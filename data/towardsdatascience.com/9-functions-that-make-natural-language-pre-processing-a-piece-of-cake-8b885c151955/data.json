It makes it possible for computers to read text, hear speech, interpret it, measure sentiment and determine which parts are important.", "It allows us as well as our machines to develop our logical, emotional and intuitive intelligence, which are particularly useful to survive and thrive in the world today.", "If you\u2019re not already a member, get your Medium Membership here!", "I run my code on Pycharm and these are the libraries that I used for the first part of the analysis. As you can see, I am keeping things nice and simple :)", "For this example, we will be using the script of the Game of Thrones show. The text files for each episode can be found here.", "The first thing I wanted to do was create a pandas dataframe with two columns, the first for the name of the character and the second for the line this character spoke.", "By adding the argument sep: \u201c:\u201d we indicate that the separation between columns will be made with every colon. With the error_bad_lines=False argument, when no colon is found the line will be deleted. This works particularly well for our non-speech lines such as [GARED grumbles], which I didn\u2019t want to keep.", "The ASCII or UNICODE encodings differentiate between lowercase and uppercase letters, it is therefore essential that all words are lower case before we begin our NLP analysis. Otherwise, we get unwanted repetitions", "I wanted to get rid of all punctuation in the line, I decided to keep things simple and used the replace() function. I found this step to be quite important when counting word repetitions and frequency. Words followed by a comma would be counted differently and this made my results very noisy and difficult to analyse.", "Make the difference between \u201cTyrion\u201d and \u201c Tyrion \u201d. This can cause many problems when trying to merge dataframes based on names, or when we generate Word Clouds they count multiple times the same word with different spacings.", "I discovered Regex recently and I am in awe. It is so powerful!", "A regular expression (Regex) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern. Usually such patterns are used by string searching algorithms for \u201cfind\u201d or \u201cfind and replace\u201d operations on strings, or for input validation. It is a technique developed in theoretical computer science and formal language theory.", "I noticed that sometimes the line with a character name would contain emotion and tone indications between brackets. Using these regex expression allowed to get rid of the brackets and everything within them. We get the result", "This deletion can be achieved with the following function and regex encoding:", "Another example of Regex application that came in handy was to delete the last name of each character in the name column.", "I wanted to look into the number of times that a character used exclamation marks to show strong emotions. I decided to use the lambda and count() functions to count the exclamation marks and create a new column with the total count.", "The exact same function can also be used to count the number of times a specific word is repeated.", "Take a look at the tree map at the end of this article to visualise the proportion of words spoken by each character in all 8 seasons of Game of Thrones.", "The difference between this function and the function in 6 is that this function looks at ALL the words and counts the number of times they have been said. The function in step 6, searches for a single specific word given at the input.", "When we run this function we get a dictionary mapping all the words spoken and the number of times they were spoken.", "To only look at the words spoken by one character I can use the following line of code to keep only his/her lines.", "Take a look at the word cloud at the end of this article to visualise the most frequently used words by each character in all 8 seasons of Game of Thrones.", "I thought it was essential to add information about handling emojis. They are used everywhere, and it is essential we know how to make the most of this new information.", "This is an extract from the code of another project of mine where I analyse a WhatsApp conversation.", "I imported the emoji library and then used the append() function to create a list of every emoji used. I then used the Counter() function to count the number of times each emoji appeared in the list. I created a dictionary with all the emojis used and their corresponding frequencies. Finally, I applied the sorted() function to enumerate and order the most and least used emojis.", "For a real life application of all these functions (especially emojis), take a look at this article: \u201cWhat WhatsApp conversations tell us about our friendships\u201d", "It looks scary, it's really not!", "First, we choose the character we want to analyse. And then I follow the exact same steps as I did for the emoji exercise. List the words, count the repetitions, create a dictionary, finally plot the word cloud! Easy-peasy.", "For color, shapes and fonts the Word Cloud documentation can be found here.", "The idea behind this plot was to visualise the proportion of words spoken my make and female main characters in the TV show.", "I format my dataframe such that the words are counted by character, and each character is assigned a gender and a color. Women are red and men are blue. I need to change each column of the dataframe such that it becomes a Pandas Series. This can then be used as input for the tree map which uses the squarify.plot() function.", "For Game of Throne fans, look at this article: 3 Quick and Easy data visualisations inspired by Game of Thrones", "For more articles like this, find me on Medium here!", "If you have any questions, suggestions or ideas on how to improve, please leave a comment below or get in touch through LinkedIn here.", "All the code can be found in got_analysis.py file on Github here.", "Your home for data science.
