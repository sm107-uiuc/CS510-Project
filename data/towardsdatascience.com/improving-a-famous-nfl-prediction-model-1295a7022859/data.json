Players are nearing the end of training camp, and fans alike are eager to watch their favorite team play on Sunday again. How we got here has been unconventional, to say the least. The offseason has been one we\u2019ve never seen before, as the same can be said of this year in general. We should all be thankful there will even be a 2020 season given how this year has played out. But never less football appears to be back, and everyone is getting ready.", "When I say everyone is getting ready I\u2019m talking about; coaches, players, fans, sports outlets, sports writers, sports betters, and Vegas. Vegas may look like the odd one out but I ensure you they have prepared for the 2020 season more than anyone else. Why is that you may ask? Well because they're in the industry of information. The more information they have, the more money you lose.", "See as the 2020 season rolls around Vegas will put odds out on hundreds of events that will happen in the current season, and every year millions of betters lay money on those odds hoping they occur. Spoiler Alert! Many of those betters will lose. Why? Because those odds don\u2019t just come out of thin air. No, they are generated by elaborate models that when inputted information will output a probability of an event that most betters will often over or under value. This is why most betters lose. They simply don\u2019t have the info that Vegas has.", "There are those that will win against Vegas and continually win against them. These betters have created their own models that compete with the ones Vegas uses, and is where our famous model comes into place.", "You're probably wondering what this quote on quote \u201cFamous Model\u201d is, well it was created by Nate Silver, the founder and editor in chief of FiveThirtyEight and his team.", "FiveThirtyEight is a website focused on politics, economics, and sports blogging. They're famous for using statistical analysis and hard numbers to tell compelling stories and create models that show or predict an outcome. Questionably their most famous is their NFL prediction model. The model has been seen to compare to those in Vegas and is the reason many professional sports betters use it. They rely on the predictions and bet accordingly to what the model says.", "The model was created in 2014 and has been continuously updated over the years to further improve the accuracy of the predictions. But in 2020 I have found ways to improve the model and increase the accuracy of the predictions even further. I will go more into detail later on but I think it\u2019s time you finally learn what this famous model is and how it works.", "If you\u2019re familiar with how players are ranked in chess then you're familiar with Elo ratings. Elo rating is a simple system that judges teams or players based on head-to-head results and is the core of the model created by FiveThirtyEight. These Elo ratings are able to forecast the outcome of every game and generate win probabilities for each team. The nuts and bolts of this system are described below.", "To begin with, the Elo model assigns every team a power rating. Those ratings are used to generate win probabilities for games based on the difference between the two team\u2019s Elo ratings. Teams increase their Elo rating by winning games and decrease by losing, but by how much depends on the expected result of the game.", "For example, let's take two teams and give them each an Elo rating. Let's say the Dallas Cowboys are versing the New York Giants. The Dallas Cowboys have an Elo rating of 1650 and the New York Giants have a rating of 1400. Since Dallas\u2019s rating is higher we know they have won more games than New York and should be favored in this game. In fact, I can tell you, the Elo model gives them a win probability of 80%.", "The reason Elo ratings are called a head-to-head system is because if Dallas were to win this game they would take points from New York, meaning their Elo rating would increase by how much New York\u2019s decreases. Determining that number depends on the expected result. Since Dallas is favored to win by a large margin, if they do win their Elo rating will only increase about 5 points. However if New York wins, their Elo rating will increase by roughly 17 points. Elo takes in the level of the opponents and rewards more to the underdogs and less to the favorites. This is to ensure teams with high Elo ratings are winning against teams of their caliber and not just against below average teams.", "On the surface the Elo system is very simple. If a team wins a game their Elo rating increases based on the expected outcome, vice versa if they were to lose said game. But football is more complicated than that. Elo ratings show the overall strength of the football team as a whole, but what it doesn\u2019t take in is the outside circumstances that affect a football game. Circumstances that include: is the team playing at home or away, are they coming off a bye week, or are there changes at starting quarterback.", "There has to be adjustments for these situations to make sure the model is as accurate as possible. Therefore, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elo model also includes several adjustments that take place before the start of each game:", "If you're wondering how specific numbers like add 55 Elo points for the Home-Field Advantage came to be, well it\u2019s because every point in a NFL game is equal to 25 Elo points in the model. As I said before, teams that play at home win by 2.2 points more on average. 2.2 x 25 =55, this is how the model finds out how much it should add for each adjustment.", "One thing about the Elo model that should be known is that it\u2019s always continuous. The Elo\u2019s for each team don\u2019t reset after each season, instead, the Elo ratings get carried over to next season. To account for offseason changes that may include draft picks, free agency, trades, and coaching changes there is a preseason adjustment for the Elo ratings.", "This adjustment uses two factors. The first is reverting a team\u2019s end of season Elo one-third of the way toward a mean of 1505. The second involves using Vegas win totals for next season.", "What forms a team\u2019s Elo rating for the start of next season is one-third weight given to regressed Elo and two-thirds weight given to Vegas-wins.", "Taking a look back at the Dallas vs New York example, Dallas\u2019s Elo rating was 1650 and New York\u2019s was 1400. The difference between the two is 250. If we divide 250/25 we get 10. What this means in the model is that it predicts Dallas to win by 10 points against New York. This is how point spreads are predicted for each game. The model takes the Elo difference and divides it by 25, because like I mentioned before, every point in an NFL game equals 25 Elo points in the model.", "Predicted point spreads are a great way to evaluate prediction accuracy by comparing it the actual score differential of each game. That\u2019s exactly how FiveThirtyEight judges the accuracy of their models. Using Mean Squared Error, the model finds the difference between the predicted point spread and actual, and squares the errors to give a larger penalty for bad misses. The lower the error the better.", "FiveThirtyEight also evaluates their models using Brier Scores. Instead of point spreads, Brier Scores use win probabilities. In our Dallas example, the model gave them a win probability of 80%. At 80% the model is very confident Dallas will win and if they do the Brier Score will be low (Lower Brier scores are better because they mean the prediction was closer to being correct). However, if New York wins with only a 20% win probability, that means our model was very wrong in predicting the outcome of this game and the Brier Score will be quite high.", "Over the years, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elo prediction model has been continuously updated with new adjustments to further improve prediction accuracy in these two metrics. In 2019 their latest version came out and it performed much better than previous versions. The graphs below show the difference between the newest version and the older versions in both accuracy metrics. This increase in accuracy can be contributed to one more adjustment in their latest model that is their biggest and maybe their most important that we haven\u2019t discussed.", "In 2019 FiveThirtyEight added an adjustment for the game\u2019s most important position. Here\u2019s how it works:", "The quarterback Elo adjustment is applied before each game by comparing the starting QB\u2019s VALUE rating with the team\u2019s VALUE rating and multiplying by 3.3.", "Example: When Drew Brees was injured midway through the 2019 season, he had a VALUE rating of 75. The New Orleans Saints team VALUE rating was 78, and backup Teddy Bridgewater had a personal rating of 45. So when adjusting the Saints Elo for their next game with Bridgewater starting instead of Brees, we would have applied an adjustment of 3.3 * (45\u201378) = -109 to New Orleans\u2019 base Elo rating of 1639 heading into its Week 4 game against the Cowboys. This effectively would have left the Saints as a 1530 Elo team with Bridgewater under center (before applying adjustments for home field, travel and rest), dropping New Orleans\u2019s win probability from 60% to 44% for the game despite playing at home. In cases like these, the QB adjustment can have a massive effect!", "Just like how a team\u2019s preseason rating is adjusted, so are individual quarterbacks. When the offseason rolls around, quarterbacks have their final VALUE rating from the end of the season reverted toward the average QB VALUE by one-fourth before the following season.", "For rookies making their starting debuts, we assign them initial ratings based on draft position. An undrafted rookie is always assigned a rating of zero for his first start. The first overall pick, by comparison, gets a VALUE rating of 35 before his first start.", "You should now have a higher quality understanding of how the FiveThirtyEight model works. It is a simple but effective model to predict the outcome of games, win probabilities, and their point spreads.", "However, the model can be improved even further, and improve it I did! I have found other adjustments that the people at FiveThirtyEight did not and ended up improving the model greatly.", "When trying to figure out how to improve FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model, I had to think about what aspects of the game did they not adjust for. As we discussed before they already have adjustments for: home field, bye weeks, playoff favorites, travel distance, and changes at starting quarterback. But diving deeper into the game of football I was able to find 3 new adjustments that heavily improved the model.", "Kirk Cousins, the quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings is the inspiration for this adjustment. Cousins is famous for playing terribly in prime time games (Monday night. Thursday night, and Sunday night games). In fact, his record in these games is 6\u201313 despite playing on an above average team.", "This got me thinking, in prime time games on national television when the whole world is watching, do teams play better or worse then when playing on a normal Sunday afternoon. Well when diving into the stats over the last 10 years this is what I found\u2026", "As you can see from the table above in Thursday and Sunday Night games, the home team has a greater chance of winning by nearly 5% more. These teams also increase their average margin of victory in these games by around 1 point on Thursday night and about 2.5 points on Sunday night, thus proving at home, teams typically play better in prime time games. Therefore, the adjustment that is added to our improved model is to add 25 Elo points to the home team on Thursday night games, and add 50 Elo points to the home team on Sunday night games.", "In each division in the NFL there are 4 teams. These teams play each other twice in the regular season. Since teams in the same division see each other more often than other teams, they get the advantage of playing them once, adjusting for them, then playing them again. This would ensue that divisional games should be much closer than non divisional games since these teams have already seen how the other plays, and they can prepare for it.", "The table below shows the difference between divisional games and non-divisional games over the last 10 years.", "As seen from the table above, in divisional games the home team has a lower chance to win than non-divisional games by nearly 3%. Their average margin of victory also decreases by a point when playing a team in their division, proving that divisional games are much closer and harder to predict then non-divisional games. To adjust for the closer divisional games, our improved model reduces the team with the higher amount of Elo points by 25 to minimize the overall difference in Elo between the two division teams.", "As I discussed before, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model is famous because it competes with the ones in Vegas. In fact when comparing their model\u2019s predicted point spreads with Vegas\u2019s predicted point spreads, in about 80% of games the difference between the two is a mere field goal (3 points or less). But the disadvantage that the Elo model has is that it\u2019s not up to date like the Vegas model.", "When Vegas rolls out their point spreads they are imputing every factor they can find; injuries, weather, last second starting change, etc. The Elo model doesn\u2019t do this. Most of its adjustments you can find the info a week before. The only up to date adjustment is the quarterback adjustment that applies when there is a quarterback change, but for every other position an adjustment does not exist.", "If in about 80% of games the difference between the two point spreads is about 3 points, then what happened with the other 20%? In my conclusion I believe there may have been an injury besides the quarterback position, or an unseen circumstance that the Elo model couldn\u2019t adjust for, that may have occurred to make the difference between the two point spreads greater than 3. This is where our 3rd adjustment takes place.", "Since our model doesn\u2019t adjust for these scenarios, I decided to get a little help from the Vegas model. Therefore, if the difference between our model\u2019s predicted point spread and Vegas\u2019s predicted point spread is greater than 3, then we adjust our predicted point spread to match Vegas\u2019s. For example, if our model predicts the Cowboys to win by 10, but Vegas predicts they win by 6, then we adjust the Elo\u2019s for the two teams so our predicted point spread is then 6.", "So like in the example above, Dallas\u2019s Elo was 1650 and New York\u2019s was 1400. The difference in Elo is 250 and 250/25 =10. Our model predicts the point spread to be 10, but we want it to match Vegas at 6. Therefore, we reduce Dallas\u2019s Elo from 1650 to 1550.", "2019 was a bit of an unpredictable NFL season. This is backed by the fact that in both of FiveThirtyEight\u2019s newest and older Elo model versions, both accuracy metrics (Brier Scores, Mean Squared Error) took a dip from its previous years. But how well did our improved model do in this unpredictable NFL season? By comparing all 3 models in both accuracy metrics, we can determine which model performed the best in the 2019 season.", "If you remember the lower the Brier Score the better, and our improved model was able to lower the Brier Score significantly. In 2019 New Elo had an average Brier Score of 0.219, and our improved model had an average of 0.196, showing in 2019 our model was able to predict the win probabilities of team\u2019s much better than both Elo versions. But it wasn\u2019t just 2019. If you look at the graph above, over the last 5 years our improved model performed better than both Elo versions every year.", "Using Brier Scores, let\u2019s take a look at how each model\u2019s accuracy evolved over time in the regular season. As you can see from the graph below in weeks 3, 4, and 9 our model did worse than the Elo versions. But for the rest, our improved model was able to outperform. This means in 14/17 weeks our improved model performed the best. This resulted in the decrease of the overall average Brier Score for the 2019 season.", "Similarly to Brier Scores, our improved model out performed both Elo versions every year in reference to Mean Squared Error. In 2019 New Elo had an average MSE of 183, while our improved model had an average of 174, showing in 2019 our model was able to predict the point spreads of games much better than both Elo versions.", "You\u2019ve already seen how our improved model has done better than the Elo versions on a season and week to week basis. In theory, the next part is to show what specific games did our improved model increase in accuracy the most.", "Down below are two charts. The first displays our improved models best picks relative to the newest Elo version, the second displays the worst.", "(OLD column refers to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s newest Elo models predicted winning percentage for the team that won. NEW column is our improved models predicted winning percentage for that same team).", "Every year FiveThirtyEight host an NFL forecast competition to see if anyone can beat their Elo models in forecasting NFL games. Yearly, thousands sign up to prove that they know more about football than FiveThirtyEight and anyone else.", "The game works by using Brier Scores. Every week of the NFL season (including playoffs) players decide which team will win by giving that team a winning percentage. After each NFL game finishes, players will either gain or lose points based on whether they picked the winning team and how confident they were that they would prevail. The higher a win probability you assign a team, the more points you can earn \u2014 but also the more you can lose if you were over confident.", "To further demonstrate that our improved model can forecast NFL games better than FiveThirtyEight, I decided to participate in their game to see how many points my improved model would have accumulated if we indeed played in the 2019 season.", "In 2019 over 15,000 players signed up to play FiveThirtyEight\u2019s NFL forecast game. At the end of the season FiveThirtyEight\u2019s model had accumulated 773.7 points, good enough to be in the 97th percentile and in 514th place. This means their model was able to predict NFL games better than 97% of those that played. In comparison, Griffin Colaizzi who came in 1st place finished with 1,126.2 points and was in the 99th percentile.", "Question is, was our improved model able to beat FiveThirtyEight\u2019s score, and did it come even close to Griffin\u2019s?", "Down below is a weekly chart of the net points our improved model gained each week in the NFL forecast game.", "In all but 2 weeks our improved model stayed in the positive for net points, and was able to finish the season with a total score of 1,414.8 points. Not only did we nearly double FiveThirtyEight\u2019s points, but we blew Griffin\u2019s total out of the water by gaining almost 300 more points than he did. This means if our improved model had competed in the forecast game during the season, not only would we have come in 1st place out of nearly 15,000 competitors, but it wouldn\u2019t even have been close.", "The reason the Elo model is so great is because most of the info needed to predict games can be found months before when the schedule for next season comes out. Since we are days away from the start of the season, and we now understand how the Elo ratings update as the schedule plays out, we have the info we need and can predict what will happen over the entire 2020 season.", "The NFL season isn\u2019t always definite, teams that should typically blow out others teams sometimes lose. This infers there\u2019s randomness in an NFL season. To integrate this randomness into our model, we use the Monte Carlo Method and simulate the 2020 NFL season 100,000 times, tracking how often each simulated universe yields a given outcome for each team.", "In the end the simulations will show a team\u2019s expected Elo points, point differential, full-season record and it\u2019s odds of winning it\u2019s division, making the playoffs, getting a first round bye, and even winning the Super Bowl.", "Find you favorite team down below, and see what our model predicts will happen for your team next season.", "FiveThirtyEight\u2019s Elo model is simple but effective. Through Elo ratings it\u2019s easy to tell the strength of any given team and predict a winner. The adjustments that come along with the model help those predictions become even more accurate by dealing with situations in and outside of the direct game.", "We were able to improve their Elo model by recreating it and adding a few adjustments of our own. But can we improve it even further? Absolutely! Football is not stagnant, it is ever changing and new patterns and play styles will emerge that will change how the game is played. This is why Vegas\u2019s models continue to be some of the best, they always change based on how the game has. By doing the same, the Elo model can compete with some of Vegas\u2019s best and may have the ability to even surpass.", "I would like to give a short paragraph to say thank you to the guys at FiveThirtyEight. They have done an excellent job in providing details on their models that allowed me to recreate them. I discussed most of what the model incorporates in this article, but if you want to read the details for yourself here\u2019s a link to their webpage: How Our NFL Predictions Work.
