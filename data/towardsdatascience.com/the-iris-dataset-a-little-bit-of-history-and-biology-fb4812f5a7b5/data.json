What most people know about the Iris dataset is that it has records on the length and width measures for sepals and petals. This dataset consists of 50 records for each of three Iris species: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor.", "Beyond that, do you know where the dataset came from? Do you know what these different species look like? If you don\u2019t know the answers, that\u2019s OK. It is exactly what the present article is talking about. Let\u2019s have a brief getaway from dealing with data and learn some interesting stories behind this common dataset.", "The Iris flower dataset is also known as the Fisher\u2019s Iris dataset. Your guess is right \u2014 this is the same Fisher, Sir Ronald Aylmer Fisher, who also invented the Fisher\u2019s exact test. As a Fellow of the Royal Society, Sir Fisher was born in 1890 in London, England, and was well-known as a statistician and geneticist.", "His contribution to statistics is way beyond the Fisher\u2019s exact test. For example, he developed the maximum likelihood estimation and the analysis of variance (more commonly known as its acronym ANOVA) test. For these important contributions, he has been highly regarded in the history of modern statistics, as noted on his Wikipedia page.", "For his work in statistics, he has been described as \u201ca genius who almost single-handedly created the foundations for modern statistical science\u201d and \u201cthe single most important figure in 20th century statistics\u201d. \u2014 Wikipedia", "In 1936, Fisher published a report titled \u201cThe Use of Multiple Measurements in Taxonomic Problems\u201d in the journal Annals of Eugenics. If you\u2019re interested, you can read the full text here. In this article, Fisher developed and evaluated a linear function to differentiate Iris species based on the morphology of their flowers. It was the first time that the sepal and petal measures of the three Iris species as mentioned above appeared publicly. A snapshot of the original data table is provided below. Please note that these measures were recorded in centimeters.", "As shown in the diagram below, overall, this discriminant function performed well in discriminating between these species, except some overlap between Iris versicolor and Iris virginica. The Iris setosa is noticeably different from the other two species.", "However, it should be noted that Fisher didn\u2019t collect these data himself. In his article, he explicitly credited the data source to Dr. Edgar Anderson, who collected the majority of the data at the Gasp\u00e9 Peninsula, a beautiful tourism place in Canada. I couldn\u2019t find a copyright-free picture for Dr. Anderson, but you can find his picture here if you\u2019re interested.", "Dr. Anderson was born in 1897 in New York and raised in Michigan, United States in the early 21st century. As a botanist, Dr. Anderson was a faculty member at the Washington University in St. Louis. In 1929, he accepted a fellowship to work in Britain with a few scientists, including Sir Fisher. Through this collaboration opportunity, Fisher obtained Dr. Anderson\u2019s permission to use the data in the article as discussed above.", "Besides collecting this famous dataset\u2019s data, Dr. Anderson made important contributions to the botanical genetics and published an original book on this field title \u201cIntrogressive Hybridization.\u201d His scientific contributions made him elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934 and a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1954.", "How many of you have actually seen Iris flowers, particularly those three species included in the dataset, in gardens or pictures? I doubt the number can be high because based on the responses from my surrounding friends and colleagues, only a small portion of them told me that they had seen Iris followers before. Certainly, I had to show them some pictures of Iris, otherwise many of them probably didn\u2019t even know what Iris flowers were.", "All this aside, we know that the three Iris species in the dataset: Iris setosa, Iris virginica, and Iris versicolor, and we also know that the dataset records the lengths and widths of sepals and petals for these flowers. Let\u2019s kill two birds with one stone \u2014 see the figure below.", "As shown in the above figure, there are indeed similarities in morphology between these species. Thus, it\u2019s interesting to note that the discriminant function developed by Sir Fisher in the 30s could solve this problem neatly from a statistical perspective. However, botanists have a better way to tell the difference between these species. In fact, Dr. Anderson himself published a manuscript titled \u201cThe Species Problems in Iris\u201d to discuss the discrimination of Iris species, and you can read the text here. In the article, Dr. Anderson noted that the morphology of the seeds of these flowers was more informative. There is a noticeable difference in the seed size between these three species, in addition to the difference in the sizes of their petals and sepals.", "Big data, artificial intelligence, machine learning, deep learning, and many other data science phrases are hot topics in almost every academic and industrial field. Many people enter these fields given the considerable job demand for data scientists in the market. Some data scientists mistakenly think that their only job is to deal with the data that are presented to them.", "What they\u2019re not truly aware of is that all of our data have their sources and content backgrounds. The processing, analysis, and interpretation of the data all require content knowledge in the pertinent domains. Thus, if we want to do better data science, we can never overlook the content knowledge underlying the data that we\u2019re dealing with.", "A quick last note about the current article. The first time that I got to know the Iris dataset was when I was learning discriminant analysis using SAS. Frankly, I didn\u2019t think about the dataset itself too much. However, while I\u2019m learning more about data science research, I find it so critical to have an in-depth understanding of the data. Thus, in hindsight, I wanted to find out the story behind the Iris dataset, and share it with you. I hope that you enjoyed some part of the current piece, and learned some stuff \u2014 at least, you should know what sepals and petals are for Iris flowers, right?", "Your home for data science.
