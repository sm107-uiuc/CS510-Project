People rent their apartment via Airbnb to make a nice stash, big signs are everywhere, enormous tent city is on the ground, and there\u2019re first tourists flood signs. You can\u2019t avoid the hip. I like the idea beyond the Eurovision; I mean, I really don\u2019t watch every \u201cnumber\u201d (even when my country makes progress to the finals), but I endorse every international act that celebrates diversity.", "As an international relations graduate though, I\u2019ve always been thinking about the voting system. Many people say it\u2019s biased, and mostly the better scores are given between countries from the same geographical block or political alliance (which sometimes it can be both). Intuitively, this statement maybe has truth in it, but I haven\u2019t yet witnessed a scoring summarize between countries to support this claim.", "Last week while I was Googling, I found this great data set in data. world, provided by datagraver.com, that details at the row-level every vote since 1975 until the last Eurovision in Lisbon, May 2018 (50K rows). For those who are interested in my data engagement steps, you may jump over to the ending section in this story. Overall, this creates a tremendous opportunity to provide a descriptive and tangible analysis.", "I choose to display the results as an interactive map I had done via Tableau; By hovering a country, you can see to which countries it likes to favor, along with the ability to control the number of viable countries in the tooltip. Since Medium doesn\u2019t support embedded Tableau visualizations, it\u2019s essential to enter the hyperlink (it would be better to enter from a computer). Let us have a look at four cases to examine the statement above.", "In Scandinavia, four out of five countries (Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and Sweden), tend to rank at least three Scandinavian countries in top six scores on average; Even the remained country, Finland, scores Sweden 2nd, and the rest of the countries in the opening ten. Taking all together, the average score inside the Scandinavian block is 4.65. Even if this aggregation sounds low, from my point of view it\u2019s impressive due to the fact it\u2019s a quintet and the analyzed period of time is over four and a half decades.", "Going east to the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania), it\u2019s seen that that geographical tendency is quite solid. Estonia, for example, ranks Latvia 1st with 8.4 points; Latvia ranks Lithuania 2nd with 5.8 points, and Lithuania ranks Latvia 1st with 9.9 points and Estonia 3rd with 5.6 points. This triangular pack maintains 6.75 score points on average. One may also claim that adding Finland is a must due to the high political and cultural orientation to the Baltics. Whether if truth sticks to it or not, the analysis endorses it with Finland ranking its neighbor Estonia 1st with 7.9 points. An additional fact that all Baltics tend not to engage with the \u201cRussian bear\u201c, giving it once the 1st rank and twice and 2nd, with a ~7.5 points on average.", "Remember the Viking achievements and were impressed? Be ready for another surprise. In the situation in the Balkans (Albania, Croatia, Greece, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Serbia, and Slovenia), things go extreme. Five out of the septuple have ranked on average a Balkan country on the 1st place, and all the seven together have a Balkan country in 2nd place. It\u2019s worth mentioning that Serbia and North Macedonia keep their allegiance faithfully since their top five scored countries are inside the block. Overall, All seven countries hold an average of 5.39 points scoring one to another. In addition, having Cyprus out of the Balkans list is correct, but the Mediterranean political alliance between Greece and Cyprus can\u2019t be ignored; Both exchange 1st place with more than 10.3 score points on average.", "Another prominent regional bloc is Russia and its Eurasian extensions (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, and Georgia). This axis\u2019s voting pattern is placing its state members at least in two spots in the top three, while in three out of the four cases Russia is ranked 1st. Computing the measure in this block reaches the highest pick in my analysis, towards 6.39 score points on average per voting inside the group. Imagine that this value would have been higher though were it not for the political rivalry between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh; This led for themselves score each other 0.1 points on average.", "Beyond these four cases, there are more hidden politics perpetuation stories. For example, the story of the native English speaking countries (Australia, Ireland, United Kingdom) has a minor scoring pattern to point of, but it might change in the future when more scores will be cumulative; more bilateral relations, such Italy-Malta and Romania-Moldova; and the same goes for French native speaking countries, German and Latin countries (Spain, Portugal) which didn\u2019t receive expression in this analysis, but we should hope it wouldn\u2019t.", "I sincerely hope, as mentioned in the preface, that the \u201cright eyes\u201d will see this post. As Netta Barzilai, the Israeli singer who won in the May 2018 contest in Lisbon, expressed her gratitude by saying \u201cthank you for accepting differences and celebrating diversity\u201d, I state this is the righteous agenda that should be endorsed, but not only at the individual level but also collectively, between nations.", "Thanks for the reading. I\u2019ll be grateful to read any remarks \u2014 Available on my Linkedin profile, or via alonrechavia@gmail.com.", "For those who are interested in initiating a project for their portfolio or just curious about my working methods, here are the engagement steps -", "Your home for data science.
