Homework is supposed to make you learn the subject you are working on. Doing other people\u2019s homework is just letting other people off the hook and they will also miss out on the learning factor, right?", "Normally you would frown and say \u201cLooks like you are just trying to get someone to do your homework\u2026\u201d, but doing other people\u2019s homework can be quite fun! If they don\u2019t want to learn, I sure do.", "Instead of getting slightly annoyed, I jumped on it and started doing some homework! All of these are found in various Facebook groups. I have kept the posts anonymous, but if you see your post and would like to be credited, drop me a line and I will add it to the article.", "Let\u2019s kick off the week with the most thorough one.", "This involves the use of Object-Oriented Programming. I wanted to sketch up the classes and see how it is all connected, but looking at the assignment, I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll need much. This was probably a task where you just had a dict and no classes. Then you need to convert it all to include classes. It is a kind of forced use of classes assignment.", "At first, I was looking for a use of a City class. You could use a city class here, but there is really no need for it. We can create a Pandemic class and store the cities in a dict there.", "This method just adds a city to the self._city_overview = {} dict. The assignment said that the data for the city should be a sequence. That would normally be a list or a tuple, but a dictionary works better here so we make a new dict for the key the user added to the main dict, like this.", "That way we have covered the task of adding a city with default values.", "This method edits existing cities in the main overview dictionary.", "Since we only accept integers, we do a check first to see if all the inputs are integers. Since input returns a string in the first place, we can use .isdigit() to check if the user typed in a valid number.", "We could use int(input(\u2018\u2019)) as well to force an int, but I dislike this approach because it will crash the program if you type a string.", "This method just displays the data we have. Since it is a dict with dicts, we need to do some looping here.", "To print the city name, which is the key, we only need to loop through the keys. We can use the key() method on the dict to get those", "For the dict in the city key, we need both the keys and the values. Here we can use the items() method", "It would look prettier if we use the tabulate library. You can see examples of those nice tables in my article about writer analysis:", "If you\u2019re feeling bold, you can go and grab a list of 4 million cities here:", "Use the csv module to populate the project.", "Just in case you ever need to grab the overview dict for anything", "Let\u2019s have a look at the main program that does all of the interaction. There\u2019s not much to it, but I will break it down.", "The first thing you do is to import your pandemic class.", "We start by creating the corona pandemic and then we set the user_choice to \u2018y\u2019 to make sure we enter the while loop where we ask for user input.", "The assignment said we needed to account for both \u2018Y\u2019 and \u2018y\u2019. By using lower(), we make sure the input is always lower case. This way, we only need to check for \u2018y\u2019 .", "If the user says \u2018y\u2019, we ask for the city. If the city is in the dictionary, we can edit the data by using our .edit_city() method.", "If the city does not exist, the assignment wanted us to add the city with default values. We use the .add_city() method for this and if the user wants to edit that new city right away, we use edit_city() on the newly created city.", "You could put the data input into the Pandemic method itself instead of running it twice in main. It might be a good idea to look into\u2026", "Let\u2019s go easier on the next one to catch our breath.", "I love when the assignment has errors in them\u2026 It happens quite often. The expected result does not return what you would expect from a program written to solve the problem.", "The assignment wants us to get a list of values in a sequence (I am guessing either a list or a comma-separated string.) Then it wants us to kill any duplicates and return the sorted list.", "There are many ways to get a list of comma-separated values. The easiest for the user is probably to write one word, hit enter, and write another one. You could create a menu that allows this until you hit \u201cq\u201d or something. For this project, I chose to have the user type it all in a sequence in one go. Because of this approach, we need to solve another. If the user types spaces anywhere, we need to kill them.", "You might also want to use lower() to make sure \u201cRed\u201d and \u201cred\u201d are treated the same.", "To solve this, we can use a variety of built-in methods. The basic thought behind this one is:", "We allow the user to type in the words so it is versatile. We also add a strip so we can account for errors when the user adds spaces.", "We strip all the spaces from the list elements using list comprehension. For the words in the split version, add strip(). This creates a new list with spaces stripped out.", "This will create a set, and as you probably know, a set can not have multiple instances of the same word. This is perfect for this assignment.", "To make sure we output the print correctly according to the assignment text, we can use .join() . This will use all the elements in the list and join them to a string. The \u2018,\u2019 tells join to join them with a comma. Guess what (sorted(clean_user_words)) does.", "As the function name suggests, the code will accept an iterable and return the second largest. In this case, we pass a list.", "It is written in a cluttered way, but let\u2019s see what we got.", "Here, the code is assigning the first number of the list to both the largest and second-largest variables. It is preparing to see if there are any larger numbers coming in when we iterate through the rest of the list.", "OK, if the next number is larger than largest, it will add what is currently largest to the variable second_largest and assign the new and larger value to largest. This way it pushes the numbers to the side.", "If the number is not larger than largest, but larger than second_largest it is time to push that out of the variable and keep largest.", "I find the above code clunky. It looks like the one who wrote it comes from a non-Python background. There is too much manual work to get to the point.", "Here is how I would write the same function:", "Alternatively, you can use .sort(), but I prefer to use sorted if I don\u2019t need to modify the list in-place.", "I have noticed a rise in Rock, Paper, Scissor on Facebook questions lately. I don\u2019t know if this is because several people are working on the same assignment, but I thought it would be a good idea to try and solve it.", "I did not want to solve it using a long list of if/else, so I started looking for a way to implement the rules and found a way to write a short and solid version.", "This is a simple way to return a long string and use it as a menu. I want to keep this in a separate function so it is easy to change and is kept separate from the game itself.", "This function uses the import module and returns that computer choice based on that random number.", "The number generates the index and uses the alternatives list to return a choice.", "This function is what allows us to not rely on a bunch of if questions.", "The dictionary holds the beat values. This means that the key \u2018rock\u2019 will beat the value \u2018scissors\u2019.", "I\u2019m using the .get() method instead of dict[key] getting the values for the key. By using .lower() we also make sure to catch Rock vs. rock.", "Jonathan Hsu has a nice article about how this works:", "We are not checking for actual errors in the typing. You should get that into the code as well as the interaction loop.", "Nothing fancy here\u2026 We get the computer choice and a player choice. Then we check them up against each other and figure out who wins.", "The only extra part here is checking if it is a tie.", "To get this game more interactive, you can try and create a loop so the player can play for as long as he/she likes.", "Well, his is quite broad and I don\u2019t have a great answer for this one. I would like to link to some good resources for Python though. Here is a random list of resources I have used and I have been recommended. Feel free to add your favorites in the comment section.", "This was a very fun exercise and I hope you learned a trick or two. I am considering creating a series called \u201cAllow me to do your homework.\u201d where I reach out to beginners. We\u2019ll see how popular this gets.", "Your home for data science.
