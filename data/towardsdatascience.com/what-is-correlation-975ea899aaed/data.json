Without them, all you have is correlation. What is correlation?", "Sure, you\u2019ve probably already heard us statisticians yelling that at you. But what is correlation? It\u2019s when the variables in a dataset look like they\u2019re moving together in some way.", "For example, \u201cwhen X is higher, Y tends to be higher\u201d (this is called positive correlation) or \u201cwhen X is higher, Y tends to be lower\u201d (this is called negative correlation).", "If you\u2019re looking for the formula for (population) correlation, your friend Wikipedia has everything you need. But if you wanted that, why didn\u2019t you go there straight away? Why are you here? Ah, you want the intuitive explanation? Cool. Here\u2019s a hill:", "When most people hear the word correlation, they tend to think of perfect linear correlation: taking a horizontal step (X) to the right on the hill above gets you the same change in altitude (Y) everywhere on the same slope. As long as you\u2019re going up from left to right (positive correlation), there are no surprise jagged/curved bits.", "Bear in mind that going up is positive only if you\u2019re hiking left-to-right, same way as you read English. If you approach hills from the right, statisticians won\u2019t know what to do with you. I suppose what statisticians are trying to tell you is never to approach a hike from the right. That will only confuse us.", "But if you hike properly, then \u201cup\u201d is \u201cpositive.\u201d", "In reality, this hill is not perfect, so the correlation magnitude between height and distance will be less than 100%. (You\u2019ll pop a +/- sign in front depending on whether we\u2019re going up or down, so correlation lives between -1 and 1. That\u2019s because its formula, pasted from Wikipedia above, divides by standard deviation, thereby removing the magnitude of each variable\u2019s dispersion. Without that denominator, you\u2019d struggle to see that the strength of the relationship is the same regardless of whether you measure height in inches or centimetres. Whenever you see scaling/normalization in statistics, it\u2019s usually there to help you compare apples and oranges that were measured in different units.)", "What does a correlation of zero look like? Are you thinking of a messy cloud with no discernible patterns inside? Something like:", "Sure, that works. You know how I know X and Y truly have nothing to do with one another? Because I created them that way. If you want to simulate a similar plot of two uncorrelated variables, try running this basic code snippet in R online:", "But there\u2019s another way. The less linear the relationship, the closer your correlation is to zero. In fact, if you look at the hill as a whole (not just one of its slopes at a time), you\u2019ll find a zero correlation even though there\u2019s a clear relationship between height and distance (duh, it\u2019s a hill).", "The presence of a linear correlation means that data move together in a somewhat linear fashion. It does not mean that X causes Y (or the other way around). They might both be moving due to something else entirely.", "Want proof of this? Imagine you and I invested in the same stock. Let\u2019s call it ZOOM, because I find it hilarious that pandemic investors intended to buy ZM (the video communications company) but accidentally bought ZOOM (the Chinese micro-cap) instead, leading to a 900% increase in the price of the wrong Zoom, while the real ZM didn\u2019t even double. *wipes away laugh-tears* Anyways \u2014 in honor of that comedy \u2014 imagine that you and I invested a small amount in ZOOM.", "Since we\u2019re both holding ZOOM, the value of your stock portfolio ($X) is correlated with my stock portfolio value ($Y). If ZOOM goes up, we both profit. That does not mean that my portfolio\u2019s value causes your portfolio\u2019s value. I cannot dump all my stock in a way that punishes you \u2014 if my portfolio value suddenly becomes zero because I sell everything to buy a pile of cupcakes, that doesn\u2019t mean that yours is now worthless.", "Many decision-makers fall flat on their faces for precisely this reason. Seeing two correlated variables, they invest resources in affecting thing 1 to try to move thing 2\u2026 and the results are not what they expect. Without an experiment, they had no business assuming that thing 1 drives thing 2 in the first place.", "The lovely term \u201cspurious correlation\u201d refers to the situation where where there\u2019s no direct causal relationship between two correlated variables. Their correlation might be due to coincidence or due to the effect of a third (usually unseen, a.k.a. \u201clatent\u201d) variable that influences both. Never take correlation at face value \u2014 in data, things often aren\u2019t what they seem.", "To summarize, if you want to talk about causes and effects, you need a (real!) experiment. Without experiments, all you have is correlation and for many decisions \u2014 the ones based on causal reasoning \u2014 that is not helpful.", "It\u2019s putting lines through stuff. Think of it as, \u201cOh, hey! These things are correlated, so let\u2019s use one to predict the other\u2026\u201d", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an entire applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Let\u2019s be friends!
