Actually, it is a good chance that you are reading this while self quarantined at your home, social distancing from public and like many, have very much of extra time to deal with. So, if you are familiar with programming, why not try this: build your own epidemic model at home. Which helps you boost your programming abilities, and, helps you understand the concepts and basic dynamics of epidemics.", "But first of all, please note that it is simply an article to show how to use Python to prepare a basic model for Covid-19 epidemic. Which on the other hand means: It Is Not a model you could use to predict what's to come. It is Not your DIY model which brings you the ability to simply ignore what official authorities recommend you to do. Neither it is a visualization tool to prove others on social media how doomed we are! If you\u2019r OK with these disclaimers now let\u2019s start our coding.", "The main concepts we assume here, is to model a finite number of individuals of a sample society interacting with each other on a daily basis and the chance of contamination which each interaction brings. For the sake of simplicity, I generated the group randomly, with proximities represents the amount of interaction each person has with it\u2019s nearest neighbors. Note that a person\u2019s neighbor may be his/her family, colleagues, classmates or anybody else who he/she is in contact with every day. I assumed that this interaction remains the same for most persons in the sample, but to make things more interesting, let\u2019s assume a fraction of group,I took 10%, which we call them Transporters, move randomly each day in the model; which means their neighbors change each day. I\u2019ve added these group to represent those shopkeepers, taxi drivers, police officers, etc. who interact with new individuals each day. I\u2019ve marked transporters with a circle and their number to keep track of each.And finally, to complete our Day Zero initialization, what we need more is a Patient Zero! which I colored red.", "After initialization, the simulations goes like this on each day:", "Coding the above mentioned algorithm would be an easy task for like all programming languages, but for visualization purposes, Python has a lot to offer using matplotlib.", "Let\u2019s see what happens if we run this simulation with a random dataset of 1000 individuals and infection chance of 25% in each interaction:", "Let\u2019s see what the statistics looked like during that simulation:", "Since the simulation takes some time, I had python to report me what is exactly going on with my society during the simulation in a log:", "And I had python to automatically do all the job to make all those charts and list and video and save it on the format I chose. But note that it may take some simulation run time if you choose big numbers for quantity and change some of the assumptions in a wrong way.", "For example, simulating 10,000 individuals took me around 24 hours until day 34 which you may see the simulation results below:", "Now that you have developed your own sample model, you may find it interesting to search for more scientific models developed by professional epidemiologists or you may see one here from Washington Post.", "Below, you may find my python code to above illustrated model in which you can change parameters easily and see what happens with different assumptions.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
