But if there\u2019s one thing in economics that you can consistently count on over the long run, it\u2019s the tendency of things to mean revert thanks to the business cycle.", "You\u2019ve probably heard of the Law of Large Numbers. It states that when we run an experiment a large number of times, the average of the results tend towards the expected value (a.k.a. the mean). In economics and finance, which deal more with time-series data, there\u2019s also a tendency, albeit weaker, for the data to revert towards its long-term mean. For example, look at the way the unemployment rate ebbs and flows across economic cycles, but regularly comes back to its mean (the orange line):", "Of course this is different from the law of large numbers where the idea is that we\u2019re repeating the same experiment over and over. In economics, things are never the same \u2014 many of the forces driving things a decade ago are often significantly different today. Thus, the magnitude and pace of mean reversion can vary over time. Additionally, the exact value of the mean is also uncertain and could potentially change over time.", "And yet, the most powerful forces that drive the business cycle are reasonably consistent, which explains why despite constant change many economic variables like unemployment still tend to reliably mean revert:", "Before we look at more variables that are impacted by the cycle, let\u2019s map out its approximate shape and driving forces:", "Each cycle is different, the industries that drive the excess are rarely the same \u2014 in the late 1990s it was Dotcom, during 2005\u20132008 it was housing and banks. But the forces at play are similar:", "A tight labor market along with strong corporate profits and investment spending drive wage growth and credit growth, which leads to lots of dollars flying around and inflation. This spurs interest rate increases (by the Federal Reserve).", "Higher interest rates hurt asset prices and make borrowing less attractive \u2014 the net effect is less spending, less economic growth, job losses, and ultimately recession (but no more inflation).", "Once inflation is under control, the Fed is able to focus on its full employment mandate, and lower interest rates and/or print money (quantitative easing) with the aim of stimulating credit growth and asset prices. Often, expansionary monetary policy is accompanied by fiscal stimulus from the government as well \u2014 lowering rates on its own is usually not enough to reverse a severe recession.", "And with many of their competitors gone and their operations leaner, surviving businesses gradually return to making money and begin hiring again.", "Earlier we saw how the cycle causes unemployment to ebb and flow \u2014 though it\u2019s probably more accurate to think of the unemployment rate as a major driver of the cycle (employment generally lags economic growth, but has a major feedback impact on most major economic variables).", "What are some other ones? The year-over-year change in industrial production (which is highly correlated to GDP) is another one. Notice how the blue line remains above the orange line when the economy is growing and pierces below it during recessions. Also observe the current low value, which hints at the shrinkage in the economy due to the ongoing pandemic. The good news is that it\u2019s already begun to mean revert, but it\u2019s still a long ways below what we would expect of a healthy and expanding economy.", "Keep in mind that despite the tendency to revert towards the mean, the data rarely stays at the mean for very long. So you shouldn\u2019t think of the mean as a level that you will frequently observe in the future.", "I added total monthly vehicle sales as well \u2014 vehicle sales are also very sensitive to the economic cycle as people tend to put off large purchases when the economy is not doing well. Notice how close the blue line is to coming back to the orange line. This means that despite the pandemic, the current pace of vehicle sales is almost back to what could be considered a normal level.", "A favorite one of mine to watch is credit spreads, which measures the extra yield that lenders demand to bear bankruptcy risk. It\u2019s the difference between the interest rate on corporate bonds (Baa is the lowest rating that\u2019s still investment grade) and the interest rate on safe bonds (U.S. Treasury bonds). I like it because it\u2019s a function of both what\u2019s been going on recently (have a lot of companies been defaulting?) and the bond market\u2019s expectations of the future (will a lot of companies start defaulting over the next few years?). It\u2019s a good gauge of the market\u2019s appetite for risk \u2014 below average yields implies that investors believe everything is great and above average yields mean that investors are panicking or close to it.", "It looks like investors were pretty panicked a few months ago but have largely calmed down since then.", "One thing we can do is look at the de-trended version of each time series \u2014 to remove the trend, we just subtract the mean (the blue line less the orange line). Let\u2019s overlay the de-trended (and Z-scored) variables on top of each other to see how they relate:", "We can see that the series do generally move together, though unemployment clearly lags the other two. As I mentioned earlier, unemployment generally lags other economic data because businesses tend to be slow to fire and slow to rehire (as they feel their way through the business cycle in real-time). The current pandemic is an exception where involuntary shutdowns forced thousands of businesses to close and millions of people into unemployment virtually overnight \u2014 so there\u2019s no lag this time around.", "If you find it hard to tell that they\u2019re correlated from the previous graph, below is the correlation matrix. Vehicle sales and industrial production are highly correlated (note that industrial production and vehicle sales have been inverted to make them directionally consistent with unemployment \u2014 so when vehicle sales appears high in the plot, it actually denotes a below average value). Unemployment appears less correlated because it moves with a lag compared to the other two variables (if we lagged the unemployment time series by a few months, we would see a much higher correlation).", "Lastly, we can take a look at how spreads, which include the investment market\u2019s expectations (which can be very inaccurate) of the future relate to the average of the three macroeconomic variables we plotted earlier (the time series are plotted as Z-scores).", "They generally move together (correlation=0.63). That\u2019s one of the dirty secrets of finance \u2014 variables that are supposed to be forward-looking because they are based on market prices (and the way markets supposedly embed and capture all the available information) are actually pretty reactive. Meaning that they move in tune (or even slightly behind) economic data, and almost never ahead of it. True shocks happen out of the blue and pretty much always blindside investors.", "One interesting thing is how differently corporate bond investors view 2008 vs. today. Despite a similar sized negative shock to the economy, credit spreads barely budged during this pandemic and have already recovered back to the rolling 10 year mean. Back in 2008, the initial shock to credit spreads was much larger and the recovery took longer.", "Macroeconomics is a very deep subject and this post only scratches the surface of the business cycle. Even though I titled it \u201cUnderstanding The Business Cycle\u201d, I doubt anyone reading this without prior knowledge and experience would come out of it with a deep understanding of the business cycle. Rather, it\u2019s more critical that you recognize that the business cycle exists \u2014 and that it\u2019s responsible for much of the ebb and flow of our economic and financial lives.", "When I think of the business cycle, it reminds me of that old saying, \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it often does rhyme\u201d. Keeping that in mind, we should not only recognize the existence of the business cycle, but also put at least some effort and thought towards preparing for the next phase of the cycle while we\u2019re still in the current one.
