It is often overlooked because of not yet surpassing human level performance. Yet, as we\u2019re going to see through this series we can make some pretty nifty tools that can help us not only gain insights but automate tasks.", "All the code mentioned is available here. You might\u2019ve to copy some of the helper functions I\u2019ve written from the github link. Mentioning it here would make everything too clustered.", "To start off, we\u2019re going to do a basic analysis of the American president\u2019s speeches right from the first president to the 2009 Obama speech. There are three libraries we\u2019re going to use here1. nltk2. pyphen \u2014 To separate words into syllables 3. matplotlib \u2014 well, for plottingAll of these can be installed using pip install.", "You\u2019ll need to download corpora. You can do that by executing the code given below", "Or you can just execute nltk.download() and download \u201cinaugral\u201d and \u201cstopwords\u201d in the corpora section after the downloader pops up, as shown in the screen capture below. You can explore other corpus too this way.", "Now we import the nltk package and speeches with the following code(This might take a few seconds depending on your computer)", "As we\u2019ve imported the inaugural speeches now, we can take a look at the data. We can see that we\u2019ve got data of 56 presidents, from Washington to Obama in 2009.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the speeches. To get the raw format of data, we can simply use inaugural.raw() . But as we can see, we can\u2019t clearly divide it into words. Fortunately, we\u2019ve got inaugural.words() to do the work for us.", "Now that we\u2019ve got our speech broken down into words, we can start doing some basic analysis on it. We start by getting a frequency distribution. This will tell us how many times does a particular word comes up. Plus it\u2019s already arranged in the decreasing order.", "We\u2019ve run into a problem, it\u2019s overwhelmed with the presence of stopwords. Often there are words and punctuation that are repeated more often than others and they don\u2019t usually give us more information about the data. nltk already has a small list of words like this, and they are called stopwords. They are available for multiple languages. We add a few more symbols to the list of stop words imported.", "So now that we\u2019ve a list of stop words, we write a small code to delete all the stop words from the speech and find out the frequency distribution again.", "That\u2019s better and gives us a few insights about the data too. But this only gives us the data about one speech, we need something that\u2019ll allow us to compare more president\u2019s speeches together.", "So we start counting how many 2,3,4 letter words president xyz used. We then take the average letter count per word of each president and plot it.", "A higher letter count per word would mean the president mostly used \u201cbig\u201d words. We first count how many x letter words were used by each president.", "While we were doing that, we also stored the average letter count per word in a variable called presidents_avg . Using matplotlib to chart it, we can see that it has clearly decreased over time/presidents.", "Going on the similar path, we start counting how many words were spoken by president xyz in one sentence. We then take the average word count per sentence for each president and plot it.", "A higher average word count per sentence would mean the president mostly used \u201cbig\u201d sentences. We also store the average word count per sentence in a variable called presidents_avg_words_per_sentence . Using matplotlib to chart it, we can see that it has clearly decreased over time/presidents.", "Now let\u2019s see if analysis of hapaxes can get us anything. In corpus linguistics, a hapax legomenon is a word that occurs only once within a context/speech. words.hapaxes() gives us all the unique words in the corpus given.", "But counting no. of unique words is not enough. We need to also divide it byt he length of the total speech. Why? Because speech length varies a lot, so a larger speech may have more unique words and we need to remove that bias. So we find the unique words in one speech and count them up, average them and plot them for each president.", "It seems to be decreasing a little, though it\u2019s not very apparent.", "For the final analysis we calculate the syllable per word used by each president in his speech, we use pyphen library for this as normally nouns like \u201cAfghasnistan\u201d have no predefined number of syllables.", "We then take the average syllable per word for each president and plot it.", "When we see the graph, we see that it has decreased over time.", "So comparatively speaking, presidents nowadays use smaller words and shorter sentences as compared to the earlier presidents. This can be due to many reasons, English language itself evolves a lot over a period of 200 years but it can also be due the advances in media. As the president\u2019s speeches started to reach the common man who\u2019d naturally prefer shorter sentences and smaller words, president\u2019s speeches started to change according to the new audience. They were less about impressing few educated men in Washington, and more about getting votes from the common man.", "Your home for data science.
