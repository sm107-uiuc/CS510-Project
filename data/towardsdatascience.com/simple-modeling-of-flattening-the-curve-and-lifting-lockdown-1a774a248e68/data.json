They may also be eager to see if they can contribute somehow to the fight against this highly infectious pathogen.", "There can be many avenues for data scientists and statistical modeling professionals to contribute to the cause. In almost all cases, they should be working closely with domain experts \u2014 virologists, healthcare professionals, epidemiologists. Without such active collaboration and teamwork, it is dangerous and meaningless to embark on a project of predictive modeling or forecasting the spread of the disease and mitigation efforts.", "As the widely popular data modeling website Five-Thirty-Eight argues, it is freaking hard to make an accurate COVID-19 model.", "However, even without venturing into actual predictive modeling, it is possible to demonstrate the efficacy of the only basic weapon that we all have against the COVID-19 virus \u2014 \u201csocial distancing\u201d \u2014 by a simple programmatic approach.", "In this article, we will show how to build such a demo in Python, following a simple yet fundamental epidemiological theory.", "This is not an attempt to build any forecasting or predictive model.

The script is in the SEIRclass.py file in my Github repo and the class needs to be imported for this demo.", "The SEIR model categorizes the entire population into four groups,", "The idea is inspired by this article which lays down the epidemiological model and the dynamical equations clearly: Social Distancing to Slow the Coronavirus.", "Here is the Github repo corresponding to the article above: https://github.com/dgoldman0/socialdistancing.", "Almost all compartmental models of infectious disease spread are dynamical in nature i.e. they are described by a set of first-order/second-order differential equations with time as an independent variable. The basic dynamical equations are as follows,", "To be noted, that the famous reproduction number R0 is the ratio of beta and gamma from this model.", "All the coefficients (alpha, beta, gamma, etc.) are assumed to be constant here. In reality, the infectiousness of the pathogen may vary over time.", "The first two equations change slightly with the introduction of fourth parameters \ud835\udf0c which represents the social mixing. The higher the \ud835\udf0c the less social distancing. It can have a value from 0 to 1.", "Here are a couple of articles showing how Python programming can be used to numerically solve such dynamical systems of equations.", "The partial class definition is shown below. A test Jupyter notebook can be found here. The model class is here. They are released under MIT license, and therefore, you are encouraged to download and play with it, enhance it by adding other useful methods, etc.", "We define various utility methods in this class,", "We start by importing the class and making an object as an instance.", "Then, we can run a dynamical simulation for some length of time \u2014 say 90 units of time. This can be thought of as 90 days or any other length of time.", "We can plot the result of this simulation simply by,", "Next, we run the simulation for various social distancing factors to examine their impact on the peak of the curves. Note that, here, a higher value means less social distancing i.e. higher social mixing/interactions.", "We observe that a higher degree of social mixing leads to a higher peak for the infected population fraction, which can potentially overwhelm the healthcare system capacity.", "Now, we examine what happens with early termination of lockdown or \u201cstay-at-home\u201d measures, which aim to reduce social mixing i.e. increase social distancing.", "We start with a certain value of the social distancing factor, let it run for a certain amount of time, and then relax the norms i.e. increase the value of the social distancing factor, and see what happens to the infected population fraction. We will observe a second peak appearing. Depending on the various social and epidemiological factors, this second peak can be higher than the first one.", "For this study, we will use two SEIR models,", "After the \u201cstay-at-home\u201d mandates end and social distancing norms are somewhat relaxed, there will inevitably be another peak of the infected cases. The question is how high that would be and whether a longer lockdown can somehow dampen that.", "With this simple model, we can observe that letting the first \u2018lockdown\u2019 run for a long time can potentially reduce the absolute value of both peaks \u2014 one during the lockdown and the one which inevitably comes after the lockdown ends.", "This is due to the impact of an enhanced \u201cherd immunity\u201d i.e. with a longer lockdown, the susceptible population gradually reduces slowly over time (without producing a sharp peak). Therefore, when the lockdown is relaxed, there is a less susceptible population for the virus to infect!", "We also note that beyond 150 days, the susceptible fraction level does not go down significantly i.e. there is no visible reduction from 150 days case to the 180 days case to the 210 days case. Therefore, if the goal is to build herd immunity, the lockdown extension may be effective only up to a certain period.", "The example of \u2018tweaking social distancing\u2019 above showed a second peak of as high as > 0.05 i.e. 5% of the population getting infected. Here, we show that letting the first lockdown running longer can potentially reduce both peaks. In fact, we see the first peak is higher in this experiment and it is only around 0.018 or 1.8%.", "Of course, this scenario depends on the initial infection rate, disease parameters, and social dynamics. This is just one possible outcome that can be highlighted by our program.", "Again, this work was done to show how a widely-used dynamical model of epidemiology can be programmed using a simple Python script.", "Once such a programmatic model is built, many popular phrases like \u2018flattening the curve\u2019, \u2018herd immunity\u2019, and \u2018spiking from an early end of lockdown\u2019 can be gauged by playing with the model parameters and simulation settings.", "The goal is to show that with only a basic dynamical model, it is possible to understand key concepts such as the \u201cflattening the curve\u201d, \u201cherd immunity\u201d, and \u201clifting the lockdown too quickly\u201d. And, you can program such a model with rudimentary Python and mathematical knowledge.", "The model is extremely simplified. There is no geospatial interaction, which is at the core of the most advanced infectious disease models employing graph-theoretic algorithms.", "The model does not feature any statistical estimation, which is at the heart of estimating the parameters (alpha, beta, gamma, etc.) for running a realistic simulation.", "So, please do not take this model as anyhow related to the actual data and predictions related to the currently unfolding situation involving COVID-19. There are many excellent resources to consult for that.", "However, even such a simplistic programmatic approach is powerful enough to create key visualizations that drive home the messages of \u2018stay-at-home\u2019 and \u2018flatten the curve\u2019.", "A great (but lengthy) piece with excellent playable JavaScript animations is here,", "Again, a test Jupyter notebook can be found here.
