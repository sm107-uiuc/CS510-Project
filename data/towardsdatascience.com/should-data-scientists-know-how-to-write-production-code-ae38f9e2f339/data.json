Without the deployment of models after agonizing months (or even years) of models development, models will always remain as models if they don\u2019t bring any benefits to customers or end users.", "All those long hours of data collection and cleaning, models building and optimization, and presentation are meant to show that your models are able to generate results and insights to reach business objectives.", "Once you\u2019ve successfully convinced stakeholders (provided your models are robust, analysis makes sense from the business perspective, and the results are able to achieve the business goals), deployment phase will not be too far away, and that is when you need to put models into production by delivering production-level code.", "To be brutally honest, your boss doesn\u2019t really care what models you used.

In these cases, you may not need to write production code given the business objectives.", "For some other companies, having production-ready code is a must to be integrated into their existing system before being deployed to end users.", "There is precisely one of the reasons why some data scientist job descriptions don\u2019t include production code skill as one of the requirements, but rather more on one of the preferable skills as they may have a team of software engineers or IT people to help productionize models.", "I\u2019d not say that I\u2019m an expert in writing production code as the learning journey is definitely not easy. But here I am, still learning everyday to improve one step at a time.", "I hope this article gave you the edge as a data scientist to understand the importance of writing production code and master this important skill yet not explicitly stated in job descriptions.", "At the end of the day, you\u2019re what you have added values and contributed to the company to reach their business goals.", "As always, if you have any questions or comments feel free to leave your feedback below or you can always reach me on LinkedIn.
