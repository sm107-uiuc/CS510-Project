At least in his sampling, he didn\u2019t see a difference in density between bean varieties, but there was a difference in bean hardness. I was curious about bean hardness because I also home roast, so I set out to collect coffee bean hardness before and after roasting.", "The change in hardness between green and roasted beans is big, but the interesting part I found was that there was a correlation between the hardness of coffee beans after roasting and the amount of weight loss due to roasting. Weight loss during roast is dominated by water loss.", "Before and after a roast, I collected 30 samples of bean hardness using a durometer. So the sampling before and after are of different beans, but with a large enough number of samples, the distribution is reliable. To make data collection more efficient, I made a video for each round of measurement and then played the video back to manually record the numbers. Typically, it took 3 to 5 minutes to record a video, and about 5 minutes to document.", "A shore durometer has a spring, and you push a pin into an object. When the durometer can\u2019t be pushed any further, the reading is the hardness. To measure bean hardness, you need a durometer type D which has a pin at a 30 degree angle and a spring force of 44 Newtons.", "One of the challenges of measuring bean hardness was that the roasted beans could easily fracture. I measured more than 30 samples to account for each bean fracturing. I also noticed for green beans, the act of measuring the hardness left an impression on the bean.", "I roasted each bean separately, and I would mix two beans to make a blend. I use a Hottop roaster, and my roast profile has a slower curve to bring them to temperature. I worked to optimize the roast profile in my first year, but once I had settled on the best, I only modify when I end a roast. Also to note, I add the beans immediately, so I don\u2019t have a charge temperature.", "For these roasts, I aimed to end the roast at 1:30 past the first crack. In the HI Mokka, it went longer because I had trouble hearing the first crack.", "These beans are the current beans I have from Burman Coffee Traders. I typically buy coffee from Sweet Maria\u2019s, but I wanted to try roasting some Hawaiian beans. In this table, I have the green hardness, roasted hardness, ratio between the two, and the roasted weight to green weight as a percentage.", "Looking at just the average hardness, all the beans experience a decrease in hardness.", "I took all the samples and sorted them for green beans and then roasted beans, and the shift is clear, but just because one variant is harder than another doesn\u2019t mean they have an equal shift in hardness due to roasting.", "When plotting the various bean distributions of green vs roasted, they have similar attributes. This also assumes the least hard green bean will be the least hard roasted bean. One of the difficulties of this study was that I was using two different sample sets. A better design of experiment would be to use a small sample roaster, measure all the beans before the roast, and all the beans post roast.", "I also plotted the Green to Roasted ratio vs the green bean hardness. The only trend from here is an equal shift, but again, the sampling is not one to one.", "Looking at overall stats, we can look at how much weight was retained after roasting. Typically, 10 to 20% of the coffee bean weight is lost by roasting. In this case, a trend appeared. I looked at the trend of the roasted bean hardness as well as the ratio of green to roasted hardness. The trend is strongest for roasted bean hardness.", "The dataset only has ten samples of average hardness for roasted beans, and I broke it down by processing just to see. More data would be interesting to better understand the relationship.", "I don\u2019t have moisture measurements for the green beans, and I\u2019m curious if there is a correlation between bean moisture and hardness. There seems to be a relationship for bean mass lost for roasted beans and hardness, and mass lost is mostly due to water loss.", "I still haven\u2019t quite dived into experiments with roasting, but I\u2019m certainly curious enough. For hardness, I\u2019m collected some data over time for the roasts I do, so hopefully I will have a better understanding of this variable. Another interesting experiment would be the dehydrate the beans and look at a bean by bean comparison of hardness vs moisture level.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
