Let\u2019s start at the end by interpreting the value of AUC and then come back and explain how to calculate it, this will give us a better context and help you understand its advantages.", "Previous post (deep dive in confusion matrix)", "AUC is calculated as an area ranging from 0 to 1, but interpretation of the AUC value is one probability. Likelihood that if we take any two observations from our predictions, they will be ordered in the correct way. That is, an AUC of. 90 (which has an area of \u200b\u200b90%) has the interpretation that if two observations are taken of any of the predicted values, their probability of being correctly ordered is AUC itself, 90%. This explains why the minimum AUC is .50, because if your model is completely random, The probability of two observations being ranked correctly is 50%, ie random. Just as the maximum AUC is 1.", "Each end of the ROC curve is formed by a chosen threshold. The example below helps us understand. Imagine that we start with the 20% cut and note the false negative rate and the false positive rate, and we move on the different thresholds to form the curve. In practice, when we ask sklearn to plot the ROC curve it does this observation by observation as follows:", "The AUC is nothing more than the area that forms below the ROC curve. But it brings very interesting interpretations.", "A good model is a model that can separate the two classes well, so the less intersection between the two classes our model has, the better it is and consequently the larger the AUC.", "A very annoying problem we had in metrics that came out of the confusion matrix such as Accuracy, Accuracy, and Sensitivity is that prevalence (ie the ratio between classes) greatly affected these metrics, but AUC doesn\u2019t suffer from that, in the gif below we have a real example. The AUC curve is in the right corner in green and we note that it does not move to any prevalence level.", "When we have two different AUC curves, we have to decide which one is best for us in each situation. In the case of the figure below, it is clear that model 3 is the best and model 1 is the worst. This decision not only comes from the value of AUC being higher, but the curve shape shows that model 3 is better for any chosen threshold. Note that at the beginning of the curve (where the easiest predictions are) the three curves are pretty much the same, and as we move toward more difficult predictions, the farther to the right the models start to differentiate.", "Now a more difficult question, what if the curves have the same area but different shapes like the picture below? Which of the two models is better? In this case curve A would be better for problems such as disease detection as it is more sensitive than curve B.", "An interesting feature is that if these two curves have the same AUC as 80 and we made an assembly of these two models, it is very likely that the final model will be superior to the two initial models as they can combine the good points of the two models and get the best of both curves.", "A trained Machine Learning model has a complete ROC curve, but in practice, we can only use a single point on the curve and choose the rates associated with that point. Next to an example comparing a model that detects skin cancer (blue curve) against multiple doctors (red dots), note that each doctor is a single point.Some doctors are more sensitive, others more accurate, but still they choose a single cut, so they are represented by points, since our models have the curve for all points.", "Your home for data science.
