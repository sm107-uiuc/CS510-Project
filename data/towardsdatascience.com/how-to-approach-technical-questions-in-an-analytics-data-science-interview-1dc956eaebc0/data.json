They often are full of anxiety and don\u2019t know where to start when trying to prepare. In this article, I\u2019ll aim to cover the most common question I get from readers with 2 real SQL examples that illustrate what interviewers are looking to test for when making hiring decisions.", "As far as preparation, you just need practice. But more specifically, the ability to write SQL syntax and any other technical languages absolutely needs to be second nature to you. That will either take years of experience or hundreds of practice problems to get your skill to industry standards. You can check out my other article on some of my favorite platforms to use for practice. I would do as many intermediate and difficult problems you have available.", "Once the technical part becomes second nature, the real work starts. The second focus of any interview is to test how someone thinks and breaks down a problem. They\u2019re testing how someone approaches a problem and comes up with a solution.", "You can focus and spend energy on learning how to best communicate and whiteboard a comprehensive approach that answers the business question and covers all edge cases with the interviewer.", "In my experience during technical interviews, their focus is to test for an understanding of what the code is doing, how you think about the various scenarios/edge cases, and the implications of the output is it pertains to the business question.", "So let\u2019s talk about what type of SQL questions you might get during an interview. The SQL question itself is rather easy when compared to the long, complex queries you\u2019d probably write on the job. On the job, you may be writing hundreds, if not thousands of lines of code across dozens of tables, to answer questions and build scalable data products. But in an interview, you are either given 1 or 2 tables and asked to create a SQL query involving a join or a self-join that comprises no more than 10 lines of code. If you\u2019re lucky, you\u2019re given SQL code and asked to debug it (hint: there are always problems with the code \u2014 obviously).", "In terms of your technical skills, so long as you know how to write JOINS and use slightly advanced functions like COALESCE, you\u2019ll be fine. What makes the interview difficult are", "With those 4 bullet points on what makes an interview difficult, let\u2019s go through a few examples to illustrate these points.", "You are given 1 table that contains user friend requests, acceptances, and their dates all on 1 table. How do you write a query such that you\u2019ll get % of friend acceptances over time?", "First off, you\u2019ll probably never been given an actual table with data populated. So it\u2019s up to you to ask the interviewer what columns the table contains and what type of data is contained within the table or tables.", "This query is easy to create (hint: use a self-join to separate the friend requests with the acceptance). Anyone that knows SQL can probably write the query that will calculate the percentage of friend acceptance over time. One SQL query that would work might look like this:", "Do you see how this query doesn\u2019t address many of the edge cases or really even answers the question? This query evaluates the percentage friend acceptance over a lifetime. But does the interviewer want me to evaluate the percentage over days, weeks, months, or years? Additionally, how do you deal with a friend acceptance that happened days later? Which timeframe do you count the acceptance? Technically, any time a friend accepts your request it should count towards the percentage. But in a business sense, what good would it be if the friend accepted the request 2 years later? You\u2019re trying to build a product that connects people together and you should strive to achieve that goal as soon as possible/", "Also, another question I would have for the interviewer when building the query is \u2014 Do you count the acceptance on the day the friend sent the request or do you count it on the day the request was accepted? Why or why not?", "All these questions and issues are incredibly important to answer the question completely. And your interviewer will be testing if you can spot and understand these gaps in your solution. There\u2019s no right or wrong answer here but you need identify that there are a multitude of ways to write the query and talk about the trade-offs between the choices.", "If you ran an AB experiment and saw a 2x increase in friend acceptance (p < 0.05) due to a new feature being launched in pilot regions, do you deploy it to production and launch it to all users in all regions?", "Most people would say yes, but in an interview, the most obvious answer is probably not the correct one. The correct one in this case is \u2014 it depends. Why does it depend and what does it depend on? The answer is that it depends on how the feature behaves and what the feature effects. Everything is a system, so if you make one change in a system, it will impact another part of the system. In this example, if the experiment is deployed the landing page of the platform, you might ask what space it\u2019s cannibalizing. Is there an impact to other features?", "Another issue may be with the algorithm itself. Is the algorithm reducing the number of friend requests? Would that lead to an increase of friend acceptance since the denominator is a small number? Why or why not?", "Obviously, as someone that does not know the intricacies of the feature and platform, it\u2019s impossible be confident with your recommendation. But you should be able to identify these issues and talk through it with the interviewer so they can understand how you think and approach vague problems.", "My main advice to you in preparing for an SQL interview is to understand why and how code is being written to solve a specific problem.", "Be prepared to communicate why you\u2019re writing specific lines of code, what logic you\u2019re adding to solve specific edge cases and scenarios, and what the output will yield. Your explanation is just as important (if not more important) than the code itself.", "Also, be sure to talk with the interviewer as you\u2019re building the solution, and keep them in the loop about your thought process as much as possible.", "SQL interviews are not only meant to test your technical skills but also your thinking skills. Zero-in on the skills that are going to be included in your interview and be sure to do as many practice questions as possible.", "Your home for data science.
