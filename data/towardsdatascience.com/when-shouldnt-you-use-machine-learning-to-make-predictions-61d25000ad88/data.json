More and more companies are using machine learning as part of their products such that an increasing number of decisions affecting us are influenced by\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Machine learning is getting better and better. More and more companies are using machine learning as part of their products such that an increasing number of decisions affecting us are influenced by an algorithm. Wondering what to watch on Netflix? The suggestions of what to watch next are served by a very powerful recommendation engine. Instinctively, we feel comfortable about decisions like this being taken by an algorithm. But consider the following scenarios:", "In the above situations, the use of algorithmic decision making / machine learning was either performed poorly or was highly inappropriate. I recently read a fantastic book called \u201cRadical Uncertainty \u2014 decision making for an unknowable future\u201d, by Mervyn King and John Kay. It got me thinking about the role of machine learning in making predictions. So, given a problem with a representative sample of data, in what situations should you be wary about using machine learning? Read on for broad high-level framework\u2026", "But before we consider this framework, it helps to consider the different ways that humans reason about the world:", "These types of reasoning correspond to the following levels of machine sophistication:", "It therefore follows the more than predictions involve abductive reasoning, the less useful machine learning will be. Almost by definition, historic data is only useful to a degree in informing responses to unique events. So how does this relate to our 2 scenarios above?", "One of the key assumptions of machine learning models is \u2018stationarity\u2019 \u2014 that is, the underlying probability distribution of what is being modelled does not change. Put simply, this means that the system cannot react to current predictions about its future state.", "Before the financial crisis, banks calculated their risk using Value at Risk models (VaR). These models started to be developed in the 1980s and have 2 key inputs \u2014 the daily returns of a particular asset and the co-variance of returns between different assets. Using these two pieces of information, a probability distribution can be constructed which details the maximum likely loss on a portfolio of assets on a single day. How these these two values calculated? Historic data of course!", "However, this historic data had been drawn from a period in which banks had not suffered crippling losses. In a similar way, pre-2007, the default on mortgages were mainly a result of individual misfortunes (e.g. loss of job) and therefore were not correlated to each other. However, when loans being made depended on rising house prices, any drop in prices could result in many defaults. Therefore assets which were believed to have a low co-variance ended up have a very high co-variance under certain circumstances. The system was only stationary under certain conditions.", "There are, of course, many scenarios in which the assumption of stationarity is valid. For example, consider a machine learning algorithm which views images of tumours and predict a likelihood that the tumour is cancerous. The tumour certainly does not react to the prediction made by the algorithm and assume a better \u2018disguise\u2019 in the future.", "This is not to say that machine learning cannot be useful in non-stationary environments \u2014 they certainty can be. However, extra care needs to be taken when interpreting the results of such models. A couple of suggested ways to protect against model failure:", "So, the first part of the framework is as follows: the less stationary the model environment, the more wary to be of machine learning.", "In the second scenario, we instinctively feel quite uncomfortable about the price of credit being different without any reference to the credit-worthiness of the individual. Taken to extremes, imagine the decision of the court case being determined entirely by the broad profile of the individual and not on the specifics of the case. The more important the decision for the individual, the more uncomfortable we feel about a decision being taken in this way.", "Part of our sense of injustice comes from not taking account of the unique circumstances of each case. Just because someone of his/her background is usually guilty, what evidence is there to suggest that he/she committed the crime? If an event is unique, we feel as though each situation needs to be considered on its merits. Indeed, as discussed earlier, the more unique an event, the less capable machine learning is of providing a reasonable prediction in any case.", "Part of our sense of injustice also arises from the consequences of the wrong decision for the individual. We are all unique, of course, but there are few campaigns against the injustice of Netflix recommendations. The cost of not being recommended a good film is, after all, quite low. However, we might feel slightly more uncomfortable about being rejected from job application by automatic algorithmic screening. Although I wasn\u2019t a typical applicant to this role, surely I was a good fit? Why was I rejected?", "The more unique an event, the more we explain the event to each other in the form of narrative. \u2018Trump won the 2016 Presidential election as a reaction against the identity politics of Hilary Clinton\u2019, for example. These explanations cannot meaningfully be described as \u2018optimal\u2019 \u2014 indeed there may be many competing explanations. Machine learning, on the other hand, explains in terms of historical correlations and therefore struggles to explain and create a narrative around an event.", "Again, this is not to say that machine learning cannot be useful for important decisions and unique events. However, the more that this is the case, we should place more and more importance on explainability and exercise good judgement about the limitations of our model.", "So, the second part of the framework is as follows: the more important a decision & unique an event, the more wary to be of machine learning.", "Below are a few machine learning examples to illustrate the framework in action.", "So, in conclusion, when you are approaching a problem with machine learning, you should be asking yourself two questions:", "Finally, if either of these situations apply, it is always worth continually asking the question posed by the authors of Radical Uncertainty \u2014 \u201cwhat is going on here\u201d. It only seems apt to end with the words of Yogi Berra \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future\u201d.", "Your home for data science.
