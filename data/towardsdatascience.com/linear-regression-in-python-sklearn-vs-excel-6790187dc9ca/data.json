As time passed Scikit-learn became one of the most famous machine learning library in Python. It offers several classifications, regression and clustering algorithms and its key strength, in my opinion, is seamless integration with Numpy, Pandas and Scipy.", "In this article, I will compare the prediction accuracy of multiple linear regression of Scikit-learn with excel. Scikit-learn offers many parameters (known as hyper-parameters of an estimator) to fine-tune the training of the model and increase the accuracy of prediction. In the excel, we do not have much to tune the regression algorithm. For a fair comparison, I will train the sklearn regression model with default parameters.", "This comparison aims to learn the prediction accuracy of the linear regression in excel and Scikit-learn. Also, I will touch briefly on the process to perform linear regression in excel.", "For the comparison, we will use historical 100,000 readings of precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and wind speed, measured several times in a day for 8 years.", "We will use the precipitation, minimum temperature and maximum temperature to predict the wind speed. Hence, wind speed is the dependent variable, and other data is the independent variable.", "We will first build and predict the wind speed with a linear regression model on excel. Then we will do the same exercise with Scikit-learn, and finally, we will compare the predicted results.", "To perform the linear regression in excel, we will open the sample data file and click the \u201cData\u201d tab in excel ribbon. In the \u201cData\u201d tab, select the Data Analysis option.", "Tip: In case you do not see the \u201cData Analysis\u201d option then, click File > Options> Add-ins. Select the \u201cAnalysis Toolpak\u201d and click the \u201cGo\u201d button as shown below", "On clicking the \u201cData Analysis\u201d option, a pop-window will open up showing different analysis tools available in the excel. We will select the Regression and then click \u201cOK\u201d.", "Another pop-up window to provide the independent and dependent values series will be shown. Excel cell reference of wind speed (dependent variable) is mentioned in the \u201cInput Y range\u201d field. In \u201cInput X Range\u201d we will provide the cell reference for independent variables i.e. precipitation, minimum temperature and maximum temperature.", "We need to select the checkbox \u201cLabel\u201d as the first row in our sample data has variable names.", "On clicking the \u201cOk\u201d button after specifying the data, excel will build a linear regression model. You can consider it like training (fit option) in Scikit-learn coding.", "Excel does the calculations and shows the information in a nice format. In our example, excel could fit the linear regression model with R Square of 0.953. Considering 100,000 records in the training dataset, excel performed the linear regression in less than 7 seconds. Along with other statistical information, it also shows the intercepts and coefficients of different independent variables.", "Based on the excel linear regression output, we can put together the below mathematical relationship.", "We will use this formula to predict the wind speed of the test data set, which excel regression model has not seen before.", "Further, we have calculated the residual of the prediction and plotted it to understand the trend of it. We can see that in nearly all cases the wind speed predicted is lower than the actual value and faster the wind speed higher is the error in the prediction.", "Let us not delve into linear regression in Scikit-learn.", "Step 1- We will import the packages which we are going to use for our analysis. Individual independent variables values are spread across different value ranges and not standard normally distributed, hence we need StandardScaler for standardization of independent variables.", "Step 2- Read the training and test data from excel file into the PandasDataframe Training_data and Test_data respectively.", "I will not focus on preliminary data quality checks like blank values, outliers, etc. and respective correction approach in this article, and assuming that there are no data series related to the discrepancy.", "Please refer \u201cHow to identify the right independent variables for Machine Learning Supervised Algorithms?\u201d for independent variable selection criteria and correlation analysis.", "Step 3- In the below code, we have declared all the columns data except \u201cWindSpeed\u201d as the independent variable and only \u201cWindSpeed\u201d as the dependent variable for training and test data. Please note that we will not use \u201cSourceData_test_dependent\u201d for linear regression but to compare the predicted value with it.", "Step 4- As the independent variable ranges are quite disparate, hence we need to scale it to avoid the unintended influence of one variable. In the code below the independent train and test variable is scaled, and saved to X-train and X_test respectively. We neither need to scale training or testing dependent variable values. In y_train, the dependent trained variable is saved without scaling.", "Step 5- Now we will feed the independent and dependent train data i.e. X_train and y_train respectively to train the linear regression model. We will perform the model fit with default parameters for the reasons mentioned at the start of the article.", "The Linear regression score on the training data is the same as we observed with excel.", "Step 6- Finally, we will predict the wind speed based on test independent value data sets.", "Based on the predicted wind speed value and residual scatter plot we can see that Sklean predictions are more close to actual values.", "On comparing the Sklearn and Excel residuals side by side, we can see that both the model deviated more from actual values as the wind speed increases but sklearn did better than excel.", "On a different note, excel did predict the wind speed similar value range like sklearn. If you an approximate linear regression model is good enough for your business case then to quickly predict the values excel comes across a very good option.", "Excel can perform linear regression prediction at the same accuracy level as sklearn is not the takeaway of this exercise. We can improve the sklearn linear regression prediction accuracy massively with fine-tuning of the parameters and it is more equipped to handle complex models. For quick and approximate prediction use cases excel is a very good alternative with acceptable accuracy.", "Your home for data science.
