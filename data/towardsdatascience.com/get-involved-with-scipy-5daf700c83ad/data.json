SciPy is a free and open-source Python library. It\u2019s used for scientific computing and technical computing. It contains modules for optimization, linear algebra, integration, interpolation, special functions, FFT, signal and image processing, ODE solvers and other tasks common in science and engineering.", "SciPy uses NumPy arrays as the basic data structure. It has modules for various commonly used tasks in scientific programming. These tasks include integration (calculus), ordinary differential equation solving, and signal processing. SciPy builds on the NumPy array object. It\u2019s part of the NumPy stack. The stack includes tools like Matplotlib, Pandas, and SymPy, and an expanding set of scientific computing libraries.", "While I\u2019m over at NumPy working on creating a section in the technical documentation aimed at beginners, Maja Gw\u00f3zdz is hard at work in the SciPy docs. She\u2019s combing through the SciPy documentation to create something that\u2019s even more helpful for you. She\u2019s reaching out the whole community (that\u2019s you!) to find out what you like and don\u2019t like, and she would love your input!", "As Maja wrote in her proposal for Google Season of Docs:", "\u201cI intend to work on the refactoring of the existing documentation so that it would be easily accessible by users with different needs. It goes without saying that a researcher is most likely interested in advanced and subtle features, whereas a user without prior expertise appreciates step-by-step guides and diagrams.", "I am interested in pursuing this project for personal and professional reasons: first of all, I would like to contribute significantly to SciPy because my own research has greatly benefited from it and secondly, I encounter insufficient (or lacking) documentation all too often in other software and always wonder how much faster (if it all!) users could learn how to use the code had they been provided with a thorough guide.\u201d", "Maja put together a survey for everyone in the community who wants to be heard. This is an amazing opportunity to raise your hand and get involved! You can find the survey here, and it\u2019s designed to let you give as much of your time and input as you feel like giving.", "The questions are very straightforward and most of them have simple multiple-choice answers. You\u2019ll answer questions like, \u201cWhat parts of the documentation do you use?\u201d and \u201cWhich of the documentation features should be improved/added?\u201d Below the multiple-choice questions, you can add your own comments and suggestions.", "It\u2019s quick, it\u2019s easy, and it\u2019s incredibly helpful.
