We will go from installing Python through to setting up Pandas, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and more \u2014 and even adding a separate Machine Learning environment in Jupyter Lab (above).", "Check out the video version of this article here:", "We have a plethora of options for how we install Python. However, for keeping things simple while maintaining a fine level of control, we cannot beat the Anaconda distribution.", "Anaconda gives us an easily managed environment that includes tools such as Spyder and Jupyter. You can download it here.", "Anaconda's installation steps may vary between each OS, but once installed, the remaining steps should be essentially the same (this is true for Windows and Linux \u2014 I haven\u2019t done it on Mac).", "Check this guide for help with installation on Linux.", "Once installed, we should be able to open up Anaconda Prompt. Type python -V to get your current Python version and make sure everything is set up correctly.", "Anaconda allows us to create different instances of Python called environments. After installing Anaconda, we have a single core environment called base.", "We see this environment name whenever we open Anaconda prompt.", "Nothing is stopping us from installing new Python packages (such as Pandas/TensorFlow) within the base environment. However, it is recommended to instead use different virtual environments either for different projects or use-cases.", "Our use case is machine learning, and so we will create a new environment for this using the command conda create -n <env-name> python=<python-version> anaconda, like so:", "A list of packages will be displayed, and conda will ask if we want to proceed \u2014 we type y + [ENTER] to continue.", "After everything has been installed, we will be able to switch to our new environment by typing conda activate <env-name>:", "We should see that (base) has been replaced with (mlenv) \u2014 this means we are now working from inside our new virtual environment. So we can get started with installing all of the packages we need for ML.", "For most packages, it makes sense to attempt a conda install <package-name> \u2014 if this doesn\u2019t work, try pip install <package-name>.", "A few essentials that we almost always need are Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. We can install them all using conda install:", "Depending on what you are working on/with, you will probably need some of the most popular packages for ML too. We will install TensorFlow, Transformers, and PyTorch.", "We can install TensorFlow easily with conda install tensorflow:", "Conda does not recognize the most recent versions of the Transformers library, so we instead install that with pip install transformers:", "And finally, we have PyTorch. PyTorch is a slightly more complex installation \u2014 but made easy by accessing the PyTorch installation guide here.", "We will need to specify our OS, package manager (Conda), language (Python), and whether we have CUDA or not.", "If you have an Nvidia GPU, CUDA lets you use it to speed-up any machine learning tasks (PyTorch/TensorFlow). You can read TensorFlow\u2019s GPU setup guide and Nvidia\u2019s CUDA installation guide for help with installation.", "If you have an Nvidia GPU, I would recommend using CUDA 10.2 \u2014 unless you are using the latest RTX 30 series.", "Support for these is sketchy (at the time of writing), and you will need CUDA 11.0, alongside the nightly builds of PyTorch/TensorFlow, etc. Reach out on Twitter if you\u2019re having issues with this.", "If you do not have a GPU or don\u2019t care for CUDA, select None on the PyTorch page.", "Finally, we will be given the code we need to run within the Run this Command box, take that and run it in Anaconda prompt to install:", "That is it for our ML packages. We now need to finish integrating our new environment with Jupyter.", "We\u2019re almost there. All we need to do now is add our new ML environment to Jupyter. Fortunately, it\u2019s super easy.", "All we need to do is add a Jupyter ipykernel to our environment, like so:", "Now, all we need to do is switch back to our (base) environment, which will remain as the default whenever we open Anaconda Prompt.

Clicking on this will initialize a notebook using our new ML environment with all of the tools we need for ML ready to go!", "That\u2019s all you need to start working with your very own machine learning environment in Python!", "Whenever you find a new package or you need to make changes to an existing package in the environment, we can simply open Anaconda Prompt and type conda activate mlenv to begin making changes.", "I hope you enjoyed this article!
