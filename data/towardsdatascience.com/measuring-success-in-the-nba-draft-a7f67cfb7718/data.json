Luring superstars in free agency is difficult apart from a few marquee franchises, and such high-caliber players rarely come up for trade (and when they do, they usually carry a huge price-tag). For many teams, drafting is the only real possibility to bring in a superstar.", "However, our evaluation of drafting is also flawed and largely anecdotal. In this article, I will attempt to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of every team and executive over the past ten years. If you want the full results and rankings, then skip down to the Results section of the article. However, if you just want the cliff-notes version then it looks as follows:", "First, I must acknowledge the original post that inspired this analysis. While this approach was very interesting, I chose to significantly alter the methodology.", "During this analysis, I will cover ten years of the NBA draft, spanning from the 2018 draft (I chose to forgo 2019, since these players have been in the league less than a year) to the 2009 draft. To measure the success of each player, I chose the Win Shares metric. While any metric is imperfect, Win Shares attempts to capture a player\u2019s impact in one number, and also measures both offensive and defense.", "The guiding principle of this analysis is that a GM can only draft players that were available at that draft position\u00a0in\u00a0that\u00a0year. In other words, how well has each GM performed measured given the other options available to them?", "For example, a team may draft a player first overall that disappoints against the high expectations of a typical first overall pick. However, it doesn\u2019t really matter how well first overall picks in previous years performed \u2014 what\u2019s more relevant is whether that team passed over better players.", "Some people will argue that positional concerns deserve consideration (that guards be compared against guards, for example). I do not believe they do for the most part; today, NBA rosters are so fluid that teams seldom draft for positional needs. Most teams draft almost solely what they believe to be the best talent available.", "With this in mind, this methodology will weight the success of each player drafted against the players drafted after them. This is because the players taken directly after were most likely to be considered as alternative draft options at this position. The further away a player was drafted, the less weight they are given, since it is less likely they would have been seriously considered.", "To assign weights, I have decided to use a basic exponential function:", "In this equation, E represents the expected win shares at draft position \ud835\udcb9. K is the smoothing factor\u200a\u2014\u200aa value between 0 and 1. A higher K puts greater weight on draft positions that are closer. W represents the actual win shares from the player at draft position \ud835\udcb9 + 1 (the player drafted directly after this player).", "A K-value of 1 would assign the entire weight to the player drafted next. To begin this, I will assign a K value of 0.5. Under this smoothing factor, the weights assigned work out as follows:", "To form the expected Win Shares for a draft position, the player drafted directly after will be weighted at 50%, the player drafted two spots later will be weighted at 25%, and so on. The players drafted 7 spots later on to the bottom of the draft contribute just 1.56%.", "To initialize the exponential function, I assign an expected value of zero to the last draft position (#60). While this choice is somewhat arbitrary, I believe it is quite easily justified. Late second round picks generally have very low expectations. Since the league expanded to 60 teams in 2005, there have been 15 players drafted 60th. Seven of them never played in the NBA, while three more played a handful of games, earning Win Shares of 0.0 or below (since it is actually possible for a player to have negative Win Shares). Of the remaining five, four of them earned between 0 and 2.4 Win Shares (with Isaiah Thomas being a massive outlier). Zero Win Shares seems to approximately represent the performance of most 60th overall selections.", "Together, the expected win shares of a draft position form a counterfactual scenario that we can compare actual performance against.", "Then if the actual performance exceeded the expected performance (a positive Net Rating), then the draft pick was a good one. If the Net Rating is negative, then the draft pick was a poor one (as better players were immediately available).", "From here, the Net Rating of each player will be divided by the standard deviation of ratings from that draft year to produce a final score. This last step is done to prevent older draft selections from receiving higher scores (since they had more time to earn Win Shares).", "Score = Net Rating / SD", "All data is pulled directly from Basketball Reference. Some minor changes were made; for example, when the team that technically drafted them immediately traded them away. For this analysis, players were counted as being drafted by the team they were a part of by the end of draft night.", "The methodology does include one value that is somewhat arbitrary: the K value (smoothing factor). As stated earlier, a higher K puts greater weight on closer draft picks and vice versa. Therefore, I perform a sensitivity analysis to see how different K-values might impact results. While the methodology originally uses a value of 0.5, I also test K at 0.4 and 0.6. I then take the maximum and minimum value for each team from these three results to determine the difference between them. If the difference is small, this indicates that their score is relatively unaffected by changing K. If the difference is large, then gives us more reason for uncertainty.", "Green indicates scores that are least affected by changing K; these are the scores we are most confident about. Teams such as Indiana, Portland, Washington, New Orleans, among others change very little. Red indicates scores that are highly sensitive to a changing K. These are the scores with the most uncertainty.", "In most of the cases of teams with a high difference, their scores improves with a lower K. This likely indicates they made 1\u20132 selection where the player taken directly after performed extremely well. The exception is Boston \u2014 their score improves at a higher K. This likely indicates that Boston benefits from under-performing players being chosen right after them.", "The average difference is about 0.7. Meanwhile, the median difference separating teams in the rankings below is about 0.65 \u2014 meaning changing the K value would likely mean most teams move up or down 1\u20132 spots at most (or potentially don\u2019t change at all).", "While there are a few teams with some uncertainty, the results appear robust for the most part.", "One concern with the methodology is that it likely isn\u2019t very accurate for second round draft picks. Executives usually find a good deal of agreement in top draft picks (typically, no more than a few players are considered to be potential first overall picks for example).", "Second round draft picks are less certain. It isn\u2019t uncommon for one analyst to have a player being taken at 40th overall while another believes they go will go undrafted. In an alternative analysis, it would likely be ideal to use a lower K at later draft positions (particularly in the second round).", "In total, this analysis looked at 600 draft selections.", "According to this analysis, Karl-Anthony Towns was the best selection, despite being a first overall pick. This is largest because the two players drafted behind him (D\u2019Angelo Russell & Jahlil Okafor) have performed relatively poorly according to Win Shares.", "The first four selections are as expected; high lottery picks who produced little to no value in the NBA. According to this analysis, the worst selection was Thomas Robinson. Robinson is hurt by the fact that Rookie of the Year and 5x All-Star Damian Lillard was drafted directly after him.", "The one aberration is Melvin Frazier, who was selected 35th overall in 2018. While Frazier has played very poorly in the NBA (-0.1 Win Shares), this isn\u2019t uncommon for second round draft picks. Frazier is hurt by the fact that Mitchell Robinson was drafted directly after him. It\u2019s likely that under a lower K value this selection wouldn\u2019t look as bad. It\u2019s also very possible that the relatively small sample size of the 2018 draft is giving some unusual results that won\u2019t hold with time.", "Broken down by teams, the results are as follows:", "The Denver Nuggets have been the most efficient drafting team, with the Toronto Raptors close behind. Meanwhile, the Memphis Grizzlies have been the worst drafting team by a relatively large margin.", "Among all executives (active and inactive), the best was Tim Connelly (from Denver). Two executives stood out as far worse than the rest: Jeff Bower of the Detroit Pistons, and Chris Wallace with the Memphis Grizzlies.", "Among only currently active executives that were analyzed, the rankings are as follows:", "Your home for data science.
