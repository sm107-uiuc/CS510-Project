Support-vector machines are supervised learning models that analyze data for classification. The sample points of the separate categories are divided by a clear gap that is as wide as possible.", "As the picture above shows, the gap is the yellow region defined by the two points with black circles. The border is drawn in the middle of the yellow region. When new sample points come in, they will be predicted to be in the category of the side they fall on.", "If data are linear separable like above, we will have no trouble separating the two classes with a linear classifier. But what if our data is non-linear separable like this:", "As we can see, even though the data points from different classes are separable, we can not simply draw a straight line like what we did above", "So how can we use a support vector machine to fit the non-linear dataset? This article will walk you through how to do so. After this article, you should be able to understand the roles of the kernel, gamma, and C and how to manipulate them to fit your dataset.", "You should see something like this.", "We also need a plotting function called plot_decision_region like this. Since the target of this article is to understand SVM, feel free to copy and paste the code below if you want to play with the dataset and follow along with this article.", "Before twisting our algorithm, let\u2019s try the standard linear SVM first", "C is the cost associated with the wrong classification. The higher the value of C, the stricter the algorithm is to correctly separate the dataset. We usekernel='linear' for linear classifier.", "As we can see, even though we set the cost to be really high, the line does not do a good job of separating red and blue points. Some blues points and red points are on the wrong sides.", "Up to now, we have worked with the linear classifier in the form", "As we can see, g(x) is a linear function. When g(x) >0, the prediction is 1. When g(x) <1, the prediction is -1. But since we cannot use the linear function to work with non-linear data like above, we need to twist the linear function to another function.", "You don\u2019t need to understand how we got to this function g(x) like above. Just pay attention that:", "This classifier seems like a good candidate for our non-linear data. Let\u2019s check it out", "gamma is 1/sigma. Remember that sigma is a regulation function. Thus, the smaller the gamma is, the bigger the sigma is, and the less sensitive the classifier is to the distance between individual points.", "Let\u2019s try to make gamma bigger to see what happens", "Awesome! Seem like making the gamma 100 times bigger increases the accuracy of our classifier to the training set. How about we multiple this gamma by 10?", "Looks like the classifier takes effort to make the accuracy of the training set closer to zero. So does that mean that if we increase gamma to 10000, it will be even more accurate? Not quite. If the gamma is too big, the classifier ends up being insensitive to the difference", "Let\u2019s increase C instead. Remember what C does? C is the cost associated with the wrong classification of the entire dataset. In another word, increasing C will increase the sensitivity to the entire dataset, not just individual data points.", "Let\u2019s use a drop-down bar to quickly observe the difference between the increase in the value of C", "Awesome! We have found the parameters so our SVM classifier that successfully separates the two groups of points.", "I hope this article gives you an intuition of what the SVM classifier is and how to use it to learn a non-linear dataset. Of course, you cannot always judge the performance of your classifier based on the visualization like above if your data is high-dimensional. A good practice is to train the dataset based on the training set and use the metrics like confusion matrix or f1-score on your test set.", "You can play with the codes provided in this notebook to build a better intuition of SVM.", "I like to write about basic data science concepts and play with different algorithms and data science tools. You could connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter.", "Star this repo if you want to check out the codes for all of the articles I have written.
