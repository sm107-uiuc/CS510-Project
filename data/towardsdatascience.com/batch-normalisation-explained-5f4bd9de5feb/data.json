A simple, clear and in-depth guide to\u2026 | by Robin Vinod | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Batch Normalisation Explained", "description": "A simple, in-depth explanation of how batch normalisation works, and the issues it addresses."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167", "anchor_text": "Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift", "paragraph_index": 22}, {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-vinod/", "anchor_text": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/robin-vinod/", "paragraph_index": 24}], "all_paragraphs": ["In this article, I take a detailed look at Batch Normalisation and how it works. Batch Normalisation was introduced in 2015 by Loffe and Szegedy and quickly became a standard feature implemented in almost every deep network.", "The key issue that batch normalisation tackles is internal covariate shift. Internal covariate shift occurs due to the very nature of neural networks. At every epoch of training, weights are updated and different data is being processed, which means that the inputs to a neuron is slightly different every time. As these changes get passed on to the next neuron, it creates a situation where the input distribution of every neuron is different at every epoch.", "Normally, this is not a big deal, but in deep networks, these small changes in input distribution add up fast and amplify greatly deeper into the network. Ultimately, the input distribution received by the deepest neurons changes greatly between every epoch.", "As a result, these neurons need to continuously adapt to the changing input distribution, meaning that their learning capabilities are severely bottlenecked. This constantly changing input distribution is called internal covariate shift.", "Another issue that batch normalisation tackles is vanishing or exploding gradients. Before Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs), saturated activation functions were used. A saturated function is one that has a \u201cflattened\u201d curve towards to the left and right bounds, such as the sigmoid function.", "In the sigmoid function, the gradient tends towards 0 as the value of x tends towards \u00b1\u221e. As a neural network is trained, the weights can be pushed towards the saturated ends of the sigmoid curve. As such, the gradient gets smaller and smaller and approaches 0.", "These small gradients get even smaller when multiplied together deeper into the network. When using backpropagation, the gradient gets exponentially closer to 0. This \u201cvanishing\u201d gradient severely limits the depth of networks.", "Although this vanishing gradient can be easily managed by using a non-saturated activation function such as ReLU, batch normalisation still has a place as it prevents the weights from being pushed to those saturated regions in the first place, by ensuring no value has gone too high or low.", "Batch normalisation normalises a layer input by subtracting the mini-batch mean and dividing it by the mini-batch standard deviation. Mini-batch refers to one batch of data supplied for any given epoch, a subset of the whole training data.", "The normalisation ensures that the inputs have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, meaning that the input distribution to every neuron will be the same, thereby fixing the problem of internal covariate shift and providing regularisation.", "However, the representational power of the network has been severely compromised. If each layer is normalised, the weight changes made by the previous layer and noise between data is partially lost, as some non-linear relationships are lost during normalisation. This can lead to suboptimal weights being passed on.", "To fix this, batch normalisation adds two trainable parameters, gamma \u03b3 and beta \u03b2, which can scale and shift the normalised value.", "Stochastic gradient descent can tune \u03b3 and \u03b2 during standard backpropagation to find the optimal distribution such that the noise between data and sparseness of the weight changes are accounted for. Essentially, these parameters scale and shift the normalised input distribution to suit the peculiarities of the given dataset.", "For example, given that an un-normalised input distribution is best for a given dataset, \u03b3 and \u03b2 will converge to \u221aVar[x] and E[x], such that the original un-normalised x vector is obtained. Hence, batch normalisation ensures that the normalisation is always optimal for the given dataset.", "Ideally, the normalisation should be with respect to the entire training data set, as this ensures there will be no change in input distribution between different batches. However, since any dataset not in the current batch is outside the scope of backpropagation, stochastic gradient descent would not work, since the statistics used in the normalisation comes from outside the scope.", "Hence, the normalisation is done with respect to a mini-batch to ensure that standard backpropagation can be done. The only implication is that each batch should be somewhat representative of the distributions of the entire training set, which is a safe assumption if your batch size is not too small.", "During training, the mean and standard deviation are calculated using samples in the mini-batch. However, in testing, it does not make sense to calculate new values. Hence, batch normalisation uses a running mean and running variance that is calculated during training. There is a need to introduce a new parameter, momentum or decay.", "Momentum is the importance given to the last seen mini-batch, a.k.a \u201clag\u201d. If the momentum is set to 0, the running mean and variance come from the last seen mini-batch. However, this may be biased and not the desirable one for testing. Conversely, if momentum is set to 1, it uses the running mean and variance from the first mini-batch. Essentially, momentum controls how much each new mini-batch contributes to the running averages.", "Ideally, the momentum should be set close to 1 (>0.9) to ensure slow learning of the running mean and variance such that the noise in a mini-batch is ignored.", "Typically, larger learning rates can cause vanishing/exploding gradients. However, since batch normalisation takes care of that, larger learning rates can be used without worry.", "Batch normalisation has a regularising effect since it adds noise to the inputs of every layer. This discourages overfitting since the model no longer produces deterministic values for a given training example alone.", "The power of Batch Normalisation has been repeatedly shown in many areas of Machine Learning. It is a simple drop in solution that will yield a significant improvement in performance for almost any model.", "[1] Batch Normalization: Accelerating Deep Network Training by Reducing Internal Covariate Shift", "Your home for data science.
