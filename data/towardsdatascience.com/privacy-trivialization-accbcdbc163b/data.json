In previous weeks, I\u2019ve discussed ethical data usage with regards to medical data and the GDPR. In all of these articles, a common theme is that there is always someone that argues that maintaining our right to privacy is going to hinder progress, in the case of medical data, or detract from the collective experience of the internet, in the case of people claiming that the GDPR is leading to the balkanization of the internet.", "What these voices are doing is trivializing privacy. They are claiming that privacy is a trivial issue, at least in comparison to the other issues at stake, such as advances in medical science or any data-based research. By framing privacy in this way, the idea is that one will start to put less value on their privacy and be more complacent with regards to giving it up. This, in turn, means that those building tech will spend less time focusing on maintaining user privacy and protecting user data, because it\u2019s not like anyone\u2019s going to care if they do. Consumers aren\u2019t valuing data security because they\u2019ve been told not to, or that it\u2019s unrealistic to expect it, and this means that the people making the products for consumers have no incentive to value it either, even though these are exactly the people that should care about user security even if the users do not.", "This has been happening for years, and the impact of this is noticeable. There have been plenty of data breaches, and even more cases of users not realizing which parts of their data are fully accessible to the public (again, there\u2019s probably a reason those COVID-19 mapmakers did not share where they got their user data). One of the most recent, and glaring examples of privacy trivialization and its consequences is Zoom.", "At this stage of quarantine, I think the majority of people have used Zoom for some kind of video call at least once. If people aren\u2019t using it to talk to their friends, they\u2019re using it to conduct classes, hold business meetings, or even defend dissertations. And since we\u2019re all stuck at home, it\u2019s being used a lot more, which means its glaring privacy issues have taken center stage. One big phenomenon which has happened is zoombombing, where someone will break into a zoom meeting and do things including yell racial slurs or expose themselves to those in the meeting (which in this case was a bunch of students). The lack of security doesn\u2019t stop with zoombombing either. As noted in this NPR article:", "\u201cThings you just would like to have in a chat and video application \u2014 strong encryption, strong privacy controls, strong security \u2014 just seem to be completely missing,\u201d said Patrick Wardle, a security researcher who previously worked at the National Security Agency.", "He and other researchers have turned up flaws in Zoom\u2019s software that could let hackers spy through a computer\u2019s webcam or microphone. Zoom says it released fixes for these issues on Wednesday.", "The issues with Zoom have gotten so bad that the FBI has issued a warning about Zoom and educators in the NYC school system have been told to not use Zoom anymore. In response to these issues and, probably more, in response to the public outrage about these issues, the CEO of Zoom wrote this message apologizing and delineating the steps he and his company plan to take to address user privacy concerns. One line that I think is very telling about the evolution of the app, and the culture the app was created in is:", "First, some background: our platform was built primarily for enterprise customers \u2014 large institutions with full IT support.", "To me, this sounds an awful lot like \u201cthe users were supposed to care about and ensure app security (through having a dedicated IT department), so we the creators wouldn\u2019t have to worry about providing it.\u201d This, the way I see it, is confirmed in this quote from Patrick Wardle, the former NSA agent quoted in the NPR article linked above:", "This product was designed to prioritize things other than privacy and security", "We see this trivialization again when Zoom claimed to offer end-to-end encryption for meetings, when in fact it did not. As Oded Gal writes in this blog post:", "While we never intended to deceive any of our customers, we recognize that there is a discrepancy between the commonly accepted definition of end-to-end encryption and how we were using it", "So while someone never \u201cintended\u201d to deceive, they used a common phrase to describe a feature that they did not actually have, you know, like a lie. Oh, sorry, a \u201cdiscrepancy.\u201d", "In the conclusion of the article I wrote last week I said:", "Our fear of death has already been manipulated to compromise our privacy rights, and now that our fear is heightened, the manipulation is only increasing. This is why we need to be even more critical of the requests of these private companies and of the steps they do or do not take to protect our own rights because it\u2019s clear they have no intention of protecting our rights without being forced to do so.", "The point I want to focus on here is that companies will only act with our best interests at heart if we force them to do so. Zoom is only now focusing on security because everyone is up in arms about it. They could have focused on it before, but instead, we have a now (thankfully) defunct attention tracker and the capability to change the background. Companies do not care about people, they care about customers. That\u2019s just the way it is. They\u2019re a business in a capitalist society. No matter how many times they talk about making the world a better place, all they will ever care about is their bottom line. Therefore, the only way to incentivize them to care about you is to do something that impacts that bottom line. In this case, raising a stink about security issues has clearly cost Zoom business, so now they\u2019re fixing it. The fact is, Zoom is just the product of a much bigger tech culture that trivializes privacy and only cares about attracting customers through cool shiny features (like changing the background). Again, since this is all a greater symptom of using products created in a capitalist society, there\u2019s no easy fix, so what I will say is this:", "Never assume that a company cares about your interests unless you have given them a reason to.", "Your home for data science.
