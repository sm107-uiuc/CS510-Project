When working on a graph project with many team members, having our graph in code makes it easier to collaborate. In addition, in a collaborative space, if someone accidentally drops all or part of the data, your schema and queries are all saved and reusable. Overall, by programmatically creating graphs, Giraffle can help ease collaboration with graphs in TigerGraph.", "In this blog, we will cover:", "By the end of this blog, you will know enough to create your own project with Giraffle! If you ever get stuck or confused, the GitHub is linked at the very end of the blog for you to refer to.", "Also, Jon Herke created a blog to help get started with Giraffle, and Ramki Pitchala wrote a blog on migrating to Giraffle. I\u2019d definitely recommend you check those blogs out as well!", "First, we\u2019ll need to get a solution running on TigerGraph. You\u2019ll need to go to TigerGraph Cloud. Create an account if you have not already. On the side, go to solutions.", "Next, click Create Solution in the upper right corner.", "Click on Blank for the first section.", "Don\u2019t change anything in the second section and just click Next.", "In the third section, you can name it, tag it, add a password, make a subdomain, and add a description. Of these, make sure you remember your password and subdomain.", "Note that every subdomain must be unique. Therefore, you may or may not get the subdomain blog.", "Click Next, then Submit. You\u2019ll next need to wait for it, as it may take a few minutes to load. Once it is loaded, start your solution by pressing the Solution Operations (the blue box) and Start. It may take a while to load", "Congrats! You\u2019ve now got your solution running!", "To start, make sure you have installed gradle on your computer. You can check whether you have gradle by using the command gradle. Afterwards, type in the following command:", "From the next two options, type in 1 and 2. You can name the project whatever you\u2019d like.", "You\u2019ll see that you will gain a few folders in your directory.", "From here, go to build.gradle.kts. Update it to this:", "Notice the 1.3.4.1, as that is the latest version! Your code may or may not build without the correct version.", "If gradle build runs successfully, you\u2019re good! Next, in your terminal, remembering the subdomain from step one, type in:", "Follow the steps, filling in the subdomain, etc.", "Next, we\u2019ll need to create a certificate. To generate one, use the following command:", "In my case, it would be:", "If all runs without errors, you\u2019ve finished setting up your repository. Now you should be able to start developing!", "You\u2019re first going to need to create a schema. A schema is like a map, showing what the graph will have. In db_scripts/schema, create schema.gsql.", "In that file, I\u2019ll create a very basic schema here:", "We have two vertices called Blog and Person, and they\u2019re connected with an edge called \u201cBLOG_CREATOR\u201d.", "Let\u2019s break up the code. This document provides tasks for you to run. For example:", "For createSchema, you can change the script path if you named your schema file any differently. Then it has a description and a group. It should compile, but, to double check, you can run gradle tasks.", "Next, we\u2019ll update our gradle-local.properties. Update the file to this (filling in your details):", "(Note: if you were following along exactly, the default for the username/password is tigergraph. If you custom set a username or password, then change it to be your username and password. Insert the subdomain from step one into gHost. The gGraphName is the name you want your graph to be.)", "Next, we\u2019re going to upload our schema to the cloud. To do this, go to https://tgcloud.io/app/solutions. Click Applications (the blue button with four shapes), then click GraphStudio.", "Now, back in your terminal, we\u2019re going to use the createSchema command we added. Type in:", "If it works, your output should like above. Finally, if you go to your GraphStudio and tab to Design Schema, you should be able to see your schema.", "Congratulations! You\u2019ve just created and loaded your schema!", "Next, we\u2019ll load actual data into the graph. I\u2019m going to create a CSV full of author names and blogs.", "Create a folder in the main directory called data (it should be at the same level as db_scripts, but not in it.

In the file, add the following code:", "For this, we\u2019re creating a loading job called loadData. If you want to create more loading jobs, add others files to db_scripts/load and replace loadData with the name of your loading job.", "Next, in your build.gradle.kts, under tasks {, add", "Here, we create two tasks: one which creates or \u201cbuilds\u201d the file, and another which loads the data into the graph.", "We\u2019ll need to generate a secret before loading our changes to the graph. Go to your GraphStudio and click the Admin button on the top right. Once clicked, click User Management in the left bar.", "Finally, under the box that says Create Secret, click the orange Create button and copy the secret.", "In gradle-local.properties, add a new field:", "Finally, you can go to Graph Studio. Go to Load Data to make sure everything loaded.", "Next, go to Explore Graph to look at the data. You can pick a few vertices and double click them to explore other vertices connected to it.", "Finally, we can analyse the data using queries. In db_scripts/queries, create a file called selectAll.gsql with the following:", "Next, in the same area as the load tasks, you\u2019ll need to add a task for the queries in build.gradle.kts (within the tasks section). You should add the following:", "Finally, to push the query to the solution, run:", "Go to GraphStudio, go to Queries, and your should find selectAll.", "You can click the selectAll, press the play button on the top, then it will run the query and take in parameters. You now have your very own queries running!", "Congratulations! You now know how to create graphs programmatically with Giraffle. Now you can start modelling and querying data for your own projects.
