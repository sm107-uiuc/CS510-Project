What about an API that brings the lyrics to a song? There are several projects that already do that, it would be just one more. What could I create, that \u201cmaybe\u201d nobody had done yet?", "After several days of thinking, the idea came to me. What will be the most used word in the lyrics of the band Queen? After several searches, I realized that no one had done anything like this. And that\u2019s when I started this project.I already knew some libraries, like Spotify, GeniusAPI that are focused on music, playlist, lyrics \u2026 so I had some idea of \u200b\u200bhow I would get most of the information I would need to build the heart of the project.", "Initially, I designed this application as an API so someone with more talent in developing interfaces can make a very beautiful screen and already use the back end effortlessly.", "I will explain how I organized the project, aiming mainly that other people can read the existing code and use it as a basis to add new features and make their own modifications. But as I know that there are many people who are starting in the world of pro gammation, below I will explain the main files of our API, their respective function and how it was thought to be used.", "Responsible for going to an API (in the project I\u2019m using Genius) to search for lyrics.", "Responsible for going to an API (in the project I\u2019m using Spotify) to search for artist information.", "Responsible for going to an API (in the project I\u2019m using Spotify) to search for the songs on an album.", "Responsible for going to an API (in the project I\u2019m using Spotify) to search for all the albums that artist is available.", "Here is our business rule, like when someone sends an invalid artist, this is the layer responsible for dealing with it.", "It is the representation of lyrics in our domain, which has the characteristics of that entity.", "Here, our infrastructure layer that the responsibility is to interact with the data persistence layer, in our case a database.", "To find the most common words in the lyrics, we use this module to analyze term by term of the letters and to generate statistics on top of that result.", "This file was created as soon as I conceived the project, I imagined, if I simply took the lyrics of the songs, probably the most used words would be \u201cthe\u201d, \u201cand\u201d, \u201cyou\u201d\u2026 and that was not what I wanted to know, I really wanted to know the words that the band used the most and that\u2019s how I came across the term \u201cstop_words\u201d, there are several places that you can find stop_words for the language you want, in this case, the project today supports American and Brazilian bands.", "End of mystery, the most common word in Queen lyrics is:", "This project made me learn a lot about how to think about doing something, that other people have new ideas, new functions, how to publish something that people until they don\u2019t know so much, can follow a predefined infrastructure in a simple way.", "As a suggestion for those who arrived here, there are several new qualities to be made. For example, analyzing various scenarios, I realized that there are artists who do not have any discos, only singles (EP), and today we do not take these songs into consideration.
