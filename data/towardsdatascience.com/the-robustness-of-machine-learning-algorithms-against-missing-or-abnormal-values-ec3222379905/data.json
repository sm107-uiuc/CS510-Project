They do represent a critical issue during a modeling process from two perspectives:", "From my experience, the trick is that a broken sensor will not send NaNs back to you; that would be too easy to detect! It is more likely that you will get zeros, biased or randomized values. Great isn\u2019t it!?", "There was a time I was concerned about getting abnormal values into the data I was processing. And when you are exploring 50 million rows x 300 features, it is way more difficult than finding the giraffe or the leopard in the pictures below:", "At some point, I decided to conduct my own tests and evaluate the ratio of abnormal values I was getting (always less than 1% and mostly below 0.5%) and, most importantly, how this phenomenon was affecting the performance of the algorithms I was using.", "The principle behind that test is very simple, and in reverse compared to the usual process:", "Normally, a sane Data Scientist would try to impute the missing or abnormal values to improve his model\u2019s accuracy; I chose to do it the other way around!", "I would start by evaluating the performance of classic machine learning algorithms* against a perfect dataset. And, progressively, I would increase the ratio of abnormal values introduced into the training set to measure the evolution of accuracy.", "(* Lasso, KNeighbors, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosted Trees regressors)", "And, as I was in \u201cbenchmark mode\u201d, I decided to reverse (again!) the process and compare the benefits brought by standard imputation techniques:", "As usual, we will start by creating a virtual \u201cindustrial\u201d dataset.

Each cycle is a follows:", "When the whole process is over, we can compare the performance of each model:", "The chart below displays the difference between the initial performance and the models trained with an increasing ratio of 0s:", "We can immediately see that the Lasso\u2019s performance completely collapses as soon as the first abnormal values are introduced: 0,5% lead to a 75% drop in performance. This is due to the linear structure (=equation) of its model.", "If we exclude the Lasso Regressor, we can notice that ensemble trees methods (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) are quite robust and outperform the KN Regressor:", "The drop in performance for Random Forets was 8,8% when 10% of abnormal values were introduced.
