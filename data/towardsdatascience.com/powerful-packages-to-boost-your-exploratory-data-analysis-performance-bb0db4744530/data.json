The goal of this step is to gain valuable insights through the data so that one can know what is going on with the data, which part needs to be cleaned, what new features can be built, build hypotheses to be tested during the model creation/validation phase, or even just knowing some fun facts about the data.", "\u201cA high-quality chart is worth a thousand insights\u201d", "Wait a minute, what is a high-quality chart?? Is it a chart with Super HD graphic quality?? \u2014 What I mean by a high-quality chart is a chart that captures interesting stories from a particular variable or the interaction between 2 or more variables. The question is:", "How can one produce that kind of \u201csuper\u201d chart??", "It sounds hard to produce that chart\u2026 Even though one has generated that chart, other questions arise:", "Does that chart provide enough insights? Is there any other kind of chart that provides completely different insights? Do we have to generate charts to gain insights from our data?", "In this article, I will introduce 3 awesome free packages which can generate an HTML report comprises various kind of EDA, in just a couple lines of Python code!", "I will try to focus on what are the best features offered by each of those packages and how they are complementing each other. The Titanic Dataset is used here to do the comparison.", "You can find all of the codes used in this article here.", "The main selling-point from this package is the broadness of analysis and the in-depth univariate analysis provided in a single HTML report!", "There are 5 sections in the generated report: Overview, Variables, Interactions, Correlations, Missing Values, Sample", "The first section of the generated report is the Overview section. There are 3 tabs in this section: Overview, Reproduction, Warnings.", "Overview \u2014 This tab provides an overview of the data, ranging from the number of variables, number of samples, missing cells, duplicate rows, total size in memory, average record size in memory, and also the distribution of variable based on the types.", "Reproduction \u2014 This tab provides the details of how this package performs the analysis and produce the report.", "Warnings \u2014 This tab provides very useful information if there is something wrong or something needs to be handled for each of the variables in the data. One can easily look first into this tab to do the data cleaning or some feature engineering with the data.", "The magic happens in the second section: Variables. One can see an in-depth univariate analysis for each of the variables, ranging from numerical analysis, Unicode analysis, URL analysis, or even Image analysis, based on the variable type.", "In my opinion, the Interaction section in the Pandas Profiling report is not really insightful. So, we will move into the next section: Correlations. This section provides a correlation analysis with 5 different methods! One of those methods can calculate the correlation between categorical, ordinal and interval variables.", "Again, in my opinion, the Missing Value section is not really insightful since the information is already provided in the Variables section. Finally, the last section of the Pandas Profiling report is the Sample section. This section provides the first and the last 10 rows of the data, which can be useful for one to know what the data really looks like.", "A really insightful report, right? The good news is one can easily generate this Pandas Profiling HTML report by just only 10 lines of code!", "The main selling-point from this package is the target analysis, comparison of train and test set, and a very cool User Interface, all in a single HTML report!", "Sweetviz is a newly published package (May 2020) which provides a very elegant HTML report. Different from Pandas Profiling, the HTML report generated by this package is not divided by section. At the top of the report, one can see the comparison summary of the train and test set. For a more in-depth comparison between the train and test set, as well as the powerful target analysis, one can hover through each of the variable \u201ccard\u201d.", "On each card, one can also see the categorical and the numerical associations between the particular variable and the remaining variables. The exciting part is this package can treat a variable with more than 1 type. For instance, the \u2018boat\u2019 variable is assigned in the categorical association table as well as in the numerical association table.", "Another cool report, right? Even now with only 3 lines of code, one can easily generate this HTML report.", "The main selling-point from this package is the target analysis and Principal Component Analysis in a single HTML report!", "For your information, DataExplorer is an R package. However, one can easily use any R packages in Python using the help of RPy2. If you are interested more in this, you can check this wonderful repository.", "Same with the Pandas Profiling, the report generated using this package is also divided into several sections. In my opinion, the most useful features one can exploit from this report is the Principal Component Analysis and Bivariate Distribution section.", "Since this is an R package that is used in Python, one need more lines of code to generate this report.", "To summarize all of this, in my opinion, one should consider using all of these 3 powerful packages to boost the EDA performance both in time-efficiency and also in the analysis quality. Each of these packages has its own excellence:", "The really important thing is: all of the reports can be generated easily with only a couple lines of code!", "Here are the snippets of what the Image and URL analysis generated in Pandas Profiling report.", "Louis Owen is a Data Science enthusiast who always hungry for new knowledge. He pursued a Mathematics major at one of the top university in Indonesia, Institut Teknologi Bandung, under the full final-year scholarship.", "Louis has experienced as an analytics/machine learning intern in various field of industry, including OTA (Traveloka), e-Commerce (Tokopedia), FinTech (Do-it), Smart City App (Qlue Smart City) and currently as a Data Science Consultant at The World Bank.", "Check out Louis\u2019 website to know more about him!
