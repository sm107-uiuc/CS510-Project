Three participants (two female, one male) listened to excerpts of Wikinews articles converted to MP3 files.", "The five articles cover a car smashing into a dental office[4], the venues of the 2026 FIFA World Cup[5], Microsoft\u2019s plan to acquire Github[6], a meeting between the Korean leaders[7] and Netta\u2019s victory at the Eurovision Song Contest[8].", "Blind to the names of the services and voices, the participants were presented with one speech output at a time in random order. They were instructed to rate how natural and how pleasant the speech they\u2019ve listened to sounded on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best).", "For each of the four services, one male and one female voice was used. This yielded a total of 120 ratings (three subjects, five articles, four services, two voices per service). The text was sent to the APIs as raw text without any SSML optimization.", "Playlists of the generated speech samples were uploaded to SoundCloud after the study had been completed.", "The following table provides an overview of the findings:", "Amazon\u2019s text-to-speech service Polly was announced at the end of 2016.", "At the time of writing, it supported 25 languages, ranging from Danish and Australian English to Portuguese Brazilian and Turkish.", "A larger number of voices has several benefits.

Among the four competitors, Google\u2019s service achieved the highest naturalness score and the best overall ratings.", "If natural sound is primary concern, then this is most likely the right choice of you.", "It should, however, be pointed out that both Amazon Web Services and IBM Watson offer more features.

Subsequent requests set you back pay $4 for every one million characters.", "In addition to limits of 300 requests per minute and 5,000 characters per request, there is a quota of 150,000 characters per minute.", "If you decide to the Java SDK, make sure to import from the package v1beta1 in the namespace com.google.cloud.texttospeech (and not from the v1 package).", "Microsoft\u2019s Cognitive Services Text To Speech is currently available as a preview. The greatest strength of this service is the degree of localization that it offers.", "The 80 voices that are available across 32 languages cover an unparalleled range of European and Asian locales.", "At this point, however, there is a clear trade-off between quantity and quality. The output generated with the two voices ZiraRUS and BenjaminRUS received the worst ratings in the experiment: 3.2 for naturalness and 3.33 for pleasantness.", "The samples that were generated for the experiment can be accessed through the following playlist:", "Microsoft\u2019s customization feature creates a unique voice model using studio recordings and associated scripts as training data. This feature is currently in private preview and limited to US-English and mainland Chinese.", "The free tier covers five million characters per month. In the S1 tier, the price per one million characters synthesized with the default voices is $2. Speech-to-text with custom models is available at a price of $3 per one million characters plus a $20 monthly fee per model.", "A console appears to be available only for its precursor, the Bing text-to-speech API.", "The service supports version 1.0 of SSML without extensions and limits the input to 1,024 characters per request, a fraction of the length of a news article.", "The only official Java library that exists is used for Android development. Interacting with the REST API, however, is a straight-forward two-step process. The client first obtains a token by providing the subscription key. This token \u2014 which is valid for 10 minutes \u2014 is then used to obtain the synthesized speech from the API. Note that voices are specified inside the SSML document using the voice tag.", "IBM has introduced two interesting SSML extensions for its Watson Text to Speech service: Expressive SSML and Voice Transformation SSML.", "The first extension is available for the US English voice Allison and implemented through the express-as element. The tag has a type attribute with three possible self-descriptive settings: GoodNews, Apology and Uncertainty.", "One can easily see how Expressive SSML enhances customer support solutions and other applications aiming at life-like conversations.", "While Watson Text to Speech comes only with support for 13 voices across 7 languages out of the box, the second SSML extension enables the creation of new voices.", "Going beyond the benefits of a broad range of default voices that are in general use, unique voices can enhance branding efforts through a memorable and differentiated user experience.", "Using the voice transformation element, customers can apply built-in transformations or define their own changes to create new voices based on the three existing US English alternatives.", "Using the values Young and Soft for type attribute, the sound of the three existing voices can be made more youthful and softer.", "To apply custom transformations, the type attribute must be set to Custom. This provides a fine-grained control over different aspects of the voice through optional attributes. Adjustable voice characteristics include the pitch, rate, timbre, breathiness and glottal tension.", "In the experiments I\u2019ve conducted, Watson Text to Speech performed slightly better than Microsoft\u2019s service, but did not achieve the level of naturalness and pleasantness that Amazon and Google provide.", "The names of the voices that have been used in the experiment are Allison and Michael. The generated samples rated by the participants are available through the following playlist:", "With the exception of the w tag, all of the SSML elements we\u2019ve mentioned are supported. For languages other than US English, however, the say-as instruction is limited to only two types of interpretations: digits and letters.", "Timing information can be obtained for words and markers.", "The Lite plan is restricted to 10,000 characters. Under the Standard tier, the synthesis of the first one million characters is free to the consumer. Subsequent requests are charged at a rate of $0.02 per 1,000 characters, making Watson Text to Speech the most expensive among the four services.", "A web demo showcases the basic functionality and the SSML extensions.", "While the body of a single request can have, at most, 5,000 characters, there is no limit on the number of requests sent per minute.", "The Java SDK works seamlessly and intuitively:", "[3] Ping, W., Peng, K., Gibiansky, A., Arik, S., Kannan, A., Narang, S., Raiman, J. and Miller, J., 2018.
