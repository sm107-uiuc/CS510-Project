Instead of comparing that extensive list of numbers, we\u2019ll use rectangles and their sizes.", "That\u2019s great! In a single method, just passing the data frame, we already have a visual representation of our missing values.", "This bar chart represents the number of records in each column. Here we have two scales, one telling the exact amount of values in the field (right) and the other representing the proportion to the total number of rows.", "Starting with a bar chart allows us to quickly tell if we\u2019ll need to spend more time analyzing the null values or not.", "It isn\u2019t the case with our data, but if you have a blessed dataset without any null values or with an acceptable amount of them, you could stop by now and follow up with your analysis.", "Let\u2019s try a different visualization for missing values.", "A matrix tells us exactly where the missing values are, in our example, the data is sorted with the newest records on top.", "We can already have some valuable insights by looking at the matrix and knowing how our data is arranged. Here we can see that the data collected changed at some point, where fields such as \u2018avg inmates get mental health bed\u2019 on the right of the matrix were discontinued, and others were added.", "Pretty cool, the matrix also has a small viz on the right that represents the completeness of the rows \u2014 They even mark the max and min amount of missing values.", "Now let\u2019s get a look at .heatmap, which will help us understand how the fields relate to each other regarding incompleteness.", "Okay, things just got complicated \u2014 Let\u2019s simplify it.", "This plot represents the correlation between the null values by column.", "Column A has a value, B also has a value, which means a strong positive correlation or a blue 1 in the chart.", "Column A has a value, but B has a null, which means a strong negative correlation, or a red -1 in the chart.", "We noticed earlier that there was some change in the way data was collected, and here we can see it again. The new variables have a positive correlation with themselves but a negative correlation to the old fields.", "Even though we can visualize that relationship by looking at the matrix, heatmaps make them more evident. It\u2019s not always that we\u2019ll have our rows sorted in a convenient way for us to realize the pattern.", "In this dataset, we can see that the fields of the survey are almost grouped.", "So, if one question is answered, we\u2019ll very likely have the answers for all items of that group.", "Okay, I want to go through one more way of visualizing how the fields relate in matters of nulls.", "We saw some group behaviour with the heatmaps, but primarily because of the dataset arrangement.", "If the rows are sorted, we can notice some correlation between the fields using the matrix chart, but this would be harder if they\u2019re randomly positioned.", "The same thing goes with heatmaps. If the columns are randomly positioned, we would have a more challenging time figuring out the pattern among groups of variables.", "The dendrogram uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm to bin the fields by their correlation. *the relationship we saw with the heatmaps.", "So it\u2019s like figuring out which fields are highly related to each other in matters of nullity, then testing how those groups of variables relate to themselves and so on.", "Again we can notice the discontinued fields, but we can get a more unobstructed view of which variables may be more reliable.", "The chart illustrates how the groups connect, where connections farther from zero represent combinations of variables that are less similar in nullity.", "Missingno is an excellent tool for quickly visualizing missing values; we only used one line of code for each chart and got a pretty decent result.", "The tool has some filtering functions to select and arrange the variables we want to plot. And it allows us to customize some aspects of the chart, all on the same statement.", "For whatever you can\u2019t customize directly with the Missingno, you can always go to Matplotlib.", "Great, we got a look at the basics of visualizing and analyzing the completeness of a dataset. It\u2019s interesting to see how much we can learn about the data by visualizing their missing values.", "Thanks for reading my article.
