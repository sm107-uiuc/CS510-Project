One such indicator is GDP per capita. GDP or Gross Domestic Product of a country is the monetary value of the final goods and services produced in a country during a specified period of time. Larger countries with a larger population will tend to have higher GDP. So in order to remove this bias towards high population, GDP is divided by the total population of the country, which gives us GDP per capita of the country.", "A country\u2019s development can be influenced by various economic as well as social factors. This article focuses only on the social factors impacting GDP per capita of a country. A total of seven social factors have been chosen for analysis. World Bank data has been used to gather all these features.", "The analysis uses regression to find whether the chosen factors impact GDP per capita. The study also tries to provide a ranking of the features based on their impact on GDP per Capita.", "Government: Knowing the relative importance of the features impacting development, governments can plan to invest money and form policies in the right direction.", "Voters: Voters can use it as one of the measures to analyze a government\u2019s work based on the knowledge of whether a government is focusing on important aspects or are its policies aimed at factors which do not contribute much towards a country\u2019s development.", "The Changemakers: The individuals who want to make a difference in the development of a country can choose which direction to work on to make the most impact on a country\u2019s growth.", "The different features were collected from the World Bank data and were wrangled to convert them to the desired structure. Regression was used to determine the coefficients. For this purpose, all the features were scaled so that the weights obtained by fitting a regression model, corresponds to the relative importance of each feature.", "The result of fitting a linear regression model on the scaled features suggested that Literacy has no impact on GDP per Capita. This result seemed weird as literacy is always associated with development. To investigate this the individual explanatory variables were plotted to understand their relationship with the dependent variable GDP per Capita.", "This analysis revealed that the features were not linear which implied that a Linear regression model could not be fit on the given data as it is. The plot suggested that the maximum variation in the Y-axis was from 0 to 150,000 while maximum variation in the X-axis was from 0 to 100. So a distinct relation could not be identified between the GDP per Capita and other variables. Therefore log of GDP per capita was taken to make the two variations similar.", "After log transformation, the variation of the X-axis and Y-axis became similar and almost a linear trend could be identified between GDP per capita and other independent variables. For example, it could be seen from literacy plot that as literacy rate increases log of GDP per capita increases and similarly the trend could be observed for other variables too. This gave motivation for using GLM(Generalized linear model). From the above plot, the link function was clear that it would be alog link function as after log transformation the trend in the data appeared linear. Now the challenge was to determine which family of distribution to use in GLM. To get some idea, the pdf of the dependent variable was plotted :", "The shape of the above density and the fact that GDP per Capitawas a positive continuous quantity suggested that Gamma distribution could be used to model the density function.", "So a GLM was fitted on the scaled data with Gamma distribution family having log link function.", "A linear model was also fitted by log transforming the dependent variable GDP per Capita. It is not a good practice to transform the dependent variable if the model is built for prediction purpose. But here the main task is identifying the feature importance. Also, log being a monotonically increasing function does not affect interpretability. So a log-transformed linear model was used as a second model.", "One of the most intuitive and simple ways to determine the relative importance of features is by directly assessing the weights associated with the scaled features obtained from the fitted regression model. But this does not take into account the error in determining the weights or in other words the confidence interval. So to mitigate this t statistic was used as the measure of importance as it also incorporates the error associated while calculating the weights.", "The entire analysis was performed in R. For the detailed code and to understand the entire flow, how the data wrangling was performed, how some features causing collinearity were dealt and other minute details, do have a look at my jupyter notebook in my GitHub repository. The notebook contains a documented analysis of each step which will help to understand the analysis better.", "Out of the seven factors considered only the following four features had an independent impact on GDP per capita:", "The other three factors, Poverty, Under Slum and Corruption were dependent on the above four. Varying these four can change the value of the three dependent variables.", "The above image shows the correlation values of all the factors. The numeric value of correlation varies from 0 to 1. If the correlation of two features is close to 0, that means the two features are not at all related while if the correlation is closer to 1, the two features can be considered highly related. The negative values indicate that increasing one variable will lead to a decrease in another variable while a positive value indicates increasing one will increase the other.", "The below image shows how the four independent features impact GDP per Capita:", "From the above image, it can be concluded that:", "Now we know how each of the four variables impacts GDP per capita, let us see which is the most important factor impacting it:", "Here two models have been analysed and both the models give the same result for the importance of features. The importance is directly proportional to the absolute value of t statistics obtained by fitting the two models. From the above two graphs, it can be observed that:", "Literacy is the most important factor impacting GDP per capita followed by Adult Mortality, then Government effectiveness and last political stability.", "Let us look at the top 10 countries having the highest GDP per capita in 2018", "The graph shows that Monaco has the highest GDP per capita among all the countries in 2018 and the United States ranks 10th.", "According to GDP per capita, the USA ranks 10th, China 90th and India 182nd. There is a similar difference in literacy rates. USA and China have a very high literacy rate of 99% and 97% respectively while India lags far behind at 74%.", "According to Wikipedia, the USA spent 5% of its GDP on education in 2014. In 2016, China spent 4% of its GDP on education. On the other hand, India spent only 3% of its GDP on education in 2019. This shows a serious concern. Both the USA and China have a very high literacy rate, to catch up with them India needs to spend much more than them on education.", "Your home for data science.
