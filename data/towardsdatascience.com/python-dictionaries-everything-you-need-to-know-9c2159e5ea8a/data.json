They allow you to store and structure nested data in a clean and easy-to-access way. Today we\u2019ll explore everything there is to Python dictionaries and see how you can use them to structure your applications.", "Don\u2019t feel like reading? Check out my video on the topic:", "Dictionaries are somewhat similar to lists. Both are dynamic, meaning they can store any data types, and both are mutable, meaning you can change them throughout the application.", "What makes dictionaries different is the storage type. They store key-value pairs instead of a raw number or text. Further, you can access dictionary elements through a key instead of an index position, as is the case with lists.", "Accessing a key returns a value \u2014 that\u2019s the general behavior you should remember.", "There are many topics to cover. Please follow them in specified order if this concept is new to you. If not, feel free to skip to any section.", "There are multiple ways to create a dictionary. None of them is better than the other, so feel free to pick one that best suits your coding style.", "The first way is the one you\u2019ll find in most of the examples online, so we\u2019ll stick to it throughout the article. In this style, you are putting keys and values separated by a colon inside curly brackets. Here\u2019s an example:", "The second style uses the dict keyword to declare a dictionary, and than places the elements as tuples (key, value) inside a list:", "It\u2019s not the most convenient method if you ask me. There are way too many parentheses, which ruin the code\u2019s cleanness if the dictionary has nested elements.", "The third approach also uses the dict keyword, but the style looks more like assigning values to function parameters:", "Note how quotes aren\u2019t placed around the keys with this approach.", "Once again \u2014 the style you choose is irrelevant.", "In this section, you\u2019ll learn how to access dictionary values, change them, and delete them.", "To access dictionary values, you can use the dict[key] syntax. Let\u2019s see how to print values of both Country and City from the dictionary d:", "Executing this code prints \u201cUSA Washington, D.C.\u201d to the console.", "Next, let\u2019s see how to change the values. You can still use the dict[key] syntax, but you\u2019ll have to assign a value this time. Here\u2019s how:", "If you were to reuse the first code snippet from this section, \u201cFrance Paris\u201d would be printed to the console.", "Finally, let\u2019s see how to delete a key. Python has a del keyword that does the job. Here\u2019s how to use it:", "If you were to print the entire dictionary, \u201c{\u2018Country\u2019: \u2018France\u2019}\u201d would show. The Capital key was deleted successfully.", "Nested dictionaries have either dictionaries or lists as values for some keys. If you make a request to almost any REST API, chances are the JSON response will contain nested elements. To oversimply, consider JSON and nested dictionaries as synonyms. Therefore, it\u2019s essential to know how to work with them.", "The Temperature key has a dictionary for a value, which further has two key-value pairs inside. The nesting can get a lot more complicated, but the principles remain identical.", "Let\u2019s now see how to access the City key. This should be a no-brainer, as the mentioned key isn\u2019t nested:", "The value of \u201cWashington, D.C.\u201d is printed to the console.", "Let\u2019s spice things up a bit. To practice accessing nested values, you\u2019ll have to access the value located at Temperature > Value key. Here\u2019s how:", "The value of \u201c54.3\u201d is printed to the console.", "And that\u2019s all you should know about nesting. Once again, nesting can get way more complicated, but the logic behind accessing elements always stays the same.", "Checking if a key exists is common when working on programming or data science tasks. In this section, you\u2019ll learn how to check if a key exists, if a key doesn\u2019t exist, and how to check if multiple keys exist.", "Let\u2019s start with checking if a single key exists. You can use Python\u2019s in keyword to perform the check:", "The code above outputs True to the console. Let\u2019s perform the same check for a key that doesn\u2019t exist:", "As you would expect, False is printed to the console.", "Let\u2019s now see how to check if a key doesn\u2019t exist in a dictionary. You can use Python\u2019s not keyword combined with in. Here\u2019s an example:", "The above code prints False to the console.", "Finally, let\u2019s see how to check for multiple keys. You can use Python\u2019s and and or keywords, depending on if you need all keys to be present or only one:", "The first line outputs False, and the second one True. You can put as many conditions as you need; there\u2019s no need to stop at two.", "This section is the most useful one for practical work. You\u2019ll learn which methods you can call on dictionaries and how they behave.", "This method is used to grab a value for a particular key. Here\u2019s how to grab the value for City of the weather dictionary:", "As you would expect, \u201cWashington, D.C.\u201d is printed to the console.", "This method returns all of the keys present in a given dictionary:", "The values() method is very similar to the previous one, but returns dictionary values instead:", "This method returns a list of key-value pairs found in a dictionary:", "The pop() method removes a key-value pair from the dictionary and returns the value. The removed value can be stored in a variable:", "This method is similar to the previous one, but it always removes the last key-value pair. The removed value can be stored in a variable:", "The output is: {'Country': 'USA'}. As you can see, the Temperature key and its value were successfully removed.", "This method is used to delete everything from a dictionary. Here\u2019s an example:", "The output is an empty dictionary \u2014 {}.", "This is the last method we\u2019ll cover today. Put simply, it is used to merge two dictionaries. If the same keys appear in both dictionaries, the value of the latter is preserved:", "The unpacking operator provides a more Pythonic way of performing dictionary updates. Unpacking is widely used in data science, for example to train a machine learning model with a set of hyperparameters stored as key-value pairs in a dictionary.", "To perform the unpacking, you can use the ** operator before a dictionary.", "Let\u2019s cover unpacking with an example. Suppose you have the following two dictionaries:", "You want to store all key-value pairs in a single dictionary. Here\u2019s how to do this with unpacking:", "Don\u2019t let the fancy naming fool you \u2014 this is a simple concept. You are probably already familiar with comprehensions, but with lists. As it turns out, you can do the same with dictionaries.", "If you aren\u2019t familiar, don\u2019t worry, there isn\u2019t much to it. Dictionary comprehensions are methods for transforming one dictionary into another. Comprehensions are a neat way to avoid writing loops.", "Let\u2019s get practical. Suppose you have the following dictionary of scores on a test:", "For whatever reason, you\u2019re feeling generous today and are giving ten extra points to every student. Instead of writing a loop and reassigning values in that way, you can use comprehensions:", "Awesome! For the next example, you want to find out which students passed the test. 50 points is the pass threshold:", "And that\u2019s just for today. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "Today you\u2019ve learned pretty much everything there is about dictionaries. You can do other things, of course, but I didn\u2019t find them useful in my daily job.", "This article alone should serve you well for any use case \u2014 from programming to data science and machine learning.", "What\u2019s your most common operation performed with dictionaries?", "Loved the article?
