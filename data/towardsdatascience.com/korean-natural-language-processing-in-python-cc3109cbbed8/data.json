We will be using a Python module called KoNLPy. Based on the official documentation, KoNLPy (pronounced as ko en el PIE):", "\u201c\u2026 is a Python package for natural language processing (NLP) of the Korean language.\u201d", "This module is based on the following philosophies:", "There are 3 sections in this tutorial:", "Let\u2019s proceed to the next section and start installing the necessary modules.", "Setup is slightly complicated as you need to make sure that you have installed Java version 1.7. Proceed to the following link to download the necessary JDK for your computer.", "JPype is needed to access the Java class libraries from Python. You will need to install the correct JPype based on your operating system and Python version. Check it with the following code", "Head over to the following link and download the corresponding file. I will be using the following file since I am running Python3.7.4 on a 64-bit Windows machine.", "Place the file in a directory and open up a terminal. It is highly recommended to setup a virtual environment beforehand. Change the directory to the root folder where the wheel file is located. Run the following command to install it. Modify the name accordingly based on what you have downloaded.", "Proceed to install koNLPy via the pip install command.", "If you are using other kinds of operating systems, kindly check out the official documentation as I have not personally tested it. It supports both Linux and MacOS and the installation is a lot more straightforward.", "Let\u2019s move on to the next section and start writing some Python code.", "This module provides a few different classes for us to perform morphological analysis and part-of-speech tagging. Each of them differs in the final results and performance. Check out the following link to find out more on the time and performance analysis.", "I will be using Okt for this tutorial to keep things simple and easy. Let\u2019s start by adding the following import declarations on top of your Python file.", "I will be using the following text as input. It means I am eating an apple in Korean. Hopefully, I got it right.", "Initialize the class as an object", "After that, we can call the functions inside it and print the result out using the pprint utils class.", "Let\u2019s try to extract nouns from the sentences by using the nouns function", "You should get the following result.", "If you are looking to tokenize the sentences, you can use morphs function. It accepts three input parameters.", "It can be called as follow:", "You should see the following output at the console.", "You can notice that the word \uba39\uace0\uc788\ub2e4 (eating) is being reduced to \uba39\ub2e4 (eat).", "pos function is useful if you are looking for part of speech tag after tokenization process. Unlike the previous functions, the parameters inside this function differs based on the class that you are using. Some of the classed have flatten parameter which preserves eojeols if set to False. Okt class has the following input parameters.", "Let\u2019s test it out with the following code", "The following result will be shown at the console.", "Modify the previous line and set the join parameter to True", "The result is now tied together as one element separated by / sign.", "Let\u2019s recap on what we have learned today.", "We started off installing the necessary modules and libraries. The setup is slightly complicated if you are a Windows user.", "Next, we explored the functions provided by koNLPy module in-depth. It can be used to extract nouns from an input sentence. Besides, you can also tokenize it into individual words. You can fine-tune it to get only the base form of the word as output.", "Moreover, we have also tested out the pos function which allows us to identify the part of speech tag for Korean language.", "Thanks for reading this piece.
