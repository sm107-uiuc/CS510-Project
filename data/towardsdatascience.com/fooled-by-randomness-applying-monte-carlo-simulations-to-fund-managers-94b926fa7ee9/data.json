At the time, I simply took him at his word when he made statistical arguments. Today, that\u2019s not the case, and I think we can learn more by challenging some of his assumptions and building these simulations ourselves.", "For the uninitiated, Taleb\u2019s first book is a thought-provoking discussion of the effects of randomness, particularly in the financial markets, and human limitations, cognitive biases, and mistakes in the face of these effects. There is a lot of wisdom, wit, and insight that can be gleaned from his writings (if you can get past his ego); I find myself often reflecting on some of the concepts he has raised or popularized over the years, from black swan events, antifragility, to the incentives of having skin in the game.", "Taleb refers often to the power of Monte Carlo simulation to get a handle on the effects of randomness by simulating potential futures mathematically. Seeing how these various paths play out, we can then make informed decisions based on expectation rather than pure probability. Moreover, we can examine the areas that we\u2019re falling into cognitive traps based on the outcome of these random processes. This is a particularly pernicious problem when it comes to finance.", "It\u2019s well-known that traders and professional money managers face a strict test, being quickly culled from the herd when losses begin to mount, regardless of their past track records. In times of turmoil, they\u2019re quickly shown the door never to be heard from again (Taleb illustrates this with the story of John and Nero, the former being a high-flying trader who racks up millions before blowing up and being tossed from the industry and polite society, while the more conservative Nero continues on). Given such an arduous process, those with stellar track records that are consistently paraded before the audiences of the financial \u201cnews\u201d networks (\u201cnews\u201d being used loosely given their propensity to entertain first, and promote stocks second) must be exceptional investors with remarkable insights into the markets.", "Taleb strongly remonstrates against such ideas.", "This line of thinking falls to the survivorship bias \u2014 only seeing those who remain at the end of the day while ignoring the failed entrants in the game. Taleb likens this to a game of financial Russian roulette, you take risk after risk after risk, and often the chamber clicks, rewarding you with another day and giving you the false impression of your own competence. Eventually, however, this is going to end quite badly. Given enough participants, we can expect some to survive simply as a numbers game. However, viewing those survivors as role models to emulate is the height of folly.", "We can explore this mathematically by setting up our own Monte Carlo simulation of the thought experiment given in the book (see this post for code).", "Taleb illustrates his point by asking us to imagine a cohort of 10,000 money managers competing for investments. Each year we review the performance of the managers and throw away those who lost money. If we assume that the market provides us with a binary outcome, we either profit or take a loss (no break-even\u2019s in our world) and that each outcome is equally likely, we find ourselves with a rapidly diminishing pool of viable managers.", "The technical term for this type of simulation is a Bernoulli Process. That simply means that we have a sequence of events which have a random, binary outcome. In this case, we flip 10,000 coins at the end of the first year, and for each head we get, a manager makes a profit and survives to invest again the next year. Each tail indicates a manager looking for a career change.", "Playing this model out, we\u2019ll wind up with a curve showing the survival of only a small percentage of managers.", "By the end of 5 years, our 10,000 managers dwindles to a mere 269. Taleb takes it one step farther shows that even if you have a greater propensity to lose money than make it (45/55) you\u2019ll still wind up with multiple \u201csuccessful\u201d managers to choose from (~190).", "These managers are going to have stellar, perfect records and likely will have amassed an incredible amount of money for themselves, their firms and/or investors, but you have no reason to invest with them in the future. At least, this is Taleb\u2019s argument.", "Taleb\u2019s argument is fine if we assume profiting in the market is a purely random process. However, given the fact that he made his money as an options trader and considers himself intelligent and capable as such, I don\u2019t think he really believes that the market behaves according to his description. In fact, there does seem to be a variety of different investor strategies and skill level.", "Let\u2019s return to his example and add a bit of nuance to the model. Instead of assuming that the outcome for all of the participants are equal, and that each has a 50:50 chance of earning a profit or loss, let\u2019s randomly generate managers with a certain skill level. In this set-up, the average manager will have a skill level of 50, which yields a 50:50 chance of survival. If we set the standard deviation to 10, then a manager that is one standard deviation above the mean will have a skill level of 60. He has a 60% chance of surviving and so forth.", "Our distribution of skill looks as follows:", "Simulating this scenario, we can see that more fund managers make it to 5 years, even though the expected return of the population is the same.", "In this case, we get a higher number of fund managers who survive (439 to 269). Stated another way, our 5-year fund manager survival rate increased from 2.7% to 4.4%.", "This doesn\u2019t tell us everything though, because if you\u2019re an investor looking at past performance, you\u2019d like to know if it tells you something.", "If we split up our managers into different quantiles and track their performance, we can see how skill may influence their performance.", "In the plot above, I split the managers into bins based on skill and tracked their 5-year performance, where each year, the managers got a 1 or -1 according to their skill level if the profited or not. In this case, I didn\u2019t throw out those who failed \u2014 we just need to focus on the columns on the right to see those who never had a down year. From here, we can see where our different skill groups wind up.", "We can see that of our top performers (the 5-year survivors) 61% of them are from our most highly skilled management group. The next 22% come from Group 3, those that are above average, but just outside of the top 25% of skilled managers. The balance is made up of the two below average groups (1 and 2). These are the truly lucky ones. While the top group, on average, stands to profit 63% of the time, the bottom two groups can only expect a profit 37% and 47% of the time respectively.", "If you change the model by extending the time horizon, you\u2019ll see a clearer and clearer separation between the skilled and unskilled investors. This indicates that those with a longer record of success may indeed have an advantage over those with shorter records (even if the short records are outstanding). It doesn\u2019t seem to me we can ever eliminate chance as an explanation\u2014 long records like Buffett\u2019s could indicate he was simply the luckiest investor of all time \u2014 but it reduces the probability that luck and randomness is the primary explanation of success as a record stretches out in time.", "If we were to restrict our investment decisions to the fund managers (or companies) that have a 5 year track record of profits, then, under this distribution, we\u2019d have a 61% chance of picking a top performer, and an 83% chance of picking an above average performer! Those are certainly better odds than we\u2019d get by simply reading Taleb\u2019s treatment.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that no luck whatsoever is involved, but it does seem that Taleb proves too much in his simplified illustration. Lest anyone take my simplistic Monte Carlo model too seriously and figure they\u2019ve got an 83% chance of profiting just by looking at 5-year track records, my model too makes some key and very questionable assumptions.", "All models are wrong, but some are useful.George Box", "For one, notice I assumed that there was a balance between luck and skill, with these offsetting each other. Even if we lump other things into the skill bucket (e.g. investment strategy, technological infrastructure, support staff, etc.) we would still be missing other information such as the market regime. We could call it \u201cluck,\u201d but if you came of age in 2009 and started investing then, you\u2019d have enjoyed the longest bull market in history. There\u2019s certainly a significant aspect of luck to that! However, it seems more that this isn\u2019t luck or randomness in the sense that Taleb uses the phrase (although he seems to equivocate in other areas of the book). This kind of adjustment would require the use of a proper baseline to correct for.", "Another key assumption is that this skill factor is normally distributed. I am quite confident that skill \u2014 or whatever differentiates investors \u2014 is not identical from person to person as Taleb\u2019s model assumes, but I do not know if it\u2019s normally distributed, if it\u2019s skewed left or right, or how it may vary across the population of investors. Nor, do I know how a Jim Simons or Warren Buffett may compare to your average retail investor along this single, all encompassing \u201cskill\u201d metric I devised.", "Finally, I assumed that this skill factor remains fixed over time (something I\u2019m quite confident is false) and that it remains constant relative to the market over time as well.", "Correcting these assumptions is not straightforward. But we ought to be careful what we infer from our models. When we infer too much, as I believe Taleb does in his book, you can go down dangerous paths. As a side note, you ought to be inherently skeptical whenever someone invokes a single cause as the explanation for a complex phenomenon. If only it were ever that simple.", "Many of Taleb\u2019s broader point on the role of randomness in our lives stands. We often do fall victim to its vices by adhering to cognitive biases and heuristics that serve well in most of our life, but fail catastrophically in the face of probabilities. Despite this fact, it doesn\u2019t follow that we can\u2019t derive some important signals from the onslaught of random noise that we\u2019re bombarded with.", "Your home for data science.
