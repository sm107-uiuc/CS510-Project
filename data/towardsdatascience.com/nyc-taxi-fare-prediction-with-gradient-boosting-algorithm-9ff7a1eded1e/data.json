Every month, millions of data collected by taxi agencies enable them to gain insight into demand density, travel patterns, and traffic congestion. By leveraging these data accumulated on a daily basis, taxi companies can provide better pricing with the aim to facilitate passengers with a competitive ride fare.", "In this experiment, we are going to implement a learning algorithm which is Gradient Boosting to predict the taxi fare.", "Gradient Boosting (GBM) is a learning technique which combines the outputs of many simple predictors to build a powerful predictor with improved performance over the base learner tree. The new tree is an enhancement version of the previous tree, therefore this technique is known as boosting, where new tree boosts the performance of the original version (Biau, et al., 2019).", "The GBM algorithm can be illustrated as the figure above. GBM used base learners composed of multi-layer decision trees on a fixed scale. It has been highlighted that gradient boosting has several advantages. GBM offers the ease of use to train the model and facilitate both efficiency and effectiveness as follows:", "This experiment leveraging the data from the NYC Taxi and Limousine Commission (TLC) specifically on yellow taxi data in June 2019. Check out the dataset here. The dataset composes features including the pickup and drop-off zone, trip distance, pickup time, passenger count, congestion_surcharge, and so on. These variables will be used as independent variables. On the other hand, the fare_amount variable will be used as the target variable which defines as the total amount of the taxi fare. Additionally, a random subset of approximately 1.000 observations will be split into the ratio of 8:2 for model development and evaluation purpose.", "Finally, RStudio will be used to perform all of the experiments of model development and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) will be used as an evaluation metric.", "GBM offers various tuning parameters and extremely flexible. However, the challenge arises when finding the best combination of hyperparameters as it can be time-consuming to control.", "It is no doubt that GBM continues to evolve by eliminating all errors, overemphasizing the outliers, and cause them to overfit. Therefore it is necessary to perform cross-validation to generalize the model. In the first step, the GBM model is built with 10-fold cross-validation with the default learning rate (shrinkage) of 0.001. Besides, GBM uses a default number of interaction.depth as 1 which defines as the level of tree used for learning. Finally, n.trees will be set to 10000.", "As can be seen from the chart above, 0.001 shrinkage is a very small learning rate which typically needs a large number of trees in order to reach the minimum MSE. Additionally, many trees also lead to a long training process.", "This setting seems not sufficient for better prediction. Therefore, several parameters need to be tuned through grid searching. In order to find the right fit of parameters with a lower RMSE rate without being overfitting, Grid Search is performed. In this step, several parameters are tuned including:", "The following is the grid search setting of each parameter. The parameter range is set to fits the dataset characteristics. In this case, the given data are merely 1000 observations which are quite small.", "Then the grid search setting then is fitted into the model training loop as follows.", "As the result, the following are several parameter sets that output the 10 lowest rates of RMSE. In this case, the first row set up will be used to fit the final model.", "Following are the parameters set up for the final model:", "The configuration will be used to obtain an optimal model. These parameters are then fitted to the final model with the gbm() function to train the model.", "The final Train RMSE is 0.1148923 and Test RMSE is 0.3030436 which indicates that it is a good model where the gap between train RMSE and test RMSE is quite small.", "Throughout the process of model development, fine-tuning and optimization procedures play important roles to find the best fit of parameters to build a better model with lower the error rate. After all the models are trained, it is a necessary task to perform validation to evaluate a trained model on the test dataset. This validation process verifies whether the model is performed as expected. Not only that, this process also facilitates the generalization ability of the model which has been trained and tuned.", "In terms of speed performance, previous researchers revealed that the Gradient Boosting learning technique performs faster compare to other tree-based learning like Random Forest. During the training of Random Forest, this model utilizing fully grown trees and combine all trees to make a prediction through the voting method. However, gradient boosting leveraging the combination of weak learners to make a better prediction.", "Your home for data science.
