In this blog we review supervised learning, where you\u2019ll have an input variable such as x and an output variable such as Y and you use an algorithm to learn the mapping function from the input to the output Y = f(x).", "Digging deeper into supervised learning, we have two sets of problems, classification and regression. Classification problems have output variables that are categorical (qualitative) while regression problems tend to have outputs that are values (quantitative). In statistics, qualitative methods are descriptive whereas quantitative are numerical. Although it may not be as simple as splitting the two problems into classification and regression it can become a little more complicated. A least squares linear regression problem is used with a quantitative response whereas a logistic regression is used with a qualitative response (binary results between 0 and 1). We often use logistic regression for classification problems. Think about you Y variable or output having two results such as yes or no (binary results). Boosting and KNN are two examples that can be used in the case of either qualitative or quantitative responses but by nature are quantitative methods.", "When we have models in data science that are quantitative by nature but we would like a categorial response we use classification methods. As stated above binary results may be used with numbers like 0 and 1. 0 representing false and 1 representing True. If there are more than two categorial outputs we represent our outputs using dummy variables.", "A dummy variable (aka, an indicator variable) is a numeric variable that represents categorical data, such as gender, race, political affiliation, etc. Technically, dummy variables are dichotomous, quantitative variables.", "Choosing between qualitative and quantitative methods depends on what you believe would provide the best evidence for your research objective. Some data scientists even use both in order to correctly solve their business problems. We call this mixed methods!", "Let\u2019s take banking data as an example, we want to flag customers with fraudulent credit card behavior. We have 5 columns of data which includes a unique id, date, name, location, and transaction amount. We know our data has transactions that provide us with quantitative data and qualitative data. As a data scientist, we decide to use a logistic regression approach to this problem(binary) 0 for no fraud and 1 for fraud.", "But wait, we aren\u2019t finished\u2026 we have location as a qualitative data. We want to change our locations using longitude and latitude which turns our location data to quantitative results. We can flag customers with <2 transactions outside a certain milage of their other transactions. Creative right?", "How about we flag customers from a quantitative perspective and monitor spikes in transaction amounts. These are two simple examples of how we can solve problems from cleaning our data from turning some variables to a quantitative approach. We can even use categorial or \u201cdummy variables\u201d in order to solve more problems with fraudulent behavior.", "Overall, data scientists and data analysts will use different methods in order to solve problems more effectively. Whether the answer is to use a quantitative or qualitative approach depends on the nature of the problems being asked. Remembering your process of cleaning and evaluating data and staying creative with solving problems is key to any business decision. In order to effectively deliver models with solutions you must understand what output should be required.", "Your home for data science.
