Traditional methods for antibiotic discovery can be very costly and time-consuming, however, this new technique could reduce the time frame from years down to weeks.", "The technology, in general, is not new, with the most famous example of deep learning being the one that you probably carry around in your pocket. Technologies such as Apple\u2019s Siri and Amazon\u2019s Alexa are both examples of neural networks that learn more and more from your voice the more that you talk to it.", "Similarly, this new program was first provided with an existing database of around 2000 molecules including FDA approved antibiotics, among other compounds. The team were then able to train the neural network to recognise other similar molecules that are able to kill bacteria. They had this deep learning system highlight any molecules with antimicrobial activity against their test bacteria E. Coli.", "The initial library screened was the \u2018Drug Repurposing Hub\u2019 which contains over 6000 characterised molecules. Re-discovering the same compounds over and over again is a big problem with traditional methods of drug discovery. To counteract this, only compounds that had a different structure to other known antibiotics were pulled out from the tested library.", "After repeated cycles of learning, the system was able to identify one molecule of interest which was predicted to have very high potency against E. Coli, as well as low toxicity in humans. The new molecule was aptly named Halicin, after the AI machine in \u20182001: A Space Odyssey\u2019.", "Halicin was then subjected to more conventional laboratory tests to uncover how efficient it was at killing various bacterial species and to see which mechanism it uses to do this. It was found that Halicin interferes with a bacteria\u2019s ability to maintain a gradient across their cell wall which produces ATP. ATP is the energy currency of all living cells, so without it, death is inevitable.", "In mice models, Halicin was found to have potent antimicrobial activity against some of the most dangerous resistant infections such as Clostridioides difficile and pan-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii. Both of these are highly ranked by the WHO as pathogens for which we desperately need new antibiotics.", "Following the success of the initial round, scientists then turned to a bigger library of compounds. The ZINC15 database contains over 1.5 billion molecules, however, only 107 million were chosen to screen.", "Of these molecules, 8 were found to be active against at least one of the bacterial species chosen to test, which included S. aureus and Klebsiella pneumoniae, among others. This whole process took only 4 days, which is astounding when you consider the largest library able to be manually screened with empirical methods is ten times smaller and can take years.", "Two of the compounds were found to be broadly active against all species tested. One, in particular, has a structure unlike any other known antibiotic, as well as predicted low toxicity in humans. No doubt this molecule will be the focus of future studies for the group.", "This method has the opportunity to completely revolutionise how we discover antibiotics. Through the combination of conventional and disruptive technologies, the team were able to identify an antibiotic that they believe could be one of the most important ever found (Reported by Broad Institute).", "The impact of this is huge for a lot of areas within science. Probably most importantly, this could greatly aid the fight against antibiotic resistance.", "To put this into perspective, the strain of A. baumannii which halicin has potential to treat is currently resistant to all known antibiotics and is currently a huge problem among US soldiers deployed in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bacteria is of little threat to healthy individuals, however, those with weaker immune systems or injuries are significantly more susceptible, leading to higher instances in hospitals. It is thought that infection rates are high among soldiers due to the multiple instances of exposure to different medical environments that recruits will endure before heading back to their home country following an injury. This is resulting in higher overall deaths among soldiers.", "In terms of this technology, the scientists behind the study have highlighted that this is just the beginning. Now that it has been demonstrated just how powerful a tool this is, the AI aspect can be improved continuously so that bigger libraries can be screened. This could potentially result in molecules with antimicrobial activity being discovered regularly.", "There is also the opportunity to tailor the deep learning algorithms to pinpoint molecules that can kill very specific types of antibiotics. The team hopes that in the future, this could lead to the development of treatments that could be delivered intravenously to a precise site of infection, so as not to interfere with the bacteria that live within us harmlessly.", "Original Research Paper \u2014 A Deep Learning Approach to Antibiotic Discovery", "Introducing Deep Learning and Neural Networks \u2014 Deep Learning for Rookies (1)", "Trends and Exceptions of Physical Properties on Antibacterial Activity for Gram-Positive and Gram-Negative Pathogens", "Epidemiology of Infections Associated With Combat-Related\u2026 : Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery", "ZINC 15 \u2014 Ligand Discovery for Everyone", "Your home for data science.
