It identifies and quantifies the sources of variation that influence the measurement system. Processes where the variability of the measurement system is not controlled cannot be improved. A good measurement system has only random variability due to the inherent variation of the item being measured, and not produced by appraisers (operators, machines, etc.), parts, time, or another factor. Some important terminology related with this topic include the following concepts:", "In summary, repeatability may be defined as the inherent variability of the measurement system (under similar conditions) and reproducibility as the variability under different conditions (groups), for instance, operators, machines, or any other factor.", "For a measurement system to be accurate, the contribution of the gage R&R variability to the total variability should be lower than 10%. A value between 10% and 30% could be considered as acceptable. However, a value larger than 30% represents an inefficient measurement system.", "To evaluate this fact, the square roots of the variabilities (i.e. the standard deviations) are used. The contribution of each source of variation is then computed over the total StudyVar:", "In the same way, another useful metric is the number of distinct categories. It is calculated using the formula below and rounding to the nearest lower integer (1 if lower than 1).", "The number of distinct categories should be greater than or equal to 4. This value measures the relationship between the variability due to the measurement system and the inherent variability. If it is lower than 4, then the gage R&R variability is large compared to the inherent variability. Otherwise, the relationship between both variabilities can be considered adequate.", "The ss.rr function from the SixSigma R package automatically performs the gage R&R study. For the following example, let\u2019s consider a case where a battery manufacturer measures the voltage of three different batteries (parts), with two different voltmeters (appraisers), three different times (replicates). Let\u2019s take a look at the R code!", "According to the results of the MSA, the %StudyVar due to R&R is 93.13%. The total number of distinct categories was 1. This combination of results (i.e. small number of categories and a large percentage of variability), represents the worst case scenario for a measurement system.", "According to the charts results, it is apparent that the measurement system is not working properly. The main problem in this example is the voltmeters (appraisers).", "Measurement represents a significant task in quality assurance. Wrongly measured data could lead to wrong decisions, and thus, inadequate results. For this reason, MSA should be conducted as a preliminary stage in any Six Sigma Project. MSA allows engineers analyze data and identify sources and variation. With this information, they can proceed with the planning and development of kaizen events with the aim of a better yield. The SixSigma R package represents a great tool that allows performing gage R&R analyses with just a few lines of code. Industrial, process and quality engineers are highly encouraged to take advantage of this tool to be able to fulfill the customer\u2019s requirements with high quality and efficiency standards.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
