Here is my answer.", "Sigmaplot has introduced this software a long time ago. It has been widely used to find the best curve fitting in the data. The running time is pretty quick and the number of equations is relatively high (More than 3,500 equations in version 5.01). As opposed to Python and other sophisticated software, the user interface is very easy for beginners. By simply uploading the data in any supporting formats (xls, dat, txt, sys, and many more), and just one simple click, the software will automatically try fitting all the available equations (including the custom one that you can generate) and report them as ranking by R^2 value.", "There is two main software in this set. The first one is TableCurve2D which is used to model two variables, and the other one is TableCurve3D which is used to model three variables.", "Unfortunately, for more than 3 variables data set, it is not possible to visualize the data in a graph that humans can see. Perhaps, this is the reason why they don\u2019t develop further applications for 4 or 5 variables. Furthermore, this curve-fitting software tends to overfit the data providing that it has so many complicated equations to try on. In addition, it cannot separate between training and testing datasets (you\u2019ll need to do it manually if needed). Nonetheless, the results are generally accurate if you use the model to predict the new data where the dependent variables are within the scope of the model.", "This is also not open-source software, but it costs really low. It also offers a limited period for a free trial. Within just a $500 one-time purchase, you can get a quick analysis and good model fitting results. The curve fitting graphics are easy to understand and very efficient to compare among different equations.", "Microsoft Power BI is really a powerful interactive data visualization software. One module that they have just embed recently is the ability to conduct simple prediction and the ability to tell the key influencers. By plugging in the data and proceed with a few clicks, the results are pretty amazing. There is also some adjustment available for the prediction interval, such as adjusting the confidence level or seasonality parameter.", "Although there are not many modeling parameters that you can adjust, if using Power BI, the results are relatively okay and it is very easy and quick to do the analysis for any analysts.", "According to betterbuys.com, Power BI has three pricing plans.", "As a main competitive for Power BI, TIBCO Spotfire also give good forecasting features. Within a few clicks, the forecast line and curves can be easily set up. However, due to its high license cost, I have not tried that much, but their official blog, Forecasting in Single click, is a really good source to explore.", "Regarding its pricing, TIBCO offers a 30-days free trial. After that, the cost ranges from $25 to $125 per month depending on the package that you can select. The official site is here.", "KNIME Analytics Platform is an open-source application built for data science work with no coding skill is required. It can convert from CUI (Coding User Interface) like Python or R to GUI (Graphical User Interface) which is much more user friendly to someone who does not have coding skills. It works as icons with just drag and drop. Then, the work can simply begin. Like the above snapshot, instead of writing \u201cpd.read_csv()\u201d in Python, the CSV Reader icon will do this task in KNIME.", "One good thing that I really like for KNIME is that it allows the users to model parameter tuning, so it can help beginners to learn how to model really efficiently. Unlike Power BI and Spotfire, the model parameter tuning in KNIME can be customized almost like in R or Python. Although it is not much popular comparing with Python or R, professionals use KNIME in real projects. KNIME also has tons of supporting libraries that you can download, install, and use it like Python or R. A good tutorial to KNIME is given in this youtube link. In addition, their blogs have someone to answers your questions.", "In summary, there are both pros and cons for each software option that you can select. This is purely based on my opinion. Some of their features are really useful for a quick assessment and I\u2019ve used them in real-world projects depending on situations and available time that I have to complete the projects. All of them are worthwhile trying if you have available time. Feel free to let me know if you have any suggestions on this.", "Your home for data science.
