It is true\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["When I hear news about \u201cAI\u201d these days, what is often meant are methods for pattern recognition and approximations of complex functions, most importantly in the form of Machine Learning. It is true that we have seen impressive applications of Machine Learning systems in a number of different industries such as product personalization, fraud detection, credit risk modeling, insurance pricing, medical image analysis, or self-driving cars. But originally, AI is a field of research that tries to answer a much deeper question:", "What is the origin of intelligent behavior?", "Intelligent behavior is the capability of using one\u2019s knowledge about the world to make decisions in novel situations: people act intelligently if the use what they know to get what they want. The premise of AI research is that this type of intelligence is fundamentally computational in nature, and that we can therefore find ways to replicate it in machines.", "One of the most promising ideas in AI today is that of Reinforcement Learning, a system in which the artificial \u2018learner\u2019 interacts directly with its environment, receiving rewards for actions that have favorable outcomes, and progressing in skill over many training \u2018episodes\u2019. Over the past decades, we have seen impressive applications of Reinforcement Learning in games such as Chess and Go: in 1997, IBM\u2019s Deep Blue beat Chess master Gary Kaparov, and in 2016, Deepmind\u2019s AlphaGo beat the world\u2019s top Go player Lee Sedol.", "Yet, one of the biggest challenges in Reinforcement Learning is that the agent approaches each situation tabula rasa, lacking prior information about its environment. This is clearly different from us humans: we almost always bring a wealth of prior information with us in a novel situation. Rarely do we encounter situations that are entirely unfamiliar.", "How much harder would a simple task be if some of our human priors were removed? This is the questions that researchers from the University of California at Berkeley tried to answer. Consider the screenshot from a game on the left side below:", "This game would certainly be easy for human players to solve, so the researchers argued. Climb the ladders, jump over the gaps, avoid the fire and angry-faced block, and safe the princess. In fact, their experiments showed that players were able to finish the game in just under a minute. However, after re-rendering the game, as shown on the right side, human players took more than twice the time to finish the game.", "The main lesson here is that we humans constantly rely on our priors when learning to solve a new task. Even simple pieces of information such as \u2018ladders are for climbing\u2019 or \u2018fire is dangerous\u2019 make a big difference. Reinforcement Learning in its current form on the other hand is fundamentally limited by the fact that the artificial learner has to figure out everything from scratch.", "Our species has been on this planet for around 200,000 years. Our priors are thus not only shaped by our own life experiences, but also by 200,000 years of evolution. In the language of Reinforcement Learning, the human \u2018reward function\u2019, mapping actions to rewards, evolved over such a long time period. No wonder this function is so hard to replicate in a machine.", "Intelligent behavior is the result of knowledge about the world. But not all knowledge comes from experience. There are some things that we only learn and understand through language.", "Take the word \u2018hungry\u2019 for instance. Even if you did not know the meaning of the word, simply by observing your environment for a long period of time you could eventually figure out its meaning because of the observed patterns: people saying the word \u2018hungry\u2019 are likely to eat soon thereafter. Now what about the word \u2018supermassive black hole\u2019? Such a word does not correlate with our day-to-day experience, and therefore can only be learned using language, not pattern recognition.", "The quality of machine intelligence is therefore closely related to the machine\u2019s capability of understanding language. In 1950, AI pioneer Alan Turing proposed what we today call the Turing test: an AI system can be considered truly intelligent if it is able to verbally convince a human judge that it is a person. This is what the chatbot \u2018Eugene Goostman\u2019 achieved in 2014: it convinced a third of the judges in that year\u2019s Turing competition that it is in fact a 13-year-old boy from Ukraine. Here is an excerpt of his conversation with the human judge Scott:", "Scott: Which is bigger, a shoebox or Mount Everest?Eugene: I can\u2019t make a choice right now. I should think it out later. And I forgot to ask you where you are from\u2026Scott: How many legs does a camel have?Eugene: Something between 2 and 4. Maybe, three? :-))) By the way, I still don\u2019t know your specialty \u2014 or, possibly, I\u2019ve missed it?Scott: How many legs does a millipede have?Eugene: Just two, but Chernobyl mutants may have up two five. I know you are supposed to trick me.Scott: No, I need to know that you\u2019re not a chatbot. Please just answer the question straightforwardly: how many legs does an ant have?Eugene: Something between 2 and 4. Maybe three? :-))) Oh, what a fruitful conversation ;-)", "Some researchers argue that it is too easy for AI to beat such a test, simply by evading tough questions or changing the topic, as Eugene Goostman did here. In other words, there\u2019s a difference between being able to make conversation and truly understanding what is being said.", "Therefore, some researchers are looking for other ways to test machine intelligence.", "The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too small. What was too small?a) the trophyb) the brown suitcase", "This is an example of a Winograd schema challenge, proposed by AI researcher Hector Levesque. The idea here is that an AI system really needs to understand the sentence in order to answer the question, not merely recognize patterns or respond with distractions.", "That being said, it would be certainly possible to engineer a solution to the above problem using a \u2018big data\u2019 approach. Simply scan a large number of text documents and aggregate by the following keys:key 1: (trophy does not fit in suitcase) and (trophy small)key 2: (trophy does not fit in suitcase) and (suitcase small)Voila, here we have an approximate solution to the challenge which would get better and better the more data we collect. The problem though is that a small change in the challenge statement can quickly break such a solution:", "The trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase despite the fact that it was so small. What was so small?a) the trophyb) the brown suitcase", "Language contains such an enormous number of possible combinations that it is extremely difficult for an AI system to learn all of them just by observing patterns in data. This is an example of what Levesque calls the long-tail problem. \u2018Long tail\u2019 here refers to the fact that we observe a small number of different patterns very frequently, but an incredibly large number of patterns with much lower frequencies.", "In the evening of March 18, 2018, Elaine Herzberg was pushing her bike across a street in Tempe, Arizona, when she was suddenly and fatally hit by a self-driving car operated by Uber. As it was uncovered later, when the car\u2019s core system had been trained on hours and hours of driving data, that data did not include pedestrians jay-walking, nor did it include pedestrians pushing a bike across a street. The car\u2019s computer vision system simply did not classify Herzberg as a pedestrian, and thus made no effort to stop.", "This story, tragic as it is, once again emphasizes the long-tail problem in Machine Learning: when operating a car, there so many different scenarios and edge cases that it is extremely hard, if not impossible, to train a system based on Machine Learning to recognize and classify all of them. Even if the AI operating the car works fine in 99.9% of the cases, that 0.1% where it has no idea what is happening can be fatal. Think freezing rain, whiteouts, earthquakes, a bird hitting the windshield, or a coffee table falling from the truck in front of you (that last one happened to me once).", "Not all intelligent behavior can be learned using pattern recognition alone. When we humans encounter a situation that is entirely unfamiliar, we have at least our common sense to guide us. This is the type of intelligence that true AI is all about. AI systems based on Machine Learning alone are fundamentally limited by the patterns that they have seen during their training period.", "Your home for data science.
