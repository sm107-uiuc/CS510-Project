Imagine a world where you used Facebook because they delivered the best service, not because you and everyone else you know must be on it. Imagine a world where you knew who was advertising to you, why they were advertising, and who paid for it. Then, imagine a world where you could turn it off.", "The Cambridge Analytica and Facebook data scandal has ignited discussion about data privacy and ownership. Increasingly people are expressing scepticism towards the tech giants, galvanised behind campaigns like #DeleteFacebook. Away from scandal, data access and ethics are vibrant research areas, with open data initiatives and academic data sharing resources increasingly encouraged.", "Yet, while both concerned with access and ownership, these tribes seem to be in conflict. On the one hand, a desire for data privacy involves keeping data locked away. On the other, open data initiatives strive to share data, and are very much opposed to the hoarding of data, whether on a personal or institutional level.", "This conflict is illustrative of the era of data politics that we find ourselves in.", "Data politics may also be described as the political economy of data; who owns data, who controls data, and what should be done with data, when data is integrated as a productive resource. Data politics then is a subset of cybernetics \u2014 the study of power and control of technology is society.", "There are three emerging models of data ownership, all of which require further research and are contained within data politics:", "The problems with laissez faire data ownership are increasingly revealing themselves. Yet, there are problems with data trusts and data commons which \u2014 in turn \u2014 are the advantages of laissez faire.", "The primary issue with data trusts surrounds the question, \u201cwhat is data?\u201d As scholar Lisa Gitelman argues, data only becomes data when it is conceived as such. For example, we all have an age. But when conducting a census, we might want to know the average age of the population. As such, a facet of our being that we all have and always have had (age) is transformed into a data point because we decide it is data.", "This reveals a tension of claims of ownership \u2014 do we own our data because it\u2019s data pertaining to us, or does the person who collects the data own it because they conceived of it as data? Answering this question is of vital importance in a data trust, because it determines how the trust should be build, and who the trustees serve.", "A data trust that combines the private data monopolies of big tech and allows them to entrench their position in the market will do little but exacerbate the problems currently seen within our laissez faire model.", "Instead, we might construct a data trust that considers the people who create the data (us) as its members and uses this collectively held data monopoly to negotiate terms with big tech. For example, if Facebook wants access to some more of my data, then would have to negotiate with the data trust, who may force Facebook to compensate me for providing them with my data.", "The problem with this model is it potentially stifles innovation, creating data costs for new tech firms to access data. It also stifles consumers who may want to use a service but may find the service isn\u2019t approved by the data trust. This is a problem the laissez faire model easily solves.", "Data commons rely on the principle of collective transparency, which broadly holds that you may gain unrestricted access to data provided you provide that same access to someone else. Collective transparency will appear as a jarring proposition to some, especially those whose core objection to laissez faire ownership is a lack of privacy. Indeed, collective transparency may be accused of capitulating to Sun Microsystems CEO Scott McNealy\u2019s famous quote, \u201cyou have no privacy anyway \u2014 get over it.\u201d", "Retaining privacy is a major challenge facing data commons. In our current data climate, the principle of a, \u201cright to a copy,\u201d is appealing, but the notion of revealing that copy \u2014 and undermining the sense of control the copy brings \u2014 is less so. Privacy is just one problem that emerges from what I would call a centralised data common; others include ensuring the data that is provided is genuine and up-to-date, and ensuring users of that data are accountable for their actions, to avoid what economists call the tragedy of the commons.", "One solution to these problems may be integrating blockchain technology, creating a decentralised data common. Along with the right to a copy, data creators could be provided with a unique data code which de-anonymises their data. All copies would be stored on a blockchain, and a standard procedure when signing up for a new service would be to provide the data code. Thus, all our data would be freely accessible to anyone, but we would only be identifiable to those we choose (anonymous data would also be freely available, primarily for the interest of researchers). Furthermore, the blockchain would keep a record of who was accessing the common and how often, while changes to the common could be validated by comparing blockchains.", "This is not a panacea, however. A decentralised data common would require vast infrastructure, while all data commons would require a significant change in attitude. There\u2019s also the issue of democratic oversight: whatever institution runs the central repository would certainly have to be supranational, and it remains unclear who would fund, structure and regulate such a body.", "Data ownership mirrors the labour market and has much to learn from it. Right now, many people feel they\u2019re getting a poor deal \u2014 opaque monopolies, pervasive advertising, and reduced sovereignty. When such practices are seen in the labour market, there are calls for unionisation, if not revolution. These calls are met, however, only when there are institutions in place to enable them.", "The future of the data ownership debate, therefore, is a deeply political one. What institutions do we want? What do we need? Is data an individual commodity? Is it a collective good? If data is valuable, shouldn\u2019t we receive a cut? These are questions we will hear ever more in the proceeding months and years, and they don\u2019t have simple answers. But as we acknowledge the digital revolution that is taking place, and how it is disrupting the flow of our lives, we should ask them.", "For a longer discussion of the ideas presented in this article, see my paper \u2018Who Owns the Future\u2019, accessible here.", "Your home for data science.
