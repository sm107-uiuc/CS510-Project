It\u2019s good news though that companies are working towards narrowing this gap. What\u2019s even more, recent legislations are putting companies under pressure to reveal their pay gaps and start taking active measures. People analytics gives insight into talent stats that helps companies identify where they are falling short with equal workplace opportunities.", "Nestl\u00e9, the world\u2019s largest food and beverage company with over 2,000 brands, is a great example of how a global company should actively work on providing diversity and inclusion in the workplace through people analytics.", "Andr\u00e9 Bezemer, People Analytics Manager at Nestl\u00e9, took the stage to present Nestl\u00e9\u2019s advocacy and initiatives for gender workplace equality through people analytics at the Nordic People Analytics Summit last year.", "\u201cIf you ask our CEO [about gender equality], it\u2019s very simple, it\u2019s the right thing to do. Everybody deserves equal opportunity whether in the gender space, in LGBT space, etc,\u201d states Andr\u00e9. To support their beliefs, Nestl\u00e9 has signed an ILO (International Labour Organization) Pledge that shows their commitment to equality, diversity and equal pay. Besides that, since last year, they\u2019ve started monitoring gender pay and equal pay across the whole Group and beyond local legislation to make sure all gaps are identified and addressed.", "But once all officialities are done and you have committed to paying men and women equally, you have to actually deliver. So Nestl\u00e9 decided to look inwards and see whether they actually pay women and men the same, and if not, how to amend that.", "Before Andr\u00e9 continues to explain Nestl\u00e9\u2019s approach, he makes a clear distinction as to the meaning of the terms \u201cequal pay\u201d and \u201cgender pay gap\u201d. Gender pay gap refers to the average of all men in the company compared to the average of all women in it. Whereas equal pay means a man and a woman being paid the same for the same work.", "As they are working across multiple markets, Nestl\u00e9 established principles for people analytics that would be upheld by all division across the world:", "The tricky part with people analytics is that the analysis is done locally and problems arise when comparing two different markets, states Andr\u00e9. Hence, they are focused on developing a local approach that they can compare between markets on a global level. The main objective is to discover if there are certain outliers in certain markets or if there are entire groups of the workforce with large pay differences that need to be addressed.", "If you want to move the needle [in gender balance], you have to make sure that you have sufficient women identified to take senior roles.", "As we mentioned previously, the gender pay gap is easy to calculate \u2014 it\u2019s the difference between the average pay for men and the average pay for women. But calculating whether they pay equally men and women for the same work is a bit more complicated. Nestl\u00e9 uses a standard model that takes into account several variables such as age, grade, function and talent rising, and then calculates whether all these correlate to gender with pay as an outcome.", "What they discovered as an outcome is that women on average earn 1.013 times what men earn. The result is good, but the important thing is what they actually do with it and the subsequent actions they drive off that, emphasises Andr\u00e9.", "If the inequality case refers to individual persons that for e.g. are lagging behind with salary, the issue is addressed relatively easily. But if a bigger part of the workforce is concerned, it requires a much more systematic and structural approach to fix the gap, Andr\u00e9 asserts, such as adjusting skill gap or policy that affects that particular workforce. Again the crucial thing is to get the insight that a gap exists and define an action plan within the market to start closing that pay gap.", "As much as offering diversity and inclusion in the company, it\u2019s that much more important to standardise how the insights are presented and make them easily accessible because as Andr\u00e9 points out. They discovered that a lot of people didn\u2019t have access to the data or many misunderstandings had arisen when looking at data when a company operates across the whole planet, as Nestl\u00e9 does. For example, attrition is not the same everywhere", "So they discovered that there is an urgent need to standardise a comprehensive set of metrics:", "One critical metric is succession, Andr\u00e9 explains, because in Nestl\u00e9 the higher the company ladder you go, the rate of external hires decreases and the number of females gets more narrow, as is the case with most of the other companies. At a C-Suite level, their internal movement ratio is 94%, which Andr\u00e9 admits it\u2019s not a great number because hiring externally is one way to increase the gender balance.", "One solution to this is a succession plan based on insights on succession metrics so different divisions can devise a strategy on how to develop and prepare women for these roles.", "The succession and other metrics are available in Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global D&I Dashboard, which is globally accessible to all stakeholders in the company. And it\u2019s completely in accordance with GDPR and all individual data is protected.", "Nestl\u00e9\u2019s Global D&I Dashboard also provides them with insight into gender balance holders vs. successors, meaning the ratio of women in every level in the company vs. the ratio of women who are equipped with knowledge and skills to succeed to senior roles. \u201cBecause if you want to move the needle [in gender balance], you have to make sure that you have sufficient women identified to take those roles\u201d, emphasises Andr\u00e9. The dashboard data allows them to take concrete measures to address the gender gap and create a succession plan. In the case where a vacant job needs to be filled and there are no females on the list, or they are potential female candidates but they will be ready for the position in 3\u20135 or more years, they start driving the agenda to prepare them for succession on a more senior role. That also means preparing the executives for challenging conversations and openness to accept change. And the dashboard insights have been helpful for the people analytics department in these challenging conversations, concludes Andr\u00e9.", "Originally published at Hyperight.com on September 19, 2019.", "Your home for data science.
