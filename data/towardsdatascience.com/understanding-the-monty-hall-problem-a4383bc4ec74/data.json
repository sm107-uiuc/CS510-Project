It\u2019s also one where when I first heard the answer, I just couldn\u2019t wrap my head around it. Have you ever had something explained to you and it sort of makes sense to you rationally, and yet your intuition keeps shouting, \u201cThis cannot be!\u201d Well, that\u2019s how I felt when I first learned the solution.", "Since we are currently sheltering in place in San Francisco (due to the ongoing pandemic), I have a lot of time to think, read, and write. So today I decided I will finally fully understand the Monty Hall Problem.", "\u201cSuppose you\u2019re on a game show, and you\u2019re given the choice of three doors: Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door, say No. 1, and the host, who knows what\u2019s behind the doors, opens another door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \u201cDo you want to pick door No. 2?\u201d Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?\u201d", "Spoiler alert: the answer is that, yes we do want to switch. But why, and how much does our probability of getting the car increase if we do make the switch? Let\u2019s find out.", "This problem is designed to tease the brain, even for people trained in probability. It wants you to get lost in the probabilities until you just give up and say, \u201cAren\u2019t they both the same?\u201d", "One non-mathematical and relatively simple way to arrive at the correct answer is to use the following line of reasoning:", "So the correct answer is to definitely choose again. But the actual correct answer is to pick the other door \u2014 the door that is not the one that you initially chose. Then your probability of landing the car goes up to 2/3!", "I coded up a simulator in Python for the Monty Hall Problem (you can find my code here). When I ran it 900,000 times and then stared at the results really hard, I realized what\u2019s going on.", "Here are the results if you do not change your door selection after the host opens one of the doors with a goat behind it. It is as expected \u2014 in 1/3 of the simulations, you get lucky and choose the correct door.", "Obviously if you have a 1/3 chance of choosing the right door, then it follows that you have a 2/3 chance of choosing the wrong door. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice to flip the odds? But the only way to do that would be if we got to choose 2 doors right?", "Well what if I told you that by switching your door selection after the host opens one, you are effectively choosing 2 doors? Sounds too good to be true right? But that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening. It\u2019s easier to see why if we invert the situation.", "Let\u2019s think about how we could lose if we decide to flip our door pick. In this case, we lose if our initial pick was the correct one. That\u2019s because by opening a wrong door (one with a goat), the host is effectively giving us a free guess. And then we can complete the reversal of our initial decision by flipping our original pick. Our initial pick will be correct 1/3 of the time \u2014 and since we\u2019ve now taken the other side of our initial pick, we get the car 2/3 of the time.", "A more intuitive way to visualize this is to recast the Monty Hall Problem as a slightly different game. Imagine instead that you are playing against 2 other players. All 3 of you are randomly assigned a different door and you get to keep what\u2019s behind the door that you\u2019re assigned.", "Now right before you open the door the host comes to you and says:", "I will give you a choice. Either you can keep what is behind your door OR you can keep what\u2019s behind the doors of your opponents. And yes both of them!", "Would you take that deal? I definitely would. Your two opponents get to open one door each (a total of 2 doors), so there is a 2/3 chance that they will get the car. That\u2019s better than your 1/3 chance if you stay with your current door and worst comes to worst, you\u2019ll end up with 2 new pet goats.", "By choosing to switch your door pick in the Monty Hall Problem, you are effectively choosing your opponent\u2019s doors (one opened by the host and the other by you after you\u2019ve decided to reverse yourself).", "We can see this in the simulated results:", "Let\u2019s go through the first 2 rows of the table to make sure you know what is going on. In the first row, we picked door 1. Then the host opens either door 2 or 3 and reveals a goat. We choose whichever of the doors that he did not open and we get a goat as well (because our initial selection was correct and the car was behind door 1). Too bad!", "In the second row, we again pick door 1. But this time, the car is behind door 2. Knowing this, the host can only open door 3, otherwise he would reveal the car to us! Finally, we switch to door 2, open it, and get a brand new car!", "In our 900,000 simulations, we are now winning the car in 600,000 of them (if we switch), a probability of 2/3 exactly like we reasoned above.", "Hope you enjoyed this and found it insightful. I plan to explore more probability and statistics brain teasers in the days ahead. Cheers and stay healthy everyone!", "Your home for data science.
