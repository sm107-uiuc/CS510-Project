It is all about this \u2018unconventional hero\u2019 whose capabilities are profound among data scientists, but\u2026 this is also the case! Oftentimes, no much attention is paid to their nature and hurrying through them, ends up with invalid conclusions and faulty analyses. For example:", "\u2018Fantasy Corp\u2019 hires and in an effort to attract personnel, it\u2019s about to publish in a Sunday newspaper column its employees perks. Given the following perks\u2019 distribution, what are the \u2018average\u2019 perks, the journalist should address in the column?", "(*) indicates the number of perks an employee enjoys (1: laptop, 2: laptop+car, etc)", "If you just answered 2.75 (or else: 22/8), please take this map and let me guide you through the rest of this journey \u2014 a travelog dedicated to variables.", "This article intends to develop a strategic narrative, data scientists may listen to and then hark back to variables\u2019 principles. That way, we aim to:", "(a) Re-introduce ourselves to the most common types of Variables", "(b) Develop a guide to contextually follow, concerning the Metrics and Plots selected, on every case", "(c) Learn to Communicate the variable-driven conclusions, in a more fluent and effective way", "To do so, we are going to investigate variables through different lenses; their Nature and their Scale of Measurement.", "Variables in statistics can generally describe either quantities or qualities. In this context, we distinguish two broad categories [1]:", "\ud83d\udd38 Qualitative (Categorical) Variables: They describe a quality [what or how something is] and can\u2019t be counted. They are expressed by either real numbers or words. Examples: team, color, zip-code.", "\ud83d\udd38 Quantitative Variables: Another broad category which describes a quantity [how much there is of something]. Apparently, it is expressed by numerical values. Examples: height, age, time.", "This concept refers to a system of rules which defines how a variable is measured. There are four scales of measurement: nominal, ordinal, interval and ratio [2]. Each of them is assessed by its capability to clarify:", "\ud83d\udd38 Nominal: They refer to qualitative variables, which can tell whether two individuals are different or not, but can\u2019t define the direction and size of that difference. Example: Name (Mark is different than John, but it is pointless to set any priority between them).", "\ud83d\udd38 Ordinal: Specific to quantitative variables and capable to tell whether two individuals are different or not and that difference\u2019s direction, as well. They are incapable, though, to tell the size of the difference. Example: Ranks of runners (the winner is different than the 2nd runner and obviously she comes first).", "\ud83d\udd38 Interval*: This category is specific to quantitative variables and can define the difference of two individuals, its size and direction. The zero point (when the variable\u2019s value is 0) doesn\u2019t mean the absence of a quantity, which makes it impossible to measure the difference between individuals in terms of ratios. Example: Temperature in Fahrenheit (0.0 Fahrenheit does not mean absence of heat).", "\ud83d\udd38 Ratio*: Specific to quantitative variables and capable to explain whether two individuals are different, that difference\u2019s size and direction. Also, the zero point declares the absence of a quantity and that makes it feasible to measure the difference between individuals in terms of ratios. Example: Temperature in Kelvin (0.0 Kelvin really means \u2018no heat\u2019).", "(*) Interval and Ratio variables, can further be divided into 2 sub-categories:", "\ud83d\udd38 Discrete: There is no possible intermediate value between any two adjacent values, meaning that these variables can only get a certain number of values [3]. Example: number of bedrooms", "\ud83d\udd38 Continuous: There is an infinity of values between any two values. Example: Weight", "Many times, in order to describe and process a distribution, we need to summarise it in one or more values (metrics). The most frequently used is the Average, whose content reflects the central or typical value of a probability distribution; a notion deriving from the measures of Central Tendency [4].", "Among those measures, we distinguish the (Weighted) Mean, the Median and the Mode. Each of them is calculated differently and forms an appropriate solution for different cases.", "\ud83d\udd38 Mean: It is the \u2018balance\u2019 point of a distribution, meaning that the total distance of the distribution values that are lower than it (Mean), equals the respective one of those values that are higher than that. It takes into account equally every distribution value (vulnerable to changes) and comprises a good metric for Interval and Ratio data.", "Nevertheless, when dealing with an open-ended distribution (i.e. the upper boundary is \u201c100 or more\u201d), we cannot calculate it. Instead, the Median is more meaningful to be used. Additionally, when dealing with Ordinal data, it is kind of contentious to use the Mean [2]. In such a case, the Median is a good choice and the Mode a better one.", "The same applies to the Weighted Mean, in the case of which the data points bear different weights.", "\ud83d\udd38 Median: It is the middle value of a sorted distribution and unlike the Mean, it is resistant to changes (considers the middle or two middle values). Obviously, it constitutes a robust statistic, ideal for summarising either numerical distributions that have outliers or open-ended ones. Furthermore, it is a good choice for summarising Ordinal data.", "The drawback here relies on its incapability to process Nominal and Ordinal data when the latter are not encoded with numbers.", "\ud83d\udd38 Mode: It is the most frequent value in the distribution. As a result, it\u2019s an ideal metric for Nominal, Ordinal (especially when the values are represented using words) and Discrete data (when we need to communicate the average value to a non-technical audience).", "In the case of Continuous variables, it\u2019s not an all-set solution; we first need to create grouped frequency tables and then calculate it.", "In a nutshell, you can use the following Table:", "(*) Another interesting direction is to inspect the Variability, but this supersedes the current article\u2019s scope.", "Depending on the scale of measurement each variable type is attributed with, a number of specific plots can be used to better depict the underlying conclusions [5].", "\ud83d\udd38 Nominal & Ordinal: For those cases of frequency distributions, Bar Plots (either vertical or horizontal) and Pie Charts are recommended.", "\ud83d\udd38 Interval & Ratio: Frequency distributions of those variable types, may be effectively visualised by Histograms or Kernel Density Plots (KDE). Box & Whisker Plots is another interesting option for comparing different distributions, especially when we process Continuous variables.", "To sum up, Table 2 illustrates the recommended plot per measurement scale:", "Returning to the introductory example, we can easily understand that perks are a Quantitative variable. In addition, it belongs to the Ordinal measurement scale, albeit it is encoded with numbers (we can\u2019t tell the size of the difference between Employee A and B). Further to that, it constitutes a Discrete variable.", "Consequently, since the newspaper\u2019s audience may include non-technical people, the Mean (3.14) wouldn\u2019t make much sense for the regular reader, who expects the number of perks to be an integer. The same applies to the Median (2.5). The Mode, on the other side, is a safer choice for cases like this, as it guarantees a whole number from the distribution. So, reporting this result, the journalist should avoid technical jargon (like \u201cmode\u201d, \u201cvariable\u201d etc) and simply say that a \u2018Fantasy Corp\u2019 employee typically/on average enjoys 5 perks.", "In practice, many people avoid engaging with the theoretical hurdles, ending up to inspect variables \u2018on the fly\u2019. In the context of that, they either select wrong metrics (i.e. matching exclusively the \u2018average\u2019 to the Mean) and plots or come to erroneous conclusions.", "Taking a closer look at what each variable stands for \u2014 its nature \u2014 can reinforce our analysis. In addition, perceiving the way it is measured, may foster better metrics and visualisations selections. Howbeit, we should not feel constrained to choose one metric or the other, but make our selections wisely on a vis-\u00e0-vis basis.", "This time our journey had no coding action, neither any of those fancy concepts of Machine Learning, NLP etc. Much as we like them, we should always pay our respects to that fundamental \u2018Totem\u2019 of variables, just because it constitutes the trailhead towards Data Science\u2026 Besides, as per another Benjamin Disraeli\u2019s quote:", "\u201cWhen I want to read a novel, I write one\u201d.", "Which essentially means, if we cannot write and solidify valid statistical conclusions, noway are we able to effectively communicate them\u2026", "As always, thank you very much for reading!", "[2] S.
