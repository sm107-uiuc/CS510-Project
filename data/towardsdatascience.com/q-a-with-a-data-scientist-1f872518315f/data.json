In this context, I did an interview/Q&A session on various Data Science related topics a few weeks ago.", "As part of this initiative, I thought I could also share the video recordings, as well as the transcripts of my conversation on these topics for those interested. The Q&A session covers topics such as my transition from Physics to Data Science, what working as a Data Scientist is all about as well as many other aspects of working within this domain.", "Transcript: Hello everyone! I\u2019m Vegard, and I currently work as the Lead Data Scientist in a software company called Axbit. In addition to that I also have a part-time position as an Associate Professor in machine learning at Molde university college. Today I am happy to answer a couple of questions related to data science, what data science is all about and how working within this field is like.", "Transcript: How did I become a data scientist? First of all, I think my background is probably a bit different compared to a lot of other data scientists. My career started in the oil and gas industry back in 2004. Back then I was working as an automation technician on an oil rig, working with things like process control, instrumentation, electronics and various kinds of sensor data. After doing that for a couple of years, I decided to go back to school and ended up with a master\u2019s and a PhD in physics.", "But, how then do you go from a degree in physics to working as a data scientist? In my case, this happened sort of by coincidence. Towards the end of my PhD, my research interest started to shift towards neuroscience, trying to understand how our brain process information. The topic of my PhD was on nano-physics, but one research topic we were working on was how you can use information about how the brain process information, and then try to replicate that using various nanoscale building blocks to build an \u201c artificial brain\u201d. (You can also read more about this in the following article).", "This was sort of my path into becoming interested in things like artificial intelligence, machine learning, neural networks and all these cool buzz words. After my PhD, I briefly worked as a researcher in computational neuroscience, before Idecided to go back to industry. Since then, I have been working with applied data science and machine learning within many different domains such as oil and gas, energy, aquaculture, basically any domain where extracting information from data is important.", "Transcript: Trying to understand what data science is all about, and what kind of skills you need to be a good data scientist, is not really an easy question to answer. This also depends on what kind of company you work for and whether it\u2019s a small startup or a large corporation. You might have heard that to be a good data scientist you need expert knowledge within quite different domains such as statistics or mathematics, programming skills, computer science, visualization, software engineering and so on\u2026 Having expert knowledge within all these different domains is not that easy. This rare breed of \u201cmagic unicorn data scientist\u201d which can do everything, is probably not representative of what most of us actually do. In order to build good data science projects, you probably rather need a team of people with complementary backgrounds. Someone with a data science background, someone with software engineering skills etc., and then combine this to actually build good solutions.", "When it comes to what kind of skills or personality traits make up a good data scientist, I would probably put an emphasis on being curious. In my opinion, data science is all about using the scientific method in order to extract information from data. So, in order to extract knowledge from data you need to be curious. You need this drive to understand what\u2019s the underlying process that generates this data and what kind of knowledge can we extract from this.", "I think that\u2019s also one of the skills I found most useful from my background in physics, which perhaps doesn\u2019t sound very much like data science. But, there\u2019s actually a lot of things in common between. During my background in physics, we used algorithms and computers in order to crunch data and extract meaningful information, and trying to understand the world through these observations. That\u2019s also to a large extent what data science is all about. Analyzing data, extracting information and then making some kind of predictions which in the end (hopefully) end up being useful. So, in my experience, perhaps the most important skills that I\u2019ve gained through my background is to be curious. I like to solve problems, I like to understand things, and that\u2019s definitely something I found useful working as a data scientist as well.", "Transcript : When it comes to the data science workflow, there\u2019s actually a lot of steps going all the way from having the initial idea of what kind of problem you would like to solve, until you have the final solution. The first step, which in my opinion is crucial, is to start by identifying the right business case. You also need access to someone with domain knowledge about the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. This will help you identify whether this problem is actually worth solving, and that the solution you\u2019re trying to develop actually has some some real value for the end user. That is a crucial fist step, as there is no point building a fancy machine learning model if this doesn\u2019t give any return in form of information or value to the user.", "When it comes to all these steps you need to go through, the most important (and in my experience also the most labor intensive part) is actually getting access to data, and cleaning/transforming it to a format where you can actually start exploring it. In a typical project this might take up most of your time. Once you\u2019ve done this part, the path forward also depends on what kind of solution you\u2019re trying to develop. Is it some kind of dashboard visualization, or is it a online prediction model which needs to be serving on real-time data flowing from various sources? These choices will have a large impact on the workflow going forward, as well as the necessary steps to obtain the final solution.", "In any case, when it comes to all these steps, which one do I find the most interesting? In my case I would say that this is probably the phase where you have been able to gather up all your data, and now you\u2019re ready to start exploring. So, starting to ask the right questions, exploring what kind of knowledge can we actually extract, and what kind of problems does this help us to solve? In my opinion, this curiosity driven data exploration phase is probably the most intriguing one. It is also one which also helps me get a better grasp of what\u2019s the best way going forward with this data.", "Transcript: One interesting project I was working on some time ago was in collaboration with a company called \u201cNofence\u201d. So, what they develop is an internet of things (or in this case actually \u201cinternet of goats\u201d) solution where they have this GPS collar worn by the goats when they\u2019re out grazing. This collar then tracks their movement patterns through GPS location and accelerometer data. What we wanted to do here, was to see whether we could extract some some useful information from all this data, which could then tell us something about the health and well-being of the goats.", "This is actually quite similar to something which is probably well known to many of you with, which is these smart watches many of us now have. They essentially track our behavior trough things like heart rate, movement patterns or sleep cycles and then tries to make predictions on our health and well-being. So, this is essentially what we wanted to do for the goats as well.", "As an example, let\u2019s say your your goat is out grazing on the field and it accidentally hurts its foots. Of course, being able to detect these kind of events and then alert the farmer that the goat has been hurt is very useful information. This is useful both from the financial point of view, that you can take better care of your goats, but also from an animal welfare perspective.", "More specifically, what we did in this project was to analyze GPS and accelerometer data through unsupervised learning. These data represents a time series, where you have all these points of data accumulated over time. This means you also have information about things like time of day, if it\u2019s in the middle of night or during day time. You can then start to cluster these data to identify different movement patterns and how they change throughout the day, which in turn can tell you something about the well-being of the goats.", "This was a very interesting project from a technological point of view, analyzing IoT data from goats, but I think it\u2019s also a nice example of how we can use technology for a good cause to improve animal welfare. At least for me, from a personal point of view, working on this project was very rewarding in that sense.", "Transcript: Predicting what the future of data science is going to look like, given how much has really happened during the last 10 years, is not really an easy task. But, if we start by looking back, one of the key drivers which has driven the progress within data science and machine learning forward is the access to vast amounts of data. That is a key factor I think will continue to grow also in the future, with all these connected devices through the internet of things (and increasingly the industrial internet of things). I think we\u2019ll see more and more connected devices, which shares information and data all across them. Of course, this also gives us new opportunities to harness these data to extract what is (hopefully) useful information.", "Another key factor has been the advancement in computing power, and that\u2019s also something I think will continue at least a few years into the future. So, let\u2019s say 10-15 years ago you might need a super computing facility to solve your problem. Whereas now, to obtain essentially the same amount of computing power, you can just buy a decent gaming computer for a few thousand dollars.", "Yet another important contribution has been through tech giants such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Amazon etc. They\u2019re actually quite open and sharing the results of their research, open sourcing models and making tools available for us as users. This has made a big impact on how much personnel and resources you need to build state-of-the-art solutions. Rather than creating everything from scratch, you can take advantage of what\u2019s been done before by these tech giants. You can then build upon that and adapt it to your domain in order to build really good solutions with limited amount of resources. This makes it possible even for very small companies to develop very impressive machine learning solutions for their specific domains.", "Going forward, I also think we\u2019ll see more and more automation of tasks like building machine learning models. You might have heard of this trend with \u201cAutoML\u201d, where you have automated software which builds machine learning models for you. This is also followed by statements that it is going to replace Data Scientists, taking away our jobs etc. I am not that worried that we\u2019re going to lose our jobs because of \u201cAutoML\u201d. However, I think there\u2019s going to be a bit of a change in what kind of task we typically perform, and what we spend the most amount of our time doing.", "While tasks which is possible to automate will probably be automated by software, we should rather keep our focus on the tasks which we are better at solving. In my experience, the most important part of a successful data science project is not about the machine learning models or the data analysis in itself. It\u2019s rather about understanding the domain of the problem you\u2019re trying to solve, asking the right questions and identifying the right use-cases. This will help you build solutions that give real value, instead of just building an impressive solution from a technology perspective.", "When it comes down to what kind of skills i think will be most important in the future, in my experience the most crucial skill which cannot be automated is the \u201cscientist\u201d aspect of data science. Using the scientific method, being skeptical to what the data is telling you and asking the right questions. These are probably not tasks that are going to be automated, at least not quite yet.", "In case you are interested in learning more about topics related to AI/Machine Learning and Data Science, you can also have a look at some of the other articles I have written. You will find all of them listed on my medium author profile, which you can find here.", "I also discuss various topics related to AI/machine learning in the workshop presentation below: \u201c From hype to real-world applications\u201d.
