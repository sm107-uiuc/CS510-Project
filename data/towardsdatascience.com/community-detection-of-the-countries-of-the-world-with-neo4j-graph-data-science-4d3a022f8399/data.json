Well, maybe also try to draw an acrylic painting, but I won\u2019t bore you with that. If this is the first time you have heard of the GDS library, I can recommend some of my previous blog posts that try to explain the basics:", "If you are ready, it\u2019s time to put on our graph data science hat and get down to business.", "We will be using the Countries of the world dataset made available on Kaggle by Fernando Lasso. Looking at the acknowledgements, the data originates from the CIA\u2019s World Factbook. Unfortunately, the contributor did not provide the year the dataset was compiled. My guess is the year 2013, but I might be wrong. The dataset contains various metrics like area size, population, infant mortality, and more about 227 countries of the world.", "The graph schema consists of nodes labeled Country that have their features stored as properties. A Country is also a part of a Region.", "First, we need to download the dataset and copy it to the $Neo4j/import folder. For some reason, the numbers in the CSV file use a comma as a floating point instead of a dot (0,1 instead of 0.1). We need to preprocess the data to be able to cast the numbers to float in Neo4j. With the help of an APOC procedure apoc.cypher.run , we can preprocess and store the data in a single cypher query. apoc.cypher.run allows us to run independent subqueries within the main cypher query and is excellent for various use cases.", "Another useful APOC procedure is apoc.meta.nodeTypeProperties. With it, we can examine the node property schema of the graph. We will use it to identify how many missing values each feature of the country has.", "It looks like we don\u2019t have many missing values. However, we will disregard features with more than four missing values from our further analysis for the sake of simplicity.", "High correlation filter is a simple data dimensionality reduction technique. Features with high correlation are likely to carry similar information and are more linearly dependant. Using multiple features with related information can bring down the performance of various models and can be avoided by dropping one of the two correlating features.", "Interesting to see that birth rate and infant mortality are very correlated. The death rate is also quite correlated with infant mortality, so we will drop the birth and death rate but keep the infant mortality. The number of phones and net migration seems to be correlated with the GDP. We will drop them both as well and keep the GDP. We will also cut the population and retain both the area and population density, which carry similar information.", "At this point, we are left with eight features. We will examine their distributions with the apoc.agg.statistics function. It calculates numeric statistics such as minimum, maximum, and percentile ranks for a collection of values.", "The Federated state of Micronesia has the ratio of coast to area at 870, which is pretty impressive. On the other hand, there are a total of 44 countries in the world with zero coastlines. Another fun fact is that Greenland has a population density rounded to 0 per square mile with its 56361 inhabitants and 2166086 square miles. It might be a cool place to perform social distancing.", "We can observe that most of the features appear to be descriptive, except for the Other (%), which is mostly between 80 and 100. Due to the low variance, we will ignore it in our further analysis.", "We are left with seven features that we are going to use to infer a similarity network between countries. One thing we need to do before that is to populate the missing values. We will use a simple method and fill in the missing values of the features with the average value of the region the country is part of.", "Last but not least, we have to normalize our features to prevent any single feature dominating over others due to a larger scale. We will use the simple MinMax method of normalization to rescale features between 0 and 1.", "We have finished the data preprocessing and can focus on the data analysis part. The first step of the analysis is to infer a similarity network with the help of the cosine similarity algorithm. We build a vector for each country based on the selected features and compare the cosine similarity between each pair of countries. If the similarity is above the predefined threshold, we store back the results in the form of a relationship between the pair of similar nodes. Defining an optimal threshold is a mix of art and science, and you\u2019ll get better with practice. Ideally, you want to infer a sparse graph as community detection algorithms do not perform well on complete or dense graphs. In this example, we will use the similarityCutoff value of 0.8 (range between -1 and 1). Alongside the similarity threshold, we will also use the topK parameter to store only the top 10 similar neighbors. We do this to ensure a sparser graph.", "With Neo4j\u2019s Graph Data Science library, we can run more than 30 different graph algorithms directly in Neo4j. Algorithms are exposed as cypher procedures, similar to the APOC procedures we\u2019ve seen above.", "GDS uses a projection of the stored graph, that is entirely in-memory to achieve faster execution times. We can project a view of the stored graph utilizing the gdn.graph.create procedure. For more details on the GDS graph projection, check out my previous blog post. In this example, we will project nodes that have a label Country and relationships with a type SIMILAR.", "More often than not, we start the graph analysis with the weakly connected components algorithm. It is a community detection algorithm used to find disconnected networks or islands within our graph. As we are only interested in the count of disconnected components, we can run the stats variant of the algorithm.", "The algorithm found only a single component within our graph. This is a favorable outcome as disconnected islands can skew the results of various other graph algorithms.", "Another community detection algorithm is the Louvain algorithm. In basic terms, densely connected nodes are more likely to form a community. It relies on the modularity optimization to extract communities. The modularity optimization is performed in two steps. The first step involves optimizing the modularity locally. In the second step, it aggregates nodes belonging to the same community into a single node and builds a new network from those aggregated nodes. These two steps are repeated iteratively until a maximum of modularity is attained. A subtle side effect of these iterations is that we can take a look at the community structure at the end of each iteration, hence the Louvain algorithm is regarded as a hierarchical community detection algorithm. To include hierarchical community results, we must set the includeIntermediateCommunities parameter value to true.", "We can observe by the ranLevels value that the Louvain algorithm found two levels of communities in our network. On the final level, it found eight groups. We can now examine the extracted communities of the last level and compare their feature averages.", "Louvain algorithm found eight distinct communities within the similarity network. The biggest group has 51 countries as members and has the largest average GDP at almost 22 thousand dollars. They are second in infant mortality and the coastline ratio but lead in population density by a large margin. There are two communities with an average GDP of around 20 thousand dollars, and then we can observe a steep drop to 7000 dollars in third place. With the decline in GDP, we can also find the rise of infant mortality almost linearly. Another fascinating insight is that most of the more impoverished communities have little to no coastline.", "We can assess the top representatives of the final level communities with the PageRank algorithm. If we assume that each SIMILAR relationship is a vote of similarity between countries, the PageRank algorithm will assign the highest score to the most similar countries within the community. We will execute the PageRank algorithm for each community separately and consider only nodes and relationships within the given community. This can be easily achieved with cypher projection without any additional transformations.", "Excellent visualization is worth more than a thousand words. Gephi is a great tool to create network visualizations. As we might expect by now, APOC offers a handy procedure apoc.gephi.add that seamlessly streams network data from Neo4j to Gephi. Find out more in the documentation or in my previous blog post.", "As we observed before, there are eight distinct communities in our network. The community with the highest average GDP is in the top right corner, and the countries with the highest to lowest average GDP follow in the clockwise direction. One intriguing triangle I found is right in the middle of the visualization formed by Russia, China, and Brazil. Also, if you look closely, you will see that Panama is part of the red community, but is positioned in the middle. That is because it has similar relationships to one or two countries from most of the communities, but is related to three countries from the red community, and hence belongs to it.", "We mentioned before that the Louvain algorithm can be used to find hierarchical communities with the includeIntermediateCommunities parameter and that in our example, it found two levels of communities. We will now examine the groups of countries on the first level. A rule of thumb is that communities on a lower level will be more granular and smaller.", "As expected, there are almost twice as many communities on the first level compared to the second and final level. An exciting community formed in second place by the average GDP. It contains only five countries, which are quite tiny as their average area size is only 364 square miles. On the other hand, they have a very high population density of around 10000 people per square mile. Example members are Macau, Monaco, and Hong Kong.", "Another excellent tool for network visualization with a higher focus on graph exploration is Neo4j Bloom. It provides the ability to customize the graph perspective and search queries, which can be used by people without any cypher query language skill to explore and search for insights within the graph. If you are interested to learn more, you can check this blog post written by William Lyon.", "We will take a look at the countries of the final community with the highest GDP. It is a community of 51 countries, that has four distinct communities on the first hierarchical level.", "Before, we mentioned an exciting community of five tiny countries with an incredibly high population density. They are colored red in this visualization. The blue community has around 25% higher average GDP and almost half the infant mortality as the yellow one. On the other hand, the yellow community has on average more coastline than the blue one.", "Neo4j ecosystem is well suited to perform and visualize network analysis. Graph Data Science library is a practical addition to the ecosystem that allows us to run various graph algorithms and perform graph analysis without much hassle. You can try it out either on your computer or you can create a Neo4j Sandbox account and get started within minutes.", "As always, the code is available on GitHub.", "Your home for data science.
