A description of how the data was collected and a data dictionary is available on this page.", "The dataset contains 17,880 real-life job ads. Variables within the dataset include:", "It is firstly important to understand how the dataset can be utilized to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent ads as this will govern the type of analytical method will be employed. The response variable which is the binary field \u201cfraudulent\u201d is what we are trying to predict where t = \u201cYes\u201d and f = \u201cNo\u201d.", "We have a set of variables which are not categorized and are essentially HTML strings \u2014 Benefits, Company profile, Description and Requirements. The type of analysis that will be required of textual data is Sentiment & Emotion analysis or Frequency analysis.", "The categorical or factor variables of which there are 11 \u2014 location, company logo, industry, function, salary range, department, required education, required experience, employment type, telecommuting, and questions will be inputs into a machine learning algorithm such as the gradient boosting machine (GBM), distributed random forest (DRF) and generalized linear model (GLMNET) to determine the top predictors that can be used to distinguish between fraudulent and non-fraudulent ads.", "As two analytical approaches will be used \u2014 one for the string variables and the other for the factor variables, there will be two sets of output as follows:", "Some variables do not contribute to any information and as such, they were excluded from the analysis. These include title and in-balanced as title is identifying information and in-balanced is used to include and exclude records to balance the dataset.", "Prior to modelling, a number of steps have to be carried out to cleanse the dataset. The flow diagram below shows the steps that were carried out to prepare the dataset for modelling.", "Word clouds were created for each of the HTML strings \u2014 company profile, job description, requirements and benefits.", "The word clouds below are for company profile for non-fraudulent ads (left) and fraudulent ads (right).", "The word clouds below are for job description for non-fraudulent ads (left) and fraudulent ads (right).", "Below are word clouds for job requirements \u2014 non-fraudulent on the left and fraudulent on the right.", "Finally, the word clouds below are based on the test for job benefits.", "Another way to analyse text is via sentiment analysis, which is type of emotion (positive or negative) associated with each word in text.", "For instance, looking at the emotion categories below for non-fraudulent and fraudulent ads for job requirements, we can see that a greater proportion of non-fraudulent ads (left) are positive (\u201cjoy\u201d, \u201csurprise\u201d), whereas the contrast is true for fraudulent ads (right).", "We can also look at the polarity of these ads that is the orientation towards a specific emotion category, positive or negative. A greater proportion of non-fraudulent ads are positive than fraudulent ads.", "As shown from the examples of word clouds and bar graphs of textual sentiment, we can see that text information is very useful in predicting certain behaviour. The next logical step would be to tag these ads as positive or negative based on their emotion/ polarity and introduce this information as binary variables into a machine learning model for prediction to determine the importance of these variables for prediction.", "For instance, you would create four variables, job requirements, description, benefits and company profile. For each variable, each ad would be assigned a \u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d to signify \u201cpositive\u201d or \u201cnegative\u201d sentiment.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to utilizing the numerical variables in a model for predicting which ads are fraudulent and non-fraudulent.", "It is always good to run a number of different types of models and then select the one or combination of models that provide you not only with the highest accuracy but also meaningful results that can readily be explained to business stakeholders and are likely to be accepted by them.", "For this problem, I ran three types of models:", "Now that you have some understanding of the three types of models, let\u2019s compare their model accuracy.", "The dataset was split into training (80% of dataset) and test (20% of dataset) sets using a random seed where the goal is to train the model on the training set and test its accuracy on the test set.", "The GBM was run with the following parameters where the max depth of the tree was set to 4 (4 levels), a small learn rate, and five fold cross validation.", "Cross-validation is a technique used to validate our training model before we apply it to the test set. By specifying five folds, it means that we build five different models where each model is trained on four parts and tested on the fifth. So, the first model is trained on parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 and tested on 5. The second model is trained on parts 1, 3, 4, and 5 and tested on part 2 and so on.", "This method is called k-fold cross-validation and allows us to be more confident in the performance of the modelling method utilised. When we create five different models, we are testing it on five different/unseen datasets. If we only test the model once, for example, on our test set, then we only have a single evaluation which may be a biased results.", "To measure model accuracy, I used the ROC-AUC metrics. ROC or Receiver Operating Characteristic is a probability curve and the AUC, Area Under Curve, is a measure of the degree of separation between classes. In our case, the AUC is how accurately can the given model distinguish between non-fraudulent and fraudulent ads. The higher the AUC, the more accurate the model is at classifying the ads correctly.", "AUC is made up of a couple of metrics to test model accuracy which are:", "These metrics can then be combined to calculate sensitivity and specificity.", "Sensitivity is a measure of what proportion of fraudulent ads were correctly classified.", "Specificity is a measure of what proportion of non-fraudulent ads were correctly identified.", "When determining which measure is more important for your analysis, ask yourself the question whether it is more important for you to identify the number of correctly classified positives (sensitivity is more important) or negatives (specificity is more important). In our case, we want a model with higher sensitivity as we are more interested in correctly distinguishing fraudulent ads.", "All these metrics can be summarized in a confusion matrix which is a table comparing number of cases that were correctly and incorrectly predicted against the actual number of fraudulent and non-fraudulent cases. This information can be used to supplement our understanding of the ROC and AUC metrics.", "Another aspect of the ROC-AUC metrics is the threshold used to determine whether an ad is fraudulent or non-fraudulent. To determine the best threshold t that maximizes the number of TPs positives, we can use the ROC curve, where we plot the TPR (True Positive Rate) on the y-axis against the FPR (False Positive Rate) on the x-axis.", "The AUC allows for comparison of models where we can compare their ROC curves for model accuracy on the test set as shown in the model output below.", "The table below shows that the DRF produces a model with the highest AUC of 0.962 on the test set. All three models have high AUC values (> 0.5 or random prediction).", "However, let\u2019s dig deeper into what this AUC means in terms of correctly classified ads as fraudulent by looking at the confusion matrix below for the GLM model as an example.", "The confusion matrix for GLM on the test set indicates an error rate of 8.15% in classifying fraudulent cases incorrectly. The sensitivity for this model is 327/(327+29) = 92% which is very good.", "Now, let\u2019s look at the remaining output from the models, more specifically what are the top predictors in classifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent ads.", "The variable importance rank in a classification problem tells us how accurately can a predictor variable classify fraudulent ads over non-fraudulent ads relative to all other predictors that were used int he mode.", "For both (a) GBM and (b) DRF, the top three variables \u2014 location, company logo and industry \u2014 in terms of how useful they are in classifying job ads into fraudulent or non-fraudulent are the same. This is also true for the has questions and telecommuting variables as being least important", "Now, let\u2019s plot the dataset to better understand how the top predictors vary for fraudulent and non-fraudulent ads.", "Let\u2019s look at the top variable, location, where we can see that a greater proportion of fraudulent than non-fraudulent ads are from the USA and Australia as indicated by the circled bars.", "A greater proportion of fraudulent than non-fraudulent ads do not display a company logo in their job ads.", "Now, let\u2019s try to numerically understand the relationship between the predictor variables and the classification of ads.", "As shown in the table below, the highlighted predictors are best at distinguishing fraudulent and non-fraudulent ads.", "Now that you have a good understanding of using both textual and numerical predictors in a classification problem with the employment of both textual analytics tools and machine learning classification algorithms.", "So, what can we do next?", "Predictive model accuracy can be improved by:", "For all the code used to generate results, see my GitHub repository \u2014 https://github.com/shedoesdatascience/fraudanalytics", "Your home for data science.
