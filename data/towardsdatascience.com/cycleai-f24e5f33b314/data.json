Smart cities are looking into being greener, safer and sustainable, fomenting people to take a leap from using cars to bikes or other sustainable methods of transport. Even further, cities are redesigning themselves for the actual pandemics, adding and widening bike lanes to encourage cycling and accommodate more riders.", "At the same time, thousands of people lose their lives on our roads every year. Of these, 70% of all accidents take place in urban areas. Numbers are even more frightening as we consider active users \u2014 cyclists and pedestrians \u2014 alone stand for 50% of the fatalities. How do we expect people to spread the use of bicycles while this happens? The planning and ordering of cities through appropriate infrastructures are urgent, alongside a safe and efficient transport network aimed at active mobility \u2014 both on foot and by bicycle.", "However, managing transportation systems and urban planning is a difficult task. It takes resources, people, time, money, and it is fairly subjective. Or else, let\u2019s put it this way: urbanism is arbitrary, mobility is subjective, accident risk and deaths on the road are real. Why not keep it analytical? We sure want to make planners\u2019 life easier by shaping it more analytical and cost- efficient.", "Generally, our idea consists in creating an AI model to analytically estimate a perceived safety score for every image being analyzed.", "By crowdsourcing, we intend the crowd to label compiled Google Street View images according to their perceived safety and we will rank them according to their perception.", "Once the dataset is complete, the second step would be to detect and recognize objects and structures in the images. By using the most up-to-date object detection (YOLOv5) and image segmentation (PSPNet101) software, this would enable us to detect over 80 categories of objects (people, cars, signs\u2026) and structures (road, sidewalk\u2026) present in the images, their dimensions and location.", "The third step is to train an AI model which would automatically estimate the perceived safety score for a cyclist for any given image.", "Ideally, we will be able to automatically estimate a complete map of cyclist\u2019s perceived safety for an entire country with minimal costs (GSV available in most developed countries). In parallel to this, we intend to develop a software which calculates the safest and shortest route using AI technology: riders may select two points of the nodal net and choose their preferred path based on a multitude of variables. Plus, the user would also have the possibility of taking a photo, input in the website and obtain a score for the image within a few milliseconds.", "Authorities, on the other hand, will be empowered by our integrative urban datasets crossing accident distribution and risk perception, translating data analysis into decision-taking towards greener, safer and more sustainable cities. Building a holistic measure of safety will help them locate unsafe hotspots or spots needing intervention, while working with urban labs on solutions to promote change.", "We will take action on the line, providing web-based solutions. And this is the point where we get advantage in what concerns the viability of the project through space and time. Moreover, if there is an aspect to our idea that buzzes our ears is its transferability, the capacity to broaden our horizons to other places and plans. Based on the continuous web-based crowdsourcing, we will stack ongoing data into our dataset. The more opinions we receive, the more robust the dataset gets. As data generates data, in loop, it subsists for itself, so our analysis and outputs can only grow stronger and vigorous, analytically.", "Once we have reached enough reliability on the first phase explained above \u2014 we expect this to be achieved within the first two months of work \u2013, we would go on to get the data analysis done. Then we would be producing our first outputs, while making the data available to the target groups into serving different purposes. The ultimate pinpoint would be to achieve a model which allows people to upload their own image, providing perceived safety interpretation within milliseconds at our website, or even a built-in app.", "As stated before, both the dataset and the data analysis will constantly be fed with rigorous updates under our supervision. We could fantasize diverse and futuristic applications on and on, but that is not our point. We will be glad enough if this actually translates into actual savings in data maintenance, data analysis, improved urban planning and, more importantly, we want this to be saving lives.", "Lu\u00eds Rita \u2014 Co-Founder | Miguel Peliteiro \u2014 Co-Founder | Codrin Bostan \u2014 Web Developer", "Want to give us a hand?
