I was in the middle of a data science boot camp and wanted a forum to showcase my work. My instructors suggested that I blog either on Medium or GitHub. Thank the stars I chose Medium (I could never get my GitHub blog to work).", "Full disclosure \u2014 this blog post is somewhat self-congratulatory. I told myself I would write one of those \u201cLooking Back From Whence I Came\u201d posts when I finally hit the 1,000 follower milestone and I finally hit it a few days ago (thanks everyone for the support and reading my stuff).", "I will talk a bit about how I got here, but I honestly I don\u2019t have many nuggets of wisdom to share. One of the reasons that my blog was able to gain traction was luck. And if I started over from scratch, I\u2019m not sure I would be able to replicate what happened (you will see why I feel this way below).", "Here are some stats for my blog:", "I am certainly proud of getting to this point. When I started blogging about data science, I was hoping to leverage my writing into professional connections that would eventually help me land a job, and that would be that. I had no idea at the time that writing would become a new passion of mine and a supplementary source of income \u2014 I now view my blog as my own little startup and something I intend to keep refining and working on for the foreseeable future.", "I mentioned getting lucky above. Let me show you what I mean.", "As of the time I write this, I have 225,346 all-time views of my blog. Of those views, 82,058 (36% of the total) came from a single post, Understanding Random Forest. The primary reason for its success is because it\u2019s one of the top search results when you google \u201crandom forest\u201d (look for it right below Wikipedia) \u2014 by the way, I have no idea why Google ranks it so highly.", "The funny thing is that I never intended to publish that post on its own. It was originally meant to supplement another article (my boot camp project where I used machine learning to select Lending Club loans for investment). The random forest algorithm figured prominently in my results so I wrote up a description of how it worked. However, I am not a concise writer and thus the description ended up being really long. Figuring that nobody wanted to read a 25 minute blog post about my data science project, I decided to publish the section on random forest as its own post. Lucky me, check out this difference in outcomes:", "Even now 3 months later, it remains my most frequently viewed blog post and I almost didn\u2019t publish it. And if I hadn\u2019t published it, I would not be where I am today.", "Since then I have tried with limited success to reproduce that lightning. I have had some reasonable successes (some sparks I should say) but no lightning. Regularly publishing good content is really hard. I have tons of admiration for my fellow Medium writers that publish high quality and popular content daily.", "Through hard work and let\u2019s be honest some luck, these folks have honed their writing style and subject matter expertise in such a way that it greatly overlaps with the things that Medium readers are interested in reading about. Borrowing terminology from the startup world, these power writers enjoy great product market fit (see the Venn Diagram below):", "However for the rest of us normals, the reality is much more likely to be that we don\u2019t know as much we think we do. And the average reader is just not that interested in the subjects that we do have insights on:", "It\u2019s definitely frustrating when pieces that you spent days crafting and researching fall flat. For example, I am really proud of this post on how to more efficiently and effectively skill people up and help them change careers. Yet it\u2019s one of my least read stories so far.", "But that\u2019s OK \u2014 some volatility is expected and like in the realistic Venn Diagram above, people won\u2019t always be interested in the things that I find noteworthy. The key for me is to write until I find my niche and then keep honing that area of expertise, and it\u2019s OK if my niche is a smaller and more narrow one.", "Plus there are many other reasons that I write outside of views and reads:", "Lastly and most importantly, I write to be disciplined. I strongly believe that good behaviors compound \u2014 meaning that over time, the cumulative benefits of good decisions increase exponentially:", "I plan to continue publishing at least one post every week, rain or shine. And just like how patiently cultivating and maintaining a garden leads eventually to one bountiful harvest after another, I hope to look back in a year or 2 and say, \u201cWow, look at how far my blog has come and how much I have learned from writing it consistently week in and week out.\u201d", "Lastly, because I went through the bootcamp and a career change, I\u2019ve developed a fascination with the education as a service industry (bootcamps, MOOCs, career development platforms, etc.). The job hunt can be pretty harsh and unforgiving to career changers (I\u2019ve both personally experienced this and also watched it occur to close friends of mine). I feel like there must be a better way \u2014 unfortunately, I don\u2019t currently have any game-changing insights on this but it will definitely be a future area of focus for me.", "I apologize for the rambling nature of this post. I am truly excited to be able to write for you all and grateful for your support.", "If any data science, education, or finance writers out there would like to collaborate or just chat/brainstorm, please leave me a note here on Medium or through Twitter.
