In my case, as an Industrial Engineer, I thought about a way of performing this analysis with an industrial engineering approach. Apart from learning a lot of maths and calculus, we also learn about strategy and process optimization.", "One classic concept learnt in Industrial engineering is the BCG Matrix (also known as Growth-Share matrix). This is a concept developed by the Boston Consulting Group in the 70s, for companies to identify and cluster their products into different categories, and then make them evolve in the market, maximizing the revenue from the company.", "If you don\u2019t know about the BCG matrix, don\u2019t worry, stay with me in this article and you will get the concept. I will also leave an explanatory link at the end of the article!", "Let\u2019s say you are a data scientist in an e-commerce company, and your manager asks you to run an analysis, which objective is to identify key features that they can improve in the company website. In this way, the company will gain more users to convert (convert in this case can be to buy a product, or to buy a ticket etc). What all companies want in the end is the customers to convert more, so that they have more revenue.", "They might ask you, what makes people convert more?", "For this example, I built a toy dataset from an imaginary e-commerce company that sells products online. The website from this company has the typical features you can expect from such a webpage: a search engine, filter options after the search, add products to the cart, etc.", "The database that you can get, simplified, can look like something like this:", "We can see also the table as a pivot table, using this code:", "And we get this pivot table:", "There are actions that lots of people do, such as doing a Search, however, not many people convert. It\u2019s because of that that it can be difficult to build a predictive model, because just a few people make the actions that end up in a conversion.", "We can build a decision tree, to see what features are the most important ones, and to see which are the thresholds in where we can already see clear tendencies towards the conversion. The main question is: what makes people convert?", "So if a user applied a filter more than 5 times, and added more than 3 items to the cart, then it has high chances to convert\u2026 but it looks a little too specific to be useful in this business case, doesn\u2019t it?", "I built a package for this (to install it, run this command in your terminal: pip install bcganalysis). This is the code you would have to use, using a pivot table like the previous one as the input (visit the GitHub repo for more details!)", "(*) For a more detailed way on how to apply the code, have a look at the README in my Github: https://github.com/Mateil04/bcg_analysis. There you can follow an example with a toy dataset that is available in the repo.", "In the x-axis, it shows how many users have used each feature at least 1 time, and we call that the penetration. It can be thought also as the popularity of the feature.", "In the y-axis we can see the conversion, this is, out of all the users that have used that feature, how many did end up converting.", "So for example, Search action is being done by almost all the users (~80%), but from all the users that performed this action, ~20% of them convert. This is because it is a very common action, done by almost every user. It keeps the website rolling, but it doesn\u2019t assure a conversion.", "On the other hand, if we look at add_to_cart action, we see that it is being done by a few users (penetration ~20%), but these users have a very high conversion (~75%).", "So here is where the BCG Matrix comes in (it\u2019s not strictly a matrix, but this is what it is called!)", "The BCG Matrix is originally thought for assessing the success and market share of the products from a company in the market.", "For example, you can think about McDonald\u2019s company, having the BigMac as the Cash Cow, since it\u2019s a classic product that is very popular and always brings some revenue. A vegan burger can be in the Question mark quadrant, since now vegan food is quite trendy and for sure it has a big potential, but it has to be in the market and be successful in order to pass to be the Star product and bring the most of the revenue. A fish burger can be in the Dog quadrant. This can be the case of a product that used to be a Question Mark, but didn\u2019t pass the test and was not popular in the end.", "The desired movement of the products, are indicated with the dotted arrows.", "The x-axis of the BCG matrix is the market share and the y-axis, the growth rate. In our business case, we changed them for penetration (popularity) and conversion, but the essence is the same.", "So going back to the generated plot, we can see:", "Features in the Question mark quadrant (add_to_cart, apply_filter) are the ones that have a big potential, but have not yet been exploited. We want them to become more popular, and like that, become our Star feature in the future (high penetration, high conversion). To achieve this, you may suggest to the UX team to change, for example, colors and sizes of how these features are displayed on the website, to highlight them. Then they would get more clicks and there will be more overall conversion (and this features converted into the Star quadrant).", "The features in the Dogs quadrant, they can be left out and replaced for other features. The \u201cSee rarities\u201d button in this example, doesn\u2019t seem to attract many people nor to trigger conversion, so it\u2019s better to think about another, different feature that can replace it.", "The Cash Cows, are those features that don\u2019t have a lot of conversion, but they are very popular, and keep the website heavy in user traffic. In our case, Search and Click on an article after search, are clear examples.", "Ultimately, as the graph shows, Stars are going to pass to Cows at some point, and we will need to find more features to be Question marks, like a brand new section in the homepage for example, to afterwards become our new Stars.", "In this article I showed how to perform a feature importance analysis, evaluating user behaviour, related to the UX design. It can also be considered as a way of clustering.", "If you want to see the code for the package, you can check it in my GitHub.", "If you want to learn more about the BCG Matrix, you can check this Wiki article or this other post.", "Your home for data science.
