One type is document and the other is topic. In this blog post, I will explain how to calculate similarities between the documents based on their topics with random walks with restart. You can also think of a much bigger graph with a node type word instead of topic whose connections tell which words occur in which document. For simplicity, I will go with topics.", "Now imagine we would stand on the node of document 1 and would randomly (uniform) decide which edge to take to get to another node. Since we have only two edges, the probability that we would go to topic 1 is 0.5 just like the probability that we would go to topic 2. In total, we have a sum of 1.", "If we do this imagination for all nodes, we end up with a matrix M with the starting points as columns and the probabilities in the respective rows. This matrix can be created in python with the following code:", "The usual random walk wouldn\u2019t go just one step but a couple of steps. Hence, the probability that you would end up on node document 3 from document 1 after 2 steps is the combination of these probabilities. To calculate the probabilities where a walker would end up after a couple of steps, the following script can help.", "The variable v tells us the probability of the current nodes. As we are starting at document 1, the probability of being at that node is 100%. The dot multiplication is taking this probability and performs a vector multiplication with the probabilities of the next possible node. Hence, we get a vector which tells us the probabilities where we could end up based on the probabilities where we have been before. For the first step, this is simply the first column of M. From there on, we could be at topic 1 or topic 2 and have to multiply this probability with the probabilities of the next paths.", "The random walk with restarts algorithm includes the concept of restarts. Here, a walker has a probability of beta to go on without restarting and therefore 1-beta to teleport to its starting point again and walk from there. This helps explore more diverse paths.", "The implementation is quite easy. Instead of just multiplying the probabilities where we could be right now with the transition matrix M, we include the probability that we end up on the starting node.", "Hence, we multiply the usual walk with beta and add the remaining chance of ending up at the starting point (1-beta).", "If we are running the random walking for quite some steps n, we get the following probabilities:", "They tell us on which node we could have ended up. With a probability of 34% we would be at our starting point again, 7% we would be at document 2, 14% we would be at document 3 and so on. The probability of being at document 3 is, therefore, twice as high as document 2 and so we can say, that document 1 (our starting point) is twice as similar to document 3 as it is to document 2.", "Due to the topic assignment beforehand, it was already clear that document 3 is similar to document 1. Anyhow, this simple example can be extrapolated to more complex graphs and relationships between entities. In combination with the easy implementation, it is a nice way to calculate similarities.", "Your home for data science.
