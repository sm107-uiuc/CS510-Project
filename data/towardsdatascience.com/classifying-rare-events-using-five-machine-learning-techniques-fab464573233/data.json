Being able to generate useful business insights from data has never been so easy.", "According to Andrew Ng (Machine Learning Yearning, p.9),", "Supervised Learning algorithms contribute the majority value to the industry.", "There is no doubt why SL generates so much business value. Banks use it to detect credit card fraud, traders make purchase decisions based on what models tell them to, and factory filter through the production line for defective units (this is an area where AI and ML can help traditional companies, according to Andrew Ng).", "These business scenarios share two common features:", "As Andrew Ng points out recently, small data, robustness, and human factor are three obstacles to successful AI projects. To a certain degree, our rare event question with one minority group is also a small data question: the ML algorithm learns more from the majority group and may easily misclassify the small data group.", "For these rare events, which ML method performs better?", "In this post, we try to answer these questions by applying 5 ML methods to a real-life dataset with comprehensive R implementations.", "For the full description and the original dataset, please check the original dataset; For the complete R code, please check my Github.", "A bank in Portugal carries out a marketing strategy of a new banking service (a term deposit) and wants to know which types of clients have subscribed to the service.

Data Scientists have teamed up with the sells and marketing teams to come up with statistical solutions to identify future subscribers.", "Here comes the pipeline of model selection and R implementations.", "Let\u2019s load and clean the raw dataset.", "It appears to be tedious to clean the raw data as we have to recode missing variables and transform qualitative into quantitative variables. It takes even more time to clean the data in the real world.

The unbalanced distribution should flash some warning signs because data distribution affects the final statistical model. It can easily misclassify the minority case using a model developed out of a majority case.", "Next, let\u2019s split the dataset into two parts: training and test sets. As a rule of thumb, we stick to the 80\u201320 division: 80% as the training set and 20% as the test test. For Time Series data, we train models based on 90% of the data and leave the rest 10% as the test dataset.", "Here, let\u2019s create an empty tracking record.", "In this section, we define a new function (calc_error_rate) and apply it to calculate training and test errors of each ML model.", "This function calculates the rate when the predicted label does not equal to the true value.", "For a brief introduction of logistic model, please check my other posts: Machine Learning 101and Machine Learning 102.", "Let\u2019s fit a logistic model including all other variables except the outcome variable.

As you may notice, the training and test errors are very close, and it\u2019s difficult to tell which one is clearly winning.", "Besides, classification accuracy, either train error or test error, should not be the metrics for highly imbalanced dataset. This is so because the dataset is dominated by the majority cases, and even a random guess gives you 50\u201350 chance of getting it right (50% accuracy). Even worse, a highly accuracy model may severely penalize the minority case. For that reason, let\u2019s check another metrics ROC Curve.", "ROC is a graphic representation showing how a classification model performs at all classification thresholds.

This is quite desirable for rare events since we also want to reach a balance between the majority and minority cases.", "We put a abline to show the chance of random assignment. Our classifier should perform better than random guess, right?", "According to the ROC curve, KNN (the blue one) stands above all other methods.", "As the name suggested, AUC is the area under the ROC curve. It is an arithmetic representation of the visual AUC curve. AUC provides an aggregated results of how classifiers perform across possible classifcation thresholds.", "In this post, we find KNN, a non-parametric classifier, performs better than its parametric counterparts.
