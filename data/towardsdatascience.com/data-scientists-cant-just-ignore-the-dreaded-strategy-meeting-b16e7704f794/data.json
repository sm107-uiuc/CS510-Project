Apple fan-kids \u2014 please don\u2019t send me hate-mail on LinkedIn.", "Instead let\u2019s turn to something that I\u2019ve been wrestling a bit with recently, \u201cStrategy\u201d. If you\u2019re like me, you probably wince when you hear the word. It conjures up images of gibberish-spouting consultants with great hair and implausibly bronzed skin. Glitzy powerpoint slides are probably involved somewhere, as are long meetings where everyone nods but no-one comes out any the wiser.", "Pretty much every data scientist I\u2019ve ever spoken to feels the same way about \u201cstrategy\u201d. But this raises the interesting question of: why? What triggers this reaction? And should a data scientist care about this stuff in the first place? Well I want to convince you that, as a data scientist, you should, and there exist tools out there for making the whole thing less painful.", "One of the reasons data scientists despise (OK, I\u2019m generalising here) \u201cstrategic thinking\u201d is that it seems so woolly. However it shouldn\u2019t. The roots of strategic thinking lie with the military \u2014 think 19th century Prussians with impressive moustaches, moving wooden soldiers around a map [2]. As data scientists we love a good definition, and there exist perfectly good working definitions of strategy.", "Now this is a data science blog, not an organisational culture blog, so I\u2019m going to have to gloss over the interesting way that strategic thinking spread out of the military and into the world of work. But for our purposes, I\u2019m going with a definition of strategy that riffs on the one used by the US military [3]. Unsurprisingly, those guys have thought about this a lot.", "Strategy is how an organisation achieves its purpose, by completing its goals, through the deployment of its resources.", "You can see why the military go for this kind of thinking \u2014 what do we mean by winning, what do we have to do to win, and what tools do we have to do those things. However if you\u2019re not a fan of military metaphors, it also closely parallels Simon Sinek and his \u201cFirst the why, then the what, then the how\u201d [4].", "Put like this, it seems unarguable that any organisation should have some sort of strategy. And yet, somehow, we still end up staggering out of strategy meetings exhausted and unenlightened.", "Having sat through many, many hours of data strategy meetings, I feel your pain. However there are two reasons why it\u2019s difficult to maintain that position, one cynical / realistic, the other perhaps more interesting.", "The realist\u2019s position is that if you don\u2019t help define the strategy, someone else will do it for you. And do you really want someone else to define the purpose of you and your team, the goals you\u2019ll be measured against and the resources you have? OK, maybe not all organisations involve gladiatorial battles for budget, but you still need to raise your voice in those discussions. Otherwise those shifty so-and-so\u2019s in data engineering will dump a whole load of extra responsibilities on you, without giving you anyone extra to fulfil them.", "I jest. I love my colleagues in data engineering. But you get the point \u2014 someone, somewhere will be trying to make you do a whole lot of extra work, without paying for it.", "There is, however, another less cynical and more interesting reason to care about strategy. If you\u2019ll permit me a bit of \u201cterminologising\u201d, in the above definition, strategy is a fractal concept.", "As you zoom into smaller levels of an organisation, you see that the structure of the whole, i.e. the why, the what and the how, is repeated all the way down [5]. In this view, the \u201cwhy\u201d of one level of the organisation is to fulfil the \u201cwhat\u201d of the level above it.", "Now this talk of fractal concepts, might sound a bit vague. Indeed, you might be thinking that I\u2019ve sat in one too many strategy meetings myself. So here\u2019s a data science specific example.", "Imagine you are the billionaire owner of a quantitative hedge fund. Feels pretty sweet, right? Your hedge fund\u2019s purpose might be to make macro-economic investments that play out over the long-term. To do this, it will, amongst other things, have to build better sources of macro-economic data than its competitors. Therefore you will create a data team to do this. There\u2019s a purpose (macro investment), goal (build better data sources), and deployment of resources (create a data team) in this hedge fund\u2019s strategy. Great! You\u2019ve done your billionaire job and you can return to your private island / mountain fortress / whatever else you\u2019re spending your money on.", "Now suppose you run that data team. Your purpose is to build a better source of macro-economic data than anyone else, i.e. your purpose is the goal of the organisational level above you. Well you have to set yourself some goals to achieve your purpose. One will probably be to make available all the standard sources of macro-economic data from providers like Bloomberg. You can be 100% certain that people making trading decisions will want this.", "However this only gets you to parity with other funds. Your purpose is to do better than them, remember? And hedge funds aren\u2019t shy of shedding people who don\u2019t fulfil their purpose. So you set yourself the additional goal of getting the people placing the bets (ahem, I mean \u201cmaking investments\u201d) to use alternative data sources that other funds don\u2019t have. This could be information that you\u2019ve extracted from news articles, or measured from satellite photos. To meet these goals, you hire a bunch of engineers to build the data feed from Bloomberg and a bunch of data scientists to work on the alternative data.", "Now suppose you run the alternative data half of the data team. Your purpose is to provide alternative data sources that get used by people making trading decisions. So you talk to a quantitative analyst and discover that they\u2019re interested in job sentiment data. Now you have a goal \u2014 extract job sentiment data \u2014 and you set a data scientist to extract this information from free-text articles in the Wall Street Journal. That lucky data scientist now has their purpose, so they set themselves a bunch of goals (get the data, plot the data, clean the data basically) and then work out what they have to do to complete them, i.e. use N.L.P. if they\u2019re brave, or the Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V method if they\u2019re wise.", "In short, this is a well run hedge fund, whose strategy at the top has cascaded down to all levels of the organisation. In this world, strategy meetings are there for a reason. Everyone needs to know their purpose and how it fits in with the rest of the organisation. Then they can set themselves goals, and deploy their resources accordingly. This applies to everyone, even scientists!", "I think one reason for the pain, and it\u2019s a reason we have to face square-on, is that often there\u2019s a lack of clarity about an organisation\u2019s purpose at the very top. This lack of clarity then cascades down to all other levels.", "For me, the nadir of this, was the sight of a CXO at a large nameless organisation who, when questioned on strategy, rolled his eyes and told the meeting that the company\u2019s purpose was to \u201cmake more profit, obviously!\u201d Now that\u2019s roughly akin to an individual telling me that their life\u2019s purpose is to draw another breath. Yes you have to breathe to live, but it\u2019s not an end in itself. Equivalently, yes, a company has to make a profit to continue to exist, but that\u2019s not why it exists.", "Needless to say, that company was total chaos, as people tried to figure out what the hell they were supposed to be doing. Data strategy meetings were painful, as we tried to tease out what different parts of the organisation wanted, and more importantly, why. Put simply, if you think your data team\u2019s purpose is to provide tools that make other people\u2019s jobs easier, then it helps if those other people know what their jobs are.", "So what can you do if you find yourself in this situation? Unfortunately I have no good news for you. You\u2019re going to have to embrace the pain.", "Firstly, you have to have a strategy, even if the rest of the organisation doesn\u2019t. The hard part of this is, of course, to work out your team\u2019s purpose. Once you know that, life\u2019s easy \u2014 you can set your own goals and figure out how to use your own resources. A complicating factor is that you\u2019re going to have to get a lock on your purpose for long enough that you can actually deliver something. To do this, you\u2019re going to need allies! Or if you\u2019re feeling a bit less Machiavellian, let\u2019s call them internal customers. Either way, you\u2019ll have to buddy up to other bits of the organisation and persuade them that their best interests lie with them getting their data science from you.", "As an aside, I can see why data scientists hate this. In essence, it\u2019s \u201cPolitics\u201d and that\u2019s something we don\u2019t enjoy. Tough.", "So at this stage you might feel that since you\u2019re running around trying to get customers, you\u2019re basically building an internal company of your own. Well I\u2019d argue that you should embrace this feeling. Business schools even have a term for you: you\u2019re an \u201cIntrapreneur\u201d [7]! How does it feel?", "Anyway, if you accept that you\u2019re building an internal start-up, it might be helpful to steal from those start-up value proposition templates [8]. One I like to use is: \u201cWe help X do Y by providing Z\u201d.", "In our case, we found our internal customers in the first step, so that\u2019s our X. We know what they do, so we have our Y. And now it\u2019s our job to figure out the Z. For example, \u201cwe help the customer retention team reduce churn by providing nudges at the appropriate point in the customer lifecycle.\u201d", "Congratulations! Providing that \u201cZ\u201d is your first purpose. Now figure out the goals: in our example, perhaps we decide to run experiments to find out which nudges measurably reduce churn? Maybe first build a model to predict who\u2019ll churn? Then send an email? Push a notification in the app? Now you can hand off those goals to the people on your, and importantly, your customer\u2019s, team.", "There\u2019s an obvious problem here. If you\u2019re successful you\u2019ll have lots of internal customers. So you\u2019ll have lots of \u201cZs\u201d that they want you to do. Your purpose is no longer clearly defined. It\u2019s become a grab-bag of stuff that you happen to be doing.", "Now I\u2019d argue that this is the lesser evil \u2014 remember we\u2019re operating in a chaotic environment here. When asked to justify your team\u2019s existence, it\u2019s infinitely better to respond with a whole long list of \u201cwe help X to do Y by providing Z\u201d than it is to respond by trying to explain some sort of data science technology or technique that you\u2019ve developed, for some reason.", "However at some point, if you are lucky, you will see some recurring themes in the things you\u2019re doing for your customers. Hopefully you can abstract these themes into an over-arching purpose. Let\u2019s push the previous example a bit further. If you have a bunch of projects for marketing teams, but no-one else, perhaps your purpose is to provide tools that allow marketing to increase revenue? You can probably think of some goals that you\u2019ll have to do to achieve this: improve the efficacy of campaigns by more accurate measurement, optimise customer outreach, help develop products for under-served markets. With a bit of luck some of these goals will align with the projects that you\u2019re doing already. The ones that don\u2019t then lay out a roadmap for what you should be doing next.", "So in summary, if you\u2019re in an organisation without a clear strategy, you have no choice but to define your own purpose, in collaboration with your colleagues in other departments. Then you can set your goals, and deploy your resources, as you see fit.", "Without any guidance on strategy from above, you\u2019ll have to build a strategy from opportunities that you go out and find.", "Well much as I\u2019d like this to be true \u2014 and who doesn\u2019t love moaning about senior management \u2014 life is more complicated. I think there are two more factors that are playing out, and as data scientists, we have to be a bit self critical about these.", "The first factor is that as you get more senior, you increasingly have to inspire people with a vision. Almost by definition, inspiring visions aren\u2019t detailed and data-driven (the sort of things that we data scientists like), they\u2019re abstract, high-level narratives (the sort of thing that the rest of the world likes).", "To give a concrete example, consider a media company whose CEO states that their purpose is to give a voice to a historically under-served community. I can imagine a certain kind of data scientist dismissing that purpose. How can you measure an abstract concept like \u201cvoice\u201d? That\u2019s stupid, the CEO is an idiot.", "I\u2019d argue that here, the data scientist is in the wrong.", "At this top-level you don\u2019t really need to define \u201cvoice\u201d for this to be a perfectly fine strategy. And if you\u2019re from that under-served community you\u2019ll probably be inspired by it, which is its most important function. Even if you\u2019re not, you can immediately see what needs to be done. You\u2019ll need to engage with that community. You\u2019ll need to understand what they\u2019re thinking. You\u2019ll need to find out what media they consume, so you can produce the right content for them. In other words, understanding that you have to provide a \u201cvoice\u201d is perfectly sufficient to get a series of \u201cwhy / what / how\u201d sub-strategies to cascade. It\u2019s only further down the organisation that things have to start getting measured.", "So in this case, its not the CEO that\u2019s the idiot.", "There\u2019s another factor playing out though. A senior manager laying out a vision is describing a future state of the world. In other words, they\u2019re saying the world is currently like this, it should be like that, and we have to do a whole bunch of stuff to get from here to there. Implicit in any discussions of the future is some sort of prediction of what the future is going to be.", "And data scientists hate predictions! After all we\u2019re the ones who know how hard they are! However as a senior manager, you have to make some sort of prediction about how the future is going to play out. You are steering a super tanker, and you know that any course corrections made now will take years to have an effect.", "So who\u2019s right? Well I think both sides are. Yes, it\u2019s extremely difficult to make real predictions about the future, of the sort \u201cLogan Rocks will win the 2.18 race at Doncaster\u201d. However a senior manager has no choice but to attempt to imagine possible futures in creating their strategy.", "Fortunately for all concerned there are a set of tools available that help make describing future worlds, if not scientific, at least a bit more rational. However, I think that they are sufficiently interesting that they deserve a post of their own and I\u2019ve already gone on a little long this week! To hear more, you\u2019ll have to return next Wednesday. Talk to you then.", "[1] So it turns out that some people love JIRA, which came as a surprise. My final word is that if you look at a woodworking tool on Amazon and 90% of reviews say \u201cI cut myself with it\u201d, then either you can believe 90% of people are idiots who don\u2019t know how to use a chisel, or alternatively, you might believe that just maybe there\u2019s something wrong with the chisel. I\u2019m in the latter camp.", "[2] Everyone I\u2019ve read on Strategy seems to reference Clausewitz\u2019s \u201cOn War\u201d, so here it is! Unfortunately for my rhetorical purposes, he seems not to have had a moustache.", "[3] Basically I\u2019ve taken the Ends / Ways / Means model and rejigged it to make the terminology consistent with the kind of design thinking we were talking about a few weeks ago. See Defining Military Strategy, by Arthur F Lykke, Jr., Military Review, Vol 77, \u21161.", "[4] I get excited when I get a couple of thousand views. Simon Sinek\u2019s talk \u201cHow great leaders inspire action\u201d is currently running at 12 million or so. It\u2019s great, watch it here.", "[5] I\u2019m not claiming anything new here. See Figure 1 of this paper, \u201cMilitary Strategy Revisited, A Critique of the Lykke Formulation\u201d by Lt. Col. Richard E. Berkebile. The last military reference, I promise \u2014 it\u2019s just that I found that those guys had thought about this the most clearly!", "[6] I\u2019d always vaguely associated this line with the late, great Terry Pratchett, but it turns out I was completely wrong!", "[7] I\u2019m cheerfully simplifying this whole discussion.
