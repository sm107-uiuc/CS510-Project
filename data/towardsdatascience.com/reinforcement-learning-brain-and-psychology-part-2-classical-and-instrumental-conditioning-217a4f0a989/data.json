Whereas control algorithms are mostly policy-based algorithms and are supposed to guide you through the situation.", "And as such, those categories correspond to two studies of psychology: classical (Pavlovian) conditioning and instrumental (operant) conditioning. The correspondence between prediction algorithms and classical conditioning rests on their common property of predicting upcoming stimuli, whether or not those stimuli are rewarding or punishing. With instrumental conditioning an agent is rewarded or punished depending on what it did, hence it learns to increase its tendency to produce rewarded behavior and to decrease its tendency to produce penalized behavior. Of course, the correspondence is not accidental, as psychology\u2019s influenced on RL a lot.", "This is the second part of the series on what\u2019s inspired RL and so let\u2019s jump into the rabbit hole and find out how to condition someone to believe.", "I\u2019m sure, all of you\u2019ve heard about Ivan Pavlov and his experiments with dogs and that is the best example of Classical conditioning, though there are many other works in this field let\u2019s stick to the roots.", "Dr. Pavlov was studying an unconditional response (UR) of a dog to an unconditional stimulus (US), which were salivation and a demonstration of the food respectively. The dog, when presented some food (US), started to salivate (UR) almost immediately. The process is very simple and intuitive for us but this led to the thought of whether or not the dog could be trained to react in a similar way to some other stimulus.", "Conditional stimulus (CS) is something that the dog didn\u2019t care about previously, it can be sound, light or basically any other thing which is a neutral stimulus initially. In Pavlov\u2019s experiment it was the sound of a metronome. And the reaction to CS is called conditional response (CR), it\u2019s sometimes similar to UR but often begins earlier and usually more intensive.", "Back to Pavlov\u2019s experiment, after several repetitions of presenting the sound of the metronome (CS), shortly before the demonstration of the food (US), the dog learned to salivate to the sound of the metronome (CR) in the same way as it did to the food (UR). The US is called a reinforcer because it reinforces the production of CR in response to the CS.", "An initially neutral stimulus becomes conditional stimulus (CS) as the dog learns that it predicts the US and so starts producing the CR in response to the CS.", "There are many other interesting details about this project but this is enough for us.", "The learning process of the dog is somewhat similar to how we train an RL agent. As I said, classical conditioning corresponds to prediction algorithms which predict a reward in a given state. That\u2019s very similar to what happens with the dog (an agent).", "In a state when presented food, the dog starts to salivate, which means that it expects a reward. So we build our training loop in such a way that there is another state, when we introduce CS, before the demonstration of the food. And after a couple of training epochs, the dog learns the dependency between the state with CS and the food, therefore it starts to salivate (shows that it expects the reward) in response to CS.", "In terms of reinforcement learning we could write this problem as follows.", "The eating process itself can be set as the RL reward (the food is tasty and nutritious), the actions will be to salivate, or not to salivate, \u0336t\u0336h\u0336a\u0336t\u0336 \u0336i\u0336s\u0336 \u0336t\u0336h\u0336e\u0336 \u0336q\u0336u\u0336e\u0336s\u0336t\u0336i\u0336o\u0336n\u0336, even though the dog can\u2019t do it on purpose, and the states are food demonstration process and the sound of the metronome.", "And there you have it, our agent will be predicting (salivating) the reward when the state includes the sound of the metronome.", "Let\u2019s close this section with a quote by the father of the field:", "\u201cIt is pretty evident that under natural conditions the normal animal must respond not only to stimuli which themselves bring immediate benefit or harm, but also to other physical or chemical agencies \u2014 waves of sound, light, and the like \u2014 which in themselves only signal the approach of these stimuli; though it is not the sight and sound of the beast of prey which is in itself harmful to the smaller animal, but its teeth and claws.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Ivan Pavlov.", "Unlike classical conditioning experiments, in instrumental conditioning learning depends on what exactly an animal does. In classical conditioning the animal is presented with a reinforcer (US) no matter its behavior. And that\u2019s why instrumental conditioning is far more closer to RL that everyone knows.", "Instrumental conditioning is usually considered to be the same as operant conditioning, which the term introduced by B. F. Skinner but we\u2019re not going to dive into differences and will consider it as a single thing.", "Edward Thorndike was the pioneer of the field, he experimented with cats put into \u201cpuzzle boxes\u201d. There are many variations of these boxes but the idea is the same. The cat has to perform a series of actions to get out of the box to take food.", "See, it comes down to food again. It\u2019s the reiforcer for our agent which is crucial to all these experiments. As it is said \u201cno money, no honey\u201d. You have to provide your agent with some sort of reward (positive or negative) because it won\u2019t work without it.", "What\u2019s really interesting about all this is that after a couple of successive experiences cats learn how to escape faster and they no longer act intuitively (randomly). Thorndike described it like this:", "\u201cThe cat that is clawing all over the box in her impulsive struggle will probably claw the string or loop or button so as to open the door. And gradually all the other non-successful impulses will be stamped out and the particular impulse leading to the successful act will be stamped in by the resulting pleasure, until, after many trials, the cat will, when put in the box, immediately claw the button or loop in a definite way.\u201d \u2014 Dr. Edward Thorndike.", "So, in simple words, cats figured a sequence of actions which led them outside the box and ultimately they get food (reward). But important thing for us is that they learned it by, what Thorndike discovered and called, the Law of Effect also known as trial and error.", "Let\u2019s now focus more on Reinforcement learning part as it has some exciting aspects.", "The Law of Effect describes two essential features of animal learning which mirror in RL algorithms. First, an algorithm has to be selectional, which means that it tries different actions and selects among them by comparing their outcome. Second, the algorithms has to be associative, meaning that it associates particular situations (states) with actions found during selection phase.", "The Law of Effect says that it\u2019s important not only to find the actions that give a lot of reward but also connect those actions to the states.", "The most notorious example of selectional process is natural selection in evolution \u2014 the strongest lives \u2014 but it\u2019s not associative. An example of associative method could be supervised learning but it\u2019s not selectional as it needs direct instructions in order to change its behavior.", "For a RL algorithm selectional process is the exploration and there are many ways it can be done. For example, \u03b5-greedy policy, which states that an agent picks a random action with the probability of \u03b5 and it picks greedily (chooses the action that gives the biggest instant reward) with the probability of 1-\u03b5. By gradually decreasing \u03b5 during training, we\u2019re trying to solve The Exploration-Exploitation Dilemma, which says, to put simply, when one should stop exploring and start exploiting.", "Another curious thing is motivation. For instrumental conditioning it is what influences the strength and the direction of behavior. In Thorndike\u2019s experiment it was the food left outside the box. Whenever our cat breaks out of the box it gets the food and this reinforces the actions it conducted to escape.", "Of course, it\u2019s not directly corresponding to RL but the reward signal is basically what we call motivation and the whole trick then is to make the agent\u2019s experience rewarding. And though our own motivation is very complex and highly hierarchical thing, we can get some ideas. For instance, we are more motivated to get food when we\u2019re hungry and less motivated when we just ate, and maybe we can transfer this kind of behavior to reinforcement learning. However, there are only few works on this topic. The most recent one, at least to my knowledge, is The Cognitive Neuroscience of Motivation and Learning by Nathaniel D. Daw and Daphna Shohamy.", "As you see, the abstract of instrumental conditioning is very similar to one of reinforcement learning but they are not equal statements in any way. Mapping something so complex as animals\u2019 behavior to computational problem is like explaining the string theory with sticks and stones.", "I hope that resemblance is clear for you by now but remember that RL methods were only inspired by psychology and they were never supposed to mirror animals\u2019 and humans\u2019 behavior strictly.", "It might be unclear why all the things are about animals and not humans, firstly, this is because we, humans, are as much animals as our dogs and cats. Secondly, our behavioral patters are very much alike but exponentially harder, so it\u2019s just easier to experiment on our pets. But it\u2019s nonetheless possible to use operant conditioning to train people, as, for example, Sheldon did with Penny in The Big Bang Theory.", "We still have so much to explore about ourselves that it\u2019s never to late to join the research. Maybe we, humans, really have something special about our biology and therefore psychology which made us the dominant specie, or maybe we just got lucky. The important thing is that there is a mystery in a way we learn and could it be that our attempt to explain the string theory with sticks and stones may be an essential step in explaining why we are here?", "P.S. Pavlov was a nice guy actually, he kept all the dogs and took care of them after the experiments.", "Connect with me on Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook and follow on GitHub!"], "all_outgoing_urls":
