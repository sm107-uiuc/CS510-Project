A cowboy turned medicine-man, Stanley was the first businessman to start selling \u2018snake oil\u2019 as a panacea for many ailments. In a notorious demonstration at a symposium in Chicago, Stanley took a live rattlesnake, sliced it open, dropped it in boiling water, and skimmed off the fat that rose to the surface, to show the authenticity of his snake oil. The public lapped it up. His snake oil was a hit.", "But there were some issues. Big ones.", "1) Stanley\u2019s Snake Oil did not do what it claimed to do. It did not have the efficacy against ailments that it professed.", "2) Also, as with all marketing gimmicks, what you see is not always what you get. After over two decades of selling \u2018Stanley\u2019s Snake Oil\u2019, authorities finally examined his magic potion. What they found in it was mineral oil, beef fat, chilli peppers and turpentine! No sign whatsoever of any snake oil was detected.", "The fraud was so well orchestrated by Stanley and went on for so long, that even to this day the euphemism \u2018snake oil salesman\u2019 denotes fraudulent salesmanship and making claims far removed from reality.", "So why am I talking about snake oil salesmen in the context of AI?", "Someone famously said, \u2018data is the new oil\u2019. True enough. But you know what the new \u2018snake oil\u2019 is? Artificial Intelligence!", "Allow me to explain. Everywhere you seem to look today there is someone doing something (or many things!) with Artificial Intelligence. AI is ubiquitous. It\u2019s everywhere. While that is true in many ways \u2014 we really do use AI in many, many aspects of our lives \u2014 the problem lies in how loosely the term is interpreted. Just like all that glitters ain\u2019t gold, all that is being done by a computer isn\u2019t AI. Very simplistically put, AI refers to machines being made intelligent in order to replicate human actions and/or decision making to achieve set goals. (For more details you can also read my article on Decoding AI here).", "The fallout of this deceptive AI-led marketing is profound for the startup ecosystem.", "Startups around the globe, are touting many things as being AI driven, when in reality there is little to no true AI involved. And since most people barely understand what AI really is, for no fault of their own, they fall for all the gimmickry. A survey conducted in 2019 found that 40% of the nearly 2,900 AI startups in Europe did not use AI in any substantial form.", "The fact that terms like AI and machine learning have become bait for VCs globally does not help the cause. Investors line up for anything that remotely claims to be AI-adjacent. In fact, the same survey quoted above, concluded that startups that claim to work in AI attract between 15 to 50 percent more funding compared to other software companies. Startups therefore have an almost legitimate reason to try to position themselves, by hook or crook, in the AI ecosystem.", "If there is one stakeholder group that pays a heavy price for the fast and loose usage of AI jargon by startups, it is potential employees. There are tens of thousands of young professionals, some just out of college, looking to fulfill their dreams of working in the emerging domain of data science and AI. They are lured by the promise of building the next AI unicorn and of getting the opportunity to work on the most cutting-edge analytics problems. The reality though could often be far from this, which would lead to disappointment and regret across the board. The employee is left feeling cheated, and the company has to deal with problems of high employee turnover necessitating knowledge transfer and even rebooting development efforts (always an expensive proposition!).", "Therefore, as a potential employee of an AI startup, you must ask the right questions and assess the depth of what the company is doing or plans to do. And as the founder of an AI or ML startup, you are always better off being upfront with potential team members about what the data science team would be expected to do.", "Having been in the domain of data science, AI and machine learning for the last 15 odd years, I come across many disillusioned young people who thought they were signing up for a glorious career, but instead found out that most of their time was spent in cleaning or labeling datasets. Following is a list of questions I always advise them to ask when they interview for a job with an AI startup. These not only help a potential employee better appreciate what he/she is getting into, it also demonstrates to the founders that you understand the nuances involved.", "This is an important distinction. The work one does in an AI services company will be very different from that in a products company. While services would usually provide more variety, building a product would go into far greater depth.", "Services work would in most cases be like consulting, i.e. delivering AI solutions or models to clients to solve specific problem statements. Therefore, it is vital to ask what sort of problem statements does the startup work on for its clients? Is there a wide variety in the problem statements or is there a well-defined set they address?", "Also, what part of the services delivery would you be expected to get involved in \u2014 data aggregation/cleansing, model building, manual training set creation etc.? It is important to realize that there will always be grunt work involved but having some sense of the proportion of time expected to be spent on actual model development, research on techniques etc. is always helpful.", "The vast majority of AI startups would fall in the products bucket. But not all products are the same. Being able to understand a little more about the type of product a startup is building can provide insights into the kind of data science or machine learning work that may be involved. Provided below is a broad guide for types of products that startups could typically be involved with.", "Once you understand the type of AI product being built, dig deeper to find out what specific aspect of product development would you be involved in? It\u2019s also often helpful to understand the medium and long term product vision \u2014 startup founders would usually (hopefully!) have a fair idea about how they envision their product to evolve.", "This question is important for two reasons. Firstly, it will help you get some insight into product vision. Secondly, it will also help you assess if there are specific skills or languages that you may need to pick up or brush up on if you join the company.", "The reason this question is important is because it helps separate the wheat from the chaff. Startups that are deeply committed to an AI-first strategy, will have a very good understanding of the data they would use for product development. For example, a company that wants to build a product that uses computer vision technology to have machines predict cancer occurrence by analyzing CT scan images, needs to have access to a large repository of images to train and build models.", "If you get a solid answer to this question, you can usually rest assured that the startup is on relatively strong footing.", "You may not need to explicitly ask this question, and instead could just do your own research to find this out. This question is important because AI is a largely technical domain. It is also a dynamic, rapidly evolving domain. Founders (or part of the founding team) having prior experience in the AI space would be critical to ensuring a higher probability of success because they would intimately know the challenges, would be able to guide the teams and shepherd the startup in the right direction.", "The field of AI and data science is undoubtedly one of the most exciting fields today. We have collectively just about started scratching the surface on what\u2019s possible \u2014 the horizons are limitless. The impact that the proliferation of AI will have on the world, is expected to be even more dramatic than that of the industrial revolution.", "Therefore, anyone who gets into this domain early enough, will have tremendous opportunities as the field grows even further. Make a wise choice, make an informed choice. Don\u2019t get sucked into a pipe-dream when countless real and exciting opportunities with startups exist across the globe.", "Your home for data science.
