The goal of this multi-part series is to explain what the matrix profile is and how you can start leveraging STUMPY for all of your modern time series data mining tasks!", "Note: These tutorials were originally featured in the STUMPY documentation.", "Part 1: The Matrix ProfilePart 2: STUMPY BasicsPart 3: Time Series ChainsPart 4: Semantic SegmentationPart 5: Fast Approximate Matrix Profiles with STUMPYPart 6: Matrix Profiles for Streaming Time Series DataPart 7: Fast Pattern Searching with STUMPYPart 8: AB-Joins with STUMPYPart 9: Time Series Consensus MotifsPart 10: Discovering Multidimensional Time Series MotifsPart 11: User-Guided Motif SearchPart 12: Matrix Profiles for Machine Learning", "In this blog, we will use the STUMPY package to look at some of the main takeaways from the research papers: Matrix Profile I & Matrix Profile II.", "To explore the basic concepts, we\u2019ll use the workhorse stumpy.stump() function to find interesting motifs (patterns) or discords (anomalies/novelties) and demonstrate these concepts with two different time series datasets:", "stumpy.stump() is Numba JIT-compiled version of the popular STOMP algorithm that is described in detail in the original Matrix Profile II paper. stumpy.stump() is capable of parallel computation and it performs an ordered search for patterns and outliers within a specified time series and takes advantage of the locality of some calculations to minimize the runtime.", "Let\u2019s import the packages that we\u2019ll need to load, analyze, and plot the data.", "Time series motifs are approximately repeated subsequences found within a longer time series. Being able to say that a subsequence is \u201capproximately repeated\u201d requires that you be able to compare subsequences to each other. In the case of STUMPY, all subsequences within a time series can be compared by computing the pairwise z-normalized Euclidean distances and then storing only the index to its nearest neighbor. This nearest neighbor distance vector is referred to as the matrix profile and the index to each nearest neighbor within the time series is referred to as the matrix profile index (see Part 1: The Matrix Profile for a comprehensive review). Luckily, the stumpy.stump() function takes in any time series (with floating point values) and computes the matrix profile along with the matrix profile indices and, in turn, one can immediately find time series motifs. Let\u2019s look at an example:", "This data was generated using fuzzy models applied to mimic a steam generator at the Abbott Power Plant in Champaign, IL. The data feature that we are interested in is the output steam flow telemetry that has units of kg/s and the data is \u201csampled\u201d every three seconds with a total of 9,600 data points.", "Take a moment and carefully examine the plot above with your naked eye. If you were told that there was a pattern that was approximately repeated, can you spot it? Even for a computer, this can be very challenging. Here\u2019s what you should be looking for:", "The motif (pattern) that we are looking for is highlighted above and yet it is still very hard to be certain that the orange and green subsequences are a match (upper panel), that is, until we zoom in on them and overlay the subsequences on top each other (lower panel). Now, we can clearly see that the motif is very similar! The fundamental value of computing the matrix profile is that it not only allows you to quickly find motifs but it also identifies the nearest neighbor for all subsequences within your time series. Note that we haven\u2019t actually done anything special here to locate the motif except that we grab the locations from the original paper and plotted them. Now, let\u2019s take our steamgen data and apply the stumpy.stump() function to it:", "In this case, based on some domain expertise, we\u2019ve chosen m = 640, which is roughly equivalent to half-hour windows. And, again, the output of stump is an array that contains all of the matrix profile values (i.e., z-normalized Euclidean distance to your nearest neighbor) and matrix profile indices in the first and second columns, respectively (we\u2019ll ignore the third and fourth columns for now). To identify the index location of the motif we\u2019ll need to find the index location where the matrix profile, mp[:, 0], has the smallest value:", "With this motif_idx information, we can also identify the location of its nearest neighbor by cross-referencing the matrix profile indices, mp[:, 1]:", "Now, let\u2019s put all of this together and plot the matrix profile next to our raw data:", "What we learn is that the global minima (vertical dashed lines) from the matrix profile correspond to the locations of the two subsequences that make up the motif pair! And the exact z-normalized Euclidean distance between these two subsequences is:", "So, this distance isn\u2019t zero since we saw earlier that the two subsequences aren\u2019t an identical match but, relative to the rest of the matrix profile (i.e., compared to either the mean or median matrix profile values), we can understand that this motif is a significantly good match.", "Conversely, the maximum value in the matrix profile (computed from stumpy.stump() above) is:", "And the nearest neighbor to this discord has a distance that is quite far away:", "The subsequence located at this global maximum is also referred to as a discord, novelty, or \u201cpotential anomaly\u201d:", "To further develop/reinforce our growing intuition, let\u2019s move on and explore another dataset!", "First, we\u2019ll download historical data that represents the half-hourly average of the number of NYC taxi passengers over 75 days in the Fall of 2014.", "We extract that data and insert it into a Pandas dataframe, making sure that the timestamps are stored as datetime objects and the values are of type float64. Note that we\u2019ll do a little more data cleaning than above just so you can see an example where the timestamp is included. But be aware that stumpy.stump() does not actually use or need the timestamp column at all when computing the matrix profile.", "It seems as if there is a general periodicity between spans of 1-day and 7-days, which can likely be explained by the fact that more people use taxis throughout the day than through the night and that it is reasonable to say most weeks have similar taxi-rider patterns. Also, maybe there is an outlier just to the right of the window starting near the end of October but, other than that, there isn\u2019t anything you can conclude from just looking at the raw data.", "Again, defining the window size, m, usually requires some level of domain knowledge but we\u2019ll demonstrate later on that stumpy.stump() is robust to changes in this parameter. Since this data was taken half-hourly, we chose a value m = 48 to represent the span of exactly one day:", "Let\u2019s understand what we\u2019re looking at.", "The lowest values (open triangles) are considered a motif since they represent the pair of nearest neighbor subsequences with the smallest z-normalized Euclidean distance. Interestingly, the two lowest data points are exactly 7 days apart, which suggests that, in this dataset, there may be a periodicity of seven days in addition to the more obvious periodicity of one day.", "So what about the highest matrix profile values (filled triangles)? The subsequences that have the highest (local) values really emphasizes their uniqueness. We found that the top three peaks happened to correspond exactly with the timing of Columbus Day, Daylight Saving Time, and Thanksgiving, respectively.", "As we had mentioned above, stumpy.stump() should be robust to the choice of the window size parameter, m. Below, we demonstrate how manipulating the window size can have little impact on your resulting matrix profile by running stumpy.stump() with varying windows sizes.", "We purposely chose spans of time that correspond to reasonably intuitive day-lengths that could be chosen by a human.", "We can see that even with varying window sizes, our peaks stay prominent. But it looks as if all the non-peak values are converging towards each other. This is why having a knowledge of the data-context is important prior to running stumpy.stump(), as it is helpful to have a window size that may capture a repeating pattern or anomaly within the dataset.", "When you have significantly more than a few thousand data points in your time series, you may need a speed boost to help analyze your data. Luckily, you can try stumpy.gpu_stump(), a super fast GPU-powered alternative to stumpy.stump() that gives speed of a few hundred CPUs and provides the same output as stumpy.stump():", "In fact, if you aren\u2019t dealing with PII/SII data, then you can try out stumpy.gpu_stump() using the this notebook on Google Colab.", "Alternatively, if you only have access to a cluster of CPUs and your data needs to stay behind your firewall, then stumpy.stump() and stumpy.gpu_stump() may not be sufficient for your needs. Instead, you can try thestumpy.stumped() function, a distributed and parallel implementation of stumpy.stump() that depends on Dask distributed:", "And that\u2019s it! You have now loaded in a dataset, ran it through stumpy.stump() using the STUMPY package, and were able to extract multiple conclusions of existing patterns and anomalies within the two different time series.
