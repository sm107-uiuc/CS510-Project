I\u2019m not going into what Git is or how to create and use SSH keys in this article. I am going to review some reasons to create a good readme.md file and show some examples of good and poor use of a readme. I will also briefly go over how to create a good readme.md, how to edit your readme.md and list resources I found helpful along my journey of learning.", "First off, what is a readme.md or readme file? A readme.md is a common markdown file easily converted to a text file used for various reasons within a repo. It is what is most visible, when you first go to a repository.", "Second why is a readme file important? Readme\u2019s provide an introduction to the files contained in the repository and they prevent a person viewing or using your repository from needing to read your mind.", "Typical content in an all-purpose, good readme.md would be: the purpose of the repo, who contributed code, instructions on how to use the content within the repo, what technologies were used in the creation of the project or homework and potentially much more. There are also wide range of inputs such as text, links, pictures, screen shots, that could be used to tell a story and document your repo. Specifically for students submitting projects or homework that will be evaluated by a TA, instructor or a potential employer, the readme file provides instructions and direction. Typical good readme\u2019s contain, homework / project name, links to specific files, listing of which files are important, a sentence or two about what worked as well as what didn\u2019t or who worked on the project and can be used to show off your understanding of the required tasks and even the full analysis of the work. A really great readme can also then be easily polished up after grading so that potential employers could easily evaluate your work.", "That should be enough reasons for a good readme, but just in case here are some links to more articles, reviewing why readme files matter.", "Now that the reasons are known, we are back to the question of what makes a good readme?", "For students, this answer is easier to understand. A good readme.md needs to provide instructions to graders about what you did in your homework and which files to open or run. In group projects, a good readme would have who worked on what part of the project, what the project is about, what technology was used and links to any live pages. The best readme files are creative guides that allow a reviewer to understand everything your project is about, who, what, when and how. The worst readme.md provides no or bad information or a large amount of useless information that does not guide a teacher or employer on how to use the code you placed in the repo.", "Why is this a bad readme? The link submitted to the graders means they already know they are grading a bootcamp homework, but it doesn\u2019t tell the grader anything beyond the fact that it is homework. Which file should they open? Is the homework finished? Did I complete all the steps of the homework? (I\u2019m using samples of my own work as examples)", "In this example the readme.md file contains the homework instructions and does (eventually) contain a listing of which files are important, but anyone reviewing would have to search hard to find the information needed and the graders already have the instructions each student was given. This readme doesn\u2019t help explain or guide and is cumbersome to the reviewer.", "Why is this improved? Because it provides better instructions to the grader and explains what files are contained in the repo. This example is an improvement over the previous two.", "This readme is different, in that the bulk of information is contained in a wiki format, so the project can tell a story. The reason it is a good readme is that it specified what the repo is about in the first sentence, then addresses the instructors and TAs who will be grading what they need to do and links all the needed information so that a grader or reviewer doesn\u2019t have to work at understanding what to do.", "I am a teacher\u2019s assistant for a data science bootcamp and we use both GitLab and GitHub. Because the students have to use GitHub to submit their work, the examples I\u2019m using here are specifically GitHub. However the instructions could be applied to any repository.", "The first step is to go to GitHub and create a new repository and choose to include a readme.md file, then git pull this information into your local machine for use. Once that GitHub repo is local you can then copy / paste any starter code into the repo from your GitLab repo and start working. Remember to commit often as you work! When you copy / paste from your GitLab repo, do not copy the readme.md file that provided you instructions into your GitHub repo, just the starter code, data and other file structures needed to complete the homework. After your first commit, go to your remote repo in GitHub and review the files. If you see information in the readme, such as instructions for how to complete the homework, remove this information or edit it. You can delete the readme.md in your local repo and create a blank one or you can edit the file on GitHub by clicking the small pencil icon, making your changes and then committing the readme.", "This is a link to a readme repository I created to help students with their readme file process.", "I will edit this article with a link to a video I am creating demonstrating the above steps for how to update the readme file, once completed. Until then, congratulations on making it to where you are so far in your skills! Keep practicing. If you want to really show off your work, practice your readme.md skills too.", "Here are some links to more resources and articles to review to expand on your skills:", "Your home for data science.
