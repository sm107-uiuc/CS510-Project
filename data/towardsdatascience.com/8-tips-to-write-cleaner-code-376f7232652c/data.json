And maybe you work in a big team with loads of code written every day and sometimes have to go through messy syntax, smashed-together huge blocks of code, and confusing function definitions. Fortunately, there are simple steps to follow to get clean readable code each time with a bit of practice and good habits.", "In this article, I share with you 8 tips that helped me level up my coding skills in Python and that make a huge difference in code readability. Even though my personal experience is Python related, these tips still apply perfectly to other programming languages.", "Let\u2019s start with the first tip:", "As obvious and simple as this tip may seem, the choice of the right IDE can go a long way. In fact, some IDEs are equipped with built-in tools to inspect your code, detect and correct anomalous code in your project. It is also possible to add plugins to give your IDE the same functionalities if it doesn\u2019t come with them.", "It can be extremely helpful to have an IDE that can pinpoint and highlight various code problems especially if you\u2019re new to coding. Plus from a personal experience, using a smart IDE for formatting and structuring can help you develop the good habits you need effortlessly.", "My favorite IDE for Python coding is PyCharm as it offers the possibility to locate dead code, find probable bugs, spelling problems, and improve the overall code structure. You can learn more about PyCharm code inspection below:", "Don\u2019t worry about code efficiency until you have to.", "When coding, you might be tempted to write the most sophisticated and optimized version of every function you write. That\u2019s just what any good developer would do, isn\u2019t it? Well, not necessarily. Overly optimized code can turn into complicated and incomprehensible code. So not only, it takes more time to implement but it also makes you( or whoever works on your code) waste time trying to understand it. Not to mention that it is harder to spot mistakes in a complicated code.", "My advice is to focus on getting correct code and keep optimization efforts to the minimum at first. If you find that your code takes too long to run, try tools like snakeviz to spot the parts of your code that really need optimization and only then start dealing with them. And as Donald Knuth says:", "\u201cPremature optimization is the root of all evil\u201d", "You should write your code as if you\u2019re writing a story that you can read from top to bottom (without having to scroll horizontally). Each line should be easy to read and correspond to one distinctive idea/action.", "For example, you should write this:", "This, not only, has the effect to make your code look cleaner but also has the following advantages:", "Keep away from mile-long functions as much as you can. Your functions should be set to perform one single task and the same goes for your classes.", "This rule is called single-responsibility principle (SRP) and it states that every class or function should have responsibility for a single part of a computer program\u2019s functionality.", "A simple trick to make sure you respect this rule is to take a look at your function name. If you find that your function performs more than its name suggests, chances are that you can split out your code over more than one function. Contrary to big bulks, small chunks make your code easier to read, to debug, and to maintain. Plus, you can gain code efficiency by using the separated functions elsewhere without the need to duplicate code.", "As an example, let\u2019s see two versions of a function that tries to sum the 5 lowest values of a list:", "The name you give to your variables and functions matters. It makes writing your code faster, since remembering what product_number and product_quantity do is much simpler than remembering your typical n and q single-letter variables. As you might have heard:", "If you can name it, you have power over it", "It\u2019s especially true for coding since it\u2019s very important that anyone working on your code can understand exactly what each function or variable does right away. Otherwise, they\u2019ll lose precious time figuring that out on their own.", "If you\u2019re not sure you have the right names, read them with the mindset of someone who doesn\u2019t know what your code is about and see if you can optimize the amount of information they give.", "Is much more clear to understand than this:", "For code formatting, it is easy to fall into incoherence if you don\u2019t follow strict rules at all times. This is especially true when working with others since everyone has their own preferences. To avoid this problem and give your code a readable elegant appearance, the best way to go is to use a standard styling guide and stick to it.", "One of the practical benefits of using a standard coding style is distinguishing elements by naming conventions. For example in the PEP8 style guide, class names use the CapWords convention whereas function names should be lowercase, with words separated by underscores (also know as the snake_case convention \ud83d\udc0d):", "You can take look at the PEP 8 style guide for Python code in the link below:", "Don\u2019t wait until your code is all big and functional to comment it. Good commenting increases significantly your code readability and improves your ability to go back to it at a later time.", "However, you should, also, be careful of excessive commenting. It can have the opposite effect and make your code look messy and hard to read.", "A rule of thumb you can use to know when it\u2019s a good idea to comment is to see whether or not your comment provides information your code reader doesn\u2019t have at that point. For example, you should do this:", "Remember the last time you had to watch a presentation with an endless list of bullet points and no spacing between the lines? Remember how difficult it was for you to stay concentrated and read through the points? Well, the same goes for code writing.", "Reading smashed-together, spaceless code is not the most pleasant experience. In fact, eyes have a hard time going through solid blocks of text, which is why it is extremely important to exploit the power of whitespaces. Don\u2019t hesitate to add blank lines to separate code blocks and avoid sticking too much code in one line. When it comes to code readability, segmenting your code into distinguishable parts and keeping your lines nice and short goes a long way.", "You can clearly see the difference between:", "Keep in mind that you can optimize your code readability at any stage. If you find it hard to think about what to write while worrying about how to write it, you can always go back once your code is complete to round off the edges. And hopefully, with a bit of practice, coding best practices will become automatic habits that you don\u2019t even think about.", "I hope these tips gave you some ideas to better your code writing. If you have other good practices don\u2019t hesitate to share them.", "Thank you for your interest, stay safe and I will see you in the next article! \ud83d\ude0a", "Your home for data science.
