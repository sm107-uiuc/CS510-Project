I\u2019m hoping that after reading this you have a different perspective of what DL is.", "I just created this timeline based on several papers and other timelines with the purpose of everyone seeing that Deep Learning is much more than just Neural Networks. There has been really theoretical advances, software and hardware improvements that were necessary for us to get to this day. If you want it just ping me and I\u2019ll send it to you. (Find my contact in the end of the article).", "Deep Learning has been around for quite a while now. So why it became so relevant so fast the last 5\u20137 years?", "As I said before, until the late 2000s, we were still missing a reliable way to train very deep neural networks. Nowadays, with the development of several simple but important theoretical and algorithmic improvements, the advances in hardware (mostly GPUs, now TPUs), and the exponential generation and accumulation of data, DL came naturally to fit this missing spot to transform the way we do machine learning.", "Deep Learning is an active field of research too, nothing is settle or closed, we are still searching for the best models, topology of the networks, best ways to optimize their hyperparameters and more. Is very hard, as any other active field on science, to keep up to date with the investigation, but it\u2019s not impossible.", "A side note on topology and machine learning (Deep Learning with Topological Signatures by Hofer et al.):", "Methods from algebraic topology have only recently emerged in the machine learning community, most prominently under the term topological data analysis (TDA). Since TDA enables us to infer relevant topological and geometrical information from data, it can offer a novel and potentially beneficial perspective on various machine learning problems.", "Luckily for us, there are lots of people helping understand and digest all of this information through courses like the Andrew Ng one, blog posts and much more.", "This for me is weird, or uncommon because normally you have to wait for sometime (sometime years) to be able to digest difficult and advance information in papers or research journals. Of course, most areas of science are now really fast too to get from a paper to a blog post that tells you what yo need to know, but in my opinion DL has a different feel.", "We are working with something that is very exciting, most people in the field are saying that the last ideas in the papers of deep learning (specifically new topologies and configurations for NN or algorithms to improve their usage) are the best ideas in Machine Learning in decades (remember that DL is inside of ML).", "I\u2019ve used the word learning a lot in this article so far.

From Wolfram MathWorld.", "So is the case lost? Actually no. If we find a way of representing this data in a different way, in a way we can draw a straight line to separate the types of data. This is something that math taught us hundreds of years ago. In this case what we need is a coordinate transformation, so we can plot or represent this data in a way we can draw this line. If we look the polar coordinate transformation, we have the solution:", "And that\u2019s it now we can draw a line:", "So, in this simple example we found and chose the transformation to get a better representation by hand. But if we create a system, a program that can search for different representations (in this case a coordinate change), and then find a way of calculating the percentage of categories being classified correctly with this new approach, in that moment we are doing Machine Learning.", "This is something very important to have in mind, deep learning is representation learning using different kinds of neural networks and optimize the hyperparameters of the net to get (learn)the best representation for our data.", "This wouldn\u2019t be possible without the amazing breakthroughs that led us to the current state of Deep Learning.
