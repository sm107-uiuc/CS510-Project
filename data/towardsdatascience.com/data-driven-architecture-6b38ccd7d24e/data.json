The best decisions, according to Ayres, are made at the intersection of expertise and data. The world of architecture is full of highly educated and experienced professionals, but there is a scarcity of architectural insights from data.", "Before data science, I studied and practiced architecture for nearly a decade. Over time, it became very clear that architecture is a profession built heavily on experience. When designing a building, architects often lean on history, experience, and intuition. One might hear phrases in the office such as:", "Even when architects are confronted with a new design problem, we tend towards solutions that are tried and true. From there, we make smaller tweaks and fine-tune the building design to uniquely suit the client\u2019s needs and desires.", "That being said, my argument is this: architects should prioritize data-driven decision-making in the design process. Experience and expertise is and will continue to be important, but it is given too much weight. Data and experience should work hand-in-hand, as Ayres suggests. Too often we rely on \u201cbest practices\u201d that may come from dated experience, while building users\u2019 needs and desires are always changing with the times. To remedy this, we should design continuous feedback loops from users \u2014 before design, as well as during occupancy. Data can tell us what people really want in all kinds of building typologies: the workplace, the classroom, or the hospital. The problem is \u2014 feedback isn\u2019t viewed as an essential step in the architectural design process.", "Despite this dearth in architectural data collection, there is at least one method that some architects are currently employing. This method is called a \u201cPOE\u201d or \u201cPost-Occupancy Evaluation.\u201d A POE can take many forms \u2014 like in-person interviews, phone calls, or on-site observations. But most often, a POE takes the form of an emailed survey (think SurveyMonkey) sent to the building users. The survey might ask questions regarding building acoustics, thermal comfort, lighting, general aesthetics, and more. Questions are presented in different formats \u2014 such as a rating scale, multiple choice, or open-ended response. For example:", "Do you find your work environment to be:", "On a scale of 1\u201310, how well are you able to focus in your current work environment? Please explain your rating.", "POEs are most often done for large building typologies such as: healthcare, higher education, and commercial. Let\u2019s use a newly designed office building as an example. After the building is complete, tenants move in and are given some time to settle and adjust to the new environment. After a year or so has elapsed, the architect will send the POE to the building owner, who forwards the survey to the tenants. Tenants fill out this POE, which is sent to the building owner, which is finally sent back to the architect.", "Assuming most of the questions are presented in a structured format (that is, mostly multiple-choice and rating scales), then the data can be quickly analyzed without much cleaning to identify design trends. These trends can be organized by building type and can be publicized internally to assist designers in making decisions. Trends from user feedback can identify spaces, design elements, and systems that users really like and don\u2019t like. They can show where the design is working and where it is not.", "Carefully curated survey data can provide insights into common user behavior. For office typologies, a survey can answer:", "\u201cWhich spaces do employees use the most?\u201d", "\u201cIs this open-office concept really working well for these users, or is it distracting?\u201d", "\u201cDo smaller conference rooms really need natural daylight, and why?\u201d", "In essence, POE data can eliminate guesswork about what people want in a building and in the spaces within it. Sounds great, right?", "The problem is: clients often cut these POE surveys from the scope of work to save money. In the Owner-Architect Agreement, it is often presented to the client as an \u201ca-la-carte\u201d option. This makes it easy for clients to opt-out when it comes to scope and contract negotiations. Leaders of large practices should consider POEs as a requirement to the scope of work for every project. POEs should no longer be optional for architectural services to keep up with technological and behavioral change of building users.", "KieranTimberlake is an architecture firm in Philadelphia that collects and uses many forms of data throughout their design process. Its co-founder Stephen Kieran once said:", "\u201cOur bodies get [regular] checkups, so should our buildings.\u201d", "Just as the body ages and changes over time, so does a building. POE data collection should occur not just once, but on regular intervals throughout a building\u2019s lifetime, to make sure it is working optimally. A building may remain for nearly a century or more \u2014 however, change is inevitable. Building occupants will change, the way people behave will change, and what they demand out of the building will change. For example, an old plane hangar may become the next Google headquarters!", "Data already drives so many decisions in our world: which ads to show on social media, which button is most enticing to click, the list goes on. So perhaps the future of architecture also hinges upon data. For example, occupant sensors in buildings can already collect data about human activity to control lighting and HVAC for optical and thermal comfort in buildings. But what if architecture took a lesson from the world of tech \u2014 and found a way to continuously collect data about occupant comfort and satisfaction with a building over time?", "It turns out, KieranTimberlake has already developed a web-based survey app to address this. The app is named \u201cRoast.\u201d Roast measures occupant comfort across many variables, including: temperature, humidity, personal activity level, air movement, air quality, visual stimulation, and auditory stimulation.", "Roderick Bates, a researcher at KieranTimberlake, tells us:", "\u201cSometimes uncomfortable buildings are not a product of poor design but rather a lack of information\u2026without understanding how people feel, you\u2019re in the dark.\u201d", "The lesson learned here is that the best-performing spaces for building users depend on many variables. Even when the best architects listen to their clients and give them exactly what they ask for, the building still may not ideally serve its users over time. We need to listen to users continuously to understand what they need and when they need it.", "To catapult building design into the next decade, architecture firms should consider doing these three things with data:", "Your home for data science.
