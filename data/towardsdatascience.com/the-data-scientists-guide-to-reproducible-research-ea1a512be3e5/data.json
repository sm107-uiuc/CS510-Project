However minor reproducibility might seem at a given time, it is actually one of the most important factors that will effect your research within the realms of any applied science. This impact is only illustrated further with data-science, as often generalized data can lead to misleading conclusions and false theories that do more harm than good.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how ground-breaking your discovery might be; you could discover that wearing polyester directly correlates with developing terminal illness, or even find the cure for cancer, or", "The fact of the matter is that if you design an experiment that is inherently not reproducible, then you are destroying the venerability of your observations obtained from that experiment. Fortunately, with the tremendous technology that scientists (and even more so, Data-Scientists) have at their finger tips, making your research reproducible and known is easier than it ever has been before.", "Jupyter-Notebook is most likely one of the greatest pieces of software attributing to the ease of computing reproducible. For those who are not already using Jupyter-Notebook, the software allows you to access a server which will run a virtual kernel to execute cell-level code from your web-browser. Not only is this incredibly convenient for large pools of scientific peers who might be working on projects interchangeably together, but also makes a valiant stride towards emulating thoughts and ideas in controlled bursts of code for other scientists to review.", "Let\u2019s not forget that one of the other incredibly important steps in the scientific process is peer review. Humans by nature are flawed in terms of bias. Where there is data, unfortunately there is also potential to skew said data to perform to potential biases that a scientist may have, regardless of whether the scientist is aware of this happening or not. Let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019ve all performed a test we were super excited about and had to do an about face and\u2026", "I can certainly understand why accepting the null can be discouraging. While it is certainly true that accepting the null means that your scientific idea did not pass your test, accepting the null still pushes science forward because now we know that on at least one occasion it was statistically inaccurate. So while it can be hard not to skew research, regardless of the direction that your research goes it is certainly something to be proud of.", "While Jupyter-Notebooks are an incredibly handy tool that certainly makes scientific computing as brilliant as it could be, you can still be digging your own grave on reproducibility. by not outlining your notebooks properly. This can range from simply commenting your code effectively to writing full paragraphs in markdown explaining your thoughts and scientific process. This is obviously very important, but it might not be important for the reason you think it is.", "Regardless of experience, time-spent, or practice, all humans are prone to errors. With peer reviews, and the power of the internet, any bugs, mathematical mishaps, or simple things you might have overlooked can quickly be assessed by your peers, and can potentially entirely shift the scope of your research. On top of that, your research could in turn inspire your fellow scientists to take part in similar research, furthering the development on your hypothesis and others like it.", "Though I certainly don\u2019t like to speak on what you absolutely must do in certain situations, I think it is very important to explain your train of thought when working in something like a notebook. I personally also like to section off my observations with big titles, paragraphs, conclusions, and inferences. If you would like to go above and beyond you could even potentially create something like a table of contents for your notebook. This is especially useful if you have a very long notebook with multiple sections.", "Of course, the absolute catalyst for reproducible research is data.", "All of these questions very easily factor into whether or not your analytical observations will even be considered by a community of your peers. Data sources are important, and ideally in most situations these sources will primary; meaning directly connected to an observation.", "While it might not be feasible for everyone to have an open-data policy and share their findings, at the very least those finding should be reproducible and accurate. It can be rather difficult to find accurate data sources that aren\u2019t collected by yourself, which is why I always recommend collecting public resource data from either the government, who have a legal responsibility to release much of their data into the public domain, or you could always get data from a trusted source like a university.", "One tremendous stumbling point in your work could be using the wrong tool for the wrong job. This could cause potential inaccuracies in your research, and is the reason why it is typical for research to be peer-reviewed. These mistakes aren\u2019t necessarily hard to make, and with that in mind I would say it is a better idea to avoid using the wrong tool for the job. For example, I wouldn\u2019t want to perform something like a binary signs test with a T-distribution. This would make the test useless, and yield very misleading results. Instead, for a binary figure I would use a distribution that better suites such a thing, like binomial distribution.", "Although many scientists might shrug their shoulders to the concept of reproducible research, it is a very necessary concept to abide to. If research is not easily reproduced, then the research often falls flat on its face. With modern computing and the power of the internet, the powers of research that can easily be repeated have become even more obvious. Furthermore, research is more mainstream than it ever has been, meaning that your research often needs to be more credible because of its reach. Fortunately, there are many situations where putting in a little extra work with notebook and data organization that can allow your findings to be far more conclusive and expansive than they would be otherwise.", "Your home for data science.
