The current report from Glassdoor states the average salary of a US data scientist \u2014 all industries, all company types, irrelevant of the work experience \u2014 is $113.3K per year. For comparison, the median pay in the US for the first quarter of 2020 is $49.7K.", "Now that\u2019s for the US only, and actual numbers differ from country to country, but let\u2019s assume the ratios are more or less the same \u2014 on average, average data scientist earns roughly 2x more than the average resident, anywhere in the world.", "But how can one go from $113K to $200K while working on the same job? That\u2019s where the power of side income comes into play. And you, as a data scientist, have the potential to earn a lot of it.", "There are multiple reasons why. Let\u2019s explore the trends for data science and machine learning through Google Trends:", "This is 5 years worth of data, and there appears to be a strong relationship between these two terms (as expected). Also, we can clearly see that the trend is positive. I doubt we can expect any drastic changes any time soon.", "Another obvious reason is the plain value of your skills. I see so many beginners in various Facebook groups asking questions anybody with 6 months of experience can answer without breaking a sweat. Teaching basics to complete beginners could be a viable way to go, but more on that in a bit.", "In today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll share with you my top 3 ways of making an extra income that I use on a daily basis. These 3 enabled me to increase my earnings by a factor of 2.5 in less than a year. Most of the side income comes from the #1 tip, so let\u2019s jump straight to it.", "Having a blog impacts every aspect of your professional life. I\u2019ve dedicated the whole article to this topic, so feel free to read it:", "To recap, here are the top benefits of blogging:", "I advise you to go through the article for in-depth explanations, as it\u2019s only a 5-minute read. Writing data science articles, or articles on any tech topic requires a good understanding of the topic first. Being a successful blogger requires you to explain the complex topics with the most simple words, which then further helps your understanding.", "I know what your thinking right now \u2014 I need to have years and years of experience before I start writing \u2014 and that can\u2019t be further away from the truth. The reality is, you need to be only one step ahead of your target reader. That\u2019s it. Let me elaborate.", "Let\u2019s say you want to write about Principal Component Analysis. To do so, you need a decent understanding of the topic, and your target reader is either someone who doesn\u2019t know anything about PCA or doesn\u2019t understand it well enough. Hence, you\u2019re only one step ahead of your reader, as you know PCA well enough to explain it.", "Plus, writing an educational article is a great motivation for learning some topic in the first place. Just take it easy and don\u2019t overthink things. No one will resent you getting some bits wrong, and even if someone does, that\u2019s their problem.", "There\u2019s still a high chance of someone with nothing else to do correcting your grammar, even if you do everything right, so just learn to ignore it.", "I found educational videos to be a great way to supplement your blog. Having the same topic covered in text and video format makes your content that much more visible.", "Not everyone wants to read through a tough tech article. Also, some topics are just too visual to be explained in depth with text. I always remember the linear algebra videos from 3Blue1Brown. Can you imagine learning complex topics like linear algebra from a textbook? That\u2019s most likely how you learned it in the first place, but how good was your understanding?", "I\u2019m willing to take a bet you\u2019ve remembered how to calculate things just for the exam's sake, but completely missed the bigger picture of how things work on a visual level. No shame in that, as we\u2019ve all been there. I repeat \u2014 some things are just better explained by the video.", "Okay, so what are your options for making data science videos?", "Well, the first and the most obvious one is YouTube. You can upload basically anything there, as long as it doesn\u2019t violate their content policies, but it\u2019s hard for beginners to get monetized. Let me explain why.", "To get monetized on YouTube, you need at least 1000 subscribers and at least 4000 public watch hours in the last year. And that\u2019s not that easy of a task for a beginner. My channel isn\u2019t there yet, but I hope it will be soon. You need to put in a lot of hours before seeing results, and making videos, in general, takes a lot more time than you would think.", "I know I felt tired AF after making my first video, even though I had the code already prepared.", "Neither am I, and I\u2019m not the most comfortable with the idea of speaking English for a world to hear. Google Slavic accents \u2014 you\u2019ll immediately understand why. You could either:", "The latter option got me covered, as these tools are getting better over time. IBM\u2019s Watson TTS is a great way to get started for cheap.", "If you think YouTube is too saturated, there are other platforms to consider. One that comes into mind is Udemy, but I don\u2019t have any experience with them so I\u2019ll leave that for you to research.", "Every now and then you\u2019ll read a great book or watch a great course. There\u2019s no reason not to share it with your audience if you think it\u2019s something they could benefit from.", "You could recommend the book or a course in two ways:", "The only difference being the affiliate links will earn you some money for every purchase/subscription, while the normal ones won\u2019t. If someone decides to but a book or a course, the type of link doesn\u2019t matter to them. Also, if they like your content, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll want to support you.", "One of my recent articles is a great example of this idea:", "So, in a nutshell, I read a great book. I was 100% sure at least someone from my audience could benefit from it, so I\u2019ve written a short review and placed an affiliate link. It\u2019s a win-win situation.", "However, you should be careful with affiliate marketing. I will never recommend something I haven\u2019t personally read or watched and aren\u2019t 100% satisfied with. That\u2019s a big no-no of affiliate marketing, as readers can easily sense when you don\u2019t have an idea what you\u2019re talking about.", "Amazon has an amazing affiliate program I use to recommend high-quality books. Udemy has a great program I use to recommend online courses.", "You have great earning potential as a data scientist, and it shouldn\u2019t be limited only to what the company you work for is willing to pay you. Scaling your side hustles over time will double your income \u2014 guaranteed. It\u2019s up to you to work your ass off until it happens, but it will happen inevitably.", "Then you are free to choose if 9\u20135 is actually worth it, as the majority of your side income will be passive, which means you won\u2019t need to actually work for it.", "Just put in the time and trust in the process. You\u2019ll get there.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
