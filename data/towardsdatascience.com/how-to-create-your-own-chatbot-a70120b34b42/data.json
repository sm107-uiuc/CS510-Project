No worries, I shall show you how to create a chatbot so that you can talk to a robot version of yourself.", "Jokes aside, chatbots have quite a few use cases:", "There are a lot of chatbot services out there but this article will be focusing on Dialogflow by Google. This article will walk you through creating a chatbot for my fictitious business \u2014 Pizzaeiou. As you may guess, we sell pizza. Since we are having cash flow issues, I will have to ensure that my chatbot service is free. When we are no longer having cash flow issues, I can then check out their pricing scheme to upgrade my chatbot.", "A chatbot starts with an agent. I shall name my agent as agent 1 because I am not creative enough to come up with a name. An agent is responsible for storing intents, entities, contents and fulfilment. In short, the agent is your chatbot.", "After heading over to Dialogflow and logging into the console with my personal Gmail account, I am greeted by this page:", "Let\u2019s go ahead and create an agent:", "Once I created my agent, I will be greeted with 2 default intents:", "Intents are like topics. Whenever my customers ask agent_1 something, agent_1 will try to classify the question under an intent/a topic.", "If the question is too complex for agent_1, the question will fall under Fallback Intent, where the agent will provide standardised replies for all the questions that she does not understand.", "The second default intent is the Welcome Intent. Yes, you are right. Welcome intent provides default replies for customers who greet agent_1.", "Throughout this article, I will be testing my chatbot regularly. Whenever we configure our agent, we have firstly, save the agent. This will allow Dialogflow to train our agent. Secondly, we can key in any commands we want into the chat on the right. We can then observe the output by agent_1.", "Let\u2019s create an intent for pizza orders. In any intents, there are training phrases. These are phrases that customers will key in. Remember to use a wide variety of phrases so that our agent can be smarter.", "Of course with questions, there have to be responses (ignore the $ signs for now, we will get to that later):", "After testing agent_1, we found that it is working!", "It\u2019s great that agent_1 can reply to pizza orders. But, what is pizza? What is bacon? What are strawberry milkshakes? To agent_1, this is a very foreign term. As such, let\u2019s define entities. Entities help to identify the Who, What, Where, When in your sentences.", "Let\u2019s define an entity to help agent_1 understand pizza toppings:", "In my pizza_topping entity, I specified all the toppings that Pizzaeiou offers. By ticking the \u201cDefine synonyms\u201d box, I allow different words to arrive at the same root word, as seen by the 3rd row, bacon example.", "By ticking the third box \u201cAllow automated expansion\u201d, we can allow agent_1 to learn new words. For instance, if all the customers are requesting \u201capple\u201d as a pizza topping, agent_1 will automatically include apple into this entity. Of course, no one would like apple as a pizza topping.. and hence, I shall not be ticking this box.", "With our entities defined, let\u2019s put it to use. Let\u2019s annotate our training phrases in our pizza.order intent:", "2. Search for our pre-defined pizza_topping entity:", "3. Agent_1 now recognises chicken as a pizza topping:", "Several entities can be defined or are readily available:", "Of course, we have to specify the type of flavours that we offer:", "\u201cMy customers always order a pizza. How am I supposed to know if they want a chocolate pizza or a chicken pizza?! When do they want it?! Do they want a personal pizza or a large pizza?!\u201d \u2014 Agent_1", "Agent_1 is now fed up. She has problems trying to fulfil orders. Let\u2019s help her out by ensuring that our customers always provide the size, time and toppings:", "2. Create actions and parameters. Tick the required parameters and define prompts if the user failed to provide the parameters", "3. Modify our responses. Include the parameters with a \u201c$\u201d sign.", "As you can see, with a vague request, agent_1 proceeds to interrogate our customers for more information.", "Since Pizzaeiou is experiencing cash flow issues, we should start to upsell drinks to those who wants pizza. Currently, this is how the conversation will go:", "Customer: I would like a small mushroom pizza now", "Agent_1: Sure, would you like any drinks?", "In this situation, there is no context. Agent_1 is unable to understand the flow of the conversation. Hence, let\u2019s create an upsell_drink_yes intent and an upsell_drink_no intent. Before that, we have to modify our pizza.order intent to produce an upsell-drink context:", "The number 5 states the number of interactions that this context will persist. We can then set the input context of our upsell_drinks_yes and upsell_drinks_no intent to the output of our pizza.order intent, and specify some sample training phrases:", "Now that we have received an order, we need to push it to a data store so that Pizzaeiou\u2019s kitchen can get the order! This can be done via fulfilment. There are 2 types of fulfilment:", "Let\u2019s export agent_1 so that she can live forever in the cloud:", "Voila! We have successfully created a chatbot for Pizzaeiou. We can now leave our customer support personnel to tackle more complex issues instead of taking orders.", "To make it fully functional, consider creating more intents, entities and contexts such that your chatbot will sound as humanly as possible. Do also try creating a chatbot for different purposes as mentioned in the Introduction.", "Your home for data science.
