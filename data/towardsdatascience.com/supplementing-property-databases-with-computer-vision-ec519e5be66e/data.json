These databases, however, are costly to maintain, and they often contain a significant number of missing, incorrect or out-of-date records. Computer vision models, coupled with accessible satellite and street-level imagery, can identify incorrect data and impute missing records when these models are trained to detect property features. This approach offers a low-cost alternative to collecting data that would otherwise require reporting from an on-site visit, a property manager or an owner.", "At Res-Intel, we are using computer vision models to identify building features that can shed light on a building\u2019s energy usage and retrofit potential. A swimming pool, which is equipped with an electricity-consuming pool-pump, water heater and lights, is a feature that can significantly increase a property\u2019s energy usage. County tax assessors record which properties have a pool, and store this information in a public database. However, we\u2019ve discovered that these records are often incomplete or inconsistent with observation.", "In our analysis of multifamily properties in San Diego, we found that the tax assessor database failed to provide complete pool data for nearly half of all properties we evaluated. To fill in the reporting gaps, we collected satellite imagery data for all multifamily properties and then trained an object detection model to find pools in each property image. We succeeded in imputing the missing records and even discovered some inconsistencies in the tax assessor data that would have otherwise gone unnoticed.", "Among a sample of 10,714 multifamily properties, 42% reporting missing values for the \u201cpool\u201d field in the tax assessor database. The object detection model found 146 pools that were missing from the tax assessor records, which can be viewed on this interactive map.", "Additionally, some of the tax assessor records appear to misreport the existence of a pool at a property: the model detected a pool at 114 properties for which the tax assessor recorded \u201cno pool,\u201d and it did not detect a pool at 29 properties for which it recorded \u201cpool.\u201d The satellite image below features a multifamily property which the tax assessor reports as having a pool. It looks as though the property at one time did have a pool, but it has since been filled in with cement, suggesting that the tax assessor record is simply out-of-date.", "Although the object detection methods often find mistakes in public records, it is important to remember that no model is perfect. Indeed, our manual inspection of the prediction data led us to find a handful of false-positives\u2014 cases where the model predicts the presence of a pool where there isn\u2019t one. The image below features an example where the model mistakes a blue tarp laid out on a rooftop for a swimming pool.", "The effects of model prediction errors can be mitigated or even eliminated by simply circumscribing how predictions are used. In a case where the pool detection model contradicts the property database records, for example, we can choose to believe the model only if it predicts the presence of a pool with greater than 90 percent confidence.", "The object detection model we use to find property features is the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model developed by Joseph Redmon, available here. There are currently a wide array of popular object detection models, all of which are extensions of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). CNNs classify a single image by extracting a series of underlying pixel-based features and determining the relationship between those features and a set of object classes. A pool, tile rooftop or car are examples of object classes that might be visible in a satellite image. A trained CNN model can predict the probability that a collection of pixels represents a pool or any other visible object. The YOLO model, and object detection models generally speaking, extend the CNN by iterating its predictions over proposed regions within a larger image.", "Training a detection model is the process of calibrating the weights assigned to features that are used to predict presence of an object in an image. The weights are determined through gradient descent, an iterative process that finds the value of the weights that minimizes the prediction error (or some value proportional to the error).", "Determining prediction error requires a ground truth dataset, a series of images where objects are labelled by hand. Our unit of observation is an aerial image of a single property, so we begin by exporting property-level images from a high-resolution satellite imagery raster file. Identifying individual properties requires superimposing a property boundary shapefile on the raster data. With the property images in-hand, we use YoloLabel to label the ground truth dataset, which (as you might guess from the name) exports image labels in a text file format that transfers easily to the YOLO model.", "In total, we labelled about 2,000 pool images and split them into validation and a training sets. The training images are used directly to calibrate the model weights through gradient descent, while the validation images are set aside and used later to measure how accurately the model detects objects in images it has not already seen.", "Training a neural network model is a computationally-intensive task. The computation required is lessened by the fact that the CNN models are pretrained to extract useful image features; but the thousands of parameters that connect these features to particular objects remain free to be optimized by the iterative gradient descent process. This highly multidimensional optimization problem typically requires the memory and computing power offered by high-performance graphics processing units (GPUs). Fortunately, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers remote elastic computing (EC2) servers that have powerful GPUs and can be rented hourly at a low cost. We use a p2.xlarge EC2 server that comes with a singe 61 GB memory GPU, and a pre-installed CUDA and TensorFlow libraries \u2014 these are required to leverage the GPU for neural network modeling. Training the pool detection model takes about 18 hours.", "The most important test of a model is how accurately it detects objects in images it has not yet encountered. Our validation set included 268 properties, 69 with a pool and 199 without one. The pool detection model accurately predicts the presence and location of a pool for all but two of the validation properties (AUC = 0.997). The two incorrect predictions were false negatives: though the model did detect the pools at these properties, it reported slightly less than 50 percent confidence. All-in-all the pool detection model proves to be very reliable.", "It is also common practice to evaluate the quality of an object prediction by comparing its predicted bounding box with the ground truth, as measured by an overlap statistic or normalized distance between the two. These statistics, however, are not always effective at conveying intuition about model performance. Alternatively, we can visually inspect a subset of the images and verify that the pool bounding boxes form at the correct locations. The animation above showcases a random selection of model-generated bounding boxes, which accurately form around the target locations.", "Res-Intel uses object detection models, grounded in neural networks, as a low-cost tool for identifying property features that affect a building\u2019s energy consumption. We combine this data with aggregated utility-supplied data and records from multiple property databases to create building-level energy profiles at mass-scale. We\u2019ve worked with several large utilities to construct and analyze building portfolios, model energy consumption data and design research to evaluate energy efficiency programs and technologies.", "Your home for data science.
