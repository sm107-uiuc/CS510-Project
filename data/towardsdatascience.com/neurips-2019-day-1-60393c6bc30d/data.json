This year it is in a beautiful Canadian city Vancouver and has more than 10,000 attendees. Total of 6734 papers were submitted out of which 1428 papers were accepted. You can see it is easy to be overwhelmed not only by the number of people attending, but of the flow of information.", "The information about the other days of the conference can be found here:", "The first day (Monday) was given to tutorials. There were three tutorial tracks, and each tutorial session lasted around two hours. I decided to attend three tutorials: Deep learning with Bayesian Principles, Interpretable Comparison of Distributions and Models and Synthetic control.", "The slides of the first of these tutorials can be found here. There are two things which I noticed. First, rather than doing full Bayesian inference on a Neural network (which we know is intractable), the author\u2019s attention is on the optimization algorithms. Indeed, he shows, that many optimization algorithms can be derived from Bayesian principles. For example, Gradient Descent can be derived from Gaussian model with isotopic covariance. RMSProp corresponds to multivariate Gaussian with diagonal covariance matrix. Other optimization algorithms, like Adam, can also be traced to Bayesian principle. Indeed, following this methodology one can derive other optimization algorithms, as was shown in the presentation. These optimizations give superior results for some tasks.", "The second interesting point the author makes is that using Bayesian principles we can not only explore the parameter space, but also the input space by assigning the importance of each example. The idea that the importance of each example is different from the other one is pretty old and is a foundation of Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm. Indeed, the border examples are more important in setting up decision boundary than the examples that are far from the decision boundary. It is possible to re-surface this concern using Bayesian learning, where the important examples are selected at each step. This is similar to the Bayesian Optimization algorithm, but goes well beyond the simple Gaussian Process assumption. In fact, selecting the most important examples at each learning step is how humans learn, according to the author.", "Let me jump to the first day keynote by Celeste Kidd, precisely about how people learn. She is the founder of Kidd Lab at University of California, Berkeley, where she studies the process of cognition on babies. Their way of learning is in fact active, selecting activities that helps them form more complex beliefs. The lab uses eye tracking and other cues to judge babies\u2019 attention. Babies show little attention to the predictable observations, because they do not learn much from it. They also don\u2019t show much attention to the very novel observations from which they cannot learn much. There is a Goldilocks area in the middle that maximizes learning. Also when faced with ambiguity, they take action to resolve or de-confound the ambiguity.", "Going back to the tutorials, the second was presented by the group of three people and has a very narrow scope: comparison between distributions. I did not find the slides for this one, but you can check later the tutorial\u2019s page. It had a very deep theoretical review about the types of divergence: the Integral Probability metrics is based on the difference between the distributions, and the \u03c6-divergences are based on the ratio of the distributions. Examples of the first class are MMD and Wasserstein distance. An example of the latter is KL-divergence. What was surprising to me was that Kernels are back! In the first tutorial Kernels were also used. Here they are used to model MMD and other divergences of the same family. It happens that the choice of the kernel is very important here, and there is a lot of ideas in the community which of them work better for a particular task. Obviously the divergence between distributions has to be estimated based on the data sample, which brings us back to the statistical hypothesis testing. The null hypothesis here is that both distributions are the same, but the MMD distribution itself is very complex, so the hypothesis testing is very difficult, and there are many ideas in the community how to overcome the difficulties. It is also possible to use the same methodology for a goodness of fit test, in which case one can use Stein operator and Kernel Stein discrepancy to do the test more easily.", "The third tutorial was also lead by the group of three people, including Alberto Abadie, who started this method. The slides are available here. The topic of Synthetic Control is very important, because it is not always possible to do randomized control study. This is a countefactual technique which has one single question: what would have happened if the intervention were not done. Examples, how would British economy develop without Brexit. The methods are surprisingly simple and do not require do-calculus, because they are based on time series forecasting techniques. Some stability issues of these models can be addressed by carefully selecting non-treated examples and enforcing sparse property of the model parameters.", "Finally, in the evening there was the first poster session, which, unfortunately, happened at the same time as the reception. A note to organizers: not a very good idea. Here are some posters that caught my eye.", "I will post more information from the remaining days of the conference\u200a\u2014 stay tuned!", "Your home for data science.
