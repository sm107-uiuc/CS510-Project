We begin by discussing our motivations for this project. We will then discuss the data set and its features. Then our initial data exploration and feature engineering. Finally we will describe the models we used to predict if a site visitor will make a purchase or will not, the results of such models, and the insights we gathered from them. Co-authored by Martin Beck, Yeggi Lee, Tanvi Modi, Sasha Opela, Jackson Ross, Matt Zlotnik as a result of our Business Data Science final project.", "In the U.S. approximately 9% of total retail sales comes from an e-commerce website. In fact, companies like Amazon have created retail empires off being such a huge e-commerce website. With e-commerce becoming more and more prevalent in today\u2019s economy it is important for businesses within this sector to understand what factors into a site visitor making a purchase, and being able to put their attention on potential customers. We thought it would be interesting to look into if it\u2019s possible to predict the buying behavior of a site visitor as this can have many implications such as E-commerce website able to better target ads or figure out factors that may lead to increased sales.", "The data used in this analysis is an Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention data set provided on the UC Irvine\u2019s Machine Learning Repository. The primary purpose of the data set is to predict the purchasing intentions of a visitor to this particular store\u2019s website. The variables in the data set can be split into these three categories: data related to the page that the user lands on, Google Analytics metrics, and user visit data. If you\u2019re curious and want more details about what the data looks like and its features you can check it out here.", "Otherwise, let\u2019s jump right into the exploration. Upon initially exploring the data, the first thing we noticed was the imbalance in the labels. In this data set 85% of the site visitors did not end up making a purchase, the assumption was that majority of people window shop and did usually do not want to commit to a purchase.", "We were also curious to see if perhaps any months in particular stood out or if any months had any higher chances of customers purchasing in one than another, such as in winter around holiday time where people may be making more online purchases due to sales or gift giving. However, we surprisingly saw the most site traffic happened in May with a slump in traffic over summer, whereas the most purchases that occurred happened in November which came out to almost twice as much as the purchases that occurred in May.", "The last thing we noticed was that customers tended to reach the website from the same type of places as shown below. Unfortunately the website that provided the data set does not describe in deeper detail what exactly each traffic type is, we can only assume they correlate with direct forms of traffic, or indirect such as a reference from another page or a Google search.", "To clean the data, we first changed the categorical and Boolean variables (visitor type, month, weekend, revenue) into One-Hot Encoded and dummy variables. Next, we changed all numbers, which were listed as strings in the initial dataset, to integers. Next, we split the data into X and Y data frames and explored correlations within the X data to check for collinearity. We noticed that the page related data was all highly correlated (left), so we replaced those variables with the average time spent on each type of page (right) and eliminated the collinearity problem. With the data now cleaned and collinearity eliminated, we felt comfortable moving onto the analysis portion of our project.", "In our analysis we eventually decided to utilize three different models which were: SGDClassifier, random forest classifier, and XGB Classifier. They were all able to provide us with accuracy scores and AUC scores that were sufficient.", "The first model we tried was a simple linear classification model. For this we utilized sklearn\u2019s SGDClassifier. The estimator uses a linear model with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) learning. At each sample, the gradient of loss is estimated and the model is updated based on the learning rate.", "This simple model with the default parameters actually gave us pretty good results. We managed to get an accuracy score of 87.7% and an AUC score of 0.76 with this model.", "The next model we ran was random forest classifier. Which did require some parameter tuning to optimize its performance. At first we ran the model on all the features of the data set and were able to achieve a higher accuracy of 88.7% however the AUC score of decreased to .728. After extensive tuning, we realized that feature selection was probably the best approach to further increase the accuracy.", "Already having such a good accuracy score and AUC score we decided to try out feature selection to see if it was possible to further increase our model\u2019s scores. Feature selection was done by using sklearn feature_selection\u2019s chi2. It was able to provide us with a list of our features and their importance scores. In the end we chose to remove features that received a score of 3 or less from chi2. That would end up removing 5 features like Jul, OperatingSystems, TrafficType, etc.", "After dropping the least important features we re-ran the random forest model to see if it did produce any better results. The feature selection RF model produced better results than the model that we ran on every feature. It increased the accuracy score to 89.9% and the AUC score to .771", "Our final model we ran on the data set was XGB Classifier with the feature selection we already used previously with the chi2. This ended up being our model with the best AUC score of .773 and with an impressive accuracy of 89.3%. However, even with XGB Classifier being the best model for its AUC score, every model we ran scored within a relatively small range of each other showing that choosing any of the models would have proven sufficient.", "It\u2019s estimated that about 1.92 billion people buy online. That\u2019s roughly around 25% of the world population and what\u2019s more, this number is rising rapidly and expected to hit an impressive 2.14 billion people by 2021. Clearly, being able to predict e-commerce sales from online traffic would prove to be beneficial for any company. Looking at our results, companies should focus on improving mobility between pages to encourage users to browse among different products as Page Value was one of the most important features in determining whether a purchase would be made. Furthermore, certain months such as May and November had a greater frequency in purchases meaning that e-commerce companies should capitalize in these months and provide additional sales and deals to encourage product sales. While there are limitations with our data and its application on a larger scale, our analysis shows that it is possible to predict a site visitors buying behavior within a certain level of confidence based on the features we were able to pull from the data set.", "To further improve this project, we believe data that could better shape the context of the site visitor would be important. Possible data points that could be used are user buying history, third party data, wish lists, etc. It would allow us to better analyze what characteristics and features are important to look at in possible customers. Finally, it could be useful to add class weights which would add a greater penalty to mis-classifying the under-represented class in order to reduce false positives or false negatives. This would reduce bias on the imbalanced data without \u201cover-training\u201d on the under-represented samples.", "If you want to checkout more:", "Github Repository of this project containing code and data set", "UCI\u2019s Machine Learning Repository Data Set: UCI Machine Learning Repository.
