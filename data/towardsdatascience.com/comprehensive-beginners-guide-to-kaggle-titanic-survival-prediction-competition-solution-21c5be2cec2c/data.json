God only knows how many times I have brought up Kaggle in my previous articles here on Medium.", "But my journey on Kaggle wasn\u2019t always filled with roses and sunshine, especially in the beginning. Due to my lack of experience, I was initially struggling to grasp the workflow behind a machine learning project as well as the different terminologies that were being used.", "It was only after months of sifting through online resources which included many technical articles, documentation and tutorial videos that I slowly started to learn concepts like label encoding, cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning.", "I wished back then that there was a one-stop-shop where I could learn not only the steps behind a machine learning project but more importantly the rationale behind doing them. So I thought, why not use the knowledge that I have accumulated over the last few months to create that one-stop-shop to help others who might be going through the same thing as I did?", "In this article, I will explain what a machine learning problem is as well as the steps behind an end-to-end machine learning project, from importing and reading a dataset to building a predictive model with reference to one of the most popular beginner\u2019s competitions on Kaggle, that is the Titanic survival prediction competition.", "This was the project that introduced me to the world of machine learning and also my first competition on Kaggle.", "Actually, before we even get into machine learning, I think it is important that we first understand the purpose behind building a model.", "What is a model and why is it important?", "A model is a simulation and simplification of the real-world.", "Whether you are an engineer building a skyscraper, a hedge fund analyst picking a stock or even a politician who is running for an election, we all deal with uncertainty in this world. A model allows us to minimise this uncertainty and make more informed decisions.", "Now, a model is not perfect and it won\u2019t help us consistently predict the actual outcome of a particular event but we can definitely come very close to it. With large amounts of data, together with the power of artificial intelligence, humans have become increasingly proficient at making high-quality, accurate predictions using models.", "This is where machine learning comes in.", "Machine learning is when computers learn to derive trends and patterns that are present in data. A machine learning model is \u201ctrained\u201d using historical data. Once the model has been built and tested, we can then use it to make future predictions on other data points.", "Machine learning models differ from statistical models such that they require a minimal human effort but more importantly, there are fewer assumptions that that go into a machine learning model than a statistical model. Statistical models are mathematics intensive and based on coefficient estimation. It requires the modeller to understand the relationship between different variables before they can be included in the model.", "For those reasons stated above, machine learning models not only make more accurate predictions but also predictions that are more robust and far exceed the capabilities of any ordinary model.", "For the sake of keeping this article as comprehensive as possible for beginners, I want to also highlight the two main branches of machine learning, that is supervised and unsupervised learning. Understanding the distinction between the two branches will help us think more carefully about the type of problem that we are trying to solve using machine learning.", "Supervised learning is training a model using labelled data. In other words, we are explicitly telling our model the sample outcome of our predictions.", "Supervised learning can be further broken into classification and regression. Classification problems are when the outcome of our predictions and discrete and categorical. Regression, on the other hand, has predictions that are of a continuous distribution.", "To illustrate a classification problem, imagine that you are building a spam classifier which helps classify your emails as either spam or non-spam. What you would do is prepare a training set which contains the different features of your emails like their word count, use of particular words and punctuations and most importantly their labels, spam or non-spam. Then, you can train a machine learning model using this training set and the model will start to learn the relationship between the features and their labels. Once the model has been built to your desired accuracy, you can use this classifier to classify your other emails.", "Regression differs from classification in that, rather than having a discrete target variable such as spam or non-spam, the outcome in a regression problem is continuous. A perfect example of regression is predicting house prices. Here, house prices is a continuous variable. Again, we need to prepare a training set which contains house observations along with their features such as the number of bedrooms, distance away from the city, living room area and of course, their sale prices. A model will then learn how the different house features correlate with the final sale price. Subsequently, we can use this model to make predictions on other houses.", "Now, let\u2019s move on to unsupervised learning.", "As we saw in the spam classifier and house price prediction examples, we included the sample outcome (spam vs non-spam and final sale price) as part of our training set to train our machine learning model.", "In unsupervised learning, we don\u2019t include any sample outcome but instead simply let the model derive any underlying patterns that are present in the data and group them accordingly.", "Since most Kaggle competitions use supervised learning, I won\u2019t go into unsupervised learning in too much detail in this article.", "The aim of this competition is to build a machine learning model that will help us predict the survival outcome of the passengers on the Titanic.", "This is an example of a binary classification problem in supervised learning as we are classifying the outcome of the passengers as either one of two classes, survived or did not survive the Titanic.", "More specifically, we would like to investigate how different passenger features like their age, gender, ticket class etc impact their survival outcome.", "The evaluation metric of this competition is the percentage of passengers in the test set that are correctly predicted by our classifier.", "In this section, I will briefly discuss the steps and results of my analysis of the competition. You can find the complete code for this project on my GitHub.", "There are three types of datasets in a Kaggle competition. In more advanced competitions, you typically find a higher number of datasets that are also more complex but generally speaking, they fall into one of the three categories of datasets.", "Here, I will outline the definitions of the columns in dataset. You can find this information under the data tab of the competition page.", "Exploratory data analysis is the process of visualising and analysing data to extract insights. We will mostly be using the Pandas library for this task. I have an extensive tutorial on Pandas which you can check out here.", "In this section, I will discuss the key results of my EDA. Again, you can find the full analysis on my notebook.", "I first split all the features in the dataset into categorical and numerical variables and analyse them individually to see how each correlate with survival.", "When performing feature analysis, it is important to make the distinction between categorical and numerical variables because it will help us structure our analysis more properly. For instance, we cannot compute the average of a categorical variable such as gender because average can only be applied to a numerical variable which has a continuous distribution of values.", "Categorical variables in the training set are Sex, Pclass and Embarked. Numerical variables, on the other hand, include SibSp, Parch, Age and Fare.", "Below are some of the insights that I have gathered from the EDA process:", "Data preprocessing is the process of getting our training set ready for model training. Here, we deal with missing values, apply data transformation, do feature engineering as well as label encoding.", "I will now briefly go through each of these steps but I highly suggest you refer to my notebook to have a better understanding of what is being discussed here.", "Here comes the most exciting part of the competition, modelling!", "Scikit-learn is one of the most popular libraries for machine learning if you are coding in the Python language. They also have a comprehensive documentation on the tools that are included in the library for data preprocessing, modelling, model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning.", "Before we can fit the training set to our models, we need to first split the training set into predictor variables and response variable.", "I have chosen to fit the training set to ten different classifiers and they are:", "Modelling in Scikit-learn entails three simple steps. Firstly, we need to instantiate our model, that is simply declaring a model and assigning it to a variable. Next, we need to fit the model to our training set, both the predictor variables and the response variable. Finally, we can use this model to make predictions on the test set.", "An important concept in model evaluation is cross-validation. Recall a model that only fits well to training data but unable to make predictions on new data is basically useless. Cross-validation offers a way for us to test the accuracy of our model at predicting new data.", "Cross-validation is the process whereby we repeatedly train our model with only a subset of our training set with the remaining data reserved for testing later on. The reserved data is sometimes called the holdout set.", "Cross-validation provides a more accurate evaluation of model accuracy than merely training accuracy. This is because training accuracy overlooks the problem of overfitting. Overfitting is when our model learns the noise in our data rather than the signal. The idea behind a holdout set is so that our model can be assessed on its ability to predict on data that it was not trained on.", "In my notebook, I went with support vector classifier out of the other models because it had the highest cross-validation mean.", "Hyperparameter tuning is the process of tuning the parameters of the model. Using GridSearchCV, I managed to tune the parameters of my support vector classifier and saw a slight improvement in model accuracy.", "Using my freshly tuned support vector classifier, I made predictions on the test set and managed to achieve a submission score of 0.77511 when submitted to Kaggle. In other words, I successfully predicted 77.5% of the passenger data in the test set.", "I did this project a few months ago and I haven\u2019t really had the chance to revise it and improve my model accuracy. However, here I have several possible extensions that you can potentially add to your project to make it better than mine:", "The Titanic survival prediction competition is an example of a classification problem in machine learning.", "In this project, we analyse different features of the passengers aboard the Titanic and subsequently build a machine learning model that can classify the outcome of these passengers as either survived or did not survive.", "After fitting ten different classifiers to my training data, support vector classifier showed the most promising and accurate prediction results. Therefore, I have chosen this classifier as my model of choice and achieved a submission score of 0.77511, that is I correctly predicted 77.5% of the passenger data in the test set.", "I hope this article and my notebook help you get around the initial hump that I had when I first started learning about machine learning and more importantly, inspire you to participate in more Kaggle competitions in the future.", "You can find the full notebook on my GitHub here. Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions.", "If you prefer learning via video, I have two videos up on my YouTube channel which walks through this project in more detail.
