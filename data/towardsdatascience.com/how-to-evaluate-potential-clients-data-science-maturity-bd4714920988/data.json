The market for data science skills has been, is, and will very likely continue to be terrific.", "On the supply side, bootcamps and MOOCs are revolutionizing education and will continue to allow so many talented individuals from various backgrounds to take part in the spoils of the data economy. Bright academic minds coming out of PhD programs have a fantastic and real opportunities to build life-changing commercial solutions.", "Are you one such individual? Are you looking to engage with a new client? Start with a new employer? Be careful \u2014 look out for the right things to make sure the project will be an opportunity to grow, to contribute, and to be something to look back on with pride and satisfaction. Your environment is an incredibly important factor in determining your trajectory.", "With the commercial success of applied data science, it\u2019s only natural that the domain attracts a fair degree of hype, which in turn, unfortunately, leads to a variety of undesirable consequences. For organizations looking to build or hire talent, that usually means sifting through candidates with questionable attitudes or preparation. For data science professionals \u2014 dealing with clients or employers who lack organizational readiness and data science maturity. This post aims to help professionals evaluate organizations.", "They come in a variety of flavors \u2014 from strategic and cultural, down to the practical. What could they be?", "Excessively \u201cleveraging AI and machine learning\u201d, only on PowerPoint slides?\u201dIt\u2019s going to be a tremendous AI initiative\u201d, despite nobody knowing how, or if AI is really needed?Maybe the ancient version control technique of \u201csave-as-with-suffix\u201d?

Trouble is, you won\u2019t see many of them until you start, or even quite some time after that. That is unless you take a careful look.", "Mind you, stakes are high. An innocent misjudgment may very well lead to a limbo position of an intern with a fancy title. With responsibilities encompassing bits of full stack development, overseeing deployment and also helping out that colleague with their Excel formatting issue on the regular. And no learning. Get off my lawn!", "On the other end, the attitude of expecting the client to be perfect is unreasonable, there is always something to add and improve. It is your responsibility to strive for clarity. It is your responsibility to cultivate beneficial habits and processes. That includes contributing to the improvement of your environment.", "But do the conditions exist for you to do your job? What extra tasks will you be taking on? And do you want to be taking them on? Do they put you on the learning trajectory you want to be on? You spend a large chunk of of your day, your week and your year working. Work should be fun and a source of pride \u2014 this depends on you more than anybody else. That being said, you need certain conditions. Most companies have a compliance process. Why not have your own?", "Let me go through some tests and questions that I use to check out the situation.", "I will note that the relationship with your client is in constant change, and as you establish yourself as a trustworthy and valuable contributor, you will likely gain flexibility, as well as influence over culture and strategy. It\u2019s reasonable to hold off with big demands at the very outset, but also remain mindful of the general level of opportunity a few months down the road, and let that play a role in your decision making.", "What if the opportunity doesn\u2019t check all the boxes, but is very exciting for other reasons? What if you have external pressures to move forward with the job?", "Focus is king. Focus on actions that deliver results, and use those as your leverage to steer everyone towards a better situation. At the very least, you will have contributed something meaningful in the time before your next project.", "I hope that this checklist contributes to your success.
