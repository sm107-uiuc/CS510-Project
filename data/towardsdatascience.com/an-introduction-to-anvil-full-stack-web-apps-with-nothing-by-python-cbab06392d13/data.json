At these companies, data scientists are supported by data engineers, machine learning engineers, application developers, and dev-ops specialists. Instead, they will probably find themselves working in a small team, or even by themselves. This poses major issues when a data scientist wants to get their insights, models, and even products out of Jupyter and into production.", "Anvil fills in these gaps by allowing you to build a full-stack web app using only Python. You can build a user interface with a simple drag and drop UI (or build it with code if you insist), plot with your favorite Python plotting library (Plotly, Matplotlib, etc.), and then deploy to the web in one click. No servers or containers to deal with.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the basic features of Anvil to see how powerful it can be.", "Easily build your UI with a drag and drop interface. Elements like dropdowns, sliders, images, and text are easy to position, no HTML or CSS required.", "You are not locked down to a specific UI. You can position elements to work for your use case. When you have the look you want, you can connect them all together with Python.", "Often a large part of your app will be sharing insights through data visualization. Anvil supports plotting from nearly every popular Python plotting library. Here are the libraries that Anvil has made guides for:", "Plotly has the most direct support due to its front-facing Javascript library, and it\u2019s the library I choose to use. For others, the plots can be displayed by embedding HTML or even an image file. Check out the Anvil plotting guide.", "Simply drag the chart element onto the page, then connect it with Python. A simple bar chart can be made with the following code:", "Often you will want to store some data for your app. If you or your organization has a database, then no problem. Anvil supports external databases through popular Python libraries like pymysql and psycopg2.", "But a feature I have found to speed up my development, even more, is the integrated databases that Anvil apps have. Called Data Tables, they are PostgreSQL based database system that you access directly in Python.", "When you are ready to deploy your app, there is no need to worry about how to get the app off of your local machine. It\u2019s already in the cloud! Simply publish the app with one click and share the link. If you want to secure the app you can easily authentication by adding users.", "There are actually several ways to deploy your app:", "Perhaps you are the type of person that wants to control the app from top to bottom, and not rely on a specific vendor to host your app. Well, Anvil has you covered there as well. Anvil has open-sourced its app server, which allows you to host your Anvil built apps nearly anywhere.", "Personally, I still prefer to use Anvil hosting, as it is by far the easiest and most convenient way to host apps.", "Developing a web app with Anvil is 7x faster than using current tools. This sounds like a marketing line, and it is, but it\u2019s absolutely true. I tried developing an app with Dash and within a week I wanted to throw my computer out the window. Here is perhaps a better description of how you should look at Anvil:", "Using Anvil with a team of 1 or 2 you can do the same work faster than with a team 4 or 5.", "One of the best things about Anvil is the great community. On the Anvil forums, you will find a great group of welcoming developers to help you get started and answer questions. There is also a great Show and Tell section where you can get great inspiration for your own projects. Here are some great apps made with Anvil:", "I\u2019ve used Anvil for almost a year now and I can\u2019t imagine using anything else to show my data science ideas to the world. It is constantly improving, the community of developers is excellent and supportive, and it is simply a joy to work with. Check it out at https://anvil.works.", "Thanks for reading.
