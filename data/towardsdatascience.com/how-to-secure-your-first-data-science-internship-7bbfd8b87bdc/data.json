It didn\u2019t work. I understand how hard it can get to land an internship because I\u2019ve been through it. I have even paid for training courses that were branded as internships because I was unaware. I don\u2019t even mention them in my CV anymore.", "If you\u2019re asked to pay for an internship, it\u2019s not\u00a0an\u00a0internship.", "Times have changed now, and the Data Science world is much different from what it was 5 years back. I am finally on the other side. I take interviews for prospective engineers, analysts, and interns for the data science team. There are certain things I, as an interviewer (and many other interviewers), look for in an intern candidate.", "You don\u2019t need work experience, but you need certain other things. These are certain things you have control of and can use to amplify the chances of securing an internship. This article talks about them in detail. Buckle up; your internship-hunt is going to get simplified into 7 simple steps!", "Start going after the skills right now! You really can\u2019t expect to land an internship without acquiring the minimum relevant skills. Even if you land one, sorry, but you won\u2019t be able to survive it. How do you acquire skills?", "There is no single formula for that, but you can do online courses (there\u2019s plenty for free) but remember it\u2019s not the certificate you\u2019re after, but the skills. You can learn from what experts have shared on Kaggle. There\u2019s a lot of resources out there for free; you need to look for them.", "Start going after the skills right now!", "If you\u2019re still stuck, here\u2019s a guide I wrote a while back that outlines what you need to learn and where to find them, and the approach to data science in general. I highly recommend taking the time to go through this.", "Do you need to be enrolled as an undergraduate at a university? Some companies require you to, but most are happy to hire you if you have the skills \u2014 demonstratable skills, to be precise.", "Once you acquire the skills, how do you demonstrate them?", "A demonstrable portfolio project is the single best way you can brag about your skills. It\u2019s so convincing, so convincing when it\u2019s right there for the interviewer to see!", "Start with exploring datasets in Kaggle or UCI or go ahead and collect the data and build your project. A good way to think about a successful demonstrable portfolio project is by asking, does it cover all the typical steps of an end-to-end machine learning pipeline? Did you clean the data, treat outliers and categoricals, build models, evaluate them, and deploy them? Did you try to solve a problem effectively and able to communicate it well? If you could answer these questions yes, then you\u2019ve got the project.", "Don\u2019t showcase something out of traditional getting started problems. Titanic Survival Prediction or Iris Classification, or MNIST Digit Recognition are good problems to get started and learn, but not showcase your portfolio project. Everybody does that, and you won\u2019t be having a differentiating factor.", "You might have already worked on such a project during your undergraduate program; you could fine-tune it and make it more presentable. The project should be on your GitHub, and you could even deploy it on the cloud for the period you\u2019re looking for internships.", "You have a demonstrable project; do you go ahead and apply to every vacancy online?", "When I was searching for my internship, I used to apply online. I believed the more companies I apply to, the better my chances. Since I am bulk-applying, I would use the same cover letter and the same CV for every application. I put a lot of effort into doing that, but I wasn\u2019t getting noticed.", "You get the problem right \u2014 I did what everyone else was doing, but I expected to be noticed.", "Unlike Software Engineering, there is no definitive Data Scientist role; no two job postings are the same. Data Scientist role varies from company to company. And there\u2019s more than data scientists a company would need. For instance, most companies also need a data engineer, data analyst, machine learning engineer, and the list goes on and on. And all of them work in the field of data science, and chances are you might enjoy it too.", "You need to be genuinely interested in the company you\u2019re applying to. Look in what domain do they work, what is their culture like. And depending on their requirements and vacancies, customize your CV and the cover letter. I can\u2019t stress this enough, customizing takes you a step further towards securing the internship! But then how do you apply?", "Here\u2019s an insider\u2019s secret. The first internal step of any hiring process starts by asking the existing employees if they know someone good for the role. If your dream company's employees know you and have seen your potential, guess who is getting fast-tracked into the hiring process? By the time everybody else\u2019s online applications reach HR, you\u2019d be already holding the offer letter, my friend.", "Wait, but how do I get referred? I know it\u2019s easier said than done. But I\u2019m here to tell you; it\u2019s doable.", "You have a genuine interest in the company. You have an idea of what they work on. You have built at least one demonstratable project. And you have the skills. It\u2019s time you build a relationship with the employees of the company.", "It could be as simple as asking for a review of your project (be mindful of their time, though). Or it could be asking for some tips for a future project you would be working on. Or you could simply inquire about the work they do at the company and if they\u2019re looking for interns.", "If there are no vacancies, don\u2019t push it but ask them to keep you updated. It\u2019s okay if an employee isn\u2019t responding, there could be many other employees of the same company who is willing to. The best platform I could think of for you to do all these is LinkedIn. Leverage it!", "When you show genuine interest in the company, the company, in return, wants to give you a shot at it! How would you make it count?", "It\u2019s very, very, very important to give your best in the interview. That\u2019s the only way you get assessed, and also, don\u2019t let your referrer down. Certain things you can do to feel comfortable are,", "Walking out of the room after acing the interview is the best feeling ever! You did your best in the interview. Now what?", "It\u2019s okay to ask for feedback from the interviewer once it\u2019s over. It\u2019s also okay to request feedback if you don\u2019t hear from HR after a few days. Most companies don\u2019t hesitate to give you constructive feedback (unless policies are forbidding them to), so ask.", "If you couldn\u2019t make it the first time, use the feedback to improve yourself and repeat the process. Based on my experience, after a couple of interviews, you will start noticing the same pattern of questioning and feel confident eventually. You are going to ace it naturally!", "One last step. The important one.", "Sometimes you can do everything right and still not get the offer. It\u2019s sad, but it happens. Requirements for the company may change, you might be caught in a pandemic, and they might freeze hiring, and so on.", "Keep improving yourself, acquire even more skills, and have a couple of more projects. Build a stronger professional network. If I had given up, I wouldn\u2019t be here, writing this. Have even stronger reasons for anyone to hire you!", "If you have come this far, thank you for reading. I hope it was useful to you in some way. Most importantly, please share this with someone who is embarking on an internship-hunt. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out if you need more guidance in any of these steps.", "I write extensively on getting started with data science and machine learning, based on my personal experiences here on Medium. I\u2019ll be more than happy to connect with you on LinkedIn and hear your feedback. I can\u2019t wait to see you succeed!", "For more helpful insights on breaking into data science, exciting collaborations, and mentorships, consider joining my private list of email friends.", "Your home for data science.
