And then you see somebody you know who is not as good as you in Math/Statistics brag about his Machine Learning skills in Linkedin.", "You can learn all the beginner projects that are out there on Machine Learning but when you want to do something on your own you are not able to implement it just because there is no Training Data or You just don\u2019t have a GPU with you? And then eventually you just lost interest in the field as the fire in you just lost its power due to lack of motivation.", "Being stuck sucks. I get it. You need fuel to uplift your motivation levels.", "Nothing like that adrenaline you get when you can show the final product to the world born out of your own abstract idea. The intention here is not to give you another beginners tutorial on \u2018How to make this and that awesome Machine Learning Model\u2019 but to make you experience the taste of accomplishment.", "I promise you that you can build the face mask detection model in less than 5 minutes without a single line of code. Credits to Teachable Machine by Google. But isn\u2019t coding necessary to be called as a Machine Learning Engineer or a Data Scientist?", "No, it is more about how you use the data. There is a reason why it is called as \u2018Data Science\u2019 but not \u2018Coding Science\u2019.", "Teachable Machine is a web-based tool that makes creating machine learning models fast, easy, and accessible to everyone. -Teachable Machine", "Teachable Machine allows anyone to build models based on:", "Absolutely! pretrained models are good and efficient to start with. That\u2019s why Teachable uses pretrained models powered by Google for training your models.", "But what makes it more special is the Training data. Teachable enables you to create data of your own using Webcam for Image and Pose models and using external Mic for Audio models. That\u2019s it?", "Absolutely no. It is powered by GPU computing for training and also you can easily see the live training performance by the click of a button. And you can export the model just as smoothly after the training so you can do something with it.", "Please go to Teachable Machine and click on get started", "As you are trying to build mask detection on human faces it is obvious that the model needs Images as training data. So let's go ahead and select Image Project.", "Feed your curiosity \u2014 You can try to use pose project and see how the model is performing compared to image project. The steps involved will be basically same, so you can follow the guide here.", "Click on Image Project and get set for the next step", "The most important thing to build a model is Training data. As promised you don\u2019t have to worry too much about Training data if you are trying to build a model using Teachable.", "You can upload data from Local Disk or Google Drive if you have one already or else you can create by yourself using the webcam.", "I totally recommend using your webcam for this project as you get to experience the ease of doing it.", "You can create as many labels as you want by clicking on Add Class.", "For this project, we need two classes", "Go ahead and change them by clicking on the class names.", "Next, click on Webcam Button and Hold to Record to generate images. Generate about 110 images of each class which should be sufficient enough for this project.", "Wear a mask and move your head around so it can recognise images from different directions to generate images for Mask class.", "Remove mask and take images for No Mask class.", "That\u2019s it you got your training data with labels.", "Just click on Training to start the training of the model.", "You can play around with parameters Epochs, Batch Size, Learning rate.", "One of the cool features of Teachable is you can see how your model is getting trained by clicking on under the hood.", "With default settings and 110 images of each class, the model usually takes less than a minute to get trained.", "Congratulations! For training an awesome and complex Machine Learning model in less than 5 minutes.", "Its time to have fun with the model and check how are the results.", "You can see from the Model Output Gif, it is producing pretty satisfying results for both classes.", "Model is able to identify Mask on my face and when I place the mask on my forehead it identifies as No-Mask as expected.", "You can now export the model and use it out of Teachable platform if you need.", "If the hi-fi words like Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Advanced Statistics scares you? Don\u2019t worry all you have to do is to start small and pick projects like this as they have the power to ignite the spark, give you that adrenaline to keep you going forward to reach your final goal.", "Give it a try and let me know if you made any interesting projects out of it.", "Your home for data science.
