In most cases, a restaurant\u2019s location plays an essential determinant for its success. Hence, it is advantageous and of utmost importance to determine the most strategic location for establishment in order to maximize business profits.", "A client seeks to establish a franchised Asian restaurant, with a niche in Southeast Asian cuisine, in a Toronto neighborhood. Which neighbourhood would appear to be the optimal and most strategic location for the business operations?", "The objective of this capstone project is to locate the optimal neighborhood for operation. Our foundation of reasoning would be based on spending power, distribution of ethnic group, and competition, across each neighbourhood. We will mainly be utilizing the Foursquare API and the extensive geographical and census data from Toronto\u2019s Open Data Portal.", "Fellow entrepreneurs seeking to either establish a new restaurant of a certain niche or have plans to expand their franchised restaurants would be very interested in the competitive advantages and business values this finding can potentially reap.", "The neighbourhoods alongside their respective postal codes and boroughs were scraped from Wikipedia. Geographical coordinates for each neighbourhood were extracted from here. As for Toronto\u2019s census data \u2014 median household income, total population, and population of Southeast Asians across each neighbourhood \u2014 Toronto\u2019s Open Data Portal provides all that data here.", "For returning the number of Asian restaurants in the vicinity of each neighbourhood, we will be utilizing Foursquare API, more specifically, its explore function. One has to register for a Foursquare developer account here to access their API credentials.", "Data downloaded or scraped from multiple sources were combined into one table. There were a lot of missing values for certain neighbourhoods, due to lack of record keeping. Few assumptions were made to achieve the dataframe shown in Fig 1:", "The folium library was called to help visualize, geographically, the location of each neighbourhood centered around Toronto.", "Using the Foursquare API\u2019s explore function, we could return the number of Asian restaurants located in each neighbourhood. By calculating the mean respectively, it can give us a better understanding of the frequency of occurrence in each neighbourhood. The argument for the use of frequency of Asian restaurants is that I hypothesize that there would be a correlation between the number of Asian restaurants and competition. The higher the number of said restaurants in a neighbourhood, the stronger the competition. The assumption of our analysis is that the barrier of entry to establish a new restaurant in a competitive market is high as existing Asian restaurants may have the competitive advantage of brand loyalty.", "Though, counterintuitively, the presence of these restaurants may be an indicator of demand for Asian cuisine; the presence of competition may even incentivize innovation to reduce cost and increase productivity.", "Hence, it would be sound to establish business operations in a neighbourhood that consists of a number of restaurants around the median value.", "I hypothesize that there would too exist a linear relationship between the population of a specific ethnic group and the demand for its respective cultural cuisine. Hence, it would only be sound for our clients to carry out business operations in neighbourhoods that are relatively more densely populated with Southeast Asians.", "As the franchised Asian restaurant could be categorized as casual dining, the target audience is more geared towards the middle class income earners. As can be inferred from the bar chart below, neighbourhoods distributed around the mean of household income can readily afford and indulge themselves in the aforementioned Asian cuisine.", "This study also assumes that the cost of living in all neighbourhoods in this study is relatively equal in determining their respective spending power.", "To help mathematical-based algorithms \u2014 like our k-Means algorithm in this case \u2014 to interpret features with different magnitudes and distributions equally, we will have to normalize our data; as these feature columns are different in scale, we will standardize the values to a common scale. One approach of data normalization is StandardScaler.", "Before we fit the feature values into our model, we have to pre-assign the number of clusters the algorithm should label. In order to identify the optimal number clusters to use, a range of 3 to 10 clusters were used, then the squared error calculated respectively were used as metrics of their performances.", "An analysis using K Elbow Visualizer and Squared error for each k value evident shows that k = 6 would the best value.", "After identifying the number of clusters, we will fit the standardized feature values into our k-Means algorithm; resulting in 6 clustered neighbourhoods of similar characteristics.", "In summary, neighbourhoods in Cluster 0 possess the highest relative spending power as their median household incomes are significantly higher than the other clusters. The fair number of Southeast Asians and Asian restaurants indicates an adequate demand for Southeast Asian cuisine; and customers that are capable of consuming the meals more regularly than the others.", "Cluster 1\u2019s low spending power and the low number of restaurants of similar niche signifies a low affordability index and a scarce demand \u2014 making this cluster the least desirable option.", "Cluster 2 is only promising in terms of its great population of Southeast Asians, or target customers, in the region. However, its low spending power and the high number of competitors of similar niche may indicate a high barrier of entry \u2014 its demographic is likely to demand less of the pricier menu of our client\u2019s compared to the cheaper options available from the competitors.", "Cluster 3, though favorable concerning its demographic and optimal number of competitors, its low spending power would unfortunately demonstrate a lack in consumption.", "Cluster 4\u2019s low number of competitors in the region registers it as low demand for the cuisine even though it possesses an adequate amount of spending power level and distribution of the demographic.", "Cluster 5 only consists of one neighbourhood as a result of its significantly high number of competitors and the distribution of Southeast Asians. This shows promise despite its high number of competitors. If the client\u2019s franchised restaurant is priorly well established, neighbourhoods in \u2018Cluster Label 5\u2019 might also be up consideration as the restaurant would have the competitive advantage of brand loyalty to combat the density of competitors.", "In this study, I have labeled the neighbourhoods corresponding to their characteristics \u2014 spending power, percentage of target customers, and the number of competitors. The most promising group of neighbourhoods for opening an Asian Restaurant, with a niche in Southeast Asian cuisine, appears to be \u2018Cluster Label 0\u2019.", "The higher spending power of the neighbourhoods in this cluster allows them to readily afford the slightly upscaled prices of the client\u2019s Asian restaurant menu.", "The average distribution of the percentage of target customers \u2014 the Southeast Asian demographic \u2014 indicates a relatively reasonable demand for the Asian cuisine.", "The number of competitors is not significant yet adequate enough to be a good indicator of demand for Asian cuisine.", "Our client could more specifically consider Guildwood as a location of establishment for optimal results. However, whenever there is a shift in the dynamic of business demands, we could always target different clusters of neighborhoods. Case in point, if the client has plans to expand a well-established franchised restaurant, neighbourhoods in \u2018Cluster Label 5\u2019 would be the optimal location; this is under the assumption that the aforementioned restaurant would have a competitive advantage of brand loyalty against the high number of competitors in that neighbourhood.", "In conclusion, the extensive analysis above would greatly increase the likelihood of the restaurant\u2019s success. Similarly, we can use this project to analyze interchangeable scenarios, such as opening a restaurant of different cuisines.", "I think the model could use more improvements in capturing restaurants\u2019 individual traits. For example, two restaurants might have a similar number of competitors, but one might have a smaller geographical radius while the other a bigger radius. Another example is that restaurants that are more densely populated with the Southeast Asian population may not crave their Asian cuisine any more than their ethnic counterparts.", "The spending power attribute in this study too ignorantly assumes that the cost of living in all the neighborhoods aforementioned is relatively equal. An account of the cost of living to calculate more precisely the purchasing power would drastically improve findings. More data, especially data of different types, would help improve model performances significantly.", "[3] Toronto Open Data Portal for census data:", "Your home for data science.
