It is used in a huge variety of applications such as investment modeling, A/B testing, and manufacturing process improvement (six sigma).", "But people are less familiar with the binomial distribution. That\u2019s a shame because the binomial distribution is really useful. Have you ever been asked something like:", "\u201cGiven 10 flips of a fair coin, what is the probability of getting 6 heads?\u201d", "Probability (especially back of the napkin probability calculations) is not my favorite thing in the world. So when I first learned about the binomial distribution, I thought, \u201cYes, I never have to worry about coin flip probability questions again!\u201d", "That\u2019s because the results of coin flips follow the binomial distribution. I should emphasize that the law of large numbers applies here. To be technically correct, I should say that if were to repeatedly perform the same set of experiments (flipping the coin 10 times) over and over, the number of heads that we observe across all those sets would follow the binomial distribution.", "Don\u2019t worry, I will illustrate this in detail shortly.", "First let\u2019s start with the slightly more technical definition \u2014 the binomial distribution is the probability distribution of a sequence of experiments where each experiment produces a binary outcome and where each of the outcomes is independent of all the others.", "A single coin flip is an example of an experiment with a binary outcome. Coin flips meet the other binomial distribution requirement as well \u2014 the outcome of each individual coin flip is independent of all the others. Just to be clear, the outcomes of the experiment don\u2019t need to be equally likely as they are with flips of a fair coin \u2014 the following things also meet the prerequisites of the binomial distribution:", "One thing that may trouble newcomers to probability and statistics is the idea of a probability distribution. We tend to think deterministically such as \u201cI flipped a coin 10 times and produced 6 heads\u201d. So the outcome is 6 \u2014 where is the distribution then?", "The probability distribution derives from variance. If both you and I flipped 10 coins, it\u2019s pretty likely that we would get different results (you might get 5 heads and I get 7). This variance, a.k.a. uncertainty around the outcome, produces a probability distribution, which basically tells us what outcomes are relatively more likely (such as 5 heads) and which outcomes are relatively less likely (such as 10 heads).", "We can produce such a probability distribution through simulation, such as in the image below:", "Before we go into some Python code that would run this simulation and produce a binomial distribution, let\u2019s first get some definitions out of the way. When you see binomial distributions and the experiments that underlie them described in textbooks, the descriptions always include the following key parameters:", "Let\u2019s go through some python code that runs the simulation we described above. The code below (also available on my Github here) does the following:", "So that\u2019s the code. So what happens when we repeat our 10 coin toss trial 1,000 times? We get the histogram plotted below:", "Let\u2019s modify the plotting section of our previous code so that our plot also shows the actual binomial distribution (using the stats.binom function from the scipy library):", "The following plot shows our original simulated distribution in blue and the actual binomial distribution in red. The takeaway is that the binomial distribution is a pretty good approximation of what we would have observed if we had actually repeated our 10 coin tosses 1,000 times \u2014 so instead of wasting tons of time tossing coins and recording the results, we can just use the binomial distribution!", "And if we wanted to simulate the result of a single sequence of n experiments (recall that n=10 for our example but really it could be any positive integer), we could generate that using a binomially distributed random variable like so:", "Finally, let\u2019s answer our original question (probability of getting 6 heads with 10 coin flips) by running 10,000 simulations of our 10 coin flips:", "We find the probability to be around 20% (we can also see that in our earlier histogram via the height of the red vertical line above 6 on the x axis).", "Cool, but what if we want to analyze things beyond coin flips? Let\u2019s run through a stylized real world use case for the binomial distribution. Imagine that we are data scientists tasked with improving the ROI (Return on Investment) of our company\u2019s call center, where employees attempt to cold call potential customers and get them to purchase our product.", "You look at some historical data and find the following:", "We can think of each employee as a binomially distributed random variable with the following parameters:", "The following code simulates our call center:", "If you run the code, you get outputs like the following (it changes from run to run because conversions is an array of binomially distributed random variables) key metrics for your call center:", "Profits are pretty slim compared to expenses. But these are results for just one randomly generated day. Let\u2019s look at the profit of our call center over 1,000 simulations and see how the daily profit varies:", "Wow, there is a very high chance of loss given the current operating metrics of our call center (nearly half the simulated profits are negative). What should we do then?", "Recalling that each employee\u2019s results follows a binomial distribution, we realize that we can do one or more of the following to improve things:", "Eventually, we develop a lead generation tool that allows our call center employees to identify people that are more likely to purchase our product. This results in shorter phone calls (less sweet talking required) and an uptick in our conversion probability, ultimately producing these revisions to our parameters:", "Let\u2019s run the following lines of code that simulates 1,000 potential days of our new and improved call center to see how these changes impact the statistical distribution of our future daily profit.", "The above code also plots the distribution of our improved results (red) against our old ones (blue). We don\u2019t need to run an A/B test (though we really should) to see that our lead generation tool has significantly improved the operation and profitability of our call center.", "We successfully recognized that the profit produced by each employee follows a binomial distribution \u2014 so if we could increase both the n (number of cold calls made per day) and p (probability of conversion for each call) parameters, we could generate higher profits.", "I should end by making the following points:", "More Data Science and Analytics Related Posts By Me:", "Your home for data science.
