(stata.com)", "An open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools for the Python programming language. (pandas.pydata.org)", "A collaborator is using Pandas. You\u2019re a Stata user but the research group you\u2019re collaborating with isn\u2019t. They use Pandas. To be in the same sandbox you decide to learn Pandas.", "You\u2019ve decided you want to expand your skillset. Ready for a new challenge? Maybe you\u2019ve read several books from Stata\u2019s bookstore. You\u2019ve created and published user-written programs (known to Stata users as packages). Maybe you\u2019ve even published one or more programs to the user community\u2019s preferred repository at Boston College Statistical Software Components (SSC) archive. Clearly then, you\u2019re ready to expand your skillset.", "You\u2019ve lost access to Stata. Or you anticipate losing access to Stata. Stata is proprietary and its licensing fees are costly. If you have lost or anticipate losing access to Stata and you\u2019re not interested in purchasing a license for yourself (despite the good value), Pandas is a good option.", "Other reasons. It doesn\u2019t really matter why a Stata user might look to learn Pandas. This guide is an agnostic how-to that acknowledges both languages have their strengths and weaknesses. In my work, I often find that one picks up where the other leaves off.", "To avoid reinventing the wheel, this guide does not discuss Python or Pandas installation beyond offering a recommendation that Stata users consider installing the intended-for-science Anaconda distribution.", "The examples and explanations given in this guide have been tested using the Anaconda distribution. Specifically, examples given here were created in Jupyter Notebooks which is software included in the Anaconda distribution of Python.", "Using Stata\u2019s well-known example automobile dataset. I have previously discussed this dataset as one that is useful for testing or training purposes. Here is what loading this dataset in a Jupyter Notebook will typically look:", "Next in Part 1.2, I\u2019ll demonstrate cross-tabulations and summary statistics that will help you begin the data exploration process. In the last section, Part 1.3, I will illustrate simple visualizations that will let you continue the data exploration process.", "Loading the automobile dataset in Stata is easy: sysuse auto. In Python the process can be done in two lines. But to make the code more readable, I break it into three lines:", "That\u2019s it! Easy. If you\u2019re a new Pandas user, and if you\u2019re following along congratulations! You\u2019ve loaded your first dataset into memory.", "One of the first things you\u2019ll notice is that working in Python, there is less \u2018output.\u2019 Output is information the language provides to help validate that the command did for you what you intended for it to do. For more on this, see my related article on Merging Data: The Pandas Missing Output.", "In Python, this feedback is much less extensive. To verify you\u2019ve properly loaded the automobile dataset. Try the code df.head() which is roughly equivalent to Stata\u2019s list in 1/5. Here is what you should see:", "A cross-tabulation is one of the simplest analytical techniques available. This technique involves tabulating occurrences among two or more categorical variables.", "A limitation of Stata is that cross-tabulations involving more than two or three categorical variables is limited. In Pandas three or more categoricals is no problem.", "A two-way tabulation with the automobile data set:", "Looking closely, this tabulation leaves out missing data. To get Stata to include missing data in its cross-tabulations the mi option following thetab command will provide a more complete view of the data. Putting it together in Stata it would be tab foreign rep78, mi.", "In Pandas two lines are needed to display a more complete view of the data:", "Summary statistics in Stata are not complicated. One of the quickest ways to get a look at continuous variables is to type sum. With the automobile data set this gives you:", "In Pandas the command that most closely mimics this output is df.describe().transpose() which will give:", "Most Pandas users would use df.describe() which displays variable names across the top of the output and the statistics across each row. As a Stata user, I add the transpose() method which rotates the output to more closely match the convention that I\u2019m used to with Stata.", "Bonus, in Pandas the default output also gives the 25th, 50th, and 75th percentile. Of course, the 50th percentile is the ever-useful-to-know median. These additional statistics are not offered in Stata\u2019s default output.", "If you\u2019re following along and feeling adventurous, test your intuition by executing the following:", "See if you can correctly anticipate what the output will be. Also, work on adjusting the code to customize it so that you can explore other variables beyond price (price) or mileage (mpg).", "Up next Part 1.3, illustrates a variety of simple visualizations that will let you continue the data exploration process.", "One of my favorite parts about conducting data exploration in Pandas instead of Stata is the combination of scatterplots and histograms \u2014 in the same plot.", "A histogram illustrates the distribution of one variable at a time. A scatterplot illustrates the relationship of two or more variables.", "Pandas provides ready access to the jointplot which combines the best of both scatterplots and histograms into one. Again working with Stata\u2019s automobile dataset:", "This visualization explores the relationship between mileage (in miles per gallon on the verticle y axis) and vehicle weight (in pounds on the x axis). The visualization indicates, consistent with intuition and common understanding, that as vehicle weight increases, the vehicle mileage decreases.", "This jointplot shows the relationship between these two variables (weight and mpg) in addition to visualizing the distribution of these to variables. As an added bonus this visualization indicates the Pearson correlation coefficient for these two variables along with its p-value.", "Also, handy for comparing many variables across a dataset is the pairplot. The pairplot provides a matrix of scatterplots, similar to a typical correlation matrix. The following will compare mileage (mpg), weight (weight), length (length), and price (price):", "Bonus to add a categorical comparison, here we\u2019ll compare foreign manufacturing with domestic, we can adjust the code to include a couple of additional arguments:", "After adding the additional arguments which generate a visualization that lets you compare domestically manufactured vehicles with foreign manufacture new patterns begin to go emerge which might inform further analysis.", "In three parts, this article is designed to help users of Stata think about making the transition to Python and Pandas. If the goal isn\u2019t to transition, this guide will help Stata users begin learning a new tool that can complement your on-going work in Stata. Both Stata and Pandas have their strengths and weaknesses.", "At the most basic level, once you reach an intermediate or beyond level of proficiency with Stata it is worth adding to your skillset by also learning Python and Pandas. This article demonstrates techniques that will help you begin the data exploration process.", "Part 1.1 reviewed a variety of reasons Stata users might like to begin exploring the option to work with Python and Pandas. Parts 1.2 & 1.3 walkthrough rudimentary examples of data exploration, analysis, and visualization using Stata\u2019s popular automobile dataset.", "Thanks for reading.
