I\u2019m reading a book while you\u2019re stroking Pukey, our cat. You look up to me.", "\u2018I wonder whether cats can be transgender, like you are.\u2019", "\u2018I don\u2019t know. There\u2019s no reason why an animal shouldn\u2019t be transgender. Unfortunately we can\u2019t ask them.\u2019", "\u2018I think Pukey could be trans. She behaves like an alpha male!\u2019", "\u2018Perhaps you\u2019re right. But who knows \u2014 it can be really difficult to determine someone\u2019s gender identity from their behavior.\u2019", "\u2018Yeah \u2014 most people don\u2019t think that you\u2019re trans when they meet you.\u2019", "\u2018Exactly. Although Google knew that I was non-binary before everyone else!\u2019", "\u2018You heard me right. Google knew that I was non-binary \u2014 and I found out through my ad settings.", "\u2018I realized that I was a non-binary transperson back in 2017. I\u2019d felt it all my life, but it took me a long time to find words for my feelings. That moment of realization \u2014 that was an epiphany for me.", "\u2018But there was another, smaller moment of epiphany two years prior. I was checking my Google ad settings after an email informed me of their existence. These settings cover things like your age, gender, education, and main areas of interest in order to tailor ads to you.", "\u2018I\u2019d never disclosed my gender to them, but somehow I\u2019d assumed they\u2019d guess my assigned gender based on my activity.", "\u2018That wasn\u2019t the case \u2014 it didn\u2019t guess my assigned gender! And Google used both men\u2019s and women\u2019s interests to personalize my ads. Needless to say, I was intrigued by this result.\u2019", "\u2018But why didn\u2019t you realize then that you were transgender?\u2019", "Google recognized my queerness. But I took me years to realize that", "\u2018We\u2019re talking 2017, darling. At the time, I didn\u2019t even know the word transgender. Hell, I hardly knew what being gay meant!", "\u2018I\u2019d always assumed that everybody shared my feelings of dysphoria and occasional euphoria. Since my feelings had gotten really large since the onset of puberty, I\u2019d assumed that this struggle with one\u2019s body and one\u2019s identity is the defining element of everyone\u2019s adulthood.", "\u2018I concluded that this struggle was the reason why adults laugh less often than children. That this struggle made adults so boring from a child\u2019s perspective. That this struggle eventually killed people when they got old. That adulthood is just a slow form of dying from a battle against oneself. For everyone.\u2019", "\u2018What a sad view of the world!\u2019", "\u2018In retrospective, yes. Unfortunately I didn\u2019t Google my feelings back then\u2026\u2019", "\u2018How did the people around you react to that worldview?\u2019", "\u2018I never told them about it. But of course I was aware that many other people were getting on much better with their bodies and their genders. So I went on thinking that they were somehow stronger than me because they could handle the struggle of adulthood better than I could. That led to massive feelings of self-doubt and worse.\u2019", "\u2018Yes, but for me the internet was an amazing fix. In that moment when I saw my Google ad settings I realized that I wasn\u2019t weaker or inferior than everyone else.", "\u2018That moment wasn\u2019t a fix-it-all. There were still a lot self-doubts and hard times after that. But my Google ad settings were facts that stuck in the back of my head as the years went by.\u2019", "Google must have thought that I was a genderfluid person in a relationship", "\u2018Did you check your ad settings a lot after that?\u2019", "\u2018From time to time, yes. It was intriguing to see how the settings changed with time. Sometimes I was male to Google, but most of the time it thought I was female. Men\u2019s and women\u2019s interests were both present. And Google always thought I was in a relationship, although most of the time I wasn\u2019t. I still haven\u2019t figured out why Google thought that.\u2019", "\u2018Haha, Google thought you were a genderfluid person in a relationship.\u2019", "\u2018Somehow yes. Although I\u2019m not genderfluid \u2014 my gender is the same all the time. It\u2019s just neither male nor female.\u2019", "\u2018So probably Google couldn\u2019t decide which gender you are because you neither fit in the male nor the female category?\u2019", "\u2018Probably, yes. But the game changed after I officially came out. I was out to a few close friends by 2018. But it was in 2019 that I started coming out to everyone.", "\u2018From that point in 2019, Google\u2019s ad settings consistently labeled me female. I don\u2019t know exactly why. Perhaps there was a change in its algorithms around that time, making gender assignment less flexible. Or maybe my activity changed after coming out in ways that influenced the way that Google thought about me. I\u2019ll probably never know.\u2019", "\u2018It\u2019s a mystery! And Google is still getting your gender wrong.\u2019", "\u2018And right, at the same time. It\u2019s funny how inherently sexist algorithms can reveal truths about non-conforming people like me. And how that can be a source of relief and freedom for us.\u2019", "\u2018Did you ever consider changing your settings so that Google knows your real gender?\u2019", "\u2018I recently did! The downside to this is that I don\u2019t see Google\u2019s guess of my gender any more. I found it quite interesting to see whether it sees me as male or female. It reveals a lot about Google\u2019s algorithms, and how Google and our society think about the gender-binary.\u2019", "\u2018Did anything change after you disclosed your gender?\u2019", "\u2018Well, suddenly Google thinks that I\u2019m single! Also, the setting for health and beauty immediately disappeared.", "\u2018So according to today\u2019s tech, genderqueer people are rarely in relationships and don\u2019t care a lot about health and beauty. Which is nonsense, if you ask me.\u2019", "\u2018That sounds weird indeed! It\u2019s going to be interesting to see how this changes as people become more tolerant. Will it show you ads tailored to non-binary people?\u2019", "\u2018Let\u2019s wait and see! These ads definitely exist, but we\u2019re yet to find out whether Google does a good job at showing them to me.\u2019", "\u2018It\u2019s a shame that cats can\u2019t use Google as well. We might never find out whether Pukey is transgender.\u2019", "\u2018That will be challenging indeed. But let\u2019s see what the future holds. I\u2019m hopeful that one day we\u2019ll be more educated about gender. Then we might not project our binary stereotypes onto the humans and animals around us any more.\u2019", "Your home for data science.
