Like the internet and the smartphone, AI is an enabler technology that will have a far-reaching impact on all areas of our life.", "In order to better understand the underlying concepts, I would like to share a picture with you that I typically use when explaining the broader context of machine learning / deep learning and how it relates to Artificial Intelligence.", "You will find many great articles here on medium or elsewhere which give a very good introduction to AI (I have linked some at the end of this article). Nevertheless, what I have not seen so far is an AI overview which is easy to digest visually. If you know something I could use instead, go ahead and let me know in the comments section below. But until then, let me share the visualisation that I am using right now. I will also briefly walk through the key components of the figure in this article.", "In brief, Artificial Intelligence is a branch within computer science that studies how to create machines which possess capabilities similar to human intelligence. There are different maturity levels of artificial intelligence which I will briefly touch upon in the upcoming chapters: superintelligence, general Artificial Intelligence and narrow Artificial Intelligence.", "Artificial Intelligence is very useful in order to digitize cognitive capabilities where the exact rules to follow are difficult to explain. A good AI use case would be face recognition. Trying to use handcrafted knowledge to code all relevant rules for face recognition would be an approach sometimes referred to as the first wave of AI (source). But with mature technology like machine learning and deep learning available, this is not the preferred approach as we will see later.", "What are the Key Drivers of Artificial Intelligence?", "Before we dig into the details, let\u2019s take a quick look at the key factors that drive recent advances in Artificial intelligence:", "Some researchers predict and believe that at a certain point in the future, machines will be smarter than humans. This might happen somewhere between the years 2050 and 2100. Few researches argue that this state will never be reached. But for most researchers familiar with the subject, it is not a matter whether superintelligence will be reached but rather when it will be reached.", "Superintelligence is the state where a machine\u2019s cognitive capability surpasses that of humans. As Nick Bostrom puts it, it is an organism with an \u201cintellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\u201d.", "The advent of superintelligence is based on the assumption that the rate of progress in an evolutionary learning environment is evolving exponentially (Ray Kurzweil\u2019s law of accelerating returns). This is difficult to grasp because most people think rather linearly and try to predict the future from what we already know and have experienced in the past. This will of course lead to a wrong trajectory. There is a great and fun article by Tim Urban explaining this journey (link at the end of the article). It explains superintelligence and all its implications much better than I will ever be able to. I highly recommend to read his post if you are in the mood.", "In the best case, superintelligence will lead to a future of abundance and equity (singularity). In the worst scenario it will lead to the extinction of mankind, not because superintelligence is evil but simply because humans are in its way on achieving its goals (goals that we might not be able to understand any longer since they surpass our cognitive capabilities).", "Before reaching superintelligence, general AI means that a machine will have the same cognitive capabilities as a human being. Again, researchers argue about the point in time when we will reach general AI. It could be around the year 2045. Due to the law of accelerating returns, the phase of general Artificial Intelligence will very soon after transition into the era of superintelligence.", "Intelligence is highly related to the ability of an organism to effectively adapt itself to better cope with a changing environment. Adaption also means not only changing oneself but also changing the environment. Here are the key characteristics of general artificial (and human) intelligence (sources: here and here):", "General-purpose AI will not be reached with the current approach and tools like neural networks. In order to achieve true intelligence, cognitive systems might be a solution.", "Since researches did not make much progress on achieving general AI, the focus naturally shifted towards narrow AI first. Narrow AI focuses on very specific use cases. This means that an AI (currently deep neural network are mostly used) is trained for a very specific purpose. Therefore the AI can only handle events that it has been trained on.", "If a chatbot is trained to answer customer service requests in English for company A, it will not be able to react to any requests that it will a) receive for a different company or b) are stated in a different language or c) be asked for non related topics like \u201cDo I need to take an umbrella to work today?\u201d.", "In contrast to general AI, narrow AI\u2019s capability to learn is very limited. It can learn within the boundaries of the particular use case, e.g. a narrow AI for speech recognition might be able to improve the rate of understanding new dialects of the same language it has been trained on. In order to learn another language, it needs input from humans, e.g. by providing large amounts of labeled data sets for the new language to be learned. Narrow AI cannot dynamically adapt to new situations by coming up with alternative solutions, a key trait of general artificial intelligence (see chapter above).", "Some typical narrow AI use cases:", "Machine learning is an AI discipline and the key driver behind the advances of narrow Artificial Intelligence in recent years. It is a collection of tools and methods which allow computers to learn from observations, data and examples in order to improve their performance. It does not require explicit step by step explanation on how to execute a task as it would be necessary with traditional programming.", "In essence, machine learning is based on statistical models in order to conduct predictions. During the learning process, the parameters of the statistical model are optimally adapted according to the provided training data. One can say, that the system learns by experience. Based on the given training data, the system is then able to make predictions for unseen events / data. In order for a model to generalize well for those unseen events, it is important to define a model well suited for the problem statement and to have training data available in the necessary quantity and quality.", "Supervised machine learning simply means that we provide an algorithm with fully labeled training data. Labeled training data means that every training record also has the associated answer attached to it. Therefore we already provide clear guidance to the algorithm on how to interpret the data. The algorithm will then construct a model and test it against the given labels. For each iteration, an error function will validate, if the prediction that the model came up with is in alignment with the label. The model will then be adjusted slightly with each iteration until the model performs well on the training data.", "There are two different types of supervised learning. The key thing to remember: Classification separates the data, regression fits the data.", "In cases where it is difficult or too expensive to obtain enough labeled training data, unsupervised methods become relevant. With unsupervised learning, we do not provide the algorithm with labeled training data. Instead we want the algorithm to find a way on its own how to classify / separate the data. The following key categories exist:", "In cases where labeling of massive amounts of training data is too expensive, a mix between supervised and supervised machine learning comes into play. The process starts off with a person labeling a small amount of data (example: CT scans which are interpreted and labeled by an expert radiologist).", "Currently, the most popular example of semi supervised learning is a a special kind of neural network called GAN (general adversarial network). It is using labeled training data to generate new data (via the generator network) and then sends this data to another neural network (discriminator) which needs to identify if the data is fake or part of the training data. The generator and discriminator networks jointly improve in a positive feedback loop. The generator will get better at creating convincing fake data and the discriminator is getting better at separating fake data from training data.", "A great use case for a GAN is the creation of artificial images that should mimic real images. A GAN generated portrait was recently sold at Christie\u2019s for a ridiculously high amount.", "Reinforcement learning is based on the assumption that an optimal behavior or action can be enforced by positive rewards that are given for a favorable action. The basic setup for reinforcement learning comprises an agent which will interact with its environment. Based on the positive / negative feedback the agent receives from its interactions at a given situation, a certain behavior is rewarded and favorable actions are therefore reinforced.", "Within many iterations, the agent will be trained and the performance of its actions to achieve the overall goal are improved. For each action, the agent must decide whether he wants to explore his environment (exploration) in order to search for potentially higher rewards (also the risk of failing is higher) compared to the actions that have already proven to be successful (exploitation).", "A neural network is a machine learning method inspired by biology and how the brain is functioning. They are best used to recognize very complex patterns within unstructured data such us:", "Deep neural networks are simply neural networks that have more than one hidden layer. There are so many great articles and videos on the web that explain how neural nets work in all different layers of detail, therefore I will not explain them here. I have linked some resources at the end of this article.", "There are many different types of neural networks available. Some are used for supervised, other for unsupervised learning. My initial overview pictures plots some of the more popular neural networks to one of the categories. I have recently written an in-depth article about (one dimensional) convolutional neural networks in case you are interested.", "Thank you for reading and I hope you enjoyed the article! Although you might already be familiar with all the topics I covered, I hope it was a light read which puts the key topics in perspective to each other \u2014 at least that was my original intent. Feel free to use the overview figure in your work as long as you reference it accordingly.", "If you want to conduct further readings, I would recommend browsing through the following free available articles (more or less in sequence on how I would read them).", "The postings on this site are my own and do not necessarily represent the postings, strategies or opinions of my employer.", "Your home for data science.
