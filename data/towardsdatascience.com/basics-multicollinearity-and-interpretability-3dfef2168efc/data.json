Checking for multicollinearity (henceforth MC, for the sake of brevity) before you make a regression analysis can help to ensure that you get the most insight out of your data and don\u2019t overlook important relationships.", "MC in your data means that multiple columns (i.e. features, predictors, input variables) in your data table are linearly dependent. In other words, there exist columns in your data table that can be expressed as a linear combination of other columns. Your data matrix X is not of full rank.", "I will make the case for the importance of MC in the context of linear models. The problem extends to nonlinear models as well but is simply not as easy to expose because sophisticated explanation methods are needed to interpret such models.", "Linear models (e.g. linear regression) have the reputation of being explainable, meaning that unlike complicated nonlinear models (e.g. neural networks), it is easy to see how the input relates to the output. You just have to read off the coefficients: the magnitude and sign of the coefficient directly correspond to the effect of the associated feature on the output.", "Oftentimes, data analysts use this property to quantify the relationship of two or more columns by applying linear regression and inspecting the regression coefficients.", "MC undermines this interpretability aspect of linear regression by introducing ambiguity. In MC datasets, the output can not only be expressed as a unique linear combination of columns but equivalently as a combination of its collinear columns.", "Take the fictional toy example of predicting a child\u2019s reading ability (y) as a function of its age (a) and height (h). Let\u2019s assume age and height are perfectly correlated in our data, as in the example below. Now we can express y equivalently as:", "All three expressions are correct, but they lead to very different interpretations of the relationships in the data. In the first case, we could conclude that height is the sole predictor of reading ability and age plays no role at all. In the last case, we might be tempted to postulate that both height and age are needed to predict reading ability.", "Another way of looking at the problem is that a multicollinear matrix is not of full rank. A matrix X that is not of full rank is not invertible. Also, (X^T)X is not invertible. The analytic least-squares solution of linear regression demands exactly an inversion of (X^T)X, and hence it does not exist for multicollinear matrices. For \u201calmost\u201d MC matrices the problem is ill-conditioned.", "So far we thought about the case where some columns are an exact linear combination of others. In practice, this case is negligible because if we\u2019re working with real (i.e. finite and noisy) data, such exact relationships will practically never occur. But even if columns are only approximately collinear, we still have a problem of interpretability. Our model might be fairly stable on a fixed dataset but is still sensitive to small changes in the data. Adding or removing a few samples can make our model \u201cjump\u201d from relying on one set of features to another \u2014 just as it did before.", "As noted before, MC does not only hamper the interpretability of linear models but also affects nonlinear models and their explanations methods, such as input-gradient, layer-wise relevance propagation, or integrated gradients. This is because the ambiguity does not lie in the interpretation method used, but in the data and hence the models that can be learned from it.", "Now that you understand the concept and consequences of multicollinearity, you might wonder how to detect it in your data and how to remedy its effects. These steps go beyond the basics I wanted to convey in this article but I recommend looking at the useful list of methods collected on Wikipedia.", "I hope you learned something useful!", "Your home for data science.
