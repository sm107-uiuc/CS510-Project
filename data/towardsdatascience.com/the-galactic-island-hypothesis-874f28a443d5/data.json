The Milky Way is at least 10 Billion years old, and contains probably more than 200 billion stars. In 2013, data from the Kepler space telescope showed that roughly one in five Sun-like stars contains an habitable planet that is neither too hot nor too cold for life to exist. If 10% of stars are Sun-like, this means that there should probably be around 4 Billion Earth-like planets in our Galaxy. If life started on Earth, it surely must have started on at least some of those 4 Billion worlds as well:", "\u201cDon\u2019t you ever wonder where everybody is?\u201d", "is the question that Enrico Fermi famously asked in 1950 over a lunch with fellow scientists. Fermi\u2019s paradox is the realization that our Galaxy should be filled with life, yet the only civilization we have encountered so far is our own.", "Since its first formulation, a number of solutions to the paradox have been proposed.", "There is the technical argument: perhaps, so the argument goes, civilizations simply cannot figure out how to travel interstellar distances. Consider Proxima Centauri, our closest stellar neighbor, which is currently 4.24 lightyears away. Even with the speed of the Voyager 1, our fastest spacecraft yet sent into space, it would still take us around 80,000 years to get there. If for physical or economical reasons civilizations cannot develop the technology to travel with speeds that are much faster than that, interstellar travel could simply be infeasible.", "Others have argued that alien civilizations exist but are simply not interested in interstellar exploration, or that they have discovered us but decided to leave us alone such as not to destroy our ecosystem. Then there is the idea of the \u2018Great Filter\u2019: in the evolution of a civilization from single-celled organism to multi-planet species, perhaps there is one evolutionary step that is extremely hard to achieve and thus acts as a filter. For instance, that filter could be self-destruction. It is possible that all civilizations ultimately self-destruct before they reach the technological level of being able travel interstellar distances. Depressing.", "Note that neither of these are quantitated statements, which makes it really difficult to conclude anything. If we want to make a quantitated statement about Fermi\u2019s paradox, perhaps a computer simulation could be a better approach.", "How would intelligent civilizations spread throughout the Galaxy? In order to answer this question, first we need to consider stellar motion. The stars in our galaxy are in constant motion due to gravity. This motion is so complex that is almost looks random. Here is a simulation of this effect from ESA:", "Because of stellar motion, our stellar neighborhood changes constantly. As noted earlier, our closest stellar neighbor right now is Proxima Centauri, and it is more than 4 lightyears away. However, it will be only 3.5 lightyears away in 10,000 years. After another 30,000 years, we will have a new closest neighbor: Ross 248, a red dwarf star, which will then be a mere 3 lightyears away. At different times, civilizations might thus settle different stellar systems.", "This is where the agent-based simulations from researchers Jonathan Carroll-Nellenback and collaborators come in. They started with an initial \u2018seed\u2019 distribution of inhabited planets, and then simulated the trajectories of \u2018settlement fronts\u2019 during the following 10 Million years: if a neighboring stellar system that contains habitable planets is within 10 lightyears of an existing civilization, then that civilization will send a probe to the new stellar system and colonize it. The cover image shown above is a visualization of the resulting simulation, where the dots represent habitable stellar systems, and the lines represent settlement trajectories.", "What did the researchers learn from the simulation? Well, it depends on the parameters. At one extreme, it is easy to produce an \u2018empty\u2019 galaxy by shrinking the number of habitable planets and reducing the lifespan of civilizations to less than 100,000 years. At the other extreme, it is possible to tweak the parameters such that the entire galaxy is filled with settlements. Even with the slowest interstellar probes they considered, moving roughly twice as fast as Voyager 1, such a \u2018complete\u2019 colonization would be achieved in much less than a Billion years.", "But the more interesting question is exactly how \u2018filled\u2019 the Galaxy would turn out to be. This brings us to the \u2018Galactic Island\u2019 hypothesis: can there be lonely islands in the Galaxy that are simply too isolated to encounter any visitors?", "Yes, absolutely. For example, if civilizations last 1 Million years and if 3% of stellar systems contain a habitable planet, then the data shows that there is a roughly 10% probability that a single planet like Earth has not seen any evidence of another civilization in at least the past 1 Million years. So, in the end, Fermi\u2019s paradox might not be a paradox after all. It is entirely possible for isolated worlds to exist within the Galaxy, while others are frequently visited. Or, as researcher Caleb Scharf puts it,", "\u201cIn other words, it is not terribly unlikely that we would find ourselves on the lonely side of the equation.\u201d", "This story was inspired by the Scientific American article \u2018Alone in a crowded Milky Way\u2019 by Caleb Scharf.
