Indeed, there are a number of various Relational Database Management Systems (RDMS) that use SQL as their standard language, namely MySQL, Oracle, SQL Server, etc.", "That being said, this project aims to boost my capability in using SQL to the max to explore and manipulate multiple datasets of an e-commerce company. It\u2019s not just limited to data processing; I\u2019ve decided to expand the scope of this project to scale the applicability of structured data to visualization by plugging into Data Studio to build a reporting dashboard.", "If you\u2019re keen, feel free to check out the dataset provided publicly here at Kaggle. Below is a quick summary of the key highlights in this project:", "How should we handle multiple datasets that share relationships with one another?", "If you refer to the database provided by Kaggle, there are 7 to 8 separate datasets that represents an e-commerce sales report: order, customer, order_items, payment, delivery, etc. Prior to data processing, we need to identify the relationship of all datasets with one another to avoid mis-mapping that may result in data loss.", "Take \u201corder\u201d and \u201ccustomer\u201d datasets as an example, one customer can have 0 or multiple orders (one customer_id for different order_id), but one order is only tied to one customer only (one order_id for one customer_id).", "MySQL comes with the built-in function of building an ERR Diagram that allows us to map and draw the relationship of the datasets with one another visually. So what is ERR Diagram?", "Entity Relationship Diagram (ER) displays the relationships of entity set stored in a database. In other words, we can say that ER diagrams help you to explain the logical structure of databases \u2014 Guru99.com", "Enhanced Entity Relationship Diagram (EER) is basically an expanded upon version of ER diagrams. EER models are helpful tools for designing databases with high-level models. With their enhanced features, you can plan databases more thoroughly by delving into the properties and constraints with more precision \u2014 Cacoo.com", "To provide a more visual example,", "The relationships of the datasets to one another are represented by a system of notation called crow\u2019s food notation as below:", "Essentially, ERR Diagram helps us understand the relationship of the datasets better so that we can proceed with data processing more efficiently.", "With this project, I have selected only 5 datasets for the sake of simplicity and the relationships can be easily understood as below ERR Diagram:", "What is SQL Processing and how does SQL help to convert raw data to a more structured and usable format?", "For a formal definition of SQL processing,", "SQL processing is the parsing, optimization, row source generation, and execution of a SQL statement. Depending on the statement, the database may omit some of these stages \u2014 Oracle", "Essentially, we import the raw database and manipulate the cross-table data to convert it into one (or many) structured database which is digestible and easy to understand and scale.", "If you refer back to the ERR Diagram above, we are able to join all the datasets together into one database as a centralized hub for reference before conducting further manipulation. You can join and manipulate from one centralized hub, but I suggest to separate these steps as it\u2019s easier to import future data into the workflow with the hub before processing it together with the existing data.", "Moving to the joining process, as the relationship tells, JOIN (aka INNER JOIN) or LEFT JOIN can be used depending on how you want your structured database looks like. For JOIN syntax, it maps only the values that exist between 2 datasets and removes those that only appear in either. For LEFT JOIN, apart from mapping the connected values, it also includes the values from the \u201cleft\u201d dataset that do not exist in the other.", "In my datasets, I used JOIN for (1) to only take the values that exist in both datasets (customers and orders) while LEFT JOIN for (2), (3), and (4) to also return those values that do not appear in the other dataset. Reason being for LEFT JOIN in this case is to identify the \u201cnull\u201d values that infer the missing information from the input data.", "Some key highlights from the SQL statement:", "After creating a centralized raw database, I proceeded to convert the data into a more structured and usable format, namely:", "The key highlight from this SQL Statement is GROUP BY. When selecting both text and aggregation (e.g. sum, subtract, multiply, etc.), we need to use GROUP BY to arrange identical data into groups. For example, we might have multiple order_ids with the same values, so grouping by order_ids to consolidate the total price from multiple order_ids into one.", "We can further drill down the database to generate the columns and values that align with our business objective.", "What is Data Studio and how does it help to build a visually engaging reporting dashboard?", "After processing the database, we might want to interpret the data visually to conduct analysis and reporting. In fact, there is a variety of platforms that provide visualization services with the integration of relational database systems, namely Tableau, Datorama and Data Studio. In this case, I used Data Studio as it has the option of integrating with MySQL as well as is easy to use and conduct further processing in the dashboard which also uses SQL as the standard language.", "I will not go into details of how to use the platform as it\u2019s pretty straightforward and you should play around based on your needs: https://datastudio.google.com/.", "A quick snapshot of my reporting dashboard and key analysis highlights:", "Voila!
