They are capable of converting information from one representation to another one. For example, when given an image they can blur it, color it (e.g if it was originally black & white), improve its sharpness, or fill missing gaps.", "They are more powerful than your conventional design/production/writing platforms. Because CycleGans are machine learning algorithms, they can in principle learn to implement whatever transformation is desired. Contrarily, traditional transformation software (like Photoshop) is often hardcoded and developed to execute specific tasks. Moreover, CycleGans can achieve higher performance than existing software, since they can learn from data and improve as more of it is collected.", "Understanding the workings and capacities of CycleGans at different levels is exciting and provides insights on how Artificial Intelligence can impact our day-to-day in unprecedented ways.", "Let\u2019s briefly discuss regular Generative Adversarial Networks, before talking about CycleGans.", "Generative adversarial networks (GANs for short) [2] are machine learning algorithms capable of creating data. When they are fed information such as images, sounds or text, they learn to generate new similarly looking/sounding outputs. For example: given a set of human face images, the algorithm can teach itself (train, in the Machine Learning jargon) what a human face looks like, and be able to create new faces. I encourage you to take a look at this article, in which I aim to explain the fundamentals of GANs.", "Cyclic GANs are a particular variation over traditional GANs. They can also create new samples of data, but they do this by transforming input samples, rather than creating ouptuts from scratch. In other words, they learn to transform data from a two sources of data; these distributions can be chosen by the scientist or developer who provides the sets of data to this algorithm. In a scenario where that the two sources of data are pictures of dogs and pictures of cats, the algorithm is effectively capable of converting a cat image to a dog image, and viceversa.", "A CycleGan is a neural network that learns two data transformation functions between two domains. One of them is transformation G(x). It converts a given sample x \u2208 X into elements of domain Y. The second one is F(y), which transforms sample elements y \u2208 Y into elements of domain X.", "Consider reading this article for more context on GANs", "In order to learn F and G, two traditional GANs are used. Each GAN internally has a Generator network that learns how to transform the data as desired. The first generator of GAN learns to compute F and the second generator of GAN learns to compute G.", "Furthermore, each generator is associated with a discriminator that learns to distinguish real data y from synthesized data G(x).", "The CycleGAN is thus composed of two Generators and two discriminators that learn the transformation functions F and G. This structure is displayed in the following graph:", "Each GAN generator will learn its corresponding transformation function (either F or G) by minimizing a loss. The generator loss is calculated by measuring how different the generated data is to the target data (e.g. how different a generated image of a Cat is compared to real cat images). The bigger the difference, the higher the Generator will be penalized.", "A discriminator loss is also used to train the discriminator to be good at distinguishing real data from synthetic data.", "When these two agents are set together, they will improve each other. The generator will be trained to trick the discriminator, and the discriminator will be trained to distinguish better the real data from the synthesized one. As a result, the generator will become very good at creating/transforming the desired data (learning the desired transformation e.g. F ).", "As a whole, the GAN loss looks like:", "A similar loss can be written for the second Generator-Discriminator pair:", "The CycleGAN will try to minimize the sum of the two GAN losses, as a way to learn the desired transformations F and G.", "Ideally, we would want our CycleGAN to learn transformation functions F and G that are cycle consistent. This means that, given an input x, we would like the back-and-forth transformation F(G(x))= x' to output exactly the original input x. Theoretically this should be possible, since applying G on an input x will output a value in the Y domain, and applying F on an input y will output a value in the X domain.", "Cycle-consistency reduces the possible set of mappings that these networks can learn, and forces forces F and G to be opposite transformations. Imagine that the learned functions F transform cat pictures to dog pictures by modifying their ears, and G learns to transform dog pictures into cat pictures by modifying their snout. Though these transformations would attain the goal, they would not be in harmony, as they apply different changes to the data. Using cycle-consistency forces F and G to be the opposite of each other. This way, cat pictures will be transformed into dog pictures by modifying their ears, and dog pictures will be transformed to cat pictures by modifying their ears in the opposite way. If the two functions are cycle-consistent, they also are more meaningful mappings.", "Training a CycleGAN using only the GAN losses does not guarantee that cycle consistency is held. Thus, an additional cycle consistency loss is used to enforce this property. This loss is defined as the absolute value difference (L1 norm) between an input value x and it's forward-cycle prediction F(G(x)), as well as the input values y and their forward-cycle prediction G(F(y)). The higher the difference, the more distant the predictions are from the original inputs. Ideally, our network would minimize this loss.", "The full CycleGan loss that is used to train the network is defined as the sum of the two GAN losses and the Cycle consistency loss.", "A weighting factor \u019b (named lambda) is used to control the weight of the cycle consistency loss in the full loss. The higher the weight, the more relevant it would be to reduce the cycle consistency loss, compared to the other losses.", "CycleGANs that are optimized to minimize this function will be able to learn the desired transformations F and G. The machine learning training details will be left for my following post.", "CycleGans have been tested on the completion of several tasks already, and have been able to solve them successfully. A few examples of these tasks are:", "Photo enhancement: CycleGans have been trained to generate professional pictures of flowers, with several levels of focus and blurriness as well any with photo editing tools.", "Image Style transfer: CycleGans have been trained to transform the style of pictures and pieces of art. For example, they have been able to transform photographs into Van Gogh-styled paintings of the same landscapes.", "Season transfer: Simliar to style transfer, CycleGANs have been used to convert the season in which pictures were taken. Results are astonishing here, as many of the images look like real pictures.", "Music genre transfer: Researchers from ETH univeristy in Zurich have been able to train CycleGANs to convert classical pop-genre music songs into classical music pieces [4].", "Voice conversion: Researchers from NTT Communication Science Laboratories in Japan demonstrated impressive results when using CycleGANs to convert voice registries between locutors, regardless of their gender [5].", "Audio samples of this work can be found in their website.", "The official CycleGan paper website provides a gallery of additional CycleGAN use-cases found in different places of the internet. I hope these fascinating examples encourage you to further learn about CycleGans and come up with more useful and interesting applications of them.", "Despite the apparent success of CycleGANs in the many aforementioned tasks, exhibit a 100% success rate. Here are some of their current pitfalls:", "Further research may focus on improving the work in these areas. Some strategies include the use of broader and more diverse datasets, as well as using semi-supervised learning approaches.", "I would like to thank and congratulate Jun-Yan Zhu, Taesung Park, Phillip Isola and Alexei A. Efros from the AI Research lab at UC Berkeley for their work on CycleGans.
