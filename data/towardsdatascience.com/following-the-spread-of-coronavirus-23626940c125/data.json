With the progressive spread of COVID-19 all around the world, we have read and heard much \u2014 and more \u2014 about how contagious it is; its extreme aggressiveness in some areas such as China, South Korea, Italy, USA, Brazil, and more to come; the severe containment measures adopted; and we have seen this chart, monitoring the spreading of the disease day by day by counting the cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths all over the world.", "An informative breakdown of these numbers can be found in the \u2014 by now very popular \u2014 blog post \u201cCoronavirus: Why You Must Act Now\u201d by Tomas Pueyo. There the impressive difference about the spread of the disease worldwide and its spread worldwide outside of China shows just how effective the containment measures in China have been and the danger that the rampant COVID-19 virus now poses to the rest of the world: first of all USA, Brazil, South Korea, Iran, and Italy as the most affected countries outside of China. One week later, today, has the situation significantly evolved?", "We have reproduced this line plot and other charts in a free to download web application, to drill down on the current situation. We broke down these data to explore the situation by continent and by country.", "Let\u2019s start with a breakdown of the data in Asia, where the epidemic started. The cumulative numbers of confirmed COVID-19 cases by country in Asia, updated to July 6th 2020, are shown in figure 2a.", "Figure 2a shows that the lead on number of confirmed cases for COVID19 now belongs to Russia, while China seems to finally have met the flattening of the curve necessary to keep the situation under control. Immediately below Russia, we find India with a similarly rampant curve. The early flattening of China\u2019s and South Korea\u2019s curve gives hope to all other countries still fighting the virus. Lock-down and people tracking measures have been enforced in South Korea since February 20. Apparently, it took around two weeks before the effects of such measures showed up in the plot.", "The high range of the numbers for Russia and India makes it hard to see what is happening in the other countries. For better visibility of the details, this same line plot was moved to a logarithmic scale on the y-axis (Fig. 2b). Here the trends for all countries and not just Russia and India can be seen more easily. Notice that in a logarithmic scale everything becomes less dramatic: exponential curves become lines and the slower growth becomes more evident. For example, we can see that the growth in the number of confirmed cases in China and South Korea has decreased much more than in Russia or India, even though the two logarithmic curves are quite close.", "The investigation of the curves for East Asian countries is a quite important piece of the puzzle, since these countries were affected earlier on by the epidemic and therefore have longer experience in handling it. By checking these curves, we can learn more about the spread of the disease and the effectiveness of the containment measures.", "For South Korea, the onset of the epidemic can be dated back to around January 20; a huge increase followed in mid February until the slow down commenced at the beginning of March. This confirms the number of circa two weeks before containment measures took effect.", "Russia\u2019s curve starts a bit later, it grows similarly to the curve of China at the beginning, accelerates in mid April, but continues to grow steadily. No sign of slow down yet as in China or South Korea.", "Moving west, we see the insurgence of the epidemic in the Middle East, mainly in Iran. The spread of the disease here starts later than in the Far East, but it follows the same dramatic trend with no hint of slowing down for now.", "Figure 3a, below, shows the dramatic situation in Europe, where now is UK to lead with the alarming highest number of confirmed cases. Italy was the country with the highest number of confirmed cases till May 2020. Severe lock-down measures were enforced in Italy starting early March, initially in a milder form but stepping up from March 9 in a stricter form. It took over a month of enforced lock-down to see a slow down in the increase in number of confirmed cases in Italy. The flattening of the curve though is apparent for all European countries, including now the UK.", "However, numbers about the spread of the contagion do not tell the whole story. The other face of an epidemic is its mortality, i.e. the number of deaths. A similar plot to the one in figure 3a is shown in figure 3b. This time on the y-axis we see the cumulative number of deaths due to COVID-19 as opposed to the number of confirmed cases. This plot is similar to the one in figure 3a, with UK and Italy paying the largest toll, immediately followed by France and Spain. All European countries by now have met the onset of the epidemic. It remains unexplained as of now the situation of Germany (Fig. 3a), with a high number of confirmed cases and a relatively low number of consequent deaths (Fig. 3b).", "At some point in time, between March and May, containment measures have been enforced in all these countries , following Italy\u2019s actions in March. The result is the flattening of all curves.", "Another popular chart that has been visible on the Internet in the past few months was produced by Mark Handley and is available on his Twitter account. It\u2019s a line plot of cumulative numbers where the time on the x-axis has been normalized as the number of days from the onset of the epidemic in the country. Considering time zero as the time when the first COVID-19 cases were confirmed in the country, the curve is subsequently plotted over the number of days from that time zero. The advantage of such a view is the overlapping of the curves as if they were evolving at the same time. It is a way for countries to now learn from the experience of countries who were affected earlier (Fig. 4).", "Mark Handley used this graphic at the beginning of March to show what would be lying ahead for countries like Germany, USA, or France if they did not take urgent containment measures. Indeed, at that time, many countries showed the same onset to the curve as Italy\u2019s onset; which could indicate a similar evolution if no earlier containment measures were taken. Here we can see that, by now, USA, Brazil, Russia, and India have quickly reached and surpassed all other countries in number of confirmed cases, even if being a few days later on the time axis.", "Comparing Italy to China, in March, we could see that the early start of the epidemic in the two countries was similar, though China started seeing a limitation in the growth of confirmed cases about one month after the onset. According to this graphic and assuming that the containment measures had the same effects in both countries, we could expect the growth to reduce in Italy within a week or two. It took indeed much longer for Italy\u2019s curve on COVID spread to reach the same shape as China\u2019s curve. Notice that \u201cassuming that the containment measures have the same effects in both countries\u201d is a largely unverified assumption, since Italy has not implemented tracking its population. Also worthy of mention are the facts that the two countries\u2019 population demographics are quite different, as are their size and health systems.", "The most worrisome trend for North America is that of the USA (Fig. 5a). The quick spreading of the disease resembles the early data points for European countries (Fig. 4).", "Canada has smaller numbers of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in comparison to the USA. However, if we inspect the logarithmic curve we can see that the aggressiveness of the disease spread is similar (Fig. 5b).", "As of July 2020, all countries show confirmed cases of COVID19. The most aggressive spread being in South America. This is indeed the biggest difference with previous versions of this blog post: the high number of confirmed cases in South America (Fig. 6).", "Cumulative numbers and the flattening of the curve do not tell the whole story. We can have a more in depth look at the situation by checking the number of new confirmed cases day by day for the most affected countries (Fig. 7).", "Here we can see a dramatic jump in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases all around the world on July 6th 2020.", "Drilling down country by country, we see no data \u2014 i.e. a negligible number of confirmed cases \u2014 for China and South Korea. On the opposite we see the daily great increase in number of confirmed cases in the USA (darker blue), Brazil (light blue), again India (orange), and Russia (pale orange). Daily increase numbers though seems to be diminishing, which given the situation can be taken with cautious optimism.", "Finally, let\u2019s abandon the sad field of contagion and death and simply look at how we implemented this web application using guided analytics. It consists of two pages. The first page shows the general line plot of confirmed cases and deaths all over the world (displayed in Fig. 1). Here, we can also select the type of analysis we want to perform: worldwide or for a specific continent; counting the number of confirmed cases and deaths.", "By clicking \u201cNext\u201d in the lower right corner of the page, we move to the second page of the web application (Fig. 9). This is where you will find all the sub-graphics we showed in Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6, as well as a choropleth on a world map. All plots are interactive. You can add and remove countries to/from the list, zoom in and out of sections of the plot, select data points and show the same data points in all other plots as well.", "No coding was required to develop this application, since it was developed using the free open source KNIME Analytics Platform. The workflow \u201cCOVID-19 Live Visualization using Guided Analytics\u201d implementing this web application (Fig. 10) is free and can be downloaded from the KNIME Hub.", "The workflow gets the data, provided by this GitHub repository via REST API. The API services checks the 2019-nCoV Data Repository by Johns Hopkins CSSE and caches the most recent data every hour. Each time the workflow executes, we get these cached data from the REST API. If the API breaks for whatever reason the KNIME workflow also provides additional cached data via a simple Table Reader node. The KNIME .table file is stored within the workflow and updated every time the workflow is executed on KNIME Analytics Platform.", "Next, the workflow processes the JSON structured data using an apposite KNIME Extension, appends a column with the continent name to each record, adds the right timestamp domain, recognizes missing values and finally visualizes the first page of the application using the Component \u201cCOVID-19 Overview\u201d. Using Single Selection Widgets the user can select the category of patient cases (e.g. confirmed cases) and continent (e.g. Europe) to be visualized. In the next component, called \u201cCOVID-19 Focus\u201d, more information on the respective selection can be visualized via Plotly and Google GeoChart and other KNIME JavaScript nodes.", "The workflow can be deployed on KNIME WebPortal via KNIME Server as a web based application where all this complexity is hidden from the eyes of the user. The user can access the combined views (or dashboards) via a simple link from any web browser and interact with it to visualize the most recent available data on the coronavirus crisis.", "More example workflows are available on the KNIME Hub, like for example another workflow by Paolo Tamagnini, visualizing COVID-19 virus data for Italy region by region.
