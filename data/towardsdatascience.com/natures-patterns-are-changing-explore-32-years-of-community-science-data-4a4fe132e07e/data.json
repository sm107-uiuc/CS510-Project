These natural observations and more are meticulously recorded along with the day, time and location. This began as a hobby while delivering mail along a 100 mile route in rural northern MN USA, and quickly became a way of life long after his last envelop was delivered. These types of observations, termed phenology, are aptly defined by Latimer as the rhythmic biological nature of events as they relate to climate.", "\u201cPhenology is the rhythmic biological nature of events as they relate to climate. ~John Latimer\u201d", "Or put another way, phenology is the study of seasonal plant and animal activity driven by environmental factors. Over millennia, the phenology of a species evolves through natural selection to match environmental conditions and maximize fitness. This gradual process results in species that are finely tuned to their natural surroundings. A key focus area in the natural sciences is to determine how changing climatic conditions will alter phenology, the consequences of altered phenology on species fitness \u2014 and perhaps most importantly \u2014 how changing phenology will alter species interactions.", "We can briefly illustrate the concept of phenology and species interactions with a wild bird example. Bird eggs must hatch when food, such as insects, is plentiful. Therefore, the timing of hatchling birth and insect abundance have co-evolved to be synchronous, or matched. If climate change alters these environmental cues then bird phenology will shift, but what about the phenology of the insects that the birds prey upon? Will hatchling emergence and insect abundance continue to be matched, or will climate change alter them differently and mismatch highly co-evolved predator \u2014 prey interactions?", "Latimer is part of the growing community science movement. Representing those that are typically not trained as scientist, but who contribute to science and humanity nonetheless.", "However, what seems to be lacking is a broader discussion on how community science data is going to be used and analyzed.", "One complication is the shear enormity of the data. Just Latimer alone recorded some 104,840 entries! Furthermore, what is the quality of the data and who is going to analyze them? The logical answer is scientists and professors at public institutions, yet funding and resource limitations often makes this near impossible. It is with such thoughts in mind that led me to the following question:", "\u201cIs community \u2014 based data analytics the next major transition in science?\u201d", "My recent exposure to the open data science communities at Medium and publications within provides an interesting perspective on this question, as it shows that there is no shortage of talented data scientists eager to play with novel datasets.", "As a start to this small community based science experiment, I provide access to Latimer\u2019s data and initial exemplar R code.", "This is by no means exhaustive, as the intent is to introduce the data scientists to the environmental data and, in turn, introduce the community scientists to some basic analytics in R.", "The hope is that this handshake transpires into collaborations consumed with open data and sophisticated analyses.", "Data first look and date formate", "Install the following R libraries and load them.", "Read the data into R datphen<-read.csv(\u201cLatimer_Cleaned_1.csv\u201d) and give it a look head(datphen). The data are impressive! Over a 32 year span, Latimer manually collected 10,484 phenology observations. Along with the date recorded, Latimer and colleague Nanninga added 9 other variables (e.g., genus, species, common name, lifeform, etc.) for a total of 104,840 total observations. This is just the start, our dataset stops at 2016 while Latimer continues to record phenology observations to this day!", "The data is in typical \u2018date\u2019 format. However, scientists typically use Julian day format to provide a continuous count of the days starting at January 1st each year. Each year will contain 365 days or 366 days if a leap year.", "A quick look at the data shows that Latimer did not record observations daily. This makes sense as plants are dormant in the winter and birds migrate seasonally.", "The data include observations on plants, birds and other animals. To get a feel for the plant species observed use the following:", "This produces a table with plant common name and the number of observations Latimer made for that species. Below is the table for the first 10 entries.", "We can see from the above table that some species have numerous observation while others less so. Below we use the following code to visualize the number of observations Latimer made per species throughout the 32 years of data collections.", "Just for plants alone, Latimer recorded an impressive 392 species \u2014 seen as the number of bars along the horizontal x-axis above. However, the number of observations per species varies considerably. To ensure that we have enough observations per species to detect phenology changes, we are restricting the analysis to those species with 15 or more observations (Species with observations above the blue line in above graph), which results in 76 species.", "From the selected 76 species, we will fit a linear regression model to each species to determine if a change in flowering time phenology coincides with a change in year.", "Preparing data for linear regression loop and graphs:", "The below code shows how to run a linear model consecutively (i.e., loop) through all 76 species, and neatly extract the model slope and p\u2014 value to identify candidate species for further investigation.", "The regression analysis shows that 10 of the 76 species have an p \u2014 value < 0.05. Meaning that there is a significant relationship between when Latimer noticed first flowering (Julian day) for a given species, and the year the observations were recorded (year). Interpreting significance and ensuring that model assumptions are met should be further investigated and beyond the scope of this post.", "To plot all the significant species, prep the data as shown in R notebook and run the following function:", "The code examples above and as detailed in the R notebook can be used to investigate other plant and animal species within Latimer\u2019s dataset. The three graphs below are chosen to show various trends in phenology. The Dark Eyed Junco, for example, seems to appear at the same time each year despite prevailing weather conditions. Keep in mind that weather changes appear locally over short timeframes, from minutes to hours to days; while climate is longe-term regional and global averages. So if northern MN is experiencing climate change, the early phase of Dark Eyed Junco migration does not seem to be influenced.", "In contrast to the Junco, the plants shown below display trends in flowering time. With False Solomon\u2019s Seal showing a delayed flowering day response at this site for the years observed, while aspen displays an earlier flowering day phenology. Notice that the left side of the aspen graph has less observations than the right. What happens when you exclude the earlier years? Do you get the same trend \u2014 hint, see R notebook.", "Forget the political undertones that somehow seem to accompany any post that mentions the word \u2018climate.\u2019 Instead, this is meant to introduce Latimer\u2019s life long work to the data science community. I encourage you to form your own opinions on these data. Are the data complete enough to make robust models? What models should be used and what additional data would help \u2014 e.g., weather related variables? Or, should we leave phenology to professional scientists? Are you ready to contribute to the cause and start recording your own phenology data?", "And for the community scientists out there, what can be learned by engaging the global data science community? Are you ready to look at your data with the same enthusiasm that you have for recording phenology?", "Towards the end of our interview, I had to ask Latimer what drives him. Why has he recorded data for over three decades regardless of the harsh sub-boreal Minnesota conditions. His response was quite simple:", "The joy of discovery, and the anticipation of noticing something new every day.", "Perhaps community based data analytics is the next major transition in science \u2014 only time will tell, but for Latimer it doesn\u2019t really matter. He is going to get out of bed, walk the woods and continue to record nature\u2019s secrets.", "Weston\u2019s earliest memories are littered with images from nature. Professionally he is fascinated by host-microbiome interactions, passionate about energy solutions and the environment, and all things related to open analytics. Personally he is a wannabe farmer raising three awesome children with an amazing spouse.", "This story is made possible by the hard work of John Latimer, who eagerly recorded nature\u2019s secrets throughout the last three and half decades.", "The painstaking task of translating and annotating Latimer\u2019s data into a spreadsheet was accomplished by Claudia Nanninga \u2014 the real phenology expert.", "Many thanks to those who made the poplar, False Solomon Seal and Junco photographs available under the creative commons license.", "Thanks to Kristine Cabugao, for the fine edits and kind words.", "Your home for data science.
