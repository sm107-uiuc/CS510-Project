This conversation appeared on this, the first episode of DatFramed, at ~19:25:", "HBA: Now it\u2019s time for segment called Statistical Pitfalls. I\u2019m here with Michael Betancourt, core developer of the open source statistical modeling platform Stan, who also goes around at parties calling himself a once and future physicist masquerading as a statistician. What\u2019s up, Mike?", "MB: Thanks for having me, Hugo. I am very fun at parties.", "HBA: You\u2019re here today to tell about a common statistical trap: selection bias.", "MB: Indeed. Selection bias is arguably present anytime we collect data. Before talking about generalities, however, I want to first demonstrate how subtle it can be by considering one of the most famous examples of selection bias which came out of an analysis in World War II lead by the statistician Abraham Wald.", "The Allied military was interested in how they could most efficiently use their limited resources to supplement the armor of the damaged aircraft that were returning from combat missions. The planes returning would be damaged in particular locations and popular thinking was to add more protection to where they observed damage.", "This thinking, however, implicitly assumed that the returning planes were representative of the entire population of damaged planes. Wald and his team, however, recognized that the returning planes were in fact a biased sample because they didn\u2019t include the planes that never make it back from their missions.", "Once they understood this selection bias in their data they recommended the seemingly counterintuitive strategy of reinforcing armor in places where the returning bombers were undamaged. What they realized was that if potential damage was uniformly distributed across each plane then the damage on the returning planes actually demonstrated what damage was survivable. Harm to the undamaged areas, on the other hand, was likely to be critical and prevent the plane from returning.", "HBA: And this is an example of selection bias, right?", "MB: Yes, exactly. One of the most common pitfalls in statistics is the misunderstanding that the data in hand are fully representative of the system being studied. Were this true we would be able to infer arbitrarily precise insights about that system as we collected more and more data.", "Unfortunately, in practice our measurements are never quite as perfect as assume them to be and the reality is that anytime we collect data we neglect some of it. If we want to ensure accurate inferences in practice then we have to consider how these selection biases might be corrupting our data. In particular we have to consider how our measurement process preferentially ignores data with some properties while preserving others.", "If we don\u2019t, then the inferences we draw from even very large data sets will always be limited in how much they teach us about the system that we\u2019re analyzing.", "HBA: How big of a problem can selection bias be? How do you combat it?", "MB: The exact consequences of selection bias depend both on the selection mechanism itself and and how precise of an inference we need a given application. For example, if we\u2019re a company and we\u2019re trying to understand how a niche demographic interacts with our product, then even small selection biases can seriously distort our insights.", "Ultimately the only way to quantify the magnitude of these effects, and determine whether or not selection bias needs to be taken into account, is to build a mathematical model of the full measurement process. Fortunately there is growing collection of tools to facilitate this kind of complex modeling, in particular, probabilistic programming languages like Stan.", "HBA: Mike, thanks for that great description of the common statistical pitfall of selection bias.", "MB: Thanks for having me, Hugo.", "Your home for data science.
