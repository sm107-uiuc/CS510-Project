After speaking to one of my close LinkedIn connections, I realized that the process I went through might make for an interesting article. Thus, here we are.", "There are many different ways to solve problems; mathematical laws, derived mathematical equations, or helpful representations of information. For instance, a FICO credit score is a helpful and meaningful representation of someone\u2019s ability to pay back credit. Is it a law? No. Neither is a Quarterback Score for the NFL. Many indexes that we rely on as indicators, like the Dow Jones, are not proven scientific facts, but rather a concise way to represent data in a meaningful format.", "Eric Temple Bell, creator of the Bell Series, stated:", "\u201cAbstractness, sometimes hurled as a reproach at mathematics, is its chief glory and its surest title to practical usefulness. It is also the source of such beauty as may spring from Mathematics\u201d", "In other words, sometimes abstract thinking can lead to practicality.", "COVID Dashboards were popping up all over the internet. One commonality was that there was a lack of clarity over where the virus was hitting the hardest. Did \u201cSeverity\u201d have to do with deaths or infections? Assuming that people in cities like New York City have more contact with others than people in rural areas of the country, should the population play a role in determining how severe the virus is?", "\u201cWhat if I could come up with a way to represent the Severity of the virus in each county of the United States so that a person could easily tell where the virus was impacting health the most?\u201d", "I pondered this idea and decided to research what the epidemiologists have determined.", "For flu outbreaks, public health officials usually use a Pandemic Severity Assessment Framework (PSAF) to help determine how \u201cbad\u201d a pandemic will be. It uses two factors; clinical severity and virus transmissibility. The article mentions, \u201cThe PSAF is one of two assessment tools developed by CDC to guide and coordinate actions among federal, state, local, and tribal entities involved in pandemic response\u201d", "The article then refers to the \u201cNovel Framework for Assessing Epidemiologic Effects of Influenza Epidemics and Pandemics\u201d (Reed et al. 2013). The novel framework details 4 methodology steps for determining the pandemic severity dependent on data availability, transmissibility, and clinical severity indicators. The article also mentions that historically, the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) has been used.", "Another well known statistic for diseases is Mortality Rate.", "Another link on the CDC website points to the Influenza Risk Assessment Tool (IRAT). The article explains \u201cThe IRAT uses 10 scientific criteria to measure the potential pandemic risk associated with each of these scenarios. These 10 criteria can be grouped into three overarching categories: \u201cproperties of the virus,\u201d \u201cattributes of the population,\u201d and \u201cecology & epidemiology of the virus.\u201d (Reed et al. 2019).", "There did not seem to be one metric that captured it all. The overall framework and assessment tools that exist seem to focus on the nature of how the virus spreads, not necessarily \u201chow severe each region is\u201d.", "This being the case, I started to brainstorm:", "\u201cWhat do I think determines Severity and how can I incorporate common epidemiology calculations to give this equation some legitimacy?", "None of the articles I had read mentioned growth rates. Infections and deaths have different growth rates. Therefore, I would need to insert them as separate entities. This train of thought led me to create an Infection Score and a Death Score where:", "I decided that the Death Score would be multiplied by 2 to account for the fact that there would be more infections than deaths and I initially decided to model my equation after the exponential growth formula y = ab^x where a would be the total metric, b would be the growth rate, and x would be squared. Dividing by population to normalize, the first Severity score was born.", "Sticking with the exponential growth concept, I added Positive Test Percentage (PTP) as a coefficient for the Total Infections Growth Rate with the rationale that a county with 1000 positive results out of 1 million tests should be represented as less severe than a county with 1000 positive results out of 1001 tests.", "With the Positive Test Percentage reducing the impact of Total Infections Growth Rate, I thought that adding the Case Fatality Ratio as a reducing coefficient for the Total Deaths Growth Rate would be an appropriate metric to include in the Severity score.", "Problems: There were two major questions that arose with this round of equations and one problem that I didn\u2019t yet notice.", "I didn\u2019t notice that both CFR and PTP are < 1 and most of the growth rates are also < 1. Multiplying them together essentially added nothing to my score when deaths and infections could both be in the thousands.", "Leaving those problems aside, I decided to gather some feedback about what I was doing. The most common questions I received were", "\u201cWhy are Total Deaths multiplied by 2?\u201d and \u201cWhy are you squaring the Growth Rates?\u201d", "My professor, Vibhanshu Abhishek, told me that the weights for each of the scores should not be determined by me since each person has their own bias for how they would compare infections and deaths in terms of Severity.", "This being the case, I decided to add in two coefficients that could be adjusted by the user, a death coefficient \u2014 \u03b1 and an infection coefficient \u2014 \u03b2 each ranging between 0 and 1. In addition, I added in Population Density with the rationale that an increase in Population should decrease Severity (since each infection/death is now a smaller fraction of the total), but an increase in Population Density should increase Severity as people would come into contact more often. To accomplish this behavior, Population would need to be on the denominator and Population Density would need to be on the numerator. For easier reading, it can be represented as seen below.", "Incorporating this feedback, the equations resulted in:", "Problems: I did not realize the problem with the denominator until later, but", "Population is cancelled out and the denominator is left equal to Area.", "With an equation riddled with questions and problems that I did not initially realize, I went ahead and created the first iteration of the U.S Severity Dashboard.", "An entire view of the country based on the Severity with rankings for each state and county. I was very pleased with the result. My professor told me that I should probably take a log of the equation in order to normalize the Severity as the distribution was highly skewed in its current state.", "Taking the log of my Severity score, I realized that I was breaking the first law of logarithms in one of my representations.", "The first law of logarithms states:", "log A + log B = log AB", "log(Infection Score) + log(Death Score) \u2260 log (Infection Score + Death Score)", "This posed a new problem because the Death Score and Infection Score could not be multiplied. If they were multiplied, a Death Score of 0 (no deaths) would result in a Severity score of 0, even if that state or county had millions of infections. Therefore, I needed the Infection Score to be added to the Death Score.", "After playing with derivations of the proper logarithmic representation, I finally discovered the issues I had mentioned earlier and decided I needed to rework the entire equation.", "Days of experimenting went by and I tried to focus on why I was creating Severity score in the first place.", "\u201cThe point of the Severity score is to enable comparison of health impact between counties or states\u201d", "I restructured the equation to account for the fact that once the growth rate is 0, meaning no new infections, the resulting Severity score would be based on the total amount of infections and deaths that the county or state had reached.", "Gathering input from several people, I asked a fundamental question about the Severity equation.", "\u201cWhen a county or state no longer has any infections or deaths, should their Severity score be zero or the highest that it reached?\u201d", "\u201cOf course the Severity Score should be zero if there are no more infections or deaths, that\u2019s when you would say there is NO SEVERITY\u201d", "Thinking about this answer, I realized that made perfect sense. In its current state, the equation would never equal zero since Total Deaths and Total Infections would never equal zero. This meant a small adjustment needed to be made.", "I decided that if I calculated weekly averages of the last 7 days for both infections and deaths, then if a county or state stopped having new infections or deaths, their Severity scores would be zero. I also had to change the growth rates to be based on the last 7 days as well.", "This representation felt like the perfect balance of what I wanted to achieve in this equation.", "Exactly 1 month after starting the Severity Dashboard, I now had a completed equation and an updated dashboard to show for it.", "Two months later, the Daily Pilot (LA Times) picked up the story.", "What Does the Finished Product Look Like?", "After several months of adding tooltips, updates, new features, user experience, and quality checks, the U.S. Severity Dashboard: COVID-19 in its present form is pictured below.
