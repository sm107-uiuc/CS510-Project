I would like to remind you that, contrary to what people believe now, XP was created not as a reaction to Waterfall process, but rather what Kent Beck called \u201ccode-and-fix\u201d methodology, which is an exact opposite of Waterfall, because is characterized by writing unmaintainable code that is very difficult and expensive to change, missing deadlines, lack of planning and work on the weekends. Waterfall was seen as an attempt to fix this by introducing Big Design Up Front (BDUF). XP, on the other hand, proposed a different solution to software development chaos by introducing disciplined software development practices, especially TDD and refactoring. The idea was to write unit tests in a way that can be run later in order to prove that the code is still working. This would enable to refactor the code without fear that it would break the system.", "Faithful to its name, XP proposed to turn this practice to the extreme by running the test suites all the time. But this has become even more extreme, when the XP practitioners started writing the tests before writing the code. The unit tests were treated as executable specifications, and TDD \u2014 as programming by example. Indeed, you encode the new requirement in a series of test-examples, then writing the code to get all the examples satisfied, and then do refactoring, making sure that all tests are still passing. This is the famous Reg-Green-Refactor cycle, so familiar to Agile practitioners.", "I was reminded of this when I listened to an interview of Cassie Kozyrkov, where she said that machine learning is programming by example. Indeed, back in 2000s I was thinking, would it be really cool if the code were written automatically based on the tests I write? And so I realized that machine learning is the fulfillment of my dream. Not that I did not know it, but the connection between TDD and ML became clear only then.", "Granted, that at this point machine learning cannot fully replace a programmer, because rather than writing a program, it is learning a large quantity of model parameters, requiring many iterations to get it right. Since the number of examples is limited, the model is likely to overfit to these examples (this is a danger for a human programmer too!) But one may hope that in the future the algorithms become powerful enough to be able to accomplish that, and indeed generate a correctly working program based on test-examples.", "Your home for data science.
