Even now, I still see books providing Sudoku exercises in a bookstore and of course many apps providing exercises on App Stores.", "However, when any challenge falls on a programmer\u2019s hand, what he will think immediately is how to solve it with a script. Sudoku is of no exception. A common solution for solving Sudoku is using Backtracking (aka brute force). This method is a depth-first search and tests a whole branch of until this branch violates the rules or this branch is the solution.", "Although this can almost guarantee to find a solution, the brute force does not enjoy the beauty of Sudoku which I do not like very much. Therefore I am looking for a more elegant way to solve Sudoku. And there is one indeed.", "James Crook, a professor of computer science at Winthrop University published a paper called \u201cA Pencil-and-Paper Algorithm for Solving Sudoku Puzzles\u201d (link). He created an algorithm for solving a Sudoku and he said this algorithm could be applied physically. The algorithm applies all rules in Sudoku and uses a more mathematical method to solve Sudoku. There is no complex rule involved. And so I transform this algorithm into a Python script", "Before moving on to introduce this algorithm, there are two points I would like to mention:", "(PS: I assume you already know the rules of Sudoku and thus I will not explain those rules in detail. If you don\u2019t know, please go to Wikipedia and look those up).", "The first step is easy, list out all possible numbers in each cell.", "If you have used an app to play Sudoku, there should already be a function allowing you to write down some possible numbers in a cell. In the first step of the algorithm, for each cell, you follow the rules and write down all possible numbers.", "The team \u201csingleton\u201d seems so complicated. However, the concept is easy, finding if there is a row, column, or box with only one possible value throughout the row, column, or box. Since there is one and only one number in each row, column, and box, if there is only a cell in the row, column, or box with the respective number, this number must be in this cell. So you fill in this cell with this number and then update markups in an affected row, column, or box.", "This step is quite difficult as I spent a lot of time to understand this part. Below is the definition of preemptive sets from Crook\u2019s paper.", "A preemptive set is composed of numbers from the set [1, 2, . . . , 9] and is a set of size m, 2 \u2264 m \u22649, whose numbers are potential occupants of m cells exclusively, where exclusively means that no other numbers in the set [1, 2, . . . , 9] other than the members of the preemptive set are potential occupants of those m cells.", "The range of a preemptive set is a row, column, or box in which all of the cells of the preemptive set are located. When m = 2 or 3, the range can be one of the sets [row,box] or [column, box] .", "To simplify it, if m numbers are a set or a superset of a markup of m cells within a row, column, box, [row, box] or [column, box], then this combination of numbers and cells are a preemptive set.", "This step is the most important part of the algorithm and this step helps reduce possible numbers of cells.", "Let X be a preemptive set in a Sudoku puzzle markup. Then every number in X that appears in the markup of cells not in X over the range of X cannot be a part of the puzzle solution.", "In this step, for all numbers in a preemptive set, they cannot be possible numbers for a cell outside the preemptive set. The reason here is simple, as each number can be once only in each row, column or box. If this number is in the preemptive set, this number must be placed in those cells in the set. As a result, all cells in the same row, column and box cannot have this number as a possible number in the markup.", "The link to the project: https://github.com/wyfok/sudoku", "An excel is needed to store the question of Sudoku from cell A1 to I9. Missing cells are filled with 0. In the main.py, after providing the file path of the excel file and the sheet name for the question, the program will run both basic Sudoku rules and Crook\u2019s algorithm until there is no further update on the result. Then the program will print out the result, whether this result is the solution or not.", "Basically the whole Python program loops each rule and updates the markup and solution. For example, below is the function for checking each row. If there is a possible number shown in only one cell, then this number will be the solution to this cell.", "Below is the function of applying Crook\u2019s algorithm. The function will try to find a preemptive set from the largest set of possible numbers to the smallest. If the size of the possible numbers in one cell matches with the number of cells in which their possible numbers are subsets of that cell, then the function will eliminate all possible numbers for cells outside the preemptive set.", "Feel free to try using my program and solve your Sudoku problems.
