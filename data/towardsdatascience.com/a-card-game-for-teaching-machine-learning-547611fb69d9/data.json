This also raises the question for scientists and educators as to how the topic and important basic concepts can be taught. There are already approaches to teach these contents to primary school pupils, as described in the following article:", "The technology behind it and especially the mathematical basics are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea. Therefore, new approaches to knowledge transfer are needed.", "I have developed a card game for my students to help them understand the important principles of machine learning. I would like to introduce it briefly in this article. The Game is designed to show the principles of \u201cSupervised Learning\u201d, \u201cUnsupervised Learning\u201d and \u201cReinforcement Learning\u201d. The students discover the most important ideas in a playful way and develop a feeling for the functioning of machine learning procedures.", "The playing card set consists of 32 cards that are printed with individual patterns. Each playing card represents one data set.", "The students are divided into groups of 4 persons each, and each playing group receives the following 16 playing cards:", "The task is to divide the cards into 4 groups, which the students think to belong together. Then they have to describe which characteristics were used to make the distinction.", "It is possible to distinguish the cards on the basis of the following characteristics:- The thickness of the lines- The opacity of the color of the lines", "All other characteristics of the data, such as color, number of lines, exact positioning, etc. do not contribute to the differentiation.", "The groups of cards were created with the following characteristics:- Group A: 4mm line width, 50% opacity- Group B: 4mm line width, 100% opacity- Group C: 6mm line width, 100% opacity- Group D: 6mm line width, 50% opacity", "The task is to teach that it is important for a machine-learning algorithm to learn the correct features and characteristics of the features. The representation of the data as values of the characteristics is crucial. It also shows how Unsupervised Learning (Clustering) works.", "The second task is to explain what can be seen on the cards. However, this requires additional information. This is given in the form of 16 additional cards, which in addition to the pattern have noted what can be seen on the card. There are 4 different \u201cobjects\u201d to see:\u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d:", "The task of the students is, therefore, to assign which of the 4 groups from task 1 belongs to which class of objects.The additional cards stand for a labeled dataset and the task clarifies the principle of supervised learning.", "The third task is to find out in a different way which objects belong to a particular class that is \u201cstronger\u201d than the other objects. There is no data in the form of a \u201clabeled dataset\u201d that shows the affiliation to this class. This special property of the objects must be derived by the students purely from the game behavior.", "The rules of the game are as follows:- 2 of the 4 players in a group fix one of the 4 categories as a special category (\u201ctrump\u201d) without telling the other two.- The goal of the task is that the other two players find out which cards are of the \u201ctrump category\u201d by the further course of the game.- The 16 cards with the markers are played. The cards are divided into 4 players and each player receives 4 cards.- Each of the 4 players places one card on the table in one round. The player with the card with the highest number of vertical lines wins the round and receives all 4 cards. Except when one of the cards involved is from the \u201ctrump\u201d category, it wins. (This can be judged by 2 of the players.) - If there are more cards of the trump category in the round, the trump card with the most lines wins. - If several players with the same number of lines win, the cards are split.", "From the results of the rounds of the game, it must be tried to recognize the \u201ctrump\u201d attribute. The basic idea comes from the card game \u201cWatten\u201d (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watten_(card_game))", "The form of learning in which cards (objects) are trumps, practiced in this game, is a form of reinforcement learning. After each round, a theory of the players is given, which category is a trump by the round result or is discarded.", "With these 3 tasks, the different variants of machine learning can be shown with the help of the cards. Through the playful approach and the students\u2019 own experimentation, understanding is promoted and barriers are removed.", "Your home for data science.
