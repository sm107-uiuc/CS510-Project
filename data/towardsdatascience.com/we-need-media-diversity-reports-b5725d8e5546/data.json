For instance, the just-released diversity reports from Facebook and Google show that men outnumber women by about 2 to 1 at these companies. These statistics have inspired negative commentary in the Guardian, NBC, Vox, CNN, and many other news sites.", "It is easy to blame the tech titans, but I\u2019ve found that if media companies looked in the mirror, they would find that they have many of the same problems. Over the last 6 month, I\u2019ve collected tens of thousands of articles from the home pages of 15 different news organizations. By analyzing the authors of these articles, it became obvious that most news writers are male. It seems that just like the tech industry, news media is male-dominated and needs to change.", "For those interested, I want to quickly explain how this data was collected and how it was analyzed. In doing so, I hope to show that although there are places where errors might have crept in, they should be mostly uncorrelated with minimal bias. Also, all code and data associated with this project is on github here.", "News data was collected every day in 2019 from multiple news sites using the python NewsScraper Library. Using this tool, I saved front page stories from multiple sites into one big database. Although I can\u2019t guarantee that every story was saved, I did get a large sample that was selected mostly at random.", "Once stories were in a database, it was possible to examine the writers of news articles. Unfortunately writer data often contained descriptive words that needed to be removed (ie. \u2018Reporter for AP\u2019). I had to write scripts to filter writer names and to make sure I ended up with a list of real people. In addition, many stories had multiple authors, so I had to make sure that these were counted separately. The final result was a list of thousands of names that represented anyone who had been published on a major news site in 2019.", "Finally, with a list of known, good names, I created a new database that stored the names of writers, the number of stories they published, their organization, and finally, their gender. This last part is tricky. I used the python nltk corpus of male and female names and supplemented it with as many other name samples as I could find. If a writer\u2019s first name was in a list of \u2018male\u2019 names, I labelled them that way. If the first name was in a list of \u2018female\u2019 names, they were labeled female. Finally, some small percentage were marked as \u2018unknown\u2019. This is probably the greatest source of error, as some names like \u2018Sam\u2019 can apply to any gender. Still, I am confident that most errors were random and that the results obtained are valid.", "Not only are news writers more likely to be male, but male writers are more likely to get published.", "The simplest way to look at a breakdown of gender in the news industry is to the see what percentage of writers are men and what percentage are women. The results of this simple analysis are somewhat shocking.", "As with tech workers, the creators of news stories are about twice as likely to be male (removing unknown names, men are 63%, women are 37%).", "The situation is even worse if we count the number of news articles instead of the number of news writers. This suggests that not only are writers more likely to be male, but male writers are more likely to get published.", "Removing articles from authors of \u2018unknown\u2019 gender, I found that men are responsible for roughly 71% and women for only 29% of all stories.", "As we might expect, liberal news sources seem to have a better gender balance than conservative ones.", "The previous analysis included all news sources lumped together. These sites exist across the political spectrum, so we might expect their gender balance to differ. Below I plot the distribution of writers per media outlet. The bottom plot removes writers with names that could not easily be mapped to a gender (ie \u2018unknown\u2019 gender).", "As we might expect, liberal news sources seem to have a better gender balance than conservative ones. Sites like NPR and CNN are almost balanced with close to a 55\u201345 split of male and female writers. Old newspapers like the New York Times, Guardian, Boston Globe and LA Times are closer to a 65\u201335 split. At the right end of the political spectrum, sites like Fox News, the Daily Caller and Breitbart all have over 70% male authorship. This is pretty extreme, even considering that conservatives are more likely to be men.", "Gender balance among staff writers may be much better than it is among guest writers who rarely contribute articles.", "Looking at a gender breakdown of stories instead of writers, a similar pattern emerges.", "Interestingly, the situation improves for certain news organizations. I suspect that gender balance among staff writers may be much better than it is among guest writers who rarely contribute articles.", "With this new metric, the Washington Post is near 50\u201350 balance and the Wall St Journal is closer to 60\u201340 male-to-female. Still, the picture isn\u2019t great for gender equality overall. Moreover, if it\u2019s true that news outlets favor guest features by male writers, this is still something worth contemplating.", "Just as diversity in technology is essential to creating a more just society, so too is diversity in media. The tech giants have finally woken up to their social responsibility. For the past few years they have been transparent about the diversity of their staff and released annual reports showing their progress. Given that they wield enormous cultural and political influence, I think it\u2019s time that news organizations did the same thing.", "The data that I\u2019ve collected undoubtedly has flaws. Unfortunately without real diversity reports, it\u2019s the best that we can do right now. If these findings are accurate, then the news media has a way to go before it achieves the sort of equality that it so often preaches.", "Your home for data science.
