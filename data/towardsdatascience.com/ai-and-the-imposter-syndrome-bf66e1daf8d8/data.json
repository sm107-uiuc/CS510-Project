What do we want AI to become?", "When I helped set up a coworking space soon five years ago I came across a term in conversations with a programmer. I had been talking to the technical lead in a company, a person who many considers greatly skilled at programming, and he admitted he often felt like a fraud. Later talking to other developers I came to realise that this was somewhat a common occurrence amongst techies.", "Coworking: self-directed, collaborative, flexible and voluntary work style that is based on mutual trust and the sharing of common core values between its participants.", "Years down the line in programming modules and hanging around a few developers I still get the impression this is a persistent phenomenon. Either your code runs or it doesn\u2019t. When it runs there can be things that go wrong.", "There is oft times some bug/error to be fixed. Salaries in programming are higher, this may make for a higher living standard, yet perhaps we could ask whether it puts pressure on those who find themselves in this fortunate position. Maybe it was luck? Do I deserve this?", "Impostor syndrome (also known as impostor phenomenon, impostorism, fraud syndrome or the impostor experience) is a psychological pattern in which an individual doubts their accomplishments and has a persistent internalised fear of being exposed as a \"fraud\".", "Despite external evidence of their competence, those experiencing this phenomenon remain convinced that they are frauds, and do not deserve all they have achieved. Individuals with impostorism incorrectly attribute their success to luck, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent than they perceive themselves to be.", "So in a way it is the fear of \u2018being found out\u2019, because of the belief that you are less talented than what others perceive you to be.", "Have you ever felt out of your depth like a fraud and just kind of guessed slash bullshitted your way through the situation, petrified that at any time someone was going to call you on it. I can think of many examples where I felt like this [\u2026] so for me imposter syndrome is a feeling of being well well out of your depth yet already entrenched in the situation. Internally you know you\u2019re not skilled enough, qualified enough to justify being there yet you are there and you have to figure a way out, because you can\u2019t just get out. It\u2019s not a fear of failure and it\u2019s not a fear of being able to do it. It\u2019s more a sensation of getting away with something, a fear of being discovered, that at any time someone is going to figure this out.-Mike Cannon-Brookes co-founder of Atlassian speaking at TEDxSydney", "In one way it can perhaps be viewed as a way of perceiving your own knowledge. Believing that people will look through the knowledge you lack instead of seeing the connections to other fields of knowledge. One comment on Mike Cannon-Brookes TEDx talk struck me as particularly descriptive: \u201ccoding does this to me all the time.\u201d", "Imposter syndrome first came to be known as the \u201cimposter phenomenon.\u201d In the 1970s, psychologists Pauline Rose Clance and Suzanne Imes coined the term \u201cimposter phenomenon\u201d. Students Clance interacted with seemed to have an irrational worry of being found out as frauds, despite external evidence proving their competence. Clance wrote at the time, \u201cThese women do not experience an internal sense of success. They consider themselves to be \u2018imposters.\u2019\u201d", "Caryn Farvour (Humphreys) wrote an article on medium in the publication Code Like A Girl in 2017. There she wrote that the California Institute of Technology Counseling Center define Impostor Syndrome as:", "\u201cA collection of feelings of inadequacy that persist even in face of information that indicates that the opposite is true. It is experienced internally as chronic self-doubt, and feelings of intellectual fraudulence.\u201d", "Google has acknowledged the importance of recognising other people\u2019s competence and says: \u201cWe\u2019re all reluctant to engage in behaviors that could negatively influence how others perceive our competence, awareness, and positivity.\u201d Indeed we may come to realise that people will see through the knowledge we lack, and that there is a possibility to gain so much more when you respect that you do not know everything, and that you can be valuable or perhaps come to learn more if you come to accept this.", "After writing about artificial intelligence every day for 30 days in a row publishing one article each of those days I still feel like an imposter. Arguably some would argue doing one month is a lot, however my goal is writing an article every day for 500 days. Every time I talk to a professional within the industry or a researcher within the field I feel like they are going to blame me for not knowing or try to \u2018catch me out\u2019.", "There is a sense of nervousness. Perhaps particularly after a report was released by a venture firm \u2018revealing\u2019 that 40% of AI startups do not use artificial intelligence. An article written in The Verve even claims: \u201cMMC\u2019s report found that when companies do deploy artificial intelligence and machine learning, the use-cases are often quite banal.\u201d When there is such a lack of competence or experience in the field is this surprising?", "This culture of blame or what is AI or not AI is understandable \u2013 we are talking of investments of large sums of money. Yet it does begs the question of whether the basic algorithm that beginners are starting out with is \u2018real AI\u2019. In this manner it is daunting for perfectionists to take the next step forward. It would not be unfair to claim according to certain definitions that programmers are striving for perfectionism by design.", "Perfectionism, in psychology, is a personality trait characterised by a person\u2019s striving for flawlessness and setting high performance standards, accompanied by critical self-evaluations and concerns regarding others\u2019 evaluations.", "If you are in a group of developers someone has written a code that runs \u2014 it works, and your code may not. Even small errors in \u2018chunks\u2019 that are linked together can hinder your code from running. Self-critical appraisal or evaluations it therefore a constant in many programmers everyday life on the job. What did I do wrong? Why is my code not running? These are questions that at times can take minutes, hours, weeks or months to answer depending on the problem or challenge in question. Yet we are only human.", "People do see through the mask whether you want it or not.", "Another TED talk by Dr. Knatokie Ford caught my attention. Knatokie is a Senior Policy Advisor at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), Obama Administration, and oversees development of national initiatives to raise visibility and improve the image of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.", "In the context of talking about the imposter syndrome she additionally talks about stereotype threat: fear of conforming to stereotypes about one\u2019s social group. She was the only African American in her class and thought others thought she would be silly \u2014she says this combination catapulted here into depression. Ultimately she decided that she could not continue so she left Harvard after one semester. She has one quote in her presentation I would like to repost:", "\u201cComparison is the thief of joy.\u201d \u2014 Theodore Roosevelt", "Within every conversation that I have had with researchers and with most people within industry a series of typical topics comes up. Usually there is a mention of the comparison between human and machine. The definition of AI in itself lends itself to an anthropomorphic analogism; we compare ourselves to that which is developed. We take machine learning techniques and superimpose ourselves as the standard. I would strongly argue that this is unhealthy.", "It is also interesting to look at the numbers mentioned in the latest OECD report from December 2018 Private Equity Investment in Artificial Intelligence. In total, it is estimated that more than USD 50 billion was invested in AI start-ups during the period 2011 through to mid-2018. It may suffice to be said that with great investment comes great expectations of financial returns.", "If the goal of artificial intelligence rapidly becomes superintelligence we may be making a mistake, particularly because there is a general consensus between scientists that I have talked to that Artificial General Intelligence is way beyond these capacities (at least if we compare it directly with a human). I would additionally argue that it could be destructive pursuit considering the risk involved. Perhaps this is a future worry or concern, yet the current concern is the climate crisis; gross global inequality and the risk of war.", "On one hand I would argue not to turn all issues into simple oppositions, yet I may have done so by questioning the pursuit or goal researchers, industry and nations strive for. The picture in the minds of those I talk to is of Sophia, a piece of hardware and software that was granted citizenship in Saudia Arabia.", "We strive for ourselves, for the next human being \u2014 this I would argue can be a discussion point related to the Imposter Syndrome. What do we hope to achieve by comparing ourself to a technological application? Yes, we made progress through understanding neural networks, and this has led to great progress particularly in cognitive machine learning with deep neural networks (DNN) being recognised as a leap forward. Arguably this marked an increase in AI funding, development, deployment, and commercial use.", "However if we talk of AI as if we were talking of a person or a product \u2014 in an \u2018it\u2019 perspective. This seems commonplace, although I do not have an overview of what degree, yet it is interesting to read a recent article by the Forbes contributor group to AI & Big Data:", "Keep in mind that it is still early, and AI has a long way to go before it can reason, solve complex problems alone or learn enough to plan by itself.\u2013 So How Goes That AI Spring, Forbes 29th of April 2019", "Concerns are occasionally raised that a new AI winter could be triggered by any overly ambitious or unrealistic promise by prominent AI scientists or overpromising on the part of commercial vendors.", "Should we superimpose an image of ourselves as the perfect intelligence of a mathematical equation? Let us instead recognise the great progress that has been made so far and the wonderful steps forward the field of AI has achieved with machine learning techniques applied to find knowledge; cure diseases; monitor the climate; predict disasters; and so on.", "Let us not make AI into an imposter.", "Let us instead think of both the mental health and wellbeing of hardworking developers, researchers, business people and politicians.", "This is day 32 of #500daysofAI, follow me for daily updates on AI.", "I am challenging myself to write and think about the topic of artificial intelligence for the next 500 days with the #500daysofAI. This is a challenge I invented to keep thinking of this topic and share my words with you.", "Your home for data science.
