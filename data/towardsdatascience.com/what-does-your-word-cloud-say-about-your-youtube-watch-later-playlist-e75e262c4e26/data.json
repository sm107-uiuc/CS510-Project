Later in a moment of relaxation or pause, we realize the length of the list we have accumulated.", "We don\u2019t bother checking it when is this long and if we check it we scroll a few times and then leave it and so on\u2026", "Today in this post, we are gonna go through a way where we are gonna create a word-cloud, which it will go through all the videos titles of this \u201cWATCH-LATER PLAYLIST\u201d and generate a word cloud out of this playlist which will produce a summary of the content of your playlist. We will see what does it say about you?", "Moreover, we will apply some dimensionality reduction and visualize them in 2d space to better analyse our choices.", "Well, Google has a cool feature for all the accounts, which let you download all your data related to your account: Google Takeouts", "Once you are in the homepage, let\u2019s deselect all and only select the Youtube playlist, this can be done by clicking Deselect all and then scrolling down, once done that click next step it will ask you what you want to download, tick playlist and then click Next step, after going through some authentication check you will be fine to go.", "Once you have downloaded the file, you will be having a folder with multiple files, the one we are interested in is the \u201cwatch-later.json\u201d. It will be a JSON containing all the collections of videos and their descriptions and so on like the picture below.", "What we have here is a sum of all the titles which haven\u2019t been preprocessed, I haven\u2019t done any pre-processing such as Stemming or lemmatization since I am interested in the actual context and titles names, so I left it unchanged.", "Certainly, We don\u2019t want to have the most-common internet/youtube used terms to pop-up in our word cloud so let\u2019s add them to the original stopwords list, so they can be filtered out.", "Now, why do we have to create a simple word-cloud? when we can create a cool one with two lines of code. All we need to do is download a picture you like and apply this mask to the word cloud. I chose this picture below for my word_cloud: you can try with any picture you like, I personally used the Youtube logo. Inspired from: this:https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/wordcloud-python", "It is pretty interesting to see that there are words with bigger and smaller sizes and not a single word has been repeated, the size of each word indicates its frequency or importance.", "First of all, we need to convert the collection into a matrix of TF-IDF features.", "it is a matrix that contains very few non-zero elements. When a sparse matrix is represented with a 2-dimensional array, we could waste a lot of space in memory to represent it.[1]", "This performs linear dimensionality reduction by means of truncated singular value decomposition (SVD). Contrary to PCA, this estimator does not centre the data before computing the singular value decomposition. This means it can work with sparse matrices efficiently.[3]", "Now that we have reduced the dimensionality, we can clearly see them well that there are two/three clusters, one cluster having the most number of videos while the second one well far ahead on the top with only four videos.", "In order to be more accurate let\u2019s use the Elbow method: in cluster analysis, this is a heuristic used in determining the number of clusters in a data set. The method consists of plotting the explained variation as a function of the number of clusters and picking the elbow of the curve as the number of clusters to use to.[2]", "The optimal number of clusters is 3.", "By looking at the two clusters, we can see how Cluster 1 contains podcasts, while Cluster_3 contains a mix of Food type videos and F1. these two are kind of well-distributed, with the remaining Videos are in Cluster_2(blue_points) here I think this could be two clusters itself.", "The Combination of TF-IDF, K-means, and Truncated SVD did a pretty good job in coming up with this 2D distribution and further choosing these clusters and the dimensionality reduction technique worked quite well without much loss of information.", "The Word cloud and the 2D space distribution I have obtained above are biased to my playlist (my one was relatively small with only 80 videos) it managed to use three clusters to separate the videos even though it could have been a bit more precise, it would have been more interesting to analyse a bigger playlist with more data points.", "The very interesting thing is that everyone else will have their own distribution so the clusters will be organized differently as well as the word cloud, so I highly recommend you to give it a go, it was a lot of fun personally to do this and see my results. A few more things could be further applied to better evaluate this analysis and get better insights, for example instead of applying K-means you could try with GMM(Gaussian Mixture Models), trying to implement some Topic modelling and so on.", "Your home for data science.
