From rule based systems to machine learning models \u2014 each method tends to work best under certain conditions. Successful anti-fraud systems should reap the benefits of all the approaches and utilize them where they fit the problem best.", "The notion of networks and connection analysis in the world of anti-fraud systems is paramount since it helps uncover hidden characteristics of transactions that are not retrievable any other way. In this blog post we will try to shed some light on the way networks are created and then used to detect fraudulent transactions.", "Let\u2019s consider a transaction \u2014 one of the basic entities in the world of online payments. Each transaction can be described by a set of attributes. In Nethone, we gather over 5k data points per transaction but for the sake of simplicity let\u2019s focus on a few common ones like:", "Having those exemplary transaction attributes in mind we can now pass on to the stage of network building. The network (or graph) is a set of nodes (\u201cdots\u201d) connected by edges (\u201clines\u201d). In the world of online payments the nodes can be either transactions or specific values of transactions\u2019 attributes. The edges can represent various relations but in this case let\u2019s focus on the most common one: sharing the attribute value. Let\u2019s use this simple network as an example:", "We can see that the processed transaction (\u201cdot with halo\u201d) shares an IP address (green node), email address (purple node) and cookie (orange node) value with several other transactions (black nodes). The procedure for creating such a network is pretty simple:", "In short, it\u2019s all about connecting transactions using some attribute as a matching key. This approach, although simple in principle, provides valuable context.", "Once the graph is created we can query it for various properties. We can check what is the longest path or how many nodes connect to a particular node representing, for example, IP address. After extracting the network\u2019s features, we can then feed them to rule based systems or ML models \u2014 as mentioned in the beginning hybrid approach works best.", "This gist showcases how we can perform the aforementioned attribute matching in Python\u2019s library Networkx. The data was created using https://www.mockaroo.com/.", "This network was constructed using a different seed transaction and expanded with increased depth parameter. It means that we can now not only connect transactions related to the processed one \u2014 taking an analogy from the world of social interactions, we can analyze \u201cfriends of friends of friends \u2026 etc.\u201d so transactions related to different related transactions. This way we can broaden out scope and gather more insight. Let\u2019s zoom in and look into some of the clusters", "At first glance we can see that one email and IP address (red and green nodes) are connected to many different credit card tokens (blue nodes). Since it\u2019s quite rare for people to possess a great number of credit cards, this type of network might be an example of carding fraud. In such attacks, fraudsters use stolen credit card credentials to perform numerous transactions. We can distinguish between normal traffic and carding patterns (few people, numerous cards and transactions) easily when having data structured as a network. After querying our graph and encountering a risky pattern, we can add suspicious attribute values to blacklists. This way, if they are ever encountered by our system, transactions will be automatically flagged as risky.", "We can extract a lot of insight from connection analysis but they don\u2019t come for free \u2014 there are additional challenges as well. On the one hand, studying connections in networks built from transactional, tabular data might help us uncover relationships that are hard to extract when keeping the data flat. Structure of a network and how it changes in time can be a very rich source of information, as well as a human-friendly interface to our data.", "On the other hand, there are no hard rules about what is and what is not fraudulent behavior. If we can see multiple transactions coming out of a common IP address it can mean a fraud attack, but it can also mean employees using their corporate, proxied network to make purchases. It\u2019s important to take as many factors in as possible \u2014 missing out on some may cause serious distortions in the way we perceive the data through our networks. A good example of a crucial factor is time \u2014 someone making a 10th transaction on the same day and cleaning browser cookies after each one will look exactly the same as a legitimate user making a 10th purchase in the same year, whose cookies naturally expire between consequent transactions. Context is everything.", "In this article we went through:", "Your home for data science.
