Poverty has significantly reduced over the last few decades, but there is still a long way to go. So, how can we expedite this process?", "There is a lot being done by multilateral organizations (UN, World Bank, IMF), governments and through the contentious way of CSR (still counts though).", "There is also a lot of data being collected by these players \u2014 it isn\u2019t necessarily clean or easy to collect, but there is data out there.", "My hypothesis though is that there isn\u2019t enough synthesis of this high-level global data.

It was multidimensional in that it considered education, healthcare and income (close enough to MPI), there were many data points associated with it across many years and countries and it was fairly easy to calculate. Yes, it did not measure poverty specifically, but it did measure well-being, and yes it isn\u2019t a perfect metric, but let perfect not be the enemy of good.", "Ta dah! Sometimes all you need is a little rationalization.", "Next, I had to source the data from all over the world wide web. And source it I did. I had to actually stop myself at some point because this process of data gathering can be endless.

You either drop the null values (and hope that there is enough data left behind) or you try and populate it intelligently.", "I had so many null values in my data set that if I dropped all null values, I would lose all my rows and columns, i.e. all my data. That\u2019s no good.", "So in order to give my project hope, I had to impute values with some logic. Thank god for Machine Learning. I used the power of machines to generate approximate values for those damn null values based on other information that was available for each country.

The above file also has all the functions associated with that process.", "After cleaning, merging, imputing and dropping nulls (that were not even imputable), my final dataset was a tidy 1,353 rows x 513 columns that spanned 28 years across 46 countries and had over 500 factors / features.", "Now that we had the data, it was time to get into the heart of data science. The first part of the process was to isolate the top 10\u201315 factors. Why? Because if I was going to build a dashboard for a non-coding user to use, it could not have 500 factors to toggle. That would drive the user clinically insane, but more importantly, away from my dashboard. So I had to dwindle the factors down. How?", "The criteria I used to filter down these factors were threefold:", "For Python Coders: To distill the impactfulness of the factors, I was restricted to using those ML algorithms that were inferential, i.e. those that either gave me coefficients or feature importance. So I couldn\u2019t use neural nets or KNN, but I ran a whole slew of regressors that were inferential\u2014 Lasso, Ridge, Elastic Net, Decision Trees (piled on with AdaBoost) and Support Vector Machines.", "My target variable was HDI and my X (predictor matrix) comprised all the 511 factors that we had in the dataset. My test set consisted mainly of true (non-imputed) values which mitigated the risk of the imputed data contaminating the model.", "After running all the models, the best one happened to be LassoCV (which happens to be the case more often than not) which gave me a R2 score 0.94 on the test set and a score of 0.98.

So, all in all, the model was looking good.", "You can find this on my Github project page here (it\u2019s in the Jupyter Notebook \u201cC \u2014 Picking Predictors & Final Models\u201d).", "This was an super iterative process. I ran many machine learning models and each time, they surfaced a new factor or two that was either highly correlated to the components of HDI (eg. GDP is highly correlated to Gross National Income Per Capital which is used for calculating HDI) or something that was not necessarily controllable (not sure how an entrepreneur can change Land Mass unless you\u2019re Dubai and can build islands). So, I had to drop those factors and run the models again. And again. And again.", "The other issue was that 10\u201315 factors were too little, so in the end, after a massive Mulan-esque struggle in which I went down a black hole for a quite a while, I narrowed down the 511 factors to the following 19 factors that somewhat met the criteria I had highlighted earlier:", "These factors / predictors are by no means perfect, and you can plug and play other factors as per your fancy, but for this exercise, these seemed workable.", "Okay now on to part 2 of this step\u2014 building the final models using these 19 isolated factors.", "As you are very aware by now, we are trying to predict well-being using Human Development Index (HDI) as our target variable. It\u2019s important to understand how HDI is calculated.", "HDI is made up of four component metrics \u2014 Life Expectancy at Birth, Mean Years of Schooling, Expected Years of Schooling and Gross National Income Per Capita. There are some mildly complex formulas that are used to take these component metrics and calculate HDI, and you are more than welcome to explore that by going here.", "The goal was to predict each of these component metrics and then use those predictions to calculate HDI. This would be the basis of building the final model with the isolated (\u201ctop\u201d) factors. It would incorporate 4 mini-models for each of the component metrics that would then link to HDI. Something like this:", "For Python Coders: A guardrail here was that I could only use one type of machine learning algorithm. This is because whatever output I got, I had to be able to export it into Tableau to be able to create an interactive dashboard. Since I didn\u2019t have Tableau Server and was using Tableau Public (FREE!!) to build the dash, I couldn\u2019t use TabPy (a library / tool that allows you to run Python code on the fly and display visualizations in Tableau). TabPy (as of the writing of this post) only works with Tableau Server which costs $$$. Which basically meant that I could only use only linear regression models, because linear regression gives me an equation. Once I had the coefficients and intercept of this equation, I could export them into a CSV and use that to build the same linear regression equation in Tableau. Yes, this was complicated and yes, I wish TabPy worked with Tableau Public.", "But you don\u2019t give up, you adapt.", "For those who are not familiar with machine learning, a common metric used to evaluate a machine learning model / algorithm is called R-squared (R2). Feel free to read more about it, but what you need to know for this post is that a R2 score of 1 means that the model is perfect and 0 means that it sucks. So we want a R2 score of something close to 1.", "After building, tweaking and optimizing the machine learning models, these are what the final scores of my model looked like:", "If you\u2019re wondering why the component models have lower scores than the final score for HDI, it\u2019s because those components are used to calculate other indices which are then weighted to calculate the HDI, and in that entire process, our models fare fairly well after abstraction.", "For Python Coders: The above scores in green represent scores on the test set that comprises true values only (non-imputed values). This is done to mitigate the risk of using imputed values in my training data.", "I used LassoCV again for each of the four component models (Life Expectancy, Mean Years of Schooling, Expected Years of Schooling and Gross National Income Per Capita). I further optimized these models using GridSearch. I had to reduce the skewness of some of the factors / features and did so by essentially logging the highly-skewed factors. Factors were \u201chighly-skewed\u201d if their skew was greater than 1.", "Once the four models were tuned, I used their predictions to calculate HDI as per the UNDP formula. I then ran the calculated HDI numbers against the actual HDI numbers and it gave me an R2 score of 0.97. And all in all, the score was pretty dandy.", "You can find all this in more detail on my GitHub project page here (its in the Jupyter Notebook \u201cC \u2014 Picking Predictors & Final Models\u201d)", "The model was built. The score was good. It was now time to export this model into a fancy Tableau dash.", "The goal of this dashboard is to put the power of machine learning into the hands of a user who doesn\u2019t really know how to code.

Social entrepreneurs, primarily, and other folk that work in the impact space would be secondary.", "How would this be useful to them? Maybe this would give my target audience a tool they can use to see how different controllable factors impact well-being. For instance, if they reduced corruption by 5%, what could the approximate impact on well-being be? Or if they increased rural electrification to 100%, how would their chosen country\u2019s well-being change? All this would be based on data that spanned over 28 years across 122 countries* of all type, and it would be driven by a relationship that was calculated using machine learning that humans wouldn\u2019t be able to do in their head (or by hand, or easily in Excel).", "Obviously, this isn\u2019t a perfect relationship. But as I mentioned earlier, it is something that they can use as a starting point for their local grassroots research. That\u2019s how I am going to use it.", "It is relatively easy to make sexy dashboards in Tableau because well, it\u2019s a point-and-click software. But, because of that, it\u2019s also pretty rigid. And because I used the free, public version of the software, there were some limitations on how much funky stuff I could do.", "Essentially, I had to export the machine learning model from Python into a format that was digestible in Tableau. I also had to build the dashboard in such a way that I could take in information (or inputs) from the user. I wanted to give the user toggles they could toggle and see instantly how changing a factor would impact well-being.", "After a lot of toil, this was the final output (that you might or might not have clicked on in the beginning, definitely not if you\u2019re on your phone because it only really works on a desktop). If you\u2019ve made it all way till here in this post, I hope you do have a gander, and if you have any thoughts, don\u2019t hesitate to share them.

You can find the working Tableau dashboard file I used on the GitHub project page.", "For Python Coders / Tableau Experts: As I said earlier, I was limited by Tableau Public. If I had Tableau Server, I could have used TabPy and leveraged more complicated models. In the end though, my scores were pretty decent so I\u2019m not fussed. The .twbx file for the dash is on the GitHub page for this project. Enjoy!", "I am about to become a social entrepreneur. So I was pretty much the target audience for this dashboard. I learnt a ton. It might seem a little controversial up front, but you\u2019ve got to realize that this is not perfect; it should merely serve to narrow the starting point for further local, grassroots research.", "As I have mentioned over and over again in this post, this is not a perfect model by any means, and it should serve, if anything as a starting point.

This local approach is arguably the most useful and impactful, especially when it comes to deep, long-lasting change. The likes of J-PAL, IPA and Evidence Action are conducting some incredible randomized control trials that are changing the way we approach positive change-making at a local level. Many grassroots non-profits (Barefoot College, GiveDirectly) are also improving local livelihoods directly.

Not going to lie, I am little overwhelmed by all the information and the experiences and the books that I have consumed over the last two years. The most crippling part of this is the dangerous (but important) desire to get this as right as possible, without overthinking myself to death.", "I need to see if rural electrification is as impactful as the model claims it to be. I need to reevaluate the importance of job creation and labour force improvement. What about turning waste around?
