At various points in time, I built Python versions from source myself or used the prebuilt Framework installers on OSX, all while managing the links in /usr/local/bin by hand. With either of those methods, I had no problem spinning virtual environments from any of the installed versions, but most recently my PATH and me got mixed up on whether we were using Homebrew's python@3.8 or the Framework version I had installed. Enter pyenv. If you're looking for how to set up pyenv, there are no shortage of articles or blog posts on how to install it, however, I'd recommend sticking to the official documentation. As some of these articles mention, there are many ways to get Python on your OSX systems:", "Your system needs the built-in, and Homebrew is really only going to keep a single version of Python 3 for you, so you need to pick between the last three if you want to manage specific versions of Python 2 or 3. I omitted Anaconda since I haven\u2019t needed it or taken the time to really understand how it works, but I have heard success stories for Windows users. Here, we\u2019ll choose pyenv to manage python versions, but in doing so, we\u2019ll initially have multiple versions of both Python 2 and Python 3 on our system (those from pyenv in addition to the builtin version 2 and homebrew version 3). Again, there\u2019s nothing we can do with the Python 2 builtin, OSX needs it. For Python 3, we can have Homebrew use one of pyenv\u2019s Python versions to eliminate that source of redundancy. Before we get started, it\u2019s worth noting that you\u2019re unlikely to experience conflicts between pyenv and homebrew if you use your PATH like pyenv recommends, and Homebrew warns against it; you're wading into the territory of relying on your own understanding to support this use case (as Homebrew states in their post).", "These Stack Overflow answers have the right idea of using symbolic links (symlinks), but from what I can tell they don\u2019t get the links quite right. Let\u2019s get them right!", "If you already have any traces of Homebrew\u2019s python3, first get rid of them (brew unlink python3 and brew uninstall python3). If you already had python@3.8 from Homebrew, when uninstalling it, note the packages that depended on it (for example, ffmpeg), and reinstall them after.", "As of this post, Homebrew is expected Python 3.8.6 for it\u2019s python@3.8, so first install that version with pyenv following their documentation:", "That will put (by default) the actual Python install in", "Now we just need to add one link, and then let brew do the rest. I\u2019ll use full paths here, so you can run this from anywhere (and remember to read ln -s ... ... in your head as \"link -symbolic [target] [linkname]\"):", "With the -f flag, you could have omitted the trailing /3.8.6, as ln will use the name of the target. To be as explicit as possible on the link, you should have", "Here\u2019s what the result should look like:", "Finally, let Homebrew manage the rest of necessary linking:", "This article was inspired by my own exploration of how to make it work and that the answer to this question on Stack Overflow went unanswered (I answered it, I think!).", "Your home for data science.
