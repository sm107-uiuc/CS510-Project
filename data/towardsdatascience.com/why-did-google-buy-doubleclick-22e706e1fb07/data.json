I\u2019ve always been interested in exploring this. In this series of blog posts, I hope to analyze and dissect interesting tech topics from a strategic angle. And hopefully in the process we all can learn a thing or 2 about what it takes to be a great business.", "Google announced that it had agreed to acquire a company called DoubleClick for $3.1 billion in 2007. The agreed upon purchase price was almost twice as high as what it had paid for YouTube just a year earlier? What? YouTube is an iconic pillar of the current digital landscape, one of the most visited sites in the world, and a massive revenue generator for its parent company, Google. Even back then, it was clear that YouTube had massive potential \u2014 so why was Google willing to pay so much more for a company that at least I had never heard of before?", "To understand why this acquisition was such a big deal, we need to first step back and understand the digital advertising landscape. Advertising is a huge industry. In 2019, total ad spend in just the U.S. across all channels (digital, TV, print, etc.) was estimated to be $240 billion. Of that, more than half ($130 billion) was digital \u2014 digital ads are ads served via the internet to people searching on Google, watching YouTube, browsing Facebook or Instagram, etc. and includes both mobile and desktop. Digital (especially the mobile portion of it) is also by far the fastest growing component of the advertising market, having relegated TV to second place a few years ago and it\u2019s never looked back since.", "But back in 2007, when Google acquired DoubleClick, digital ad spending was still in its relative infancy \u2014 digital made up just 12% of total ad spend compared to TV\u2019s 39% (though digital was growing many times faster than all the other types of ad spending).", "The makeup of digital ad spend was very different back in 2007 too \u2014 40% of it was paid search. Paid search is when companies bid for the right to show their ads on a search engine\u2019s search results page (by picking keywords of interest and an associated bid amount for each of those words). And Google, the number 1 search engine then just like now, dominated paid search with a 75% share of the market. Why did paid search have such a huge share back then?", "The reason for paid search\u2019s early success and prevalence is that it\u2019s easy to use and measure. A little bit of background will help drive home this point.", "Traditional ads are characterized by limited inventory \u2014 there are only so many billboards by the highway or so many time slots for commercials during that basketball game. And advertisers must show the same ad to the entire audience (everyone watching the Super Bowl sees the same ads) with some exceptions (the local programming portion of a national TV/radio network allows them to bombard us with local ads; but even then the entire local audience sees the same ad). This means that in order to get the best ROI, the ad and its product must appeal to the average audience member. In its nascent stages, digital advertising had the opposite problem. With internet ads, there\u2019s a virtually unlimited supply of individualized ad slots. Every second that someone spends on the internet browsing websites or playing games is an opportunity to serve him or her an ad of a product that is uniquely relevant to that person\u2019s specific interests \u2014 all of a sudden advertisers had more potential ad slots than they knew what to do with. The problem was targeting. Without knowing enough about a user, they had trouble identifying those interests and serving up relevant ads, which meant that digital ad campaigns often experienced lower than expected ROIs.", "Paid search though was an exception. It\u2019s much easier to target paid search ads because the user clearly states his subject of interest or intent with each search. When someone searches \u201cbest place to buy a used car\u201d, that person\u2019s intent becomes very clear (even with little or no prior data about this user). Ads for used cars placed in this person\u2019s search results will have a very high likelihood of clickthrough (clickthrough is when a user clicks on an ad), allowing Google and its search engine competitors to charge a high price, a.k.a. cost per click, for each of these ads.", "But paid search doesn\u2019t work for all types of ads. At a high level, advertising (and marketing in general) tries to do one of two things \u2014 get people to perform a specific action (such as purchase product A) or build brand awareness. Paid search ads work really well with the former (because even though it\u2019s an ad, it\u2019s also related and relevant information) but not so much with the latter. If I have a reasonably clear idea of what I\u2019m looking for when I perform a Google search, then I probably won\u2019t spare the time to watch a touchy feely video designed to reinforce an existing brand or introduce me to a new one. Rather, I am likely to see these attempts as distracting and annoying. Most people don\u2019t go to Google\u2019s website to browse; rather, it\u2019s the quick first step in their information finding journey.", "That\u2019s where display and video ads come in (when I say display going forward, I mean video as well). Display ads are interactive images or videos that appear when we visit and browse websites (they could appear as a banner, or hover to the side, or even momentarily take over our entire screen). Display ads are the closest thing on the digital side to a traditional T.V. commercial. And today, many of the same companies that spend millions of dollars on television ads also spend just as much or even more on display ad campaigns (delivered via Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, or popular websites like IMDb). It\u2019s the growth in video ads (and to a lesser extent other display ad formats) that\u2019s allowed digital to take so much advertising market share from television during the past decade.", "Today, Google is a major player in serving users display and video ads. Odds are that when you visit a random website on the internet (that seems to have nothing to do with Google) and see an ad, it was brought to you indirectly by Google-owned technology. But back in 2007, things were very different.", "In 2007, while Google was a paid search behemoth, it had a relatively insignificant presence in display ads. In fact, Google likely viewed its weakness in display ads as an existential threat. Sure, there were some on AdSense, the ad network that matched advertisers to ad slots available on the Google Network (a collection of websites that agreed to let Google figure out what ads to display for them). But the Google Network consisted primarily of smaller websites like personal blogs \u2014 and the ads on these sites were much more likely to be banners than videos.", "So Google needed to solve a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem. Without huge third party websites (content publishers) in the Google Network, it had trouble wooing big brand advertisers like Nike or Chanel. And without the super-premium advertisers that were willing to pay top dollar for video ad impressions (and clickthroughs), Google had a hard time attracting the best and biggest websites to join the Google Network. In the advertising world\u2019s lingo, Google lacked the inventory (ad slots on attractive websites) necessary to attract demand (advertisers looking to launch a major digital ad campaign).", "It sounds odd today that Google would have trouble breaking into any ad-related market, but back then there were several reasons for this:", "At the same time, Google owned some unique and massive advantages:", "In other words, Google had a treasure trove of data that would be invaluable in helping websites, even very large ones that already owned substantial proprietary data, maximize the value of their display ad space. It also had peerless data about its users\u2019 interests and backgrounds that advertisers could use to significantly increase the focus and return on their display and video ad campaigns. It just needed to solve its \u201cchicken and egg\u201d problem.", "From the San Jose Mercury News as news of the acquisition broke:", "\u201cIn a conference call with analysts and reporters, Eric Schmidt said Google decided to make a bid for DoubleClick after a strategic review revealed that the opportunity to sell display advertising was larger than Google\u2019s executives previously had imagined, and that DoubleClick had done an exceptional job at entering the market.\u201d", "The DoubleClick acquisition was a massive coup for Google. In 2007, DoubleClick was a company with expertise in serving display ads and that owned tons of relationships to both key websites and advertisers (who were all users of its software). And perhaps even more attractive to Google, they were right about to establish the DoubleClick Ad Exchange, a marketplace where advertisers could bid for ad inventory (spots on websites where an ad could be displayed) in realtime.", "Google went overnight from being a trailer to a leader in display advertising (while preventing key search competitor Microsoft from doing the same). Moreover, Google now had a clear avenue for monetizing its unique and invaluable knowledge of both websites and users. And it could do so as a platform \u2014 typically the most profitable seat in the entire value chain.", "Prior to DoubleClick, I imagine the conversation between Google and key advertisers went like this:", "Post DoubleClick, it was no longer necessary to ring up major advertisers. They were probably already on the roster of clients, as well as all the major websites of note. Instead, Google could just sit in the middle brokering transactions, collecting a small toll (and data) from every ad it placed (this position of power was not instantaneous; but rather still took them a few years to fully establish post-acquisition).", "This power broker position was also massively synergistic with its existing businesses. One obvious beneficiary was AdSense (and other Google owned ad serving business units) \u2014 Google now had much more pull with both sides of the ad market and could take advantage of DoubleClick\u2019s relationships to significantly scale ad inventory and its own knowhow to increase the average ROI of each ad. This created a virtuous feedback loop for Google where the superior performance of its ads attracted more advertisers (demand), which in turn attracted more websites (supply), and so forth, expanding its reach and market power exponentially. At the same time, it could use its entire suite or products like Search, Maps, Chrome, and eventually Android to constantly refine its ad targeting algorithms.", "There were also two more areas where the acquisition was a huge win for Google (and a loss for user privacy and market competition):", "Of note is that in 2014, Google launched a private (invite only) ad exchange where premium content publishers (the best websites) and premium advertisers could do deals. This gives big brands on both sides of the transaction more control over the content of the ad and where it appears. In a few short years, Google had gone from the outside looking in to being the one brokering the most prestigious digital advertising transactions\u2026 all powered by technology it acquired when it bought DoubleClick.", "Data scientist.
