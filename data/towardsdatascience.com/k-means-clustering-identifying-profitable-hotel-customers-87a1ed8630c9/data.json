For instance, here is a snippet of some of the market segment entries in the dataset:", "Upon applying cat.codes, here are the corresponding categories.", "The market segment labels are as follows:", "The lead time and ADR features are scaled using sklearn:", "Here is a sample of X:", "When it comes to choosing the number of clusters, one possible solution is to use what is called the elbow method. Here is an example of an elbow curve:", "This is a technique whereby the in-cluster variance for each cluster is calculated \u2014 the lower the variance, the tighter the cluster.", "In this regard, as the score starts to flatten out, this means that the reduction in variance becomes less and less as we increase the number of clusters, which allows us to determine the ideal value for k.", "However, this technique is not necessarily suitable for smaller clusters. Moreover, we already know the number of clusters (k=5) that we wish to define, as we already know the number of market segments that we wish to analyse.", "Additionally, while k-means clustering methods may also use PCA (or Principal Dimensionality Reduction) to reduce the number of features, this is not appropriate in this case as the only two features being used (apart from market segment) are ADR and lead time.", "Accordingly, the k-means algorithm is defined as follows:", "The color themes are defined for each of the market segment labels:", "Here is a plot of the actual labels:", "Here is a plot of the generated clusters by the k-means algorithm:", "As mentioned, customers with the lowest lead time and the highest ADR are deemed to be the most profitable.", "However, there seems to be a problem! Many of the market segment categories have been mislabelled.", "This is a common problem when working with k-means clustering, and does not necessarily indicate that the model should be thrown out! Instead, it merely suggests that we need to think about our data in a different way.", "For instance, we already know which customers belong to which market segment. In this regard, generating a k-means clustering algorithm to predict this once again does not serve much use. Rather, the point of running this algorithm is to get a quick visual of what types of customers are most profitable.", "Furthermore, we have only considered lead time and ADR as the two features. There may be other features that we have not considered which would better indicate what market segment a customer might belong to, and there is no visual evidence from what we have seen so far that certain market segments are more profitable than others.", "In this regard, let\u2019s simplify the analysis a little bit. What if we use three clusters instead?", "We see that the blue category has the highest ADR and lowest lead time (most profitable), while the green category shows the lowest ADR and highest lead time (least profitable).", "From this standpoint, the k-means clustering algorithm is offering an efficient way at quickly categorising the hotel\u2019s most profitable customers and further analysis can be conducted to analyse certain attributes that are common to the customers in each group.", "When it comes to unsupervised learning \u2014 it is important to remember that this is largely an exploratory method of analysis \u2014 the goal is not necessarily prediction but rather to reveal insights about the data that may not have been considered previously. For instance, why do certain customers have a lower lead time than others? Are customers from certain countries more likely to fit this profile? What about different customer types?", "These are all questions that the k-means clustering algorithm may not directly answer for us \u2014 but reducing data into separate clusters provides a strong baseline for being able to pose questions such as these.", "In this example, we have seen:", "Many thanks for your time, and the associated GitHub repository for this example can be found here.", "Disclaimer: This article is written on an \u201cas is\u201d basis and without warranty.
