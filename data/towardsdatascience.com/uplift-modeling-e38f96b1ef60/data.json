It will be a combination of programming, data analysis, and machine learning.", "I will cover all the topics in the following nine articles:", "9- A/B Testing Design and Execution", "Articles will have their own code snippets to make you easily apply them. If you are super new to programming, you can have a good introduction for Python and Pandas (a famous library that we will use on everything) here. But still without a coding introduction, you can learn the concepts, how to use your data and start generating value out of it:", "Sometimes you gotta run before you can walk \u2014 Tony Stark", "As a pre-requisite, be sure Jupyter Notebook and Python are installed on your computer. The code snippets will run on Jupyter Notebook only.", "One of the most critical jobs of Growth Hacker is to be efficient by all means as much as possible. First of all, you need to be time-efficient. That means you have to quickly ideate, experiment, learn and re-iterate. Second, you need to be cost-efficient. It means bringing the maximum return for a given budget/time/effort.", "Segmentation helps Growth Hackers to increase conversion and hence be cost-efficient. But imagine a case that you are about to launch a promotional campaign and you know which segment you want to target. Do you need to send the offer to everyone?", "The answer is no. In your current target group, there will be customers who are going to purchase anyways. You will cannibalize yourself by giving the promotion. We can summarize the segments based on this approach like below:", "The picture is very obvious. You need to target Treatment Responders (TR) and Control Non-Responders (CN). Since they won\u2019t purchase unless you give an offer, these groups are boosting your uplift in promotional campaigns. On the other hand, you need to avoid targeting Treatment Non-Responders (TN) and Control Responders (CR). You will not benefit from targeting TN and, CN will make you cannibalize.", "There is one last simple thing to do. We need to identify which customers fall into which buckets. The answer is Uplift Modeling. It has two simple steps:", "1- Predict the probabilities of being in each group for all customers: we are going to build a multi-classification model for that.", "2- We will calculate the uplift score. Uplift score formula is:", "We will sum up the probability of being TR and CN and subtract the probability of falling into other buckets. The higher score means higher uplift.", "Alright, let\u2019s see how we can implement this with an example. We will be using the same dataset in the previous article that you can find here.", "We start with importing the libraries and functions we need:", "Then we will import our data:", "As you can recall from the previous article, we have the data of customers who received Discount and Buy One Get One offers and how they reacted. We also have a control group that didn\u2019t receive anything.", "Before building the model, let\u2019s apply our calc_uplift function to see the current uplift of this campaign as a benchmark:", "Next, we will start building our model.", "Currently, our label is if a customer converted or not (1 or 0). We need to create four classes for TR, TN, CR, and CN. We know that the customers who received discount and bogo offers are Treatment and the rest is control. Let\u2019s create a campaign_group column make this info visible:", "Perfect, now we need to create our new labels:", "In this example, the mapping of the classes are below:", "There is one small feature engineering step before training our model. We will create clusters from history column and apply get_dummies for converting categorical columns into numerical:", "Let\u2019s fit our model and get the probabilities for each class:", "Variable class_probs possesses the probabilities for each customer. Let\u2019s check out an example:", "For this specific customer, we can map the probabilities as below:", "So the uplift score for this customer is:", "Let\u2019s apply this to all users and calculate the uplift score:", "By running the code above, we added a uplift_score column in our main dataframe and it looks like below:", "It is time to check the most critical part of having this model. Is the model really working? It is a bit hard to evaluate the true performance of uplift modeling. We will check how the uplift is changing across uplift score quantiles to see if we can use the model in real life.", "To evaluate our model, we will create two different groups and compare them with our benchmark. Groups are:", "1- High Uplift Score: Customers have uplift score > 3rd quantile", "2- Low Uplift Score: Customers have uplift score < 2nd quantile", "Here is our benchmark for the discount campaign.", "Let\u2019s create the first group and see the numbers:", "The results are great. Revenue uplift per target customer is 57% better and we can easily see that 25% of the target group is contributing to 40% of the revenue uplift.", "We will check the same numbers for the group with the lower uplift score:", "As expected, revenue uplift per targeted customer decreased to $1.4. Moreover, the group is 50% of the targeted customers contributed to 37% of the revenue uplift.", "By using this model, we can easily make our campaign more efficient by:", "In the next article, I\u2019ll be explaining one of the core elements of Growth Hacking: A/B Testing.
