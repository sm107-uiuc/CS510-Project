Here are seven reasons why:", "Right now there are hundreds of organizations mostly created within the last 5 years claiming to do machine learning or AI for healthcare organizations. Despite that, having worked with some of the biggest healthcare organizations in the U.S., it is very clear that the recipe for success has not been fully determined yet. As compared to various other industries like entertainment, finance, technology, media, etc., healthcare is still in its early stages of trying to figure this out. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there are a lot of great products built or being built with astounding early results, however, there aren\u2019t many established machine learning or AI based products being used at scale. This means to build a successful AI or machine learning based product, you have to innovate the first of its kind which comes with its unique challenges and struggles.", "If you have worked in health tech you know that care providers are extremely critical of technology products. It is important to understand why: These users have spent years building the expertise that allows them to take on the big responsibility of taking care of other human beings. Every decision they make has consequences on patients and their families. The same individuals although make decisions based on machine learning products in their everyday life, at work they need to think twice because their decisions have a higher impact. This magnitude of impact makes these users specifically suspicious and critical of any new technology claiming to solve their problems. This suspicion was further increased after the first few products in this space completely missed the mark. This brings new areas of focus like validation, accuracy, interpretability, and actionability for machine learning or AI products in healthcare.", "Healthcare is one of the most regulated industries with several laws around the usage of data. While that may be the right approach to ensure the privacy of patients, this has resulted in data based products to be behind the curve for healthcare. Almost every project I have worked on is slowed down due to various processes for security and compliance established in the industry over the years. Some of these processes make the data less secure from the perspective of newer cloud based architectures but it is difficult for organizations to rapidly adapt their policies and practices to meet the needs of today\u2019s infrastructures. There is a lot of work ongoing in healthcare IT to truly reap the benefits of the data they have to benefit the patients and the business. Until then, it is a bumpy road for data based products.", "Almost all organizations\u2019 leadership teams recognise the need to be data-driven, move towards proactive decision making and utilizing technology to solve problems. They are eager to invest in \u2018innovation\u2019 and \u2018AI\u2019 to remain with the rest of the industries. Several decisions are being made at the C-suite level in this pursuit, however, it seems as if the decision makers haven\u2019t fully prepared their organizations for what it would take to be on this journey. Without clear success criteria and alignment across the organization, it is almost impossible for external organizations to bring in new technology solutions; this is another challenge to solve for in addition to the product itself. This leads me to the next point below.", "The rest is people. Healthcare is driven by people, not technology. It doesn\u2019t matter how great your product is, there is always a need for deep people engagement to land your product in healthcare organizations. As a product manager, it is a challenge to identify where the boundary of your product ends such that it is big enough to be complete but small enough to be repeatable when you take it from one organization to another. This requires investments in customer engagement and implementation teams as much as product teams and building processes on establishing your product within the organization\u2019s ecosystem. Without this, expect your product to be out the door pretty quickly.", "I was most surprised when I looked through the user experience of several technology products being currently utilized across the healthcare industry. I am pretty sure my fellow UX designers almost had a heart attack. Looking at what is currently widespread, if you think creating something beautiful, simple and minimal will solve all user challenges, you are wrong. Most users in healthcare are used to looking at complex interfaces and dealing with various data points in their head to make decisions. This brings new challenges for user experience designers to build the next era of health tech products which are simple yet thorough at the same time.", "Last but definitely not the least, data! The quality, consistency, infrastructure of data from one organization to another is unbelievably difficult to work with. To build a repeatable, consistent and scalable product you have to be inventive in your data strategies. There are several \u2018standards\u2019 for data representation or variant implementations of the same standards. Data points are fragmented and most infrastructures are not built to support real-time decision making. In data science, the majority time is spent preparing the data, if you are doing data science for healthcare prepare to spend almost all your time doing that.", "Despite these challenges, I have to say that building products for healthcare has been one of the most rewarding experiences. Paving the path is never easy, but what is fun about easy problems?", "Your home for data science.
