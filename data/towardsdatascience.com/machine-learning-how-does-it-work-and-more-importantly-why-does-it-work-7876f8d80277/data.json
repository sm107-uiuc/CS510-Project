The word by itself was very intriguing. I was interested and wanted to know more. So as any normal person would, I opened my web browser and typed \u201cWhat is Machine Learning?", "And this Venn diagram popped up. Along with other words with a common suffix: supervised learning, unsupervised learning, reinforcement learning, deep learning. This was followed by other words with increasing order of complexity: data, classification, regression, models, clusters, ensembles, support vectors, neural networks, etc, etc, etc.", "After spending almost a year to try and understand what all those terms meant, converting the knowledge gained into working codes and employing those codes to solve some real-world problems, something important dawned on me.", "It\u2019s silly. This is a question that I should have asked from the beginning. Not after a year. But you know.. better late than never.", "When I searched for an answer on the internet, I found nothing relevant. That\u2019s weird. The internet should have answers to everything right?", "This got me all worked up. I wanted answers. It took me a while to find it. And this post, my first post, is the result of that find. Now the internet has an answer to a question which I had.", "Machine Learning is the tool using which you try to learn the model behind a process that generates data. You take the data that a process created and use it to model the process. The benefit? If you model a process, you can predict the process output by calculating the model output.", "Take, for example, social media. Every time you use your social media account, you create data in the form of posts, views, likes, dislikes, comments, etc. Your social media activity is the process and that process has created data. The data you created is used to model your interests so that you get to see more relevant content in your timeline.", "Let\u2019s try to understand how ML works with a simple and hypothetical example.", "You are a natural philosopher in the fourteenth century. You drop metal spheres from different heights (possibly from different floors of a man-made wonder) and record the time it takes to reach the ground. Since you are a really cool person, you use Machine Learning to model that process.", "You have recorded your data with heights values of 1m, 2m, 3m, \u2026 100m and plotted it using some ancient plotting technique. (The cartesian coordinate system was invented a century later)", "For Machine Learning to work, you need three prerequisites:", "In our example, you have recorded the data and there is a pattern to it. Since you are from the fourteenth century, you won\u2019t be knowing basic kinematics. So you can\u2019t pin the pattern behind the data mathematically.", "Now please don\u2019t think how someone from the fourteenth century can know ML and not know basic physics. It\u2019s all hypothetical and as I said you are a really cool natural philosopher.", "Finally, you start the task of modeling the time taken for a sphere to reach the ground as the function of the height it was dropped from. You used all your ML knowledge and made a model for the above process.", "Any model you make will have an in-sample error: E(in). This is the error you get when you try to predict within the sample you have taken to model the process. In our example, it will be the error in the model when you try to predict for heights in the range of 1 to 100 meters.", "The model works if it performs outside the sample you used. Let us call this E(out). In our example, it will be the model\u2019s error when you try to predict for heights more than 100 meters or non-integer heights (like 1.5m)", "Recall that the whole point of ML is to get a mathematical model that approximates the target function.", "Again, if things were ideal, we won\u2019t require ML. To quantify the change between E(in) and E(out) we introduce a new term called Tolerance (\u03b4). We determine our model performance with the use of tolerance. If the absolute change in error between in-sample and out-sample was within a tolerance level, we declare that the modeling approach you used, worked.", "A slight re-orientation of the inequality can be used to define a bad model", "If a model is bad, then the Machine Learning technique you used did not work", "Hoeffding\u2019s inequality is a concept from probability theory. It gives maximum value for the deviation between an estimate of the sample and the expected value of the sample. To simplify the above statement, let\u2019s look into a specific example, the mean (average).", "That\u2019s a lot of Greek alphabets. Let\u2019s look into them one by one", "We can extrapolate this concept to our problem. The in-sample error E(in) is an estimate from the sample. The out of sample error E(out) is the expected value of the sample. Applying the Hoeffding\u2019s inequality to this situation, we get:", "Taking into effect, the model complexity (M), we can generalize the above equation as:", "For a decent approximation, the value of tolerance should be very less. As you reduce your tolerance levels, the probability of ML failing at that \u03b4 increases. It should be be noted that, due to this fact, the ideal model where \u03b4 = 0 ( E(in) = E(out) = 0 ) is not achievable.", "As the sample size increases, the probability of ML failing decreases. So, the more number of observations you have in your data, the better.", "Model complexity has a linear relationship with the probability value. And a probability value is always less than or equal to 1. So, model complexity can drastically affect the success of ML. If complexity increases, the probability of success decreases.", "The idea behind a successful modeling approach is to balance the complexity of the model with the sample size since the tolerance is always kept low (this is where terms like over-fitting and under-fitting come into play)", "You, being a fourteenth-century natural philosopher, have successfully used machine learning to model the time taken for a sphere to reach the ground when dropped from a certain height.", "Why do you think this approach works?", "The ML approach you used works because when you try and model the process, you balanced the model complexity with the sample size you had (with reasonable tolerance) so that the probability of failure is minimized.", "If you want to build a complex model, then you require a large sample size for good generalization. So,", "When you balance the model complexity and sample size, ML works.", "The concepts behind ML has been around for more than 60 years (perceptron was invented in the \u201850s). But in recent years, there has been humongous growth in the field.", "You get to hear the terms \u201cBig Data\u201d and \u201cDeep Learning\u201d regularly. While the former implies that the general sample size of datasets has increased drastically, the later proves that the complexity in which you can model processes today can increase.", "Hope this post helped you in some way.
