There is only bad design.\u201dEdward Tufte", "Data visualization is increasingly being seen as the essential step of any successful data-driven analytics strategy. Furthermore, as mentioned in my previous article related to the subject, is one of the most powerful tools in the set available to data analysts or data enthusiasts. Therefore, we must dedicate time to create stunning graphs and visualizations to carefully and clearly communicate our story and findings hidden in structured data.", "Last week, we talked about how important data visualizations are and I introduced to different plot types such as:", "In this opportunity, I\u2019ll give you more insights on how to display customized charts with Python and Matplotlib, the plotting library that has some neat tools to enable the creation of beautiful and flexible charts.", "1. Additional plot types with Python (8 min read).", "2. Formatting applications (2 min read).", "Even though these plot types are included in the second part of this series of Business Intelligence Visualizations with Python, they are not less important, as they complement the already-introduced plots. I believe you\u2019ll find them even more interesting than basic plots!", "To begin with this series, we must install required libraries:", "A Bar plot is a chart that presents data using rectangular bars with heights and lengths proportional to the values they represent. The basic command utilized for bar charts is plt.bar(x_values, y_values).", "The additional feature involved in this plot are Error Bars, which are graphical representations of the variability of data. They\u2019re commonly used to indicate the estimated error in a desired measure.", "This time, we\u2019ll be plotting a horizontal bar plot with the following input data:", "Now let\u2019s plot the bars with the plt.barh command:", "A variation of this plot can be made with the insertion of labels or texts to the bars. We\u2019ll do this with the following input data:", "We continue with the family of bar plots, in this case with a variation that compares two sets of data horizontally. The commands to create this plot are the same as with the horizontal bar plot, but negating values for one of the sets of data.", "Now let\u2019s plot the bars with the plt.barh command and the negation feature:", "This chart is equivalent to the previous shown, with the exception that it has vertical orientation and that I\u2019ve added height labels to have a clearer visualization of such a metric. This can be done with the command ax.text.", "In addition, I introduced the method autofmt_xdate included in Matplotlib to automate the rotation of labels. Take a look at the code:", "Let\u2019s add some color to the equation. In the following chart, I introduce the built-in module called colormap, which is utilized to implement intuitive color schemes for the plotted parameters. First, I\u2019ll proceed with the imports:", "Now I\u2019ll insert sample data to plot the chart. As you can see, colormap is implemented through the ScalarMappable class which applies data normalization before returning RGBA colors from the given colormap.", "To clarify the previous statement, RGBA colors are a form of digital color representation, together with HEX and HSL. HEX is the most utilized and re-known, for being a simple representation of 6-digit numbers that can create Red, Green, and Blue. An example of a Hex color representation is #123456, 12 is Red, 34 is Green and 56 is Blue. On the other hand, RGBA colors add a new factor, the alpha, which is the opacity or transparency that follows the same percentage scheme: 0% represents absolute transparency and 100% represents absolute opacity which is the way we traditionally see colors. More details in this website.", "In this link to Matplotlib\u2019s documentation you\u2019ll find further details to the different colormaps that can be chosen. Take a look at the code to generate the plot in order to have a clearer view:", "Now we\u2019re going to add some styling to our data presentation using bar plots and pattern fills. This can be done utilizing the set_hatch command or including as an argument in the plt.bar configuration the hatch command.", "A Heatmap is a graphical representation of data in which values are depicted by color. They make it easy to visualize complex data and understand it at a glance. The variation in color may be by hue or intensity, giving obvious visual cues to the reader about how the represented values are distributed.", "In this case, the variation in color represents the number of observations clustered in a particular range of values, which is implemented with the colorbar feature of Matplotlib. Also, the plot is made with a 2-dimensional histogram, created with the command plt.hist2d.", "In the code below, I create two normally-distributed variables X and Y with a mean of 0 and 5 respectively.", "When you plot the 2D hist, you see a 2D histogram. Think about it like looking at a histogram from the \u201ctop\u201d. In addition to that, to have a clearer understanding of the color distribution, consider that colors centered at the 2D histogram are yellowish and correspond to the highest values of the colorbar, which is reasonable since X values should peak at 0 and Y values should peak at 5.", "Pie charts are used to display elements of a data set as proportions of a whole. In addition to the traditional plt.pie command, we\u2019ll utilize the shadow=True boolean feature to bring some styling to the sliced of the pie chart.", "Once visualizations are created and included in our analysis, it\u2019s time to learn how to modify the format of our plots. We can implement all kinds of colors, line styles, gradients of color, or even markers.", "Take a look at the following code, in which I implemented three different alternatives to display our desired color for a simple line plot, in this case being red.", "On the other hand, we can display a sample of Matplotlib available colors utilizing the already mentioned RGBA format, such as the following commands:", "Also, we can perform our own line plots with a sample of gradient colors applying the RGBA formatting:", "Marker styling is another interesting feature of Matplotlib\u2019s package of tools available to nicely format our visualizations:", "Matplotlib\u2019s style package adds support for easy-to-switch plotting style sheets which are pre-defined, such as \u201cggplot\u201d, the emulation of the popular plotting package in R. Here\u2019s a list of all available styles:", "There are two ways to set the style sheet, the first is by setting it globally to our coding environment via plt.style.use function.", "The second way is through the context manager, which applies the styling only to a specific code block:", "With the posted guidelines and plot types in this article, I hope to have helped you to enhance your skills to create visualizations with Python and Matplotlib.", "This is the second part of a series of articles related to data-visualization that I\u2019ll be preparing to share more insights and knowledge. If you liked the information included in this article don\u2019t hesitate to contact me to share your thoughts. It motivates me to keep on sharing!", "Thanks for taking the time to read my article!
