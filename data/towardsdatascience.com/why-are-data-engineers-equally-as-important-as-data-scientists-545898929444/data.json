I hope that this article finds you in a good mood, because I\u2019m about to piss some people off. I\u2019ve been writing a lot of tutorial/guide based articles in the past few weeks. I want to switch it up a little. We wont be touching any code this week. Instead, we will talk about why we should show some love towards all the data engineers out there.", "I have mentioned it again and again. Data is the new fuel for companies in the 20th Century. If you\u2019re not making moves based on the data you have, you\u2019re missing out. Data Practitioners use data to solve business problems, introduce new technologies and innovate new products.", "How do you think Google Home came to life ? Data", "How do you think Youtube knows what videos to recommend to you ? Data", "Companies are able to predict your age, gender, income range and many other attributes you have just by looking at your web surfing patterns and recommend you products based on that, you don\u2019t even notice it! Data Scientists are competing against each other on who has the better model that\u2019s going to make them rich. As data scientists like to say:", "Give me all your data, and I will make you rich \u2014 Every Data Scientist ever", "However, behind all the scenes, behind all the flashy models lies a true hero. A silent guardian that watches over our deployed models, automation systems, data architecture, it goes on. Someone who provides the real fuel to be processed. Someone who understands from the ground up of the data. Someone who knows exactly what data to get, where, when, how and why to get it. We call him/her the Data Engineer.", "I personally think that Data Engineers do not get enough recognition. Nowadays, it\u2019s all about the Data Scientists.", "Every company needs one. Everyone wants to be one.Everyone is one.", "Why don\u2019t I see people bragging about themselves being a Data Engineer?Where are my fellow engineers at?Well, I\u2019m here to shed some light on why Data Engineers are so important. I\u2019m here to shed some light why Data Engineers should stand tall with their heads held high. Without them, there would not even be data to model.To do that, let\u2019s dig into what each of these professions do.", "Welcome to 2019,where the term \u2018Data Scientist\u2019 gets thrown around so blindly that no one really knows what specific tasks does a Data Scientist get. Based on my experience, it highly depends on the nature of the company.", "Some DS are more analysis oriented. DS are expected to have some sort of domain/business knowledge in the industry they\u2019re working in. Besides formulating the right questions, they provide business solutions, insights, steps to take by the company by explaining what they have found from their analysis which may or may not result in higher ( insert metrics here ) for that company. They make amazing visualisations to assist them in explaining their findings to stakeholders, hoping to convince them to take the right direction in the business. There\u2019s a huge branch of analysis to be done, customers, churn, revenue, segmentation, allocation and many more that I\u2019m not going into details.", "Some DS build models for the company.Going deeper. Some DS build machine learning models for certain type of datasets that are harder to perform analysis on. These models require a certain level of Maths and Programming. Take the following example.", "Here\u2019s a dataset regarding job postings on a site. The stakeholders of the site want to know what kind of job ads get the most ad-replies based on the data given. Perhaps an ad with a longer subject?A higher salary ? Good benefits ? Certain job categories ?A DS is able to run machine learning models to answer questions like these. This can lead to optimal decision making for the management to increase whatever metrics they are prioritising. The DS is also able to predict the ad-replies of a new ad given all the data with the model.", "Some DS are more Tech Oriented.Take Spotify as an example, you noticed that they are able to recommend songs ( that you don\u2019t even realise you like ) to you. Another example would be Google Home, which implements a speech recognition bot that would answer almost any of your questions. Technologies like these are created using Artificial Neural Networks by Machines. DS train these machines with huge amounts of data to have it learn to do something in return. The process isn\u2019t as simple as you think. One would need to know how to train the Machine based on some kind of appropriate model, optimise the model and deploy the model on the app/site/product or whatever you name it.", "The thing is, DS are not locked into one specific kind. You can be a Tech Oriented DS but still be doing analysis for the company. Again, it highly depends on what the company requires of you. For the official definition of Data Scientist, we would have to go back to the definition of \u2018Science\u2019. Here\u2019s the definition by Cambridge:", "Basically, in short, science means the knowledge of how things work.Add a \u2018data\u2019 into the mix, you would get the knowledge of how data works.In my eyes, a Data Scientist should understand the nature of data, how it works and how do you work with it to give specific results that you require. A Data Scientist would know exactly what kind of method to perform on the dataset given the requirement. A Data Scientist would know how to manipulate data to whatever shape or form required so that certain processes can be done to that shape or form of data. A data scientist should know everything about data.", "But in science, there are specialisations like Physics, Biology and Chemistry. Hence we get:data science \u2014 engineeringdata science \u2014 analyticsdata science \u2014 machine learningthe list goes on.", "However, there are people nowadays with just a slight bit of excel knowledge, some light SQL and some visualisation skills claiming to be a Data Scientist. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re in the wrong in doing that but just know that the term is thrown around so blatantly that a true Data Scientist who knows his/her stuff is hard to find nowadays. Everyone\u2019s definition of a DS is different, so please, when you plan to call yourself one, be prepared to explain why.", "Data Engineers are especially important in tech firms. No matter what kind of medium you are dealing with, the data team usually do not meddle with the data in the master database. This is because it is heavy on the database and may cause problems like crashes, latency on the medium itself. There are also several databases that the data may reside in. For example, if you have a website and an app at the same time, your data may not reside in one place.", "While the DS are flexing on their models, Data Engineers are trying to figure out the core foundation on how their data is organised and structured in the data warehouse \u2014 which is where data analysts/scientists get their data from. Data engineers create a scalable, high performance infrastructure to satisfy all data needs of the company, whether the need is coming from a fellow data scientist or a finance colleague. They do this by writing ETL, or in my case, ELT pipelines to extract raw data from multiple sources into a data warehouse so that the team can perform fancy stuff on them like machine learning, visualisation etc. Since they\u2019re the owners of the infrastructure of the data warehouse, Data Engineers also build automations, functions, real-time analytical solutions on the data warehouse itself. An example of a function would be like a Gmail Data Pipeline \u2014 a data pipeline that extracts data from your Gmail inbox directly.", "Data Engineers achieve all of the tasks above by using different technologies like GCP and AWS, indicating their knowledge in these fields. They play an important role in researching which technology provides the best solution to what they are trying to achieve. In my case, I am experienced in using Apache Airflow because it\u2019s the main ELT tool I use for extracting data in my company. I have also gotten exposure to Google Cloud Functions, Google App Script, Google BQ, AWS and a few other technologies. I have also written an article on how to operate Apache Airflow from scratch, you can read it here.", "In my opinion, the engineering aspect of data is a part of the science of it. Like building blocks, the engineers are the ones who put the pieces together. They are like data plumbers, who understands the data from ground zero. They are able to answer questions like:", "That being said, the stakeholders of the company only cares if we are able to answer their business questions in their terms. Hence, it is up to the Data Scientist to use data from the data warehouse to do whatever he/she wants to in order to achieve that. Many people do not realise that Data Scientists usually get data that has already been transformed internally by the Data Engineers, which can be easily read, understood and fed into complex machine learning models in order to produce their findings. Not taking credit away from them, a Data Scientist has to perform experiments, trial runs and intensive research on the business to know what to do with the data. However, a lot of data hard work has already been partially done by the engineers. Here\u2019s an example:", "Here\u2019s a dataset about stores in a store oriented website. Let\u2019s assume we can get this dataset from the Stores table in our data warehouse. It is pretty straight forward and easy to read. Stores, parameters of the stores, and the metric which is the visits.However, data is not recorded as such in the master database. Instead, there are rules and ways to record data in the master that are often not user friendly. To better explain it, I have made a flow chart:", "Here\u2019s what happens in the master.Once a store registers, a row appears in the Store Action States table indicating the register of a new store and along with it, all the parameters that come with that store. The user of that store however, can change the store parameters at any given time. For example, if the store category was Jewellery, the store owner could have wanted to sell something else after sometime, he/she then changed the store category to Electronics. This is also recorded in the Store Action States table as a new row with a new State ID. Happening in parallel, the Store Actions table records a new row stating the action of the store, which is a \u2018parameter change\u2019 action. The store changes table then records multiple rows indicating the changes of the columns that were changed. After the changes were approved by the system, the new value of the change gets updated in the Store and Store Params table. The Store Action States table then records a new row with a new State ID indicating that it has been approved.", "If I have lost you here, that\u2019s the point!", "This form of data is not readable nor easily understood by the normal person. Every database records data differently and this is just one of the many examples. If you were to answer questions like :", "It isn\u2019t directly translatable in this form of tables. Hence, Data Engineers make transformed tables so that everyone can read information like these easily, which is what Data Scientists usually get. One of their main focuses is to design the architecture of these tables in the data warehouse so that all information can be accessed easily by simple SQL joins. So please my fellow data practitioners, buy your Data Engineer a cup of coffee tomorrow.", "Don\u2019t you just love a little taste of drama? Who do you think is more relevant?", "A scientist can discover a new star, but he cannot make one. He would have to ask an engineer to do it for him.\u2013Gordon Lindsay Glegg", "Let\u2019s get the facts out of the way. Without Data Engineers, there wouldn\u2019t even be any data for the Scientists to begin with. Without them, who will the Scientists turn to when they ask :\u201cWhat does this column mean?\u201d which is asked more often than you think. You may argue, they\u2019ll ask the developers then! Well, the developers ARE the Data Engineers in cases like this. Simply put it this way, Data Scientists are internal clients of Data Engineers, they depend on them to get reliable, useful and \u2018nice\u2019 data which makes their life 10 times easier.", "However, Engineers wouldn\u2019t be able to answer business questions because they\u2019re not experienced in that domain. Data Scientists often have business knowledge about the field they\u2019re in and are able to ask the right questions, suggest the right solutions and find the right metrics for specific requirements. They\u2019re like the brains of the CEO so that he makes the right decisions.", "Hence, I would say the roles complement each other. You can\u2019t have one without the other. You wouldn\u2019t want to hire a Data Scientist into a company without a proper data pipeline established, hoping that he/she will dig into the hardcore data engineering needed. It would be a complete waste of your company\u2019s resources, the person\u2019s time, capabilities and skillset. Both skillsets of a Data Engineer and Scientist are crucial in determining how valuable the data in your organisation is. It is also very important that the two work in harmony and communicate well with each other.", "There are many kinds of data teams being formed nowadays, some of which consist of Data Engineers and Scientists while some purely consist of Scientists only. In my case, I am heavily involved in engineering tasks while performing analysis for the company as well. If you dislike one or the other, I would suggest to ask for the nature of the role you are applying for before getting into it.", "However, when it comes to deploying machine learning models, I wouldn\u2019t put all your eggs into the Data Scientist\u2019s basket. If you\u2019ve read thus far, you would understand that the Engineers fully comprehend ALL the data available ( and not available ) to them. Hence, I would argue that they are one of the best candidates to implement a machine learning model for your medium. If you don\u2019t understand your data, how are you going to decide what to include and to exclude from your model to optimise it?", "You should have a general understanding of what is what.", "Furthermore, Data Engineers are more skilled in a various range of technologies. They\u2019re comfortable deploying models on websites and apps, they understand how containers work, they understand how APIs work and many other solutions that a Scientist have no experience with. They have much more experience in writing clean code, diagnosing and debugging. They can very well handle missing data, inconsistent data types and formats, time zones, scalability and durability of the model because they are used to transforming and cleaning data. They have cool GitHub push/pull methods. Better yet, if they realise something is missing from the dataset, they can get it immediately even if it\u2019s not in the data warehouse. Hence, you see Data Engineers levelling up nowadays, calling themselves Machine Learning Engineers. These are the guys performing all of the above, and then some.", "I hope that after reading my article, you understand Data Engineers better. You realise that they are the ones who keep the world spinning. So please, show them some love. Don\u2019t discriminate and continue learning. After all, Data Never Sleeps.", "Thanks for reading !
