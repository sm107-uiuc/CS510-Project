Mobile ads are expected to generate $1.08 billion this year, which would be a 122% jump from last year.", "In this research analysis, Criteo Labs is sharing 10 days\u2019 worth of Avazu data for us to develop models predicting ad click-through rate (CTR). Given a user and the page he (or she) is visiting. what is the probability that he (or she) will click on a given ad? The goal of this analysis is to benchmark the most accurate ML algorithms for CTR estimation. Let\u2019s get started!", "The data set can be found here.", "The training set contains over 40 millions of records, to be able to process locally, we will randomly sample 1 million of them.", "Because of the anonymization, we don\u2019t know what each value means in each feature. In addition, most of the features are categorical and most of the categorical features have a lot of values. This makes EDA less intuitive easier to confuse, but we will try the best.", "We can group all the features in the data into the following categories:", "The overall click through rate is approx. 17%, and approx. 83% is not clicked.", "The hourly clicks pattern looks pretty similar every day. However, there were a couple of peak hours, one is sometime in the mid of the day on Oct 22, and another is sometime in the mid of the day on Oct 28. And one very low click hour is close to mid-night on Oct 24.", "Extract hour from date time feature.", "In general, the highest number of clicks is at hour 13 and 14 (1pm and 2pm), and the lowest number of clicks is at hour 0 (mid-night). It seems a useful feature for roughly estimation.", "Now that we have looked at clicks and impressions. We can calculate click-through rate (CTR). CTR is the ratio of ad clicks to impressions. It measures the rate of clicks on each ad.", "One of the interesting observations here is that the highest CTR happened in the hour of mid-night, 1, 7 and 15. If you remember, around mid-night has the least number of impressions and clicks.", "Tuesdays have the most number of impressions and clicks, then Wednesdays, followed by Thursdays. Mondays and Fridays have the least number of impressions and clicks.", "While Tuesdays and Wednesdays have the highest number of impressions and clicks, their CTR are among the lowest. Saturdays and Sundays enjoy the highest CTR. Apparently, people have more time to click over the weekend.", "C1 is one of the anonymized categorical features. Although we don\u2019t know its meaning, we still want to take a look its distribution.", "C1 value = 1005 has the most data, almost 92% of all the data we are using. Let\u2019s see whether we can find value of C1 indicates something about CTR.", "The important C1 values and CTR pairs are:", "C1 = 1002 has a much higher than average CTR, and C1=1010 has a much lower than average CTR, it seems these two C1 values are important for predicting CTR.", "I have heard that there are many factors that affect the performance of your banner ads, but the most influential one is the banner position. Let\u2019s see whether it is true.", "Although banner position 0 has the highest number of impressions and clicks, banner position 7 enjoys the highest CTR. Increasing the number of ads placed on banner position 7 seems to be a good idea.", "Device type 1 gets the most impressions and clicks, and the other device types only get the minimum impressions and clicks. We may want to look in more details about device type 1.", "As expected, most clicks happened during the business hours from device type 1.", "The highest CTR comes from device type 0.", "Using the same way, I explored all the other categorical features such as site features, app features and C14-C21 features. The way of exploring are similar, the details can be found on Github, I will not repeat here.", "A hash function is a function that maps a set of objects to a set of integers. When using a hash function, this mapping is performed which takes a key of arbitrary length as input and outputs an integer in a specific range.", "Our reduced dataset still contains 1M samples and ~2M feature values. The purposes of the hashing is to minimize memory consumption by the features.", "There is an excellent article on hashing tricks by Lucas Bernardi if you want to learn more.", "Python has a built in function that performs a hash called hash(). For the objects in our data, the hash is not surprising.", "It will train until eval-logloss hasn\u2019t improved in 20 rounds. And the final output:", "Jupyter notebook can be found on Github.
