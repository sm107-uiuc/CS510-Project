But for months, the only responses you receive begin with, \u201cI\u2019m sorry to inform you that\u2026\u201d You cringe and tear up inside at another letter from a company that will not give you the opportunity to showcase all the skills in your possession.", "Or maybe you\u2019ve faring better. You were able to secure the fourth and final interview for this company you really want to work for. You did your homework on the company, prepared for the technical interviews, and prayed to the right deity.", "But when you thought you had the interview in the palm of your hands, you failed. You were so nervous on the fateful day that you couldn\u2019t perform your 100%. Or maybe your 100% just wasn\u2019t enough.", "You were rejected by a company. Again.", "For those who are in this situation, here are 12 personal tips on how to deal with rejections on a mental and emotional level as an aspiring Data Scientist. I hope these tips can guide and re-energize your tireless efforts to get that dream job in the Data Science field.", "Every Data Scientist who\u2019s working in industry went through the same tough job process that you are going through now. We all failed in the same crushing way but also succeeded in the same triumphant way. The next few tips will delve into how you can deal with your lowest moments.", "The first tip is to assume that you are NOT that person with 167 IQ, perfect credentials, and every FAANG offer secured in the first try. There will be few like that here and there. Assume you aren\u2019t that person, and you are part of the 99% that toiled relentlessly to achieve their dreams.", "If you have a Data Science buddy who can pass your resume to the hiring managers, that\u2019s great. But many of you are switching careers and do not have this luxury. That\u2019s fine, since cold applications work anyway (it\u2019s how I got my first job).", "Think about the application process from a statistical point of view (as a future Data Scientist). Let\u2019s say you can send 1 cold application every 1~1.5 minutes. So every hour you get about 40~60 applications. If you spend 3 hours a day, that\u2019s around 120~180 applications. Let\u2019s say the response rate is 1% at the lower bound. That\u2019s still at least 1 response for every 3 hours.", "Compared to this to pursuing the warm application route. You first search through LinkedIn for a friend of a former co-worker who\u2019s a Data Scientist. You spend the monthly LinkedIn premium credits to send direct messages to acquaintances like that, hoping that someone will respond for a coffee chat. One Data Scientist does generously agree, and you go over to the requested location. You talk awkwardly with that person for about an hour, and you finally (and nervously) ask for a referral. You get a yes. Hooray!.", "How long would this process take you as a whole? Let\u2019s say the initial search plus sending crafted messages took 1 hour. You spend a whole day waiting for a response. Maybe one empathetic soul responds for a meet up in 2 days when the person is free. It takes another 30 min ~ 1 hour to meet the Data Scientist directly, another 1 hour for the conversation for a referral request.", "Both are valid strategies with different returns in investment. Cold emails result in more responses from recruiters if the statistics work out. The warm approach leads you one step closer to a call with the hiring manager. So understand the benefits and disadvantages of these two tactics at disposal.", "My tactic focused on mastering the cold application strategy. Through trials and failures, I had eventually gotten to the level of efficiency at a rate of 1~1.5 minute per application per company. When my current company reached out to me 3 days after I submitted the application, I had completely forgotten what they actually did since I had applied to over 300 other locations by that point.", "Maximal application efficiency doesn\u2019t matter if your resume and cover letter are subpar. Recruiters spend about 7 seconds per resume to look for keywords. Sometimes companies use AI to filter out resumes based on these words. In other words, have a professional review your resume.", "Most applications have cover letter attachment as an option. I have not received a response from a company when I did not attach a cover letter. Make sure you craft one that\u2019s generic enough to be applicable to most companies but specific enough so that even if you are to change the company name and the requirements of the positions, the cover letter will still make sense.", "Don\u2019t stop applying even if you are close to getting that job offer. Take it from me; I was once directly reached out by a CTO of a small company, who found me after reading one of my popular TowardsDataScience posts. I was so proud by this fact that I stopped applying to other roles.", "This strategy of focusing on one company to maximize a singular return made sense at the time. It seemed to work too, as I moved on the interview stages until I met with the CEO face-to-face. He thought that I was a good fit. But when my final technical interview came and I failed to parse nested dictionaries, they had to renege on my offer.", "I was left devastated, and what made it worse was that I had no more interviews left, as my application pipeline dried out. It felt like I had to start all over from scratch, which was a soul-crushing moment that could\u2019ve been mended if I had other interviews in prospect. Never let this circumstance happen to you. Always keep applying.", "There are hundreds of people applying for that same position who have equal if not better credentials than you. It\u2019s going to be hard, very hard. If the process is easy, that should in fact be taken as a red flag on the company. This is a counterintuitive statement that often rings true.", "Most companies with legitimate and experienced Data Science teams craft the interview procedure rigorously to carefully measure the analytical and problem-solving abilities of the candidate. These skills serve as a proxy for how well the candidate will potentially perform as a Data Scientist once hired. That\u2019s why the interviews are long and laced with tricky brain-teaser questions. Another reason for crafting tough interview process is to find the best applicants among the sea of junior aspirants.", "Think about this from the opposite angle; how confident would you feel about a company if the entire Data Science interview process was only 1 hour long without any technical questions? You as an applicant are also evaluating the fit for the company, and you want to be in a setting where you will actively grow by being challenged by your teammates and your manager.", "Expanding on the point above, technical interviews are essentially intelligence testing. I break down the components of the intelligence testing in my other article here:", "As TLDR, bear in mind that Data Science skills != interviewing skills. The two are different beasts. It\u2019s just like the Standardized Aptitude Test (or comparable aptitude test in your country for college entrance). The SAT serves as proxy for your \u201cintelligence\u201d and mastery of knowledge fundamentals. They have rules and procedures of their own and you need to play this game if you want to get into a good college. Consider technical interviews in the same regard.", "Trust me when I say that you don\u2019t need a programming or statistic Master\u2019s/Bachelor\u2019s to become a Data Scientist. My Bachelor\u2019s degree is in English literature. If you think you got it bad, think about what I had to go through myself.", "Degrees and background only really matter for getting that initial recruiter call. After that, it\u2019s really about intelligence testing that I mentioned above. The reason why degrees matter in the first place is due to the competition. I said that hundreds of people with the same credentials are applying to the same position.", "Many of them \u2014 at least those in the Bay Area of California \u2014 have Masters degrees related to the data field. The number is propped by the relative easiness to get into prestigious US universities for a Master\u2019s degree compared to a Bachelor\u2019s (I know because I got one from an Ivy League school myself).", "Compound this situation with the OPT / H1B visa situation and you have 1000+ graduates each year with impressive US degrees who are trying to secure those lucrative entry-level Data Analyst and Scientist positions. If you don\u2019t have a Master\u2019s, you already look less competitive than those who do.", "If this is your worry, I have you covered. For the Exclusive TDS Interview, I spoke with Jeffrey Li from DoorDash, who shares 3 important strategies he used to get offers for multiple Data Science positions without a those degrees in software or statistics. These strategies go over the entire interview process, from getting recruiter calls to winning the hearts of the hiring managers.", "Maybe you have those right degrees and credentials. And for this company you\u2019re interviewing for right now, you haven\u2019t stumbled one bit on the technical challenges. In fact, everyone at the company you\u2019ve met gives you a stellar vibe; they seem very interested in working with you. To secure your position even more, you leverage the briefcase scenario that Jeffrey Li talks about in the TDS Interview.", "But, just but, you find out days later that they passed you on the job offer. You\u2019re shell-shocked, confused, devastated. You keep on asking yourself, \u201cWhat did I do wrong?\u201d.", "I\u2019m here to tell you that maybe it wasn\u2019t you who did anything wrong. Maybe there were forces outside of your control, like the other finalist having one more impressive thing on the resume than yours. Akin to Data Science, uncertainty is an inherent variable in the job process. You can do your very best, but luck isn\u2019t always in your favor. Construe this circumstance as that company just not being meant for you. Maybe it was their loss instead.", "Maybe you were meant to fail. By failing and growing from your failures, you have become even a more competent and competitive candidate. I\u2019ve seen this kind of growth many times. Applicants fail their first handful of interviews, get better at interviewing, fail some more, and by the time they failed their 30th time, they have gotten so good at interviewing that they can now take on the most rigorous interviews at top companies.", "It took me about 4 months until the final job offer. For others, it took 8 months, some over a year. It\u2019s soul-crushing to think that you might be unemployed for possibly a year. I know. This is a difficult reality to swallow. But keep in mind that everyone eventually gets there to the destination they were meant to reach. And it will only get much easier from there.", "Time for recovery is part of the reason why it takes so long to get that dream Data Science job. Cadence for tolerating and overcoming pain is different for everyone, as some wallow in grief longer than others.", "I\u2019m not telling you to stop grieving; I\u2019m telling you to strengthen your mental fortitude to get back up when life knocks you down. After I failed my first cycle of interviews with that CTO involved, it gave me 3 full days of misery and negativity. But through gym, music, and friends, I immediately went back into battle.", "As a final note, feel free to apply to other roles as well. You doesn\u2019t have to only apply for Data Scientist positions. Data Analyst, Data Engineer, Business Analyst, Product Analyst are also great roles that use data in some capacity. Open yourself up to other opportunities if it comes to that.", "Your home for data science.
