It\u2019s one of the terms that you can get quite philosophical about. Ask everyone and everyone has something different to say. With the most frequent answers being \u201cit-depends\u201d and others mainly defining big data after its qualities, there isn\u2019t much on defining it from other points of view.", "In this artice, I\u2019ll break down and approach explaining big data from different perspectives, including the perspective of big data qualities, the perspective of limited physical resources, and the perspective of data analysis.", "This is the most common approach taken to define big data. It describes a couple of qualities that interestingly enough all of them start with the letter V. They were four on the beginning Volume, Velocity, Veracity, Variety, and later many others were introduced. Bigger volume, higher velocity, more challenges in veracity and more variety than you can think about is what they convey. This increase, challenges the current state of technological advancements and requires further research and developments to deal with it. The definition derived out of this is:", "Big Data is referred to the data that comes in increased volume, velocity, variety, and more difficulties in veracity than we usually handle. Data might have all of these qualities, some of them or only one of them. And that\u2019s still Big Data!", "Defining Big Data on this way it\u2019s a good starting point. Ending here it\u2019s okay, but you haven\u2019t yet punctuate the true meaning behind.", "Big Data is an evolutionary term. This because it\u2019s tightly coupled to the current state of technological developments. What was named Big Data at 2010 probably would\u2019t be called Big Data at 2020. And probably in years to come this term will fade away, because we will have tools and resources that will not be challenged anymore. Here you might see different definitions of what Big Data is and what it isn\u2019t, that in some way or another relate with the physical resources used to process it.", "If traditional tools are challenged when handling data with increase in volume, velocity, veracity, variety and you-name-it, that data is called Big Data.", "Data that can entirely be processed in a single common machine, no matter what qualities it posses, that is not Big Data.", "For traditional tools, you might think of the ones we usually install in our machines to process/analyse data easily. Microsoft Excel is one of them.", "Big Data is here because we want to know more about certain phenomenons and speculate less about what they might be. If we look back, statistical analysis was there even though technology wasn\u2019t there to support. Due to the difficulty of applying analysis to the whole dataset that describes a phenomenon, people limited their analysis to samples of that data.", "There are many ways how you can extract samples with the idea to represent the entire dataset as close as possible. Even though you can approximate on this, you will never achieve an 100% correct representation.", "From the analysis perspective, in Big Data we want to have a full grasp of what is going on. We want to consider every single data point during the analysis. From here, derives another definition.", "Big Data is about considering the entire dataset rather than a sample of it when applying analysis.", "Sure, big data analysis is more aims more at extracting general directions (i.e., patterns) rather than accurate results, but this doesn\u2019t nullify the fact that it\u2019s better to consider single data point than skip.", "Whenever explaining what Big Data is, sum up everything at the end by mentioning the tech developments that directly impact what we know as Big Data. Cloud, IoT and recently 5G, all are big factors that enforce or relax the meaning behind Big Data.", "Cloud in one side is a big factor in relaxing Big Data challenges. The benefits that come out of it, especially elasticity of resources (\u2018infinite\u2019 amount of resources for your needs) help enormously on easing the burden of dealing with Big Bata.", "IoT and recently 5G on the other side are constantly presenting Big Data challenges. More data is generated and transmitted at higher speed that ever before. These tech factors going head to head with one another ensure that Big Data is here to stay for a long time.", "Big Data is a term that encompasses various meanings. Breaking up the answer in the parts mentioned above and explaining them, not only provides a better understanding of what Big Data really is, but ensures that you have also done an out-of-the-box thinking around it.", "Your home for data science.
