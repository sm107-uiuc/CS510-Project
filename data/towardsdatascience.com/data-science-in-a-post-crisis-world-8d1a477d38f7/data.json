I started to learn R and databases, built a cluster with used Pentium IIIs for parallel computing, and read introductory machine learning literature. Everything feels just like yesterday, yet forever ago. I have been lucky, and couldn\u2019t have remotely imagined what I would be doing with data, science and computing years later. The last few years may have been some of the best times to be part of this technological and methodological evolution; the tooling has never been better, the data has never been richer, and the career outlook has never been more promising. The term Data Science can be found everywhere, from the prestigious FLAG/FANG to a burgeoning five person start-ups. Suddenly it felt like we have all the knowledge and tools to fix cancer, poverty and all kinds of social and political issues, sitting in autonomous cars and fly to the moon.", "Turned out, only the last aspiration may be happening soon. The beginning of 2020 was a series of wake up calls. The pandemic devastated the world in merely weeks, followed up by massive quarantines, shutdowns and social movements and unrests. With the economic engine\u2019s fuel supply cut off, companies resorted to all means for survival. Probably contradictory to traditional belief that technical roles are relatively more resilient to economic crisis, data science departments, unfortunately, found themselves subject to downsizing quite early on. There\u2019s the pandemic to blame, but probably not all the layoffs; restructuring and consolidations are knee-jerk reactions. Part of this process may be an acceleration of an overdue leaning \u2014 when companies are thinking about how to embrace the storm and prepare for recovery, a disproportionally large data science team may be considered less-essential.", "So why, it only took a few months for data science from a premium, Sexiest Job of the 21st century, to be regarded as less essential within the business? Let\u2019s have an in-depth discussion. Also note that I will use the term data science to cover more technical areas, such as machine learning, statistical learning, causal inference, AI, for convenience. This DOESN\u2019T cover basic analysis, reporting, data engineering, or business intelligence since such functions are generally required across the board. Not differentiating may make my two-cents overly broad and not covering all the nuances, so please bear with me.", "Data Science is not magic and could not create value from a vacuum, though some people may have believed otherwise. In order for data science to unleash its full potential, there are at least three pre-requisites:", "I will explain these three pre-requisites in detail but assuming my opinions are not too far from the truth, a lot of capabilities need to be in place in order to make data science shine. It\u2019s probably unrealistic to expect the hiring of one renowned researcher to be the chief data scientist and immediately generate a return. Moreover, such a high calibre team may not even be a necessity to the business.", "So without further ado, let\u2019s discuss the three pre-requisites in detail.", "This may not be self-evident at the beginning since the majority of the world economy has been in some form of growth or hyper growth in the past five years, so we haven\u2019t been able to observe the counterfactual: how data science would\u2019ve functioned when business were shrinking. The past few months showed that very few are interested in slowing the bleeding; leveraging data to reduce week over week growth from -20% to -10% is probably not laudable. When the downturn starts, drastic strategies need to be implemented, such as pausing certain product offerings, distributing oversized discounts, adopting strong retention and reactivation measures, pivoting to a new revenue stream, etc. Since such strategies were hardly executed before (even if they did, it might have been considered as outliers), past learnings can hardly predict the future outcome, not to mention the second order effect resulted from concurrent movements with other players in the market. The net result is that the value of data science may diminish rapidly.", "Companies may also realize that such instability in strategy and market may extend long enough in the recovery phase, hence a comprehensive data science/machine learning team may not be critically needed for months or years to come. On the other hand, if the business is growing at 20% month over month, it would be arguably better to invest into expanding product features, strengthening engineering infrastructure, even scaling up logistics and customer service to further boost growth, rather than investing heavily into state of the art data science to improve the status quo. Simple eyeballing analytics and modeling may just suffice. For example, strategically it may be a much better option to invest the next 1MM to expand service to a new city in the next 6 months, rather than expanding the current data science team which may or may not bringing in the same return from optimizing business in the existing cities. Another point to note is, with the recent boom in data science and oversupply of talents, companies may be confident that the risk of downsizing data science department is low. Even though top talents still come with a hefty premium, it may not be too challenging to rebuild a capable team relatively quickly from scratch.", "Now we have seen that the business may not need a large data science presence during and immediately after the crisis. What\u2019s the best scenario for data science to function then? I reason the business may need to be:", "The business and product offerings also need to have enough complexity such that the opportunities are not intuitive to naked eyes but can only be discovered through complex data analysis and modeling. If a merchant is only selling one product online to customers, then there may not be much data science magic to cast. A three-sided online market place with sellers, goods and buyers is where an algorithm can truly outperform simple rule systems with considerable margin, albeit with diminishing returns. The first algorithm may outperform a simple rule by double digits, say, 10\u201320%, but the subsequent improvements will likely be much smaller, typically under 5% comparing with status quo, at the cost of increasingly complexity and scalability/maintenance challenges. If you check any of the Kaggle competition, the baseline is usually a random forest or xgboost model, with the winning solution typically a blend of hundreds of models, incorporating external data and many rounds of careful tweaking. The performance difference however, may not be materially meaningful business wise. A heavy commitment into the data science function is sometimes a front-loading investment for the ever growing scale and complexity of the business, hence the growth component is part of the assumption of the investment.", "Maybe the only logical reason to implement such a very complex methodology to realize less than 5% of the incremental gain, is that the 5% incremental has to be material enough to the business considering all the associated direct and opportunity cost. This implies that the baseline revenue, or whatever proxy metrics, such as daily active user, need to be massive. Even with 100MM annual revenue, a 5% incremental of 5MM may only be just breaking even for the cost of expanding a 20 people strong data science team, and there\u2019s no guarantee that such incrementality can be realized in the subsequent years. The baseline may need to be in the billions, in which case only leaves a few big players (Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Google, Tencent, Alibaba, etc) in the arena. For smaller companies, investing into engineering, sales, marketing and analytics rather than tech heavy data science may bring much better return in the short term. I have talked with quite a few companies in the past in very early stages (<10 people), with business and product in early development, ambitiously planning to build up a data science/machine learning function. It\u2019s just way too early, and the team is more likely to be used as a token to lure investors rather than doing meaningful work. They may spend most of the time doing ad hoc analysis to respond to leadership curiosities or building up data pipelines. Not to say these are not critical tasks, but these are not the optimal way of using such hires.", "As you may already feel, data science is a rather delicate organism that requires a nuanced business nutrients to survive. It requires even more internal and external factors to thrive; read further.", "One notable difference between academia and industry is whether a good research on paper can actually be implemented in a production environment within reasonable time, and with clearly measurable outcome. To make this happen, the leadership has to 1) understand the data science product end to end, what it can do and what it can\u2019t, and all the associated risks, biases and pitfalls; 2) champion data-informed thinking and decision making at all levels, and offer data science a valid voice on the table; 3) respect the objectivity of data; not weaponizing data science for arguments by fishing for favorable signals. These may seem straightforward but can be actually hard to do consistently in reality.", "The first ingredient of success is for leaders to understand data science: how data are collected, compiled and distilled; what are the sampling biases; what were captured and more importantly, what were NOT captured; how analysis and modeling were done and what were the assumptions, trade-offs, etc. If a data scientist analyzed an experiment and reported back a new feature may increase user engagement by 1%, there\u2019re typically a lot of assumptions came with this claim. Such assumptions are usually lost in discussions, email chains and summaries, resulting in reduced fidelity with larger broadcasting radius. A few degrees of separation later folks may interpret an estimate as a fact, confound the results of a regional experiment to a global experiment, make erroneous extrapolations, cite such numbers in the wrong context to support certain arguments, etc. The leaders need to be aware and promote the correct interpretation and usage of data science research, and course correct whenever necessary, sometimes even to step in and manage the narrative. Otherwise misunderstanding could occur rapidly which would tarnish the credibility of data science orgs.", "The second ingredient is to offer data science the right size of voice. In the past, I have witnessed both cases where data scientists hold discoveries from data as the ultimate truth to invalidate arguments from others, and cases where data scientists were sitting at the end of decision making table to cast a nominal vote. Neither of these scenarios are healthy. Ideally, data science should bring in independent, objective(to the most possible extent) and orthogonal view to the problems being discussed, with an equal voice to other parties such as engineers, designers, consumer insights, finances, etc. Too much reliance on data may fall victim of data fallacies such as sampling bias \u2014 what was believed as an objective delineation of the world may actually not be representative. Nominal reliance on data would render the data science team powerless. The balance is hard to strike but certainly can be done.", "The third ingredient is to maintain the objectivity of the data science by not coercing only favorable discoveries. It\u2019s often not difficult to fish for expected outcome from complex and rich data sets, to bubble up certain features in the feature selection process or fabricate correlations. It is tempting for the leaders to find additional assurance for a decision from the data science function. Some may even believe reporting only the favorable discoveries and hide the test is not necessarily lying. The leaders need to be aware and course correct as soon as possible, as this can be extremely damaging not only to the data science function both internally and externally, but also to all the collaborators. The leaders should make it clear and lead by example that this is a redline that should never be crossed.", "Even with all these prerequisites met, a mature engineering platform is a must-have for effective data science execution. It\u2019s not uncommon for engineering capabilities associated with data science, such as data platforms, auditing, model deployment, experiment toolkits, etc., to be constantly de-prioritized to make room for more critical product feature development. As a result, there can often be a gap between data science research and deployment. The data science team may compile some data, run R&D offline, and come back with a model that could potentially drive substantial business impact. Unfortunately, due to lack of infra-development, it may take a good 3\u20136 months to even make it possible to deploy. By the time deployment was ready, the entire business may have shifted, which could have rendered the prior research irrelevant. Because data science product depends on so many moving pieces, a mature platform that resolves data ingestion, compilation, model deployment, scalability, product integration is critical to allow data science teams to self-serve. Otherwise, the data science team will have no choice but to wait on many other teams to pave ways before anything can be delivered. For this to happen, it will require not only a strong data-savvy leadership, but also a company of adequate scale so resources can be set aside to invest in developing such capabilities. Smaller players usually don\u2019t have such luxury thus have to continue to rely on less ideal and more ad hoc solutions.", "So now you may ask \u2014 are we there yet? There can still be a missing component \u2014 a strong ground level operations team that can execute the strategy and deliver. Imagine a customer service optimization tool like Uber\u2019s COTA that involves humans in the loop: the CS agents need to be well-trained to use the tool to realize its value. Warehouse optimization models may assume the workers can restock and ship goods at a certain velocity, which may or may not be true in reality (and it may add pressure and stress to people on the ground). It\u2019s not uncommon to have huge discrepancies between expected and realized incremental return from data science products, and it can be non-trivial to debug the whole life-cycle. Every piece has to function flawlessly, in this sense data science is indeed a parallel to rocket science.", "The series of crisis and the underperformance and burst of recent unicorns served a cold bucket of water to quench the frenzy of chasing growth at all costs. Investors will likely to be more conservative, and profitability instead of revenue / active user base might now return as the key metric. The hoarding of data science talents will probably cool down \u2014 a few years ago it\u2019s almost a must-have to attract investors, because of FOMO, lack of talent supplies, and the grand vision what data science could achieve in capital return. The hot pursuit from the employers attracted many professionals to convert to data science, and with the plethora of data science programs and training camps, there have been a building up of talent supplies. Inevitably, this will lead to higher bars of entry and correction of data science market.", "I remember a few years ago, I visited Kansas city and talked with a local. I vaguely remember a story of the rise and fall of a town there (I could be wrong about the details). As the auto industry was very hot, one of the manufacturers built a hub to train workers of a specific skill, and guaranteed employment. Many swarmed there for the career prospect, but the whole program faltered only within a few years due to oversupplies. Now the data science market is taking a similar, albeit less grave path. I have talked to some folks at a bootcamp, and while they were pretty happy with the model they just built which could tell cats from dogs and quite impressed by how much they have achieved in just a couple of hours, many had little idea what they were doing, and why a cat/dog model is meaningful in any context. The false impression that Data Science is so easy that anyone can do it, compounded by the perception that it\u2019s one of the best jobs in this decade, may make people rush to decisions en masse to abandon their current profession and speed-train themselves, only to find later that what they have learned already become obsolete and they have to compete with many others who have went through similar speed-training process.", "What does this mean for data science in the next few years post-crisis? I think it will continue to thrive, but in a different fashion. Companies which survive the crisis will be ready to recover, and many disruptive ones will emerge in the new frontiers, especially healthcare and education. Tools will continue to be better, with more automation and scalability. Data science will be further democratized, but becomes even more polarized \u2014 anyone can get started really quickly, but emerging to the top will take a lot more work. It will require a good mix of technical knowledge, practical experience, domain knowledge, engineering skills, communications, business sense, strategic vision, and last but not the least, some good luck, to truly excel.", "As a fan of Professor Scott Galloway\u2019s Pivot, I would like to be a shameless copycat and make some predictions myself. This is what I do after all; what\u2019s different this time is that I may not have a lot of data to substantiate my intuition.", "One of the appealing part of data science to me, is that the future is not set in stone. It\u2019s a new, fast evolving domain with a lot of uncertainty. It\u2019s stressful, but also super exciting since each one of us may have a way of carving out trajectories of our own. Nevertheless, uncertainty is a natural fabric of us whose job is to make predictions.", "Your home for data science.
