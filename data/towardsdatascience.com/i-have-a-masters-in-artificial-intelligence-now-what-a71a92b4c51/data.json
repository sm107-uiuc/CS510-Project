Falling into the latter category, here are some expectations versus realities that I soon came to realise. (Do note that these apply to the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and may also differ from the reader in terms of geography)", "Expectation: I will be well equipped with the skillsets I need to break into the field of study (Artificial Intelligence).", "Reality: The truth is far from it. In the field of AI, practical application is key. Companies that hire AI/Machine Learning (ML) engineers or Data Scientists want to know that you have adequate experience in terms of applying theoretical models onto real-life datasets. Having a Masters in AI builds up a strong foundation of the theoretical knowledge underlying the various ML models, but more often than not does not translate to real-life application.", "Does that mean that it would be impossible for someone without experience to break into AI? Not at all \u2014 employers often look out for involvement in Kaggle competitions and also activity level on Github and use these as a proxy to gauge your level of interest in the field. Being able to take what you have learnt in the classroom and applying it on any real-life application is valuable in the eyes of the employer. For example, if I learnt about (Deep) Q-learning in class, building a bot that learns how to play an Atari game or Pac-man would already be a huge win.", "Takeaway: Always apply what you learnt in the classroom. Nobody is going to believe you are capable of the job just because you have a Masters.", "Expectation: I am interested in becoming a Data Scientist, hence my focus should be on building the best models with high accuracy. Code efficiency and knowing how to build ML pipelines are of secondary importance.", "Reality: In the field of AI, talent is scarce. There are more companies that want to build up a team of Data Engineers, Data Analysts and Data Scientists than there is supply of them out there in the market. As a result, you will almost always be expected to do more than your job title would allow you to. Not to mention, having that suite of skillsets under your belt will make you more flexible in your job hunt.", "Also, inevitably, companies from certain industries are bound to be quicker in terms of AI adoption. E-commerce, technology and even healthcare companies have benefitted greatly from AI and while industries like Finance have a lot to gain as well, it is undoubtedly slower in adoption due to financial regulation. Understanding the stage at which a company is at in terms of AI adoption is crucial as it would give you a strong sense as to how much each team member would be expected to contribute to the ML stack.", "The size of the teams is also a strong indication of how segregated each member\u2019s duties are. Generally, the larger the teams, the more segregated the job tasks would be, and vice versa. To understand this, imagine a company starting out in their AI adoption. They would want to hire someone with lots of relevant experience and able to build and deploy models from start to finish. On the contrary, huge tech companies like Facebook and Google would probably have individual teams for each job function.", "Takeaway: Learn all the other skills that you need to be able to deploy a ML model from front to back.", "Expectation: I should apply to huge tech companies like FANG to get the best learning since they are the leaders in this field.", "Reality: While large tech companies like FANG are attractive because of their pay packages and their reputation, it is often extremely hard to get into one. I for one have not worked in any of the FANG companies, but I would imagine that working with a group of highly intelligent people with similar interests would be an ideal place for learning.", "What else can I settle for then? It really depends on the industry you are interested in and what you would like to learn. If you are someone who is interested in computer vision, find companies that are huge in that area and one whose mission and vision resonates with you. In this day and age of AI, it is all about creating value and making life a whole lot easier to the consumer. Find a company that relates to you and one that you would like to add value to.", "If you\u2019re like me who is more focused on learning the skillsets that I need, then the company that you\u2019re applying to should not matter too much. It should be the job scope that you should be scrutinising. It should be an area of your interest where you can fulfil most of the job requirements, yet also learn new things on daily basis. That to me, is where learning and job satisfaction thrives.", "Takeaway: Focus on what you would like to learn, instead of the company you are applying for.", "Have some thoughts?
