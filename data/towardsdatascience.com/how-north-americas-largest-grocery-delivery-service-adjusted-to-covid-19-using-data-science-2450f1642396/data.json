During the time of a global pandemic more consumers have used online alternatives to the standard grocery shopping. Stores are offering online order placement and pick up. Delivery services are at an all time high. I was curious to find out how Instacart\u2019s data science team has adapted their program and tackled challenges they originally presented in 2019.", "Based on a talk by Ishant Nayer, Senior Data Scientist at Instacart, watch the full video on DSSInsider and join me at the DSS Retail/Ecomm virtual experience.", "Instacart is a retail and ecommerce company that offers grocery delivery and pick up services in the United States and Canada. You can utilize the service via their mobile app or website. Instacart operates as a four sided marketplace serving customers, retailers, third party marketplaces and the shoppers. You can select a variety of grocery, alcohol, healthcare and personal items.", "The catalog is ingesting and creating all of the data for items available for customers. The catalog of data consists of over half a billion items from over 300 different retailers in 20,000 stores across North America. This is a huge data set to deal with and keep clean every day. Each of these items has about twenty to thirty different attributes on it, for example, price, size and location. The catalog becomes a very complex data set at scale with all of the attributes factored in. There are two main categories of attributes to organize. This data comes from retailers, CPG manufacturers and third party aggregators.", "Store Specific Attributes: product price, availability, inventory", "Product Specific Attributes: images, location, weight, size, if it is sold by units or pounds, nutrition information", "What can go wrong? Sometimes with all these complex data sets there are issues like product descriptions not matching the images, no images or products in wrong categories.", "It\u2019s impossible to have someone sitting in front of the computer 24/7 to try and catch every error. Algorithms are required to catch these issues regularly on a daily basis. There are at least 10\u201315 algorithms set up for each product attribute. Instacart also uses defined heuristics that will tell the team what the inaccuracies are. The team defines what can be wrong, then develops the source of truth in the data and sets up checks for products to go through.", "To help with product conversions the team also needs to make sure that images are high quality, accurately defined by regional measuring standards, listed in proper units for sale and properly named with brands. Image detection models are being developed to fix images and help improve our retailers data sources of truth. This will be able to pull text, brand names, nutritional information and product descriptions from images. When able to scale this solution, it will improve our data quality and ripple out to other technology aspects of the business.", "Q: How did Instacart adapt overall to serve their customers during COVID?", "Ishant: Instacart has adapted really well to consumer demands during COVID times. They have onboarded new retailers which meant adding millions of new items to their catalog. Instacart\u2019s main proposition comes from the fact that they allow retailers to add any item with any type of information and they would use their catalog system to process those items to fit Instacart\u2019s requirements. The hard part was already over last year as discussed in my talk topic above. From now on, it\u2019s only about adding new retailers with automation. Due to the restrictions of COVID, many people started using Instacart for their grocery needs and Instacart delivered quickly on those increased user demands.", "Q: How can leaders leverage data as a tool to tackle challenges during COVID?", "Ishant: COVID changed many trends in shopping, real estate buying, streaming and many more industries. For leaders, listening to customers is very important and data is one of the best resources to do so. Key performance indicators (KPI\u2019s) are a set of metrics that leaders closely follow to understand the health of their business. From what I have seen so far in my professional experience as a Data Scientist, every leader checks the daily report on their business metrics and forecasted trends to understand where they are and what to do next. During COVID, regularly listening to your analytics teams and their insights is one of things a leader must do to stay on top of their game. This would help them manage resources, operations and see where the company should focus on next. For Instacart, data helped them understand how many people they would need to hire in order to meet the rising demand.", "Q: As a Data Scientist, how have you seen management of complex data sets change during COVID?", "Ishant: Management of data sets always change and adapt to current conditions. That is their basic law. Many companies changed their strategies to fit customers\u2019 needs during COVID. This means that models and datasets are constantly changing to stay current and continuously provide what customers are asking for now.", "COVID-19 has changed shopping behavior and the number of online orders has significantly increased in the past months. Leveraging data science, Instacart was able to scale its delivery services and adapt to an increasing number of online purchases, without compromising service quality. The alorithms Instacart has in place are able to detect errors in product descriptions or wrong categorizations of products in the online catalog, preventing analytics teams from spending tedious working hours on manual error detection and allowing them to focus on gaining valuable insights for better decision making and essentially improving the overall customer experience.", "Your home for data science.
