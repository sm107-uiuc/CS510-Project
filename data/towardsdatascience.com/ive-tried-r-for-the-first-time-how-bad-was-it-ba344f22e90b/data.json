Just take a look at my profile and you\u2019ll find over 100 articles on Python itself, or Python in data science. Lately, I\u2019ve been trying out a lot of new languages and technologies, with R being the one I resisted the most. Below you\u2019ll find my discoveries, comparisons with Python, and overall opinion on the language itself.", "The biggest reason I\u2019ve ignored R for so long is the lack of information on the language. Everyone I know who used it presented it strictly as a statistical language. Statistics is essential for data science, but what\u2019s the point of building a model if you can\u2019t present it \u2014 through a dashboard \u2014 and deploy it \u2014 as a REST API?", "Those were my thoughts up to recently, but since then I discovered Shiny and Plumber, which basically solve the issues I had with R in the first place. That being said, there\u2019s no point in avoiding the language anymore, and this article is the first of many in the R series.", "Today we\u2019ll compare R and Python in the process of exploratory data analysis and data visualization, both through code and through final outputs. I\u2019m heavily Python-biased, but my conclusions may still surprise you. Keep reading to find out.", "Anyhow, let\u2019s start with the comparisons, shall we?", "EDA is where data scientists spend the majority of their time, so an easy-to-write and easy-to-understand language is a must. I\u2019m using external libraries in both languages \u2014 Pandas in Python and Tidyverse in R.", "We\u2019ll use the MPG dataset for this article. It\u2019s built into R, but there isn\u2019t the same dataset in Python. To accommodate, I\u2019ve exported the dataset from R as a CSV so we can start clean with both languages.", "Here\u2019s how to read CSV file with R:", "The head function is used in R to see the first 6 rows, and the end result looks like this:", "Let\u2019s do the same with Python:", "Great! Looks like we have an extra column \u2014 X in R and Unnamed: 0 in Python, so let\u2019s remove those next.", "Here\u2019s how to remove the unwanted X column in R:", "Specifying column names like variables (without quotation marks) is not something I\u2019m most comfortable with, but it is what it is.", "Let\u2019s continue with something a bit more interesting \u2014 data filtering or subsetting. We\u2019ll see how to select only those records where the number of cylinders cyl is 6.", "Keep in mind that head function is only here so we don\u2019t get a ton of output in the console. It is not part of the data filtering process.", "Awesome! Let\u2019s see what more can we do.", "We\u2019ll create a boolean attribute is_newer, which is True if the car was made in 2005 or after, and False otherwise.", "And here\u2019s the same thing with Python:", "And that\u2019s it for the EDA. Let\u2019s make a brief conclusion on it next.", "It\u2019s hard to pick a winner here since both languages are great. I repeat, it\u2019s very strange for me not to put quotation marks around the column names, but that\u2019s just something I\u2019ll have to get used to.", "Furthermore, I absolutely love the easiness of chaining things in R. Here\u2019s an example:", "Here we basically did everything from above and more, all in a single command. Let\u2019s proceed with the data visualization part.", "When it comes to data visualization, one thing is certain \u2014 Python doesn\u2019t stand a chance! Well, at least if we\u2019re talking about the default options for both languages. The following libraries were used for this comparison:", "Let\u2019s start with a simple scatter plot of engine displacement on the X-axis and highway MPG on the Y-axis.", "Here\u2019s the R syntax and results:", "Neither of these looks particularly good out of the box, but R is miles ahead in this department, at least with the default styles.", "Let\u2019s now add some colors. The points should be colored according to the class attribute, so we can easily know where each type of car is located.", "Here\u2019s the syntax and result for R:", "It doesn\u2019t get much easier than that, and the Python example below is a clear indicator. I haven\u2019t managed to find an easy way to map out a categorical variable as colors (at least with Matplotlib), so here\u2019s what I ended up with:", "All of that work for a not-so-appealing chart. Point for R.", "Let\u2019s now finalize the chart by adding a title and labels for axes. Here\u2019s how to do it in R:", "Again, fairly straightforward syntax, and the chart looks amazing (well, kind of).", "Here\u2019s how to do the same with Python:", "It\u2019s up to you to decide which looks better, but R is a clear winner in my opinion. Visualizations can be tweaked, of course, but I deliberately wanted to use the default libraries for both languages. I know that Seaborn looks better, there\u2019s no point in telling me that in the comment section.", "And that about does it for this article. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "This was a rather quick comparison of R and Python in the realm of data science. Choosing one over the other isn\u2019t a simple task, as both are great. Among the two, Python is considered to be a general-purpose language, so it\u2019s the only viable option if you want to build software with data science, and not work directly in data science.", "You can\u2019t go wrong with either \u2014 especially now when I know that R supports dashboards, web scraping, and API development. More articles like this one are to come, guaranteed.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
