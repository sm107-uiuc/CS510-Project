This short article\u2019s been designed to give you some unconventional advice about how to pass your job interview.", "For those who don\u2019t know, the interview process for software developers or engineers is divided into two parts: your personal interview \u2014 to find one about your type of personality, to make sure you are a right fit for the team and the second interview \u2014 problem solving interview \u2014 where you\u2019ll get a couple of tech questions which you need to solve.", "To get a job you need to ace in both interviews. No matter how talented you are as a programmer, many companies will likely not hire you if you are a shitty person and either insult your interviewer or convey markers that you are difficult to work with. In contrast, if you are a people person with golden liquid light levels of charisma, but no technical chops, then that\u2019s also a nonstarter. You ideally want to land somewhere in the middle. So where do you begin, and how do you address this?", "People love talking about themselves. Ask questions during the interview to unlock this behavioral trait. Also, use your questions to help you determine if the role is a good match for what you are looking for. Maybe you are looking to get paid upwards of 250K but also sleep 5 hours a night and always be on call. Or maybe you are looking for work life balance, and want to have a predictable routine due to other important obligations. Both are fine. And both can be addressed by very different companies or very different teams.", "In my personal experience, learning how to perform a specific task and learning the key problem solving techniques to ace the coding interview are available online and abundantly present. In fact, companies like OutCo teach software engineers how to specifically solve these types of algorithms. There are also fantastic resources out there, including Gayle Laackman McDowell\u2019s famous book well known among aspiring SWEs, Cracking the Coding Interview.", "In my personal opinion, I think skills are learnable. In general, most people can learn a new skill given adequate preparation, clarity, and concentration. It usually is harder for people to radically transform their personality overnight, or requires more deep, inner work.", "I remember I interviewed two guys for an ML engineer position: both finished great schools and had a very similar resume. But one of them was really unpleasant and challenged everything we said. and the other one was inquisitive, also challenged us but in a polite manner, and could have a conversation outside of just talking shop.", "So the job went the second guy, because the company that I worked before was hiring not purely for aptitude, but also for an ability to work well with the team he would be assigned to. So\u2026 You never know. So how do you ace, or prepare for this part of the interview?", "Uncover the company profile, do some research to find out what are they looking for. Finding information about the specific people who will be interviewing you is even better.", "Unfortunately, many people who want to get a job as a software developer/engineer simply does not have the proper qualifications. You can finish MIT, UIUC, Carnegie Mellon or Harvard but if you can\u2019t recognize when to use Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm or how to implement a variation of it, then you\u2019re straight outta luck.", "You also, do not need to go to a brand-name school to learn how to become a great software engineer. I\u2019ve met people learning how to code while they work as food caterers for their survival job. I\u2019ve met Palo Alto housewives who have three kids and have decided that they want a career change. I\u2019ve even met people who didn\u2019t even go to a traditional college or 4-year university, and some of them are the most authentic and brilliant engineers and engineering managers that I know.", "So what do we actually look for during the coding interview? Well, this leads to\u2026", "Before you just dive into the code, think about writing out or diagramming your code. Now I know, I know, some of you are like, \u201cNo I want to show that I can get my feet dirty!\u201d Well, let me tell you. If you just take one moment and really read through the problem, you might catch or miss a critical feature that you looked over because of our human tendency towards heuristics and mental shortcuts.", "Practically speaking, if you are using something like CodePad, then write out some comments or skeleton code to outline your thinking process, so your interviewer knows how you\u2019re thinking. It also helps a benevolent interviewer to lightly guide you in the right direction if you seem to be veering off course.", "I can\u2019t help you if I don\u2019t know where you\u2019re trying to go.", "In other words, make sure to map out your thought process before you start diving into the code. At the very least, try to break down the problem first and share with us your general approach BEFORE you begin writing code.", "This leads us to one of our most critical points.", "Of course, in an ideal setting, we want to see you write up a working and preferably time-optimized solution. However, situations are usually not ideal and you may not arrive at a working solution in time. Would you consider that a fail? Maybe.", "But on our end, that is not always a fail. In fact, what is more important is how you communicate your THINKING. Telepathy isn\u2019t accessible to everyone yet, so a regular interviewer can\u2019t just intuit exactly what you\u2019re thinking while solving a problem.", "Now, I\u2019m not telling you to talk after every line that you write. That would actually be a little unnerving\u2026 I don\u2019t want you to become a Chatty Kathy, and then talk so much that you never finish solving the problem.", "However, sometimes communicating your intention and your thought process will provide us, the recruiters, with a signal about how you think. It can also provide YOU a signal. In particular, neuroscience research reveals that when we turn the sub-vocalization process (mental talk) into externalized vocalization (speak talk), people actually arrive at a solution faster.", "Another productivity or leadership method to practice this that many people employ is called rubber ducking. In other words, TALK. Use spoken speech as a tool to convey where you are in the problem solving process. If you\u2019re about to think through something, give us a signal to know that you will explore such a solution. This practical tip may seem superficially basic, but you will be surprised at how often I get people who feel very uncomfortable speaking about their approach or their thinking process when they\u2019re under pressure. This is where mock interviews with friends (or strangers), can really come in handy.", "Remember, if you know the solution but can\u2019t explain your logic \u2014 the interview is over for you. Recruiters want to see how your brain works. You can fail to arrive at a perfect solution, but if you can explain your solution and code up a solution that\u2019s 80% there, you may still \u201cpass,\u201d depending on the company and the leniency of the interviewer.", "Remember folks. As a software engineer, you are being hired to THINK about software. And while the final deliverable is working code, we also need to discover a way to assess how you THINK. And like I said at the beginning, I can\u2019t guess what you\u2019re thinking if you don\u2019t speak.", "Also, I recommend practicing algorithms daily. In one of my other videos, I mention doing code katas. This is one way to do it! Give yourself some time pressure, and hop onto a website like HackerRank and solve one of their algorithms.", "You know how they sometimes say, An apple a day keeps the doctor away? Well, sometimes I like to say, A kata a day keeps confusion at bay!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Machine learning engineer equally excited about understanding minds, both human and AI.
