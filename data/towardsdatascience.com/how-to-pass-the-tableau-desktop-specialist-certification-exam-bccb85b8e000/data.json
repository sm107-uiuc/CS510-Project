No, I\u2019m not a power user \u2014 I\u2019ve only used Tableau for a few months to create some dashboards at work. So if I can do it, you can too! This is my experience preparing for and taking the exam, which I hope will help you succeed as well.", "The Tableau Desktop Specialist Certification tests foundational product knowledge. It is the easiest level of certification that Tableau offers and has no expiration date, unlike the more advanced certifications that are only valid for two or three years.", "The exam is 60 minutes in length with 45 multiple-choice questions (40 scored, 5 unscored). You\u2019ll need to score above 750 out of 1000 to pass and all of the questions are knowledge-based (there used to be hands-on questions using Tableau, but those have since been removed). It is proctored, without access to the internet or to the Tableau application.", "The exam usually costs $100 USD. Once you pay for it, you can schedule it for up to 6 months in the future. I\u2019d recommend scheduling your exam in advance as timeslots can fill up quickly. You can always reschedule for free up to 24 hours before your exam time if needed. Loyalist Exam Services (LES) manages the exam, so you\u2019ll need to create an LES account to register.", "Suggested training is Tableau\u2019s Desktop I: Fundamentals course, which is available through their eLearning platform (more on this below). 3+ months of product experience is also suggested, though in my opinion you can take it whenever you\u2019re comfortable with all the topics in the Exam Prep Guide.", "Whether you\u2019re a business analyst, data analyst, job seeker, or student, getting certified is a great way to demonstrate your proficiency in Tableau \u2014 a widely-used tool for data visualization and business intelligence.", "More significantly, studying for this exam gives you a comprehensive understanding of Tableau. I can confidently say that preparing for this exam has strengthened my knowledge of Tableau and enables me to now create vizzes with much more ease.", "This official document includes information on the exam, skills measured, and some sample questions. I used the skills measured as a checklist of all the topics I needed to study.", "Tableau eLearning has self-paced learning modules, with a demo and interactive activity for each topic. It\u2019s the primary resource I used to study. However, I found that the suggested Desktop I: Fundamentals course covered most but not all skills listed on the Exam Prep Guide. The following skills were actually in the Desktop II: Intermediate course \u2014 data connections (adding a join, blend, or union), creating a set, adding a context filter, using bins and histograms, and adding a parameter. So, I took the intermediate level course as well to complete my understanding \u2014 though you can take just the relevant modules if you wish. I recommend that you take notes while watching the demos, capturing important concepts such as the difference between discrete and continuous fields. I also found it helpful to redo the exercises for review.", "eLearning costs $10 USD/user/month, billed annually. You\u2019ll also need a personal or professional Tableau Desktop license to access the .twbx activity files. If you\u2019re a working professional, it\u2019s worth asking your employer if they can cover the costs of your training, platform, and certification. If you\u2019re a student then you\u2019re in luck \u2014 you can get a year\u2019s free access to both Tableau eLearning and Desktop with a valid university email.", "This website by Lukas Halim offers free practice quizzes. I did all three Specialist quizzes and a selection of the Certified Associate quizzes for a challenge (don\u2019t worry if you can\u2019t complete all the CA quizzes as they\u2019re meant for the next level of certification). There are also Tableau Specialist Practice Exams available for a nominal fee.", "Overall, I found the exam to be extremely straightforward. Once you submit your exam, you\u2019ll receive your results immediately. Your certification and detailed scores will also be sent to your email.", "My biggest piece of advice is to become thoroughly familiar with all the topics in the Exam Prep Guide, as it is a multiple-choice exam without access to the Tableau Platform, the internet, or any other outside application. Knowing the steps for how to get to a certain type of visualization by heart is the key to completing the exam in a timely manner. Not only will this help you pass, but it will pay dividends in the workplace by enabling you to use Tableau more efficiently and effectively.", "I hope you\u2019ve found this post helpful, and good luck on your exam and Tableau journey!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Consultant with an affinity for data and design"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
