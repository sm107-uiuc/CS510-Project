Schools, universities, shops, bars, restaurants and other recreational facilities are closed for the next couple of weeks in many countries around the world. Our movements are more and more restricted with flights and trains being canceled, borders being closed, curfews being discussed and entire lockdowns introduced. All of this is done for good reason, of course: to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.", "It seems our lives are coming to a halt and changing dramatically. And these restrictions are taking a toll on our economy and significantly influencing politics. In this post, I will take a look at some graphs to describe what has already happened to the economy and politics (particularly in the US) and what this may mean for the future. Remember, there is a presidential election coming up in November of this year in the United States.", "Note: This blog post should be considered as an opinion and not as a forecast.", "It is without a doubt a serious threat to the entire world population. This Medium post nicely laid out why we must act today or many people will die and health care systems across the globe will collapse. The growth of new cases is exponential and has been exploding in some countries such as Italy, Iran, South Korea and China. However, the United States, Germany, France, Spain and other countries are only a few days behind the developments of more strongly affected countries.", "Until March 16th, there were more confirmed cases in China than in all other countries combined. However, China\u2019s complete shutdown of public life has helped to flatten the growth rate. And many other countries across all continents are adopting now similar restrictions on its citizens.", "Italy is the country with the second highest number of cases and the growth is still exponential, followed by Iran, Spain, South Korea, and Germany. This graph also shows the difficulties that the Italian health care system has had in dealing with the COVID-19 outbreak. And it is a precursor for other countries that are on the same trajectory as Italy, only a few days behind.", "It has been virtually impossible to miss that there is currently a pandemic going on. And all the updates about COVID-19 have been drowning out anything else that is not related to the pandemic. One of those things being the Democratic primary elections and the campaigns for the general election in November.", "The above graph shows the development of news stories on the topic of COVID-19 and election related news (in the US) published in digital outlets and newspapers in the US. At the end of February, the number of COVID-19 news stories first passed the number of election news stories and this was even before Super Tuesday! Beyond that point, the number of coronavirus news stories exploded.", "What is also interesting is how things being discussed in those news stories changed over time. While in mid-February, the main concerns in the election news stories were the New Hampshire primary, Bernie Sanders, the Democrats and Trump, this shifted in mid March to Trump, Joe Biden and coronavirus. Mid February to mid March also saw in a shift in topics within COVID-19 related news stories. While most stories revolved around stranded cruise ships, the situation in China and the \u201cnew virus\u201d in February, this changed to Trump\u2019s actions being the center of attention in mid March.", "TV news shifted in the same way from covering election related topics (caucuses, primaries, Democratic presidential contenders etc.) with almost 50% of airtime to an increase in coverage of the coronavirus. As of last week, the three major cable news channels (CNN, MSNBC, FOX NEWS) spent close to 20% of their airtime on the virus outbreak.", "Interestingly, FOX News is spending the most time out of all news channels on discussing the outbreak. And unlike the other outlets, FOX News has been far less critical of Trump\u2019s approach to COVID-19. The coverage there may significantly contribute to how Americans of different parties view the threat of the coronavirus (more on this below).", "Not well, to say the least. Compared with the economic recessions and stock losses over the past 35 years, the S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, DAX and Hang Seng Index are just at the beginning of a bear market.", "In terms of the biggest daily losses and gains over the past 35 years for the S&P 500, March 16th, 2020, is second only to Black Monday in 1987. Its third most devastating day was March 12th, 2020. However, because of the uncertainty of and daily updates to the current situation, the losses were almost completely regained the next day, making March 13th, 2020, the day with the third highest gains. What\u2019s even more important: all other dates both on the losses and gains side of the table are amid significant economic downturns, indicating that we might be heading into a longer recession as well.", "Looking more closely at the development over the past 3 months, the overall downward trend for all of these indices starting mid February becomes clear. When plotting the number of confirmed cases and index prices, there is a clear negative correlation.", "China\u2019s large numbers in confirmed cases are overshadowing the development of cases in other countries. After mid February, China managed to flatten its curve. But around that time the S&P 500 and the DAX started their downward path.", "Excluding China shows that in mid February, the cases in South Korea started to rise as well as news about the quarantined cruise ships (the purple, horizontal line emerging at the very bottom of the graph after February 15th) got more and more attention.", "There is a great article on the development of the Dow Jones Index in MarketWatch which shows how long the recovery of the index took after the economy went into recession. It took 25 years to make up for the losses of the Great Depression, 16 years to recover from the economically and politically tumultuous years in the \u201870s and \u201880s and 6 years to regain what was lost during the 2008 financial crisis. Currently, we are still at the beginning of a bear market, so we don\u2019t know when the stock market will turn around and how long it\u2019ll take to regain losses. But regulators assume the downward trend will continue for weeks.", "The Fed cut its rate to close to 0 % on Sunday evening in an attempt to calm investors. However, investors didn\u2019t take this as a sign of confidence. Trading halted at the New York Stock Exchange the next day right after the opening because the S&P 500 fell more than 7%.", "The difference to the financial crisis of 2008 is that we are dealing with a health crisis. Any steps taken by supranational, national and local governments are aimed at avoiding a devastating crash of health care systems around the world. However, in the short- and medium-term, the restrictions immediately affect the bottom line of companies, resulting in lost jobs.", "Countries worldwide are trying to soften the blow with emergency stimulus packages for the economy or even immediate cash payments to its citizens (as announced by the Trump administration). All signs point to a recession. But the question is how long it\u2019ll stay. Some hope there\u2019ll be a fast bounce-back, but there is no certainty. A look at China shows that recovery may take longer than anticipated.", "There are indeed local, state, congressional and presidential elections happening this November in the United States. The democratic presidential primary election was heavily covered in the news, however, attention has been changing towards COVID-19 since end of February. Campaign rallies have been canceled, debates were broadcast without an audience and even primaries in some states have been rescheduled for later dates to avoid further spread of the virus.", "Historically, presidential re-election campaigns during a recession year are tough and chances for re-election of the incumbent decrease when the economy shrinks. This would mean that Trump\u2019s chances to reign another 4 years are decreasing if the economy will go into a drawn out recession spanning multiple months. Jimmy Carter lost his re-election bid in a year that saw a months-long recession, Obama won amid the financial crisis of 2008 and Clinton\u2019s win over George H. W. Bush in 1992 was partially attributed to a recession that ended one and a half years earlier.", "And while the economy is a good predictor of elections, and this article here argues that a recession in the first two quarters of 2020 may lead to Trump losing (accounting for his Electoral College advantage), it may be more complicated in the Trump era to predict the outcome.", "His overall approval ratings have never been great, with numbers in the high 30s to mid 40s. However, they have been stable. Whether he was impeached, publicly decried for his support of white supremacists, or criticized by his own party for the air strike on Soleimani, there was not a lot of change.", "Moreover, these ratings mask the highly partisan divide over his performance. He has a very loyal base, just like there are very loyal Never-Trumpers. This divide can also be observed in the current coronavirus crisis. According to polls conducted during the first week of March and aggregated by FiveThirtyEight, Republicans highly approve of Trump\u2019s measures to combat the outbreak, while Democrats strongly disapprove.", "Also, we saw earlier in the graph depicting coronavirus coverage on TV that FOX News was spending a lot of time covering this topic. But the political commentators on this network have played down fears, showing that the echo chamber isn\u2019t restricted to Facebook. In times of social media, fake news and highly partisan divides, the economy may still be a decisive factor in elections. However, betting all cards on the economy may not necessarily lead to a Democratic presidential contender winning.", "What the above surveys don\u2019t show is how the electoral college will factor into the final election outcome. Moreover, Trump has started to listen to his advisers, like Dr. Anthony Fauci, about how to handle this health crisis. After denying the threat of the virus didn\u2019t work, he is now proposing to flush billions of dollars of cash into the economy to avoid an economic downturn. All of this could factor into how voters ultimately judge Trump\u2019s performance at the ballot in November.", "The ideas drawn from the above graphs and data are of course only one interpretation of the current situation which is very unstable with new, daily-life altering information being released every day. The economy and politics are adapting to the new circumstances created by the coronavirus and it remains to be seen whether the economy will enter a recession, how long and severe it may be and whether this will lead to a change in the White House.", "All graphs and data used in this post can be accessed on my GitHub.", "Do you want to read more, high-quality stories on Medium?
