A more purely proportional method ameliorates these issues.", "As I would recommend to anyone interested in text analysis, I was recently reading through Julia Silge and David Robinson\u2019s excellent book Text Mining with R. In that book they have a chapter on how one can quantify which words are relatively important in a given document using a statistic called \u201cterm frequency-inverse document frequency\u201d (tf-idf). I had of course seen and even used tf-idf prior to reading that chapter, but truth be told I had never really questioned it. I knew it was a simple and powerful tool used in a variety of applications, so I simply went ahead and used it without much thought.", "However, reading that chapter and more carefully considering how it is calculated, I came to realize that there is perhaps more reason to question it than I had previously thought. Indeed, I noticed a pair of rather significant drawbacks that, as I will demonstrate, can meaningfully alter an analysis.", "But before I can get into those drawbacks, I should briefly explain what tf-idf actually aims to measure and how it is calculated.", "The goal of tf-idf is to quantify how uniquely important a word of interest is to a given document within a collection of documents.", "The way it does this is straightforward. It multiplies how often a given word appears in a given document (term frequency) by a measure of how many other documents that word appears in (inverse document frequency). A word that appears often in document A and shows up in few or none of the other documents would earn a high value for that document, while words that are uncommon in document A and/or that appear in many other documents would get a low value for document A.", "Mathematically, this is done by multiplying the term-frequency, the proportion of words in a given document made up by the word of interest, by the inverse document frequency, the natural log of the number of documents in the analysis divided by the number of documents the word of interest appears in.", "As I mentioned above, this is a simple yet powerful tool, and gives generally good estimates of which words define documents in a corpus. However, there are two specific issues with it.", "First, there is what I call the \u201czero value issue\u201d, which stems from the inverse document frequency calculation. By construction, if the word of interest appears in all documents, the tf-idf value will be zero; the ratio of the number of documents in the analysis to the number of documents the word appears in will be one, and the natural log of one is zero. This would suggest that the word is not uniquely important to any given document.", "In many instances this may be reasonable: the idea that if a word appears everywhere it is not unique anywhere seems like a solid heuristic. However, there are cases where this causes meaningful challenges for an analysis and where, in my opinion, the assigned importance is incorrectly low.", "To see how this can be problematic, consider the following scenario. Imagine we have three documents: A, B, and C. Assume we want to get a tf-idf value for the word \u201capple\u201d in document A, and imagine that apple makes up a full 75% of words in that document. If apple appears just once in document B and not at all in document C, the tf-idf value would be rightfully high. However, if apple appeared just once in both document B and C, the tf-idf would fall all the way to zero. Despite the fact that the only change is that apple now appears once more outside of document A, and despite document A being almost completely made up of the word apple, the tf-idf statistic plummets from something relatively high to nothing at all. This is an undesirable feature of the measure both because it suggests that the two cases are far more different than they are and because it suggests that apple is not uniquely important to A even though it clearly is.", "The second drawback, similar to the first, is what I call the \u201cextensive margin issue.\u201d This arises because the inverse document frequency portion of tf-idf does not take into account how often a word appears in other documents (the intensive margin), just whether it appears at all (the extensive margin). This causes it to be overly sensitive when there are changes on the extensive margin and overly resistant to change when there are changes on the intensive margin, even though the latter is arguably more important.", "To see this in action, consider the same setup from above, this time with apple making up 10% of words in document A. If apple did not appear at all in document B, the tf-idf value would be relatively high. However, if it were to appear just a single time in B, the value would plummet dramatically (though not quite to zero so long as it doesn\u2019t appear in C). Despite the two scenarios being almost identical, with the only change being one more outside appearance of apple, the value changes dramatically, all because that change came on the extensive margin (i.e. apple went from being in no outside documents to one). Of course, in practical terms there is little difference between the word apple appearing just once or not at all outside of document A. Yet tf-idf would suggest that the two cases are radically different.", "On the flip side, the tf-idf would not change at all if apple were to go from appearing just once in document B to making up literally 100% of the document\u2019s words. That is, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times the word apple appears in document B, because tf-idf ignores the intensive margin. It only matters whether it appears at all. However, if our goal is to get a measure that indicates relative importance, it is quite critical to distinguish between these scenarios. In the former, apple is relatively important to document A compared to B (only showing up once in B), while in the latter apple is not at all uniquely important fordocument A (at 10% of its words) relative to how important it is for document B (100% of its words). Yet tf-idf sees no difference.", "To recap: the zero value issue means that tf-idf will suddenly plummet to zero if the word of interest appears in all of the outside documents, even if it only appears once in each of them. The extensive margin issue means that tf-idf will differ dramatically when there are minor and relatively unimportant changes on the extensive margin, but will not differ at all when there are changes, even substantial ones, on the intensive margin.", "Proportional importance is my attempt to come up with a measure that similarly tells us whether a given word is both important and unique to a given document, without the drawbacks associated with tf-idf. I will note that it is possible and perhaps even likely something similar or even identical has been done before. I have not seen it personally, but nonetheless I do not claim to be the first to think of a method like this. With that caveat in mind, let me explain the method.", "The idea behind it is simple. To calculate proportional importance for a given word in a given document, I simply look at the proportion of total words in that document made up by the word of interest and subtract the proportion of words outside that document made up by the word of interest.", "That is a bit of a mouthful, so let\u2019s look at an example. Using the same scenario as above, my measure would take the proportion of words in document A made up by apple and subtract from it the proportion of words in B and C made up by apple. So if 50 percent of words in document A were apple, and 20 percent of total words across B and C were apple, the proportional importance for apple in document A would be 0.3 (30 percent). Notice that unlike tf-idf, this measure can go negative. A negative value would simply indicate that the word is more common outside the given document than it is within it.", "This simple measure solves both the zero value issue and the extensive margin issue. For the zero value issue, if apple makes up 50% of document A and appears just once in both B and C, proportional importance will rightly maintain a high value for apple in document A, whereas the value of the tf-idf statistic would be zero.", "For the extensive margin issue, if we hold constant the proportion of words in document A made up by apple, proportional importance will differ very little in a scenario where apple makes up 1% of words in document B compared to one in which apple makes up 0% of words in document B. It will treat those two instances as similar, ignoring minor changes on the extensive margin. On the flip side, again holding the prevalence of apple in document A constant, proportional importance will differ greatly in a scenario where apple makes up 1% of words in document B compared to one in which it makes up 50% of words in document B. Proportional importance will treat those two cases as quite different, taking into account changes on the intensive margin.", "This all seems reasonable in theory, but I wanted to see it in action. To do so, I took a look at the discography of Run the Jewels, a hip hop duo made up of Killer Mike and El-P. The pair have released four albums: Run the Jewels, Run the Jewels 2, Run the Jewels 3, and Run the Jewels 4. I shorten each to \u201cRTJ\u201d and the number.", "To get the data for the analysis, I used the {Rspotify}, {genius}, and {geniusr} packages in R. I then used the {tidytext} package to get this raw data into an analysis-ready \u201ctidy\u201d form. Finally, before beginning the actual analysis itself, I removed so-called \u201cstop words\u201d such as \u201cthe\u201d and \u201cfor\u201d using the SMART, snowball, and onix lexicons.", "Once I had the data ready to go, I started by calculating tf-idf values for each word-album pair using the {tidytext} package. The figure below shows the top ten most uniquely important words by album as measured by tf-idf (some albums have more than 10 words due to ties).", "Fans will recognize that many of the words are driven by particular unique songs in the album (a point to which I hope to return in a future post). For example, the song Sea Legs in Run the Jewels unsurprisingly contains the words sea and legs, words that do not appear in any of the other albums. Thus, both words get high tf-idf scores for that album. A similar pattern appears in RTJ 2 with the words steal and cheat (from the song Lie Cheat Steal) and in RTJ 3 with the word garden (from the song Call Ticketron, in which they sing about performing at Madison Square Garden).", "A separate but similarly interesting pattern is that, compared to previous albums, expressions like \u201coui,\u201d \u201cayy,\u201d and \u201cohh\u201d are particularly important in RTJ 4, their most recent album.", "With these interesting patterns in mind, the next step is to look at what words are listed as important using my measure, proportional importance. Note that I converted the measure from a proportion to a percentage for the figure.", "Some similarities are apparent, with sea and legs appearing for RTJ (though with diminished importance) and garden appearing for RTJ 3. However, there are 21 words not listed as important by tf-idf that my measure suggests are actually among the top ten most important words for the albums.", "Some of these differences are relatively minor. Steal and cheat in RTJ2 and bumaye in RTJ 3 fall off the chart because, while they are indeed unique to their albums, they are actually not all that important to them, each being used between 8 and 9 times. Given this lack of internal importance, my measure discounts them.", "More interesting are the major shifts between measures, which demonstrate how proportional importance improves upon tf-idf.", "One major change that immediately jumped out to me was that while kill did not appear at all in the top ten most important words for RTJ 3 using tf-idf, it was actually ranked as the most important word for the album by proportional importance. This is a dramatic difference indeed. However, a look at the underlying data immediately clarifies why it occurs.", "Kill appears 97 times in RTJ 3, making up almost 3% of all non-stop words in the album. And not only is it important in the album, but it is also relatively unique to it, appearing a full 6 times more in RTJ 3 than in the album it appears in second most frequently (RTJ 2). As a result, it gets a high value for proportional importance.", "However, as we can see in the table, the tf-idf value is actually zero, suggesting the word is not at all unique or important to the album. What gives? It comes down to the zero value issue. Since kill appears at least once in all four albums, the inverse document frequency is zero, and thus the tf-idf score itself is zero. This occurs despite the word being both important in and relatively unique to RTJ 3.", "The same issue with tf-idf occurs for the words \u201chey\u201d in RTJ and \u201crun\u201d in RTJ 2. Like with \u201ckill\u201d, neither of these words are listed as important by tf-idf, but both are listed as the most uniquely important words in their albums by proportional importance. And just like \u201ckill\u201d, the discrepancy arrises because both words appear at least once in all albums. Thus, despite both words being common in and relatively unique to their given albums, they get zeros for tf-idf.", "Indeed, for more than half of the words (11) where proportional importance and tf-idf disagree, the cause is this zero value issue for the tf-idf measure. This is evidence that my measure does indeed ameliorate the zero value issue faced by tf-idf.", "What about the extensive margin issue? The word \u201cslave\u201d in RTJ 4 shows how that challenge is also taken on by my measure. While more subtle than run or kill, slave similarly does not appear in the top ten words for RTJ 4 in terms of tf-idf, but does for proportional importance. Once again, the raw data helps explain why this is.", "Slave appears somewhat (though not overwhelmingly) frequently in RTJ 4, and appears hardly anywhere else. Indeed, around 90 percent of the instances of \u201cslave\u201d are in RTJ 4, with just two mentions of it outside that album (one in RTJ 2 and one in RTJ 3). Thus, my measure labels it as uniquely important to RTJ 4. For tf-idf on the other hand, since it appears in 3 of the 4 albums at least once (even if it is only once) the value is low (0.002).", "To show the fragility of how tf-idf handles this situation, consider what happens when I simply remove the two instances of slave outside of RTJ 4 and recalculate. The tf-idf statistic not only triples to 0.008, but becomes the third highest score of any word in RTJ 4. In other words, the word goes from not even being in the top ten most important words to being third on the list. This occurs despite the fact that there is very little practical difference between slave appearing outside of RTJ 4 two times versus no times. This is a great example of excessive sensitivity of tf-idf on the extensive margin.", "On the flip side, if you increase the number of times slave appears outside of RTJ 4 to something outrageous, like 400, the tf-idf statistic doesn\u2019t change at all, remaining at exactly 0.002! Despite the word going from somewhat important and unique to RTJ 4 in the first case to not being unique at all in the second, the tf-idf statistic does not budge. This demonstrates what I discussed above: not only is tf-idf excessively sensitive when the extensive margin changes (the number of outside albums the word appears in goes from none to one or two), it is also excessively resistant to change when the intensive margin changes (when the number of total outside mentions goes from two to hundreds).", "My proportional importance measure handles this situation much better. It recognizes that slave is indeed uniquely important to RTJ 4, but does not assign an excessively high value because it also recognizes that though unique, it is not particularly important to the album (making up just 0.5% of total words). Further, when the number of times that slave appears outside of RTJ 4 goes from two to zero, it rightly notes that this is a small change. On the other hand, when the number of outside appearances increases dramatically, it becomes strongly negative, rightly indicating that slave has become relatively unimportant for RTJ 4.", "These findings are true for other words as well, such as \u201cholding\u201d in RTJ 2. In fact, tf-idf is even more sensitive to changes on the extensive margin for this word than for slave. Simply by removing the two appearances of holding outside of RTJ 2, the tf-idf statistic goes from not even being in the top ten to being the highest for any word in the album. That is, just by removing the two outside instances of the word, tf-idf goes from saying that holding is basically unimportant in RTJ 2 to saying it is literally the most important word. Once again, my measure handles this situation in a more measured way. It assigns it a middling value, because it recognizes that while the word is uniquely important to RTJ 2 (appears 19 times more in that album than in any other), it is not particularly important to the album overall (making up just 0.7% of total words).", "Ultimately, this case study demonstrates that proportional importance does exactly what I set out for it to do. In many ways it mirrors tf-idf, capturing many of the same words and listing them as important. However, it avoids the major drawbacks of tf-idf: It does not stepwise decrease to zero suddenly, it is not excessively sensitive to changes on the extensive margin, and it does not ignore changes on the intensive margin.", "Where does this all leave us? Well, this is certainly not to suggest that tf-idf is unusable and should be tossed out entirely. That simply will not happen, nor should it. In general it is a useful statistic, and the issues I identify often occur only in edge cases.", "Instead, I write this merely to suggest that analysts and researchers should proceed with caution when using the measure, acknowledging its drawbacks and how and when they may alter an analysis. Just in the small case study done above, the composition of the most important words changed somewhat dramatically when I switched to proportional importance, and did so in a way that raises questions about tf-idf. Indeed, the shift was certainly large enough to alter the conclusions of an analysis.", "In terms of proportional importance, I also did not write this to suggest that it will supplant tf-idf. I strongly suspect it will not, and that is okay. That said, I do hope that I have convinced you that it is a powerful tool that mirrors the strengths and mitigates the weaknesses of tf-idf, and I would be happy to share the code I used to calculate it (the code is still a work in progress. It gets the job done, but is not at all optimized for speed- yet).", "While I wait for the messages about proportional importance to flood in by the hundreds, I will simply sign off by saying happy text mining!", "Recent grad of Colgate University with a degree in economics.
