The result: Azure ML SDK.", "Today we will be exploring how to deal with infrastructure, environments, and deployments in the cloud. We will dig deeper into concepts and the underlying structures required for you to master these skills.", "I know that concepts by themselves might feel like castles in the air. But don\u2019t worry, there will be enough code for you to feel that the castles are actually on the ground.", "If we talk about cloud providers, there are three leading players: AWS, GCP, and Azure. When it comes to cloud computing, it\u2019s not rocket science to figure out that one of their main customers are data scientists. Maybe not directly them, but, surprise! Companies are \u2014 still \u2014 made up of people.", "So, their strategy has been simple: make data scientist's life easier.All of them have their own approach to this, but today we will be talking about Azure. They\u2019ve developed Azure Machine Learning, which is, by its own words, \u201ca cloud-based environment you can use to train, deploy, automate, manage, and track ML models.\u201d", "Automatize, configure, manage, and deploy machine learning models might be a nightmare for data scientists. Because of that, there is an increase in demand for people who can fill that gap.", "If you manage to deal with infrastructure in addition to your model training skills, you will be one step closer to become a machine learning engineer. If you are interested in jumping to this new role, working with Azure Machine Learning can boost your transition.", "Your interactions with all the cloud infrastructure can be done with the Python SDK, and coding that in your Jupyter notebook will give you the same feeling you had the first time you did an exploratory data analysis.", "This sounds great, but how does it work? Well, Roughly, there are three ways for you to interact with Azure Machine Learning: using the Browser, the Azure CLI, and the Python SDK. As you may have anticipated by the title, we will be using the latter.", "The functionalities of the Azureml package are divided into different modules. If you want to perform an action, you just need to invoke the right module and add your input (which will be pretty intuitive). A very pythonic experience.", "Note: If you want to set up an instance and open a Jupyter notebook within your Azure Machine Learning workspace, go to the following post.", "Resources are part of the internal structure of Azure. For example, if you\u2019re going to create a workspace, you will just need to import the Workspace module using the Workspace.create() function, and set the parameters.", "Note: I know that the scripts are not in .ipynb format. But I think that the .py format looks cleaner. I hope that this detail doesn\u2019t take you away from the real experience: you should be coding inside your Jupyter notebook.", "Experiments are meant to encapsulate your ML tasks. It\u2019s a great way to separate your different hypotheses and test them. So, do you need to create an experiment? Again, if you try to guess how to call the module, I\u2019m sure you will do it correctly.", "These two examples are just for you to see how simple it\u2019s to converse with Azure. But today, we will be talking about infrastructure. In the first part, we will create our foundations. Understanding what estimators are and how they interact with scripts, environments, and compute clusters, will prepare us to reach the top of our mountain: deployments.", "To explore this topic, we shall visit the most common types of deployment first. Acquiring that knowledge will teach us how to choose the right Azure service for our requirements. And in the end, you will be astonished by how easy it is to actually deploy your model.", "Estimators are an abstraction of compute targets. You have a lot of options to manage the environments inside an estimator. To work with them, you have to set different parameters, but the most important are the following:", "These three fellas open for us a wide variety of options. If you learn how to combine them, you will become an almighty machine learning professional.", "Let\u2019s say that you lead a project that predicts customer churn. The team built an entire project based on scikit-learn using a random forest\u00a0classifier. As your model isn\u2019t a deep learning one, you have chosen a CPU compute target.Your compute target configuration should look like this:", "This time we have chosen a virtual machine optimized for database workloads. If your project requires other specifications, here you can find the available options.", "A cool property of Azure compute clusters is that they will, by default, scale down or up based on the number of jobs submitted. This will lead to incredible cost optimization!.", "Good enough for our random forest, don't you think? But don\u2019t forget about our estimator!", "Note: You have to ensure that the data and the script are inside the given directory.", "SKLearn is a predefined estimator equipped with an environment with the standard packages you most probably will require (pandas, numpy and scikit-learn, among many others). As you can see, your model will be trained under specific conditions, and you can re-train it whenever you deem appropriate, without any worries about the reproducibility conditions.", "As you know, life is about change. Machine learning is about change, too. There will be occasions where your model is outdated, and you will have no other option than to adapt your infrastructure to these new requirements.", "What if your team decides to try a new deep learning model using Tensorflow? And what if that becomes even more real: after some tests, they\u2019ve realized that, in fact, the new model is outperforming your old random forest. Don\u2019t panic out. As you saw, your job can be reduced to change some parameters.", "You need a new environment, you must point to a different script, and you have to change the CPU for a GPU compute target. Don\u2019t exasperate. You need to make this little changes to your script.", "You can just change the virtual machine size, and a new cluster that accommodates better to your requirements will be provisioned. Awesome right? Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not forgetting about the estimator part.", "As you can see, we can train this model using the TensorFlow estimator, which is also available for a quick set up. Also, we can specify the framework version, which it\u2019s pretty useful to avoid compatibility-version errors.", "Besides, we reference our new GPU compute target and change the reference to our new script. Brilliant! You\u2019re done! I don\u2019t even want to think about how much work a change like this would have represented in the past. But nowadays, it\u2019s just a couple of lines of code.", "In the last section, we changed the framework by specifying the preconfigured option that Azure had for us. But what happens when the package that I need isn\u2019t available in those preconfigured environments.", "Easy! You can create and register environments with your Conda or PiPy specifications. If you want a deeper understand of environments, go here:", "In the following code, you can see how a more customized environment works. In this scenario, we needed two more packages, Boruta, and a new version of scikit-learn. The remaining pieces of code should look familiar to you.", "Incredible! Now you know how to create your own customized environments, and autoscaling compute targets. But, we are not stopping there. Going into production is our next stop.", "In this section, we will reach the dramatic climax that we have been expecting: model deployment. As you know, if something can\u2019t be launched, it can\u2019t be used either. Learning these concepts will open new horizons for you. Managing services that you thought were exclusive for Linux or Kubernetes experts are way more accessible for you today.", "The first distinction is vital if you are thinking about the requirements of your project. Real-time web services are the type that expects a quick response time for relatively small batch sizes. On the other hand, batch-scoring expects larger batch-sizes with slower response times.", "An example of the first one might be the Uber Eats arrival time estimation for your delivery. They don\u2019t know when or where you will be asking for food, so they can\u2019t be prepared. They have to process your information as soon as they receive the order.", "For the latter, you can think about mailing targeted offers. They don\u2019t need to expect for a certain event to happen to decide whether they send you the discount. They can process the information in big chunks and send you the offer whenever they feel like.", "Because, according to the Microsoft documentation, depending on the use case, you should select one or another Azure service for deployment. Azure Machine Learning can handle deployments in four different ways:", "Ok, if you are that excited by now, you deserve a great ending.", "It is critical that, after training your model, you register it. There are a lot of reasons why registering models is a great practice: reproducibility of older models, keep track of your past model metrics, or simply call the models by its versions.", "But there\u2019s a specific reason why I\u2019m bringing this to the table now. The method that we will use to deploy the model, uses the registered model as an input. I will show you the \u201cno-code deployment\u201d option, which supports specific frameworks. The good news for us is that scikit-learn models are supported.", "Using Model.deploy() with a few parameters is the easiest way to configure your deployment. In this case, the model will be registered in the Azure Container Registry. You can call your service using service.run(), and a parameter is provided if you prefer an integer output for your classifier. Otherwise, the predict_proba output will be the default option.", "As I explained to you before, there are other ways to deploy your service, and using those (AKS, AML compute) will require to provide some additional configuration.", "But I\u2019m pretty sure that the last gist blew your mind, so we won\u2019t be covering the other options today to give you time to recover (we can do it if you support this).", "The best of all is that everything can be done inside your Jupyter notebook!.", "Enough for today. If you reached this part, I hope that this helps you to move up in your cloud game. Doing so it\u2019s indispensable if you want to handle end-to-end machine learning projects. Hope to see you soon!", "[1] As the technology was created by Azure, I base the code snippets on their documentation, which you can find here.", "[2] The book Mastering Azure Machine Learning was enlightening for a structured clarification of some details. I really rely on that book to create this content. I want to thank Christoph K\u00f6rner for the authorization to publish this blog and his time on this. I really encourage you to read that book if you want a better understanding of Azure Machine Learning.", "I\u2019m also on Linkedin and Twitter.
