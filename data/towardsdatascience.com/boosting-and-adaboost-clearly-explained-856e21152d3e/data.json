I\u2019ll try to explain the concepts of Boosting and AdaBoost as clearly as possible. The initial article was published on my personal blog : https://maelfabien.github.io/machinelearning/adaboost/", "In this article, we\u2019ll cover :", "I have recently created a dedicated GitHub repository for some tutorials I\u2019m following and/or building. I have also added ML recaps :", "For what comes next, consider a binary classification problem. We are either classifying an observation as 0 or as 1. This is not the purpose of the article, but for the sake of clarity, let\u2019s recall the concept of bagging.", "Bagging is a technique that stands for \u201cBootstrap Aggregating\u201d. The essence is to select T bootstrap samples, fit a classifier on each of these samples, and train the models in parallel. Typically, in a Random Forest, decision trees are trained in parallel. The results of all classifiers are then averaged into a bagging classifier :", "This process can be illustrated the following way. Let\u2019s consider 3 classifiers which produce a classification result and can be either right or wrong. If we plot the results of the 3 classifiers, there are regions in which the classifiers will be wrong. These regions are represented in red.", "This example works perfectly, since when one classifier is wrong, the two others are correct. By voting classifier, you achieve a great accuracy ! But as you might guess, there\u2019s also cases in which Bagging does not work properly, when all classifiers are mistaken in the same region.", "For this reason, the intuition behind the discovery of Boosting was the following :", "The intuition described above can be described as such :", "Instead of training the models in parallel, we can train them sequentially. This is the essence of Boosting !", "Boosting trains a series a low performing algorithms, called weak learners, by adjusting the error metric over time. Weak learners are algorithms whose error rate is slightly under 50% as illustrated below :", "How could we implement such classifier ? By weighting errors throughout the iterations ! This would give more weight to regions in which the previous classifiers performed poorly.", "Let\u2019s consider data points on a 2D plot. Some of them will be well classified, others won\u2019t. Usually, the weight attributed to each error when computing the error rate is 1/n where n is the number of data points to classify.", "Now if we apply some weight to the errors :", "You might now notice that we give more weight to the data points that are not well classified. Here\u2019s an illustration of the weighting process :", "In the end, we want to build a strong classifier that may look like this :", "One question you might ask, is how many classifiers should one implement in order to have it working well ? And how is each classifier chosen at each step ?", "The answer lies in the definition of so-called tree stumps ! Tree stumps defines a 1-level decision tree. The main idea is that at each step, we want to find the best stump, i.e the best data split, that minimizes the overall error. You can see a stump as a test, in which the assumption is that everything that lies on one side belongs to class 1, and everything that lies on the other side belongs to class 0.", "There are a lot of combinations possible for a tree stump. Let\u2019s see how many combinations we face in our simple example ? Let\u2019s take a minute to count them.", "Well, the answer is\u2026 12 ! It might seem surprising, but it\u2019s rather easy to understand.", "There are 12 possible \u201ctest\u201d we could make. The \u201c2\u201d on the side of each separating line simply represents the fact that all points on one side could be points that belong to class 0, or to class 1. Therefore, there\u2019s 2 tests embedded in it.", "At each iteration t, we will choose ht the weak classifier that splits best the data, by reducing the overall error rate the most. Recall that the error rate is a modified error rate version that takes into account what has been introduced before.", "As stated above, the best split is found by identifying at each iteration t, the best weak classifier ht, generally a decision tree with 1 node and 2 leaves (a stump). Suppose that we are trying a predict whether someone who wants to borrow money will be a good payer or not :", "In this case, the best split at time t is to stump on the Payment history, since the weighted error resulting of this split is minimal.", "Simply note that decision tree classifiers like these ones can in practice be deeper than a simple stump. This will be a hyper-parameter.", "The next logical step is to combine the classifiers into a Sign classifier, and depending on which side of the frontier a point will stand, it will be classified as 0 or 1. It can be achieved this way :", "Do you see any way to potentially improve the classifier ?", "By adding weights on each classifier, to avoid giving the same importance to the different classifiers.", "Let\u2019s wrap up in a small pseudo-code what we covered so far.", "The key elements to remember from it are :", "And we\u2019re done ! This algorithm is called AdaBoost. This is the most important algorithm one needs to understand in order to fully understand all boosting methods.", "Boosting algorithms are rather fast to train, which is great. But how come they\u2019re fast to train since we consider every stump possible and compute exponentials recursively ?", "Well, here\u2019s where the magic happens. If we choose properly \u03b1t and Z, the weights that are supposed to change at each step simplify to :", "This is a very strong result, and it does not contradict the statement according to which the weights should vary with the iterations, since the number of training samples that are badly classified drops, and their total weights is still 0.5 !", "And there\u2019s another trick : any classifier that tries to split 2 well classified data points will never be optimal. There\u2019s no need to even compute it.", "Now, we\u2019ll take a quick look at how to use AdaBoost in Python using a simple example on a handwritten digit recognition.", "Let\u2019s now load the data :", "X contains arrays of length 64 which are simply flattened 8x8 images. The aim of this dataset is to recognize handwritten digits. Let\u2019s take a look at a given handwritten digit :", "If we stick to a Decision Tree Classifier of depth 1 (a stump), here\u2019s how to implement AdaBoost classifier :", "And it should head a result of around 26%, which can largely be improved. One of the key parameters is the depth of the sequential decision tree classifiers. How does accuracy improve with depth of the decision trees ?", "And the maximal score is reached for a depth of 10 in this simple example, with an accuracy of 95.8%.", "It has been discussed whether AdaBoost overfits or not. Lately, it has been proven to overfit at some point, and one should be aware of it. AdaBoost can also be used as a regression algorithm.", "AdaBoost is vastly used in face detection to assess whether there is a face in the video or not. I\u2019ll do another article on this topic soon ! In a further article, we\u2019ll also cover gradient boosting :)", "I hope that this article introduced clearly the concept of AdaBoost and that it does now seem clear to you. Don\u2019t hesitate to drop a comment if you have any question or remark.", "Your home for data science.
