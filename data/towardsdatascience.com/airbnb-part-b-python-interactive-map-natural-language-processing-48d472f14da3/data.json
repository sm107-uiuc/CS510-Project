The company went from a single air mattress for rent to global cooperation valued at more than 30 billion dollars all thanks to its energetic founder- Brian Chesky. 2020 was supposed to be the golden year for Airbnb as it would go public and issue the worlds\u2019 most sought after stocks. Tragically, Coronavirus happened. The travel sector was gutted by the pandemic. Airbnb now faces burning cash, angry hosts and an uncertain future as 2000 employees could potentially be discharged from their positions and the billion dollars debts with a high-interest rate that is being built to refund their customers. (Grind, 2020)", "Nonetheless, things start to look up as June arrived. Airbnb reported having more nights booked for US listings between May 17 and June 3 than the same period last year. There was also a similar growth in domestic travel in countries that are successful in combating the virus: Germany, Portugal, South Korea, and New Zealand. Other companies, like Expedia and Booking.com also witnessed a jump in domestic vacation rental reservations. Months of pent-up demand is leading to a rush of summer reservations as more and more people are looking to escape their home coronavirus refuge. Now, Airbnb has more listings than it did before the crisis, focusing on exclusively traditional vacation rental markets top destinations in America. They are Big Bear Lake in Southern California, the Smoky Mountains, along the Tennessee-North Carolina border, and Port Aransas in Texas. (Carville, 2020) Still, any rebound is coming from a very low base with Chetsky said that he expected revenue this year to each half of 2019\u2019s level in May\u2019s live conference call announcement. He said going public this year is still an option but he will wait for the market to stabilize before making the final decisions.", "As a previously trained hotelier who is living in Seattle, I want to do an analysis project on the current situation of Airbnb in Seattle in two parts. Part A will focus on the comparative study between two cities: Seattle and Washington DC. Seattle and Washington DC areas at the two ends of America that are widely known for different reasons: technological and cultural powerhouse vs political center, respectively. In addition, they share a similar population size (just over 700,000) and a number of listings (8740 and 9369). Then, in part B we will have a deeper look into Seattle\u2019s market from perspectives of a governmental position and a traveler to recommend solutions that can benefit not only Airbnb but also the city and its citizens", "In part B, we will create some visualizations, interactive maps and dive into natural language processing with the Airbnb 2020 Listings dataset of Seattle. Besides the standard ones, we introduced more libraries dedicated to creating maps (folium, geopandas), visualizations (plotly, cufflinks), natural language processing (re, nltk).", "On top of the listings.csv and listings_details.csv that are mainly used for the analysis, we also employed \u2018calendars\u2019 and \u2018review_details\u2019 dataset in order to help us. As we mentioned in Part A, listings is basically the id of the advertisement. There were 7237 Airbnb listings in Seattle on April, 2020. The \u2018listings\u2019 contains 15 features while \u2018listings_details\u2019 contains 96. Instead of using all the columns that might be irrelevant, we selectively joined the number of variables that are useful to us for part B\u2019s analysis. We also stripped \u201c%\u201c off the \u201chost_response_rate\u201d feature.", "Downtown is the epicenter of all commercial and professional activities of Seattle (1250 listings), which explains why it has the second-highest amount of listings besides the Other neighborhood outside of the city. Other areas near downtown Seattle does not appear to be that popular either as there are only 775 listings in Capital Hill and 600 for the Central Area, the rest stays below 500. One theory suggests that the reason why travelers decided to stay outside of Seattle is due to the skyrocketing price of the city\u2019s current real estate. We will unfold how this interesting fact affects other listings\u2019 factors like price and customer\u2019s perception of their Airbnb stay. For the interactive map, you can zoom in on the clusters to eventually find the individual locations of the listings (Github code below)", "CBRE Hotels\u2019 American Research has stated that approximately 80% of Airbnb\u2019s revenue in Seattle comes from entire home listings and the revenue generated by hosts with multiple entire home listings nearly doubled between 2015 and 2016. (Seattle City Council, 2017) Commercial enterprises like to utilize online rental platforms to market multiple units in different locations that could potentially worsen the housing crisis time bomb that heading towards Seattle as you will see later on in the report. Unfortunately, the situation is not better in 2020 with Entire home/apt accounts for an overwhelming majority of listings (5700 in total), 3 times higher than that of Private room. Yet, Seattle is slow to pass any substantial laws, unlike New York, which aggressively prohibits any listings from being rented out more than 30 days a year as up 2017. (Dalton, 2017)", "It is noteworthy to know that there are different property listings, but not all of them are widely beloved. In order to eliminate the non-popular property types, we created an additional column called \u201ctotal\u201d to count the listings for each property type according to the room types and select those that have more than 100. After that, I dropped the \u2018total\u2019 column to get normal results. Houses and Apartments are the most common type of properties. It seems that Houses are less popular property type for Entire home/apt listings compared to Apartment, but they are more preferred when it comes to Private room renting.", "In general, the majority of listings usually like to hos less than 5 guests, with most of them being 2 (over 2700 listings). However, it is interesting to see that a party of 6 can easily find a suitable property for the night. It is due to the fact that unlike other cities like Amsterdam, Seattle does not have a short term rental\u2019s maximum capacity restriction of 4 out of fear for possible noise complaints or fire hazards. Thus, if you want to throw a party, Seattle is the best city for such an option.", "It is no secret that Airbnb has been accused of escalating the Affordable-Housing crisis in many cities across the world. (Shafroth, 2016). To prevent this from happening, Seattle\u2019s Department of Finance and Administrative Services forced every Airbnb hosts to get short-term rental operator\u2019s licenses before operating as up December 2019. (Airbnb, 2020) The license is about $75/ unit, renewed annually. Each short term contracts allows you to operate up to two dwelling units:", "However, the guideline is not enforced upon all the listings, there are limited exceptions to the maximum number of units, including some exceptions for short-term rentals legally operated before Sept. 30, 2017. It is noted that if you operate a hotel or motel on Airbnb, the host will not be required to register for a short-term rental permit, but does need to claim a formal exemption.", "As Seattle\u2019s law stated above, we can ignore the Entire home/apt value and go straight to the Private Room to see any extreme cases that have too many listings for just two residences. Bearing in mind, Airbnb does not give the address of the listings, although the field \u201cstreet\u201d is actually in the database. These are certainly not full real addresses. Airbnb actively hides the listings\u2019 addresses and only reveals them once you confirm your booking. Therefore, one cannot say if these listings are in fact in the same house.", "By running the first 20 values out of 53 Dario\u2019s properties can be categorized into 4 different groups according to his listings\u2019 names", "Additionally, when you check the actual Longtitude and Lactitude themselves, they are highly similar to each other with a slight difference. Pictures of rooms, facilities on Airbnb\u2019s listings cannot be distinguished from one to another:", "From a respective point of view, it seems like he is running a boutique hotel but classify as short-term rental\u2019s license, which was designed especially for Airbnb, from the city center. If all the listings are legal, Dario could likely be running a hotel which would be subject to different regulation as stated above or belong to the \u2018exemption\u2019 group that signed up before Sept. 30, 2017. If not, Airbnb or the city council should have a look into the situation and investigate whether Dario is violating the rule or not. Not only Dario but also other hosts like Vera, Seyed, Shannon, Lee, etc. should be inspected.", "At the moment, Seattle has no rule in place to prevent professional hosting activities. Such shortcoming opens the door for the possibility that Airbnb outsources their platform to professional hosts (third party real estate companies). Right now, 80% of the hosts have fewer than 5 listings. We assume that hosts with just a couple of more listings than 1 are likely to also be the host for a couple of friends. But there are extreme cases (312), which raises our suspicion that they are doing it professionally.", "Below, we display the hosts with more than 20 listings. If one has a look at their listings on Airbnb, they can be blown away by the standardization and professionalism of each listing that belongs to the top 3. Thus, we can safely say that these are professional hosts.", "A deeper look into the top 3 allows us to find out more about the way Airbnb operates. It seems that on top of unprofessional listings by conventional hosts who would like to collect some side income, Airbnb also frequently establishes partnerships with mid to small scale real estate companies. Airbnb allows these local companies to register their rental properties as normal listings on the platform to generate more web traffics in exchange for commissions. The terms and degree of companies\u2019 involvement vary from one arrangement to another as the table below illustrates:", "\u201cWe are a passionate team running a modern tech-enabled corp housing co that believes nicely furnished high end homes should be consistent, affordable and easy to book.\u201d", "=> Despite being registered as \u2018Corp Condos & Apts on the system, all the listings are owned by Barsala Barsala, a mid-scale real estate company that focuses on providing good-value-for-money lease contracts in the West coast. There is not much information about the relationship between Airbnb and Barsala", "\u201cZeus is reinventing corporate housing. We do this by providing a unique, hassle-free, and high-quality housing experience in each of our 1,400+ homes throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, Los Angeles, Washington\u201d Zeus has become a permanent partner with Zeus \u201c", "=> As Airbnb absorbs more and more of the demand for housing, it\u2019s exploring how to monetize opportunities beyond vacation rentals. A marketplace for longer-term corporate housing could be a huge business, but rather than building it by themselves, Airbnb has strategically invested in cooperation with one of the market leaders in properties\u2019 longer-term rentals called Zeus Living\u201d. It is an ingenious combination: Zeus\u2019s available properties and Airbnb\u2019s global promotion platform (Constine, 2019)", "\u201cStay where it counts.

We can\u2019t wait for you to visit!\u201d", "=> From renting room solely with Airbnb, the founders decided to build up their own property renting app to rivals and partner with Airbnb at the same time. Their business approach is to give ridiculous discounts to potential renter/buyer at pricey areas if they agree to become hosts for Airbnb. Hannah Exner and Sam Joselyn scored a magnificent apartment at the Westlake for 1000USD/month at Westlake neighborhood where prices reach above 1500USD/month (Levy, 2019)", "Besides the obvious pondering of what effective measures that the government of Seattle will take to make sure all these business partnerships do not exacerbate the crisis, it is the question of realness and products\u2019 differentiation. As a company prides itself on providing an authentic experience and local hidden gems, which elevated its images above fellow hospitality competitors in customers\u2019 eyes, introducing such cookie-cutter, polished listings from real estate agencies might diminish the company\u2019s unique value proportion. (Lalicic & Weismayer, 2017). As time flies, even most diehard Airbnb enthusiasts might seek \u201cauthenticity\u201d somewhere else", "In this part, we compared the average daily rate for two (ADR) and review scores according to neighborhoods. We expected the distance to the city center is the most important factor since all Seattle landmarks locate downtown. There might be a strong correlation between the distance and the review score. Other factors that might affect the review score and ADR include:", "It is interesting to see Queen Ann is significantly expensive compared to the rest (~$285/day). Then it is Downtown (~$165/day) followed by other neighborhoods. Surprisingly, the average review scores are above 9/10 regardless of the listings\u2019 locations, so no matter which neighborhood you choose, maximum satisfaction is always guaranteed. We believe that is because Seattle is generally small in terms of size and population (1 million in total). The city is also well-connected so take around 30 minutes to travel to and away from downtown if they happen to stay in suburban areas", "Despite being less serious than San Francisco, Seattle still suffers heavily from the abundance of homeless and panhandlers. Most of them are harmless and will leave you alone. Nevertheless, it still negatively affects the public image and demotivates travelers to visit the city. In addition, visitors might experience property crime than violent crime, 7 times respectively. If you visit Seattle by car, you might experience break-ins even in parking lots. Like most cities, Seattle\u2019s safest areas are outside of the downtown core and tend to be residential areas or residential with light commercial. Among the safest neighborhoods are Sunset Hill, Ballard, Magnolia, Alki, Magnolia, Lower Queen Ann, and Wallingford. Seattle Police department has a great map of areas of Seattle color-coded by the number of crimes committed. Dark blue areas mean more cases while Lighter areas have fewer", "Taking into consideration both the ADR, review score and crime statistics, customers are advised to make their Airbnb bookings in West Seattle, Magnolia, Ballard, Rainer Valley, Central Area, Seaward Park, Beacon Hill, University District, Interbay and Northgate to receive low renting prices, maximum safety, and high satisfaction by the end. I am currently living in Rainer Valley/ Beacon Hill, 20 minutes away from downtown by car or 30 min by train, everything is very nearby. The area experiences a moderate amount of gentrification so it is both safe and local for people to book Airbnb experience. Barbecuing some mouth-watering grills on a beautiful Sunday in Beacon Hill is as luxurious as life can get.", "Equally important to the written review, guests can submit overall star rating and set of category star ratings. Ratings are categorized into:", "Readers can find below the distribution of the scores across all those categories. One could not help but be astonished by the high scores across the board. This is very common in Airbnb as the company is well-known to provide exceptional service to their customers (Plautz, 2015). Because the standard is so high like that, guests should only choose listings that score 10 in at least four out of five factors. Value is the most tricky one because they have a noticeably greater number of scores 9 compared to the others, which makes the factor a bit more distinguishable than other indicators. Staying at a host that managed to score 10 on value even though they might score less on other aspects means that you are likely to hit the jackpot.", "In order to show appreciation for their hosts\u2019 effort, Airbnb awarded those with the highest esteem \u201cSuperhost\u201d status. Being a Superhost means you benefit from an increase of your listings\u2019 visibility, earning potential and even receive exclusive rewards (Chen, 2017). Airbnb has featured a number of Superhost s\u2019 listings in their advertisement campaign and Superhosts are even invited to give speeches or share tips on how to earn this cool title. In order to become a Superhost, a host must have a 4.7 or higher average overall rating based on reviews from their Aibnb guests in the past year. They also need to organize at least 10 stays in the previous year or 100 nights over at least 3 stays if these reservations have longer term. Superhosts must not have any cancellations unless there were extenuating circumstances and need to respond to their customers within 24 hours. Despite much-restricted bar to overcome, Airbnb listings in Seattle knocked them out of the park by having nearly 30000 Superhosts at the moment (~45%). This is a shocking number given to Airbnb\u2019s international Superhost rate (20.2% )", "Since Superhosts are so popular in Seattle, it begs the question of whether or not Superhost is one of the necessary criteria when choosing a room. On the one hand, booking with a Superhost potentially means more money spent on your accommodation. On the other, as a customer, I do not want to encounter bad hosts who cancel a lot and take forever to reply. Fortunately, it is rare to meet any unresponsive hosts on Airbnb and the majority of them take less than an hour to answer, within a day is the latest. Such a quick figure partly explains why Seattle\u2019s Airbnb is flooded with exceptional Superhosts. Therefore, being a Superhost or not is something that potential guests should not put a strong emphasis on.", "The \u2018calendar\u2019 file holds 365 records of price and availability for each listing that corresponds to every day of the year. To get the right result, we merge the \u2018calendar\u2019 with the \u2018listings\u2019[\u2018accommodates\u2019] on the shared columns called listings_id with listing_id functions as an index on the left. A sample of the merged table is shown below, it is important to note that \u2018f\u2019 means that the owner does not want to rent out his property on this specific day or the listings has already been booked by a someone else/a third party.", "The number of available Accommodations is higher for the next 6 months before hitting rock bottom when going further into the future. Bearing in mind, the data was collected on April 23rd, 2020. This means that it was at the peak of the Corona Virus outbreak in America. The six months positive figure means that a lot of mean that a lot of guests have already confirmed well advance into the future before they realize the seriousness of this pandemic. Thus, there are fewer than 1100 bookings on October 16 and virtually none by the middle of January 2021. Another reason in such a drastic change in the number of available accommodations is the fact that hosts are actively looking for other alternative use of these renting properties to maintain a stable stream of revenue in face of crisis. Airbnb bookings are secondary to last on people\u2019s minds. For the interactive map, you can zoom in on the clusters to eventually find the individual locations of the listings (Github code below)", "Since accommodation for 2 is popular, we select only the available listings for 2 and find the average using mean() function. ADR peaks at $127 on Saturday, July 27th, and the cynical patterns is thanks to the higher prices at weekends. As time flies by, the price dropped dramatically. I suspect it was the impact of the COVID and host\u2019s price-slash last-minute efforts is the evidence that it would take sometimes before Airbnb can make a profit once again.", "However, it is not the end of the world. Seattle has reported a significant decline in positive cases and death tolls from once being the nation\u2019s Corona Virus epicenter. It was all thanks to the efforts of Washingtonians, particularly Seattleites, who have constantly abided to the \u2018Stay home\u2019 order by the state government. Luckily, King County, which covers the majority of Seattle and was severely affected, is confident enough to apply for the second phase of the reopening plan. Hence, we are optimistic that everything will be back to normal by September/ October", "Excitingly, it is also the best time to visit the city. Summer marks the city\u2019s high season, meaning room rates are up on the roof while winter is blanketed in endless cold rainy days that can deter even the most avid sightseers. Seattle blooms most radiantly in fall where summer weather lingers as crowds disperse, leaving plenty of Airbnb room to grab (USnews, 2019). September and October are also full of festivities like Bumbershoot (September), Earshot Jazz Festival (October-November), Seattle Restaurant Week (October-November). We suggest the potential customers booking before October 15th as room rate is low and there are still many available listings. There is nothing better than to celebrate the end of a pandemic by going out to the streets, in kaleidoscopic customs and enjoy scrumptious biscuits and heartwarming chowder as true bons vivants", "Natural Languages Processing (NLP), is a branch of artificial intelligence that analyzes the relationship between computers and humans using natural language. NLP is extremely useful when implementing in Deep Leering\u2019s application like Neural Neuron Networks because it helps to read, decipher, understand, and make sense of the human languages in a manner that is valuable. (Yse, 2019) NLP has helped me to predict the feedbacks score based on the guests\u2019 reviews of a hotel. But in this exercise, we just only want to see what the review comments entail and demonstrate the step that an NLP goes through in order to establish a concrete foundation for future research.", "The \u201d reviews\u201d file is not that interesting because it only includes review dates for each listing. The \u201creview_details\u201d includes similar information with just 4 more additional columns, Therefore, we would left-merged the \u2018host_id\u2019, \u2018host_name\u2019 together with review_details file:", "Here are the 5 hosts with the greatest number of reviews. It is interesting to see that Loftium appears one more time at the top with 4181 reviews. We believe that this is due to the company\u2019s unique business model that they were able to generate so many constructive reviews to improve their products.", "In order to clean any Natural Language Processing dataset, we need to follow 5 steps:", "Finally, we could see the drastic difference between the original review at index 1 and the cleaned version", "Bearing in mind that the actual process does not actually stop there if we want to build a world cloud because these reviews are full of host\u2019 names that are irrelevant to our analysis. Unfortunately, there are 1949 names available and searching each and every single one of them in the \u201creview_details\u201d dataset will take a very long time, plus the names do not really affect the final words cloud. Hence, we would move on from that point and future researchers can try to figure out how to deal with this specific task. After using CountVectorizer() function from sklearn and WordCloud(), we can see the rankings of most used words and also the word cloud itself", "In a nutshell, exploring Seattle\u2019s Airbnb situation both from a comparative study perspective and solutions proposing one gave us invaluable insights into how the company functions, strategize sand innovatively transforms into a force to be reckoned with in the hospitality industry.
