Some of the choices may be opinionated, but the viewers can decide by themselves what suits them best after looking over all the facts. Let us start analyzing each of these languages from scratch in descending order!", "C is a general-purpose, procedural computer programming language supporting structured programming, lexical variable scope, and recursion, with a static type system. By design, C provides constructs that map efficiently to typical machine instructions. Despite being the reason for the existence of most of the programming languages, it still has its niches in a variety of fields like embedded systems, microcontrollers, and embedded level operations.", "C in some applications might be outdated but it by no means going to go extinct any time soon. It was a wide array of uses and real-world applications and will be applied in the industry for years to come. It might be hard to learn but in the end, it\u2019s probably worth doing so if you have the time and resources.", "C# is the first C clone that will be discussed in this article. C# is a general-purpose, multi-paradigm programming language encompassing strong typing, lexically scoped, imperative, declarative, functional, generic, object-oriented, and component-oriented programming disciplines. C# is exclusively used in the gaming industry. Software tools like Unity also use C# for creating games.", "C# is a language whose popularity is rising and is probably here to stay for the upcoming years thanks to its effective abilities in creating games and robustness that help the gaming industry. It is also extremely useful in enterprise applications.", "PHP is a general-purpose scripting language especially suited to web development. It was originally created by Danish-Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf in 1994; the PHP reference implementation is now produced by The PHP Group. It is suited more towards server-side web development but unfortunately, it is considered as a dying language with better alternatives to perform similar tasks.", "PHP is considered now to be an overall dull language and not that impressive. There are better alternative programming language options available in comparison to PHP. However, it does find its uses in ethical hacking and cybersecurity as well as website designing fields.", "Ruby is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. It was designed and developed in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro \u201cMatz\u201d Matsumoto in Japan. Ruby is dynamically typed and uses garbage collection. Ruby is a typical scripting language and it has a wide range of real-life applications in websites like GitHub, Fiverr, etc.", "Ruby is still used for a considerable number of applications in today\u2019s world. So, it is probably a good language to consider learning because you will be able to develop sophisticated applications in no time. It also good technologies keeping it very relevant even today.", "C++ is an object-oriented programming language. C++ is a superset of C. Most of what we already know about C applies to C++ also. Therefore, almost all C programs are also C++ programs. However, there are a few minor differences that prevent a C program from running under the C++ compiler. The most important facilities that C++ adds on to C are classes, inheritance, function overloading, and constructor overloading. It is used extensively for AAA games and the development of 3-D models.", "The scope for C++ similar to the previously mentioned C and C# is still popular and learning it will never be a bad idea. Especially C++ because it is comparatively an easier language to pick up and learn. It has a wide range of applications in the industry. Also used for AAA games as well alongside graphical designs and 3-D models.", "Typescript is a newer programming language. TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and trans compiles to JavaScript. It provides coders with better interface modules, easier coding, navigation, error management, etc.", "The future for TypeScript seems particularly strong because it is developed by Microsoft, and lots of additional features are being added to make coding, navigation, programming interface, and other things much more user-friendly and make the lives of programmers a bit more easier.", "Go or Golan was developed by only 2 employees in Google in 2012. Go is a statically typed, compiled programming language designed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson. Go is syntactically similar to C, but with memory safety, garbage collection, structural typing, and CSP-style concurrency. Go is an open-source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.", "Go is an extremely popular and rising language. The potential for Go is high and it is definitely a language worth considering to learn more about. Go is even starting to be used in artificial intelligence and machine learning recently alongside many other applications. So, overall Go is a good language to start learning.", "Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java is a general purpose language that is well for games and mobile app development. It is also useful in enterprise-level applications as well as web apps. It provides structure and maintainability of code.", "Java is considered as a slowly dying language similar to PHP but unlike the latter, it is still widely used in many companies. It can also be used to create multiple products and has a wide array of applications. It is relevant and popular enough to be considered as a programming language to learn.", "Python is an object-oriented, high-level programming language that was released way back in 1991. Python is highly interpretable and efficient. Simply put \u2014 Python is amazing. I initially started out with languages like C, C++, and Java. When I finally encountered python, I found it to be quite elegant, simple to learn, and easy to use. Python is the best way for anyone, even people with no prior experience with programming or coding languages, to get started with machine learning. In spite of having some flaws like being considered a \u201cslow\u201d language, python is still one of the best languages for AI and machine learning.", "Needless to say, python has a bright future in the development field of programming languages, especially in the fields of data visualization, artificial intelligence, data science, exploratory data analysis, and machine learning, among many other applications.", "Learn more about python in the below two articles:", "JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is an extremely popular language and used everywhere on the web. It is an extremely versatile language for building interactive front end user interfaces.", "JavaScript is an extremely popular language. It is so widely used that it might take quite some time for another programming language to replace it. It also finds applications not in just web development but also in artificial intelligence and other applications. This language should be at the top of anyone\u2019s list as a language to learn.", "This article covered the concise list of the top 10 programming languages used as of the time of writing this post. However, this does not mean that one of them is better than the other, or the ones ranked lower are not that useful.", "Each programming language is unique in its own way and can be utilized for various purposes. So, don\u2019t stop learning a new programming language if you have the time, resources, and opportunity to do so!", "I would highly encourage all of you to look into these programming languages and check out what they hold for the future of coding as well as their resource contribution towards artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science as a whole.", "The main source and reference for this article is GitHub, 3rd quarter 2020.", "If you liked this article, then check out these other articles that you might enjoy reading as well!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end.
