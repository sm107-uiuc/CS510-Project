One promising approach is the Convolution Neural Network. CNN is an improved version of traditional Neural Networks which keeps the spatial dimension intact.", "CNN has outperformed various other frameworks for Image classification, Object detection, etc. and thus is of keen interest to the researchers. In an effort to make this learning more and more accurate, researches have started implementing deeper and deeper Convolution networks.", "The topic of selecting the right number of layers for training has been in discussion for a long time and as it turns out making a much deeper Network doesn\u2019t improve the accuracy but rather degrades it. Yes, you heard it right as you stack more and more units in the network, the network\u2019s learning capacity gets saturated and after a threshold, it falls down.", "The two basic reasons why the accuracy falls for such networks instead of going up are :", "However, the 1st problem is been taken care of by normalized initialization and intermediate normalization layers, which enable networks with tens of layers to start converging for stochastic gradient descent (SGD) with backpropagation.", "But when the deeper networks start converging, they observe the Degradation problem. With the network depth increasing, accuracy gets saturated and then degrades rapidly. One method to help remove this degradation problem is to add the additional layers with an identity mapping.", "ResNet[1] introduces these \u201cIdentity mapping\u201d or \u201cskip connections\u201d that skips one or more layers as shown in the figure :", "The idea is that instead of just stacking additional layers into the network, we add them as residual blocks (having identity mappings). To achieve the results in this scheme, the authors of the work have tweaked the underlying mapping and make the non-linear layers learn the mapping :", "instead of the conventional mapping H(x) and the original mapping is recast to :", "Another benefit of introducing these shortcut connections is that they do not add any extra parameters nor increase the computational complexity as they are employed as identity mappings. However, they ensure that the deeper networks perform as good as it\u2019s shallower counterparts.", "The originally proposed ResNet structure is presented below :", "One thing to notice here is those dotted lines, which denotes a linear projection. Ideally, to perform the identity mapping, dimensions of both F(x) and X must be the same, but when this is not the case we use a projection vector Ws to help match the dimensions.", "Another study was carried out to determine exactly when these \u201cskip connections\u201d should be introduced!", "Every possible combination was tested and tried before coming to the final version of the residual block having full pre-activation i.e. (e) in the above figure.", "Because of its compelling results, ResNet quickly became one of the most popular architectures in various computer vision tasks.", "As the popularity of ResNets grew, it\u2019s architecture was heavily studied and researchers came up with different variants of the originally proposed work.", "Based on the original work, an alternative called ResNeXt [2] was proposed with the following building block :", "This model adopts the strategy of ResNets of repeating layers while incorporating the split-transform-merge strategy in an easy, extensible way. The block may look similar to the Inception network [3] where we perform various different transformations (1x1 Conv, 3x3 Conv, 5x5 Conv, MaxPooling ) and stack them together, whereas here we merge the different transformations by adding them together.", "This type of block introduces one more dimension cardinality \u2014 the number of independent paths, along with the existing height and depth dimensions. The significance of this dimension was experimentally proved by its authors that \u201cincreasing cardinality is a more effective way of gaining accuracy than going deeper or wider,\u201d especially when depth and width starts to give diminishing returns for existing models.", "The proposed building block has three possible variations :", "Authors also state that the model is easy to train rather than the Inception [3] network over different datasets, as it has only one hyperparameter to be adjusted unlike in Inception where we have more hyperparameters to adjust.", "Another popular variation of the ResNet is DenseNet [4] where the authors have tried to solve the problem of vanishing gradients by making extra connections. In DenseNet, they ensure maximum information flow between the layers in the network by connecting all layers directly with each other. To preserve the feed-forward nature, each layer obtains additional inputs from all preceding layers and passes on its own feature-maps to all subsequent layers. The model is shown below :", "Along with tackling the vanishing gradients, the authors also argue that this implementation enables feature reuse, making the network highly parameter efficient. In the traditional models, each layer acts as a state, it reads from a previous state and writes to the subsequent layer. It changes the state but also passes on information that needs to be preserved.", "The DenseNet architecture explicitly differentiates between information that is added to the network and information that is preserved and the final classifier makes a decision based on all feature-maps in the network. Along with better parameter efficiency, DenseNet also provides an improved flow of information and gradients through the network, which makes it easy to train.", "The lth layer receives the feature maps from all of its preceding layers as inputs :", "where [ .. ] signifies the concatenation operation. To facilitate downsampling in the network, it is divided into parts as shown above with transition layers in between. The transition layers consist of the batch normalization layer, convolution layer, and max-pooling layer.", "Because of their compact internal representations and reduced feature redundancy, DenseNets may be good feature extractors for various computer vision tasks that build on convolutional features.", "I hope it helps the readers to strengthen their understandings of this groundbreaking work.", "All the figures of the article were taken from the original papers in the references.", "[3].
