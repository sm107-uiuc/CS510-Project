As novelist Thomas Berger put it:", "The art and science of asking questions is the source of all knowledge.", "One of the most challenging and fundamental elements in any data science project or endeavor is this frequently under-appreciated and overlooked component: the question. While we might expect to encounter the frustrations of data cleaning, the intricacies of data analysis, and the vagaries of data visualization, we can forget that these processes are undertaken in response to the question itself and that we must therefore frame and pose our question first.", "I am just a child who has never grown up. I still keep asking these \u2018how\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 questions. Occasionally, I find an answer. \u2014 Stephen Hawking", "Let\u2019s begin our exploration of questions with a clip from West Wing, because we all desperately need some more West Wing in our lives. For those (sad) souls that have never seen the show, here\u2019s some very basic context: Joey Lucas is a pollster and Josh, CJ, Sam, and Toby are staffers for the President who have just heard some bad poll numbers about the upcoming re-election.", "As this article explores, asking the right questions as a data scientist matters. We can have all the data and statistics and graphs in the world, but if they don\u2019t tell us what we need to know, then they\u2019re not much use. They can even actively be a detriment.", "A caveat before we dive into the article itself: we\u2019re going to tackle only a sliver of the art of asking questions. I\u2019m uncertain a definitive guide on how to ask better questions is even possible. Instead, this article shares some advice for formulating a question and hopefully jumpstarts some creativity and curiosity.", "The very undefinable nature of a \u201cgood question\u201d reveals one of the aspects of good questions in general: they don\u2019t always have a clear answer, or even an answer at all. Questions like \u201cWhy are we here?\u201d have been at the center of human culture since the get go. We\u2019re unlikely to get a definitive answer. It might be worth bearing in mind as we move forward that the quality of a question is not defined by the quality of its answer.", "In the words of poet and novelist James Stephens:", "We get wise by asking questions, and even if these are not answered, we get wise, for a well-packed question carries its answer on its back as a snail carries its shell.", "The query and response of conversation is how we transmit information to one another. Knowledge is built on this ability to share information through language. It would follow, then, that if we build better queries, we can get responses that better match what we care about.", "Enter Tithonus. In Greek mythology, Tithonus is the lover of Eos, the goddess of the dawn. Upset that her mortal love will eventually grow old and die, Eos beseeches Zeus, king of the gods, to grant him immortal life. In typical Greek myth fashion, this ends well for no one.", "Zeus grants Eos\u2019s request, but since Eos forgot to ask for eternal youth in addition to eternal life, Tithonus continues to age but cannot die. He eventually withers to nothing and starts babbling incoherently, before Eos mercifully turns him into a either a cicada or a cricket, depending on the version. Lovely.", "The moral of this fable for most is \u201cbe careful what you wish for.\u201d As Oscar Wilde sardonically put it \u201cWhen the gods wish to punish us, they answer our prayers.\u201d", "But there\u2019s another lesson that we as data scientists might take from the myth of Tithonus instead: \u201cbe careful what question you ask.\u201d", "Allow me to share a brief example from my own experience of why good questions can make a great deal of difference.", "While clerking in law school, I worked on a case that involved a horrible accident and a piece of heavy machinery. For ethical reasons of confidentiality, details of this case have been altered or omitted.", "Several defendants wanted to be dismissed from the case using something called the statute of repose, which works similarly to the statute of limitations. It says:", "The defendants in question were definitely part of building installing the machinery in question so the first prong was no help and neither was the second prong since enough time had gone by. And yet I sat there staring at the third prong curiously, and as often follows curiosity, a question came to mind: I wonder if they broke any laws when they built it? So I searched and I searched and then I found a local construction ordinance stating that the machinery had been installed a quarter inch too close to the walkway in violation of local law. This case had been going on for several years, involving dozens of parties, hundreds of attorneys, hundreds of thousands of pages of documents, and millions of dollars on the line.", "No one had asked that question because it seemed unlikely. I ran into the partner\u2019s office waving a piece of paper like Archimedes out of his bath and said \u201cI found it!\u201d It had been there, patiently waiting, all along.", "The law, the information, the data, the case, nothing had changed. It was just the right question to ask, and it significantly shifted the tenor of the case.", "For a beautiful illustration of the real world consequences of asking the right question, see this Forbes piece on why IBM never acquired Xerox\u2019s IP and how good data science might have prevented that costly mistake.", "Ok so at this point we\u2019re coming around to the idea that maybe kinda sorta this question thing is important after all. But we have a slight problem. What do we mean by \u201cbetter\u201d questions?", "Let\u2019s go ride a roller coaster to explore this idea a bit more.", "Kingda Ka is the tallest roller coaster in the world.", "The average wait time, based on a random series of people posting on the internet and friends who have ridden the ride (which I recognize is, ironically enough, a problematic data set) is somewhere between 20 minutes and a couple hours. The ride itself? 50.6 seconds. And that\u2019s from Six Flag\u2019s own website. Imagine waiting 60 minutes for a ride that lasts less than one.", "What might make Kingda Ka better? Well if the ride was longer, that might be better. Oh and it also might be better if the line was shorter. What that means, though, is that you could be standing in line, looking at the roller coaster with one eye and the line in front of you with the other and \u201cbetter\u201d could mean two opposite things \u2014 longer and shorter \u2014 at the same time in your own head.", "This problem only magnifies when you try and communicate with other people, or worse yet, a machine. You could spend all day standing next to Deep Blue \u2014 IBM\u2019s chess-wizard supercomputer \u2014 screaming \u201cbetter\u201d and Deep Blue will happily hum along producing a great deal of heat and ignoring your very existence. Better is simply not a precise enough concept for our machines (yet).", "This makes sense. Better can mean faster, slower, taller, shorter, so on and so on. While our machines speak a whole bevy of languages, not a single one of them is English. Or Chinese. Or Hindi. Machine do not (again, yet) actually speak any human language. This means that the machine in front of you will obligingly give you whatever answer you ask for, just like Zeus granted the request for Tithonus\u2019s eternal life. But just like Eos, you may find yourself ruing your failure to be precise about what it is you wanted.", "Eos understood what she wanted and maybe we did as well, but she didn\u2019t articulate that in the question she asked, the query she sent, the request she made. If a goddess can get it wrong, so can we mortals.", "So there\u2019s this article\u2019s lesson in asking better questions: ask the question you intend to ask. Define your terms. Be precise. Precision is, in this author\u2019s opinion, the carefully measured spice of life.", "Is saying \u201cbetter\u201d just fine in everyday speech? You bet. But if you\u2019re like Eos and you\u2019re about to put something important on the line, be it a day, week, month, or even year (although hopefully not eternity), not to mention resources and manpower, take the time to ensure that the question you are asking actually seeks the information you\u2019re looking for. Understand the problem you are trying to solve fully. If you don\u2019t, no amount of cleaning, analysis, or visualization is going to get back that lost time for you, your team, or your employer.", "I\u2019m so glad you asked. That\u2019s an excellent question; you\u2019ve clearly learned a great deal from this article.", "To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.", "\u2014 Albert Einstein, famed mail clerk", "As I mentioned, this only scratches the surface of the interplay between creativity and curiosity in the context of asking good questions. As it happens, I came across a variety of resources in the course of writing this piece. Some are interspersed throughout, but there wasn\u2019t room for all of them, so I\u2019ve gathered a few of the resources that served as sources of facts and ideas here for your viewing pleasure. Enjoy!", "For the importance of questions in conversation:", "From the below article: \u201cThe biggest risk is when the stakeholder briefly describes the problem to the data scientist who doesn\u2019t ask enough questions and assumes what the problem is. Then the data scientist builds a solution that seems to solve the described problem. The lack of asking questions and too many assumptions result in a situation where the final solution actually solves a different problem than the original one and gives an opposite recommendation or a result.\u201d", "From the below article: \u201cGreat data scientists get annoyed by \u201cno,\u201d so annoyed that they find a way to get around it, over it, or through it, or they back up and take another path altogether. Design constraints are infuriating and intoxicating.\u201d", "From the below article: \u201cIn many ways, curiosity \u2014 that insatiable hunger for knowledge and understanding \u2014 is the first and foremost trait of a data scientist. Our job is to ask questions of data and of people. Most people don\u2019t know or care about the limitations of data, so we must be curious about what they are doing and what they want to achieve.\u201d", "A great article on questions that you may need to answer in a data science interview:", "For more on learning how to ask the right questions of people instead of data, check out this Harvard Business Review piece.", "Thanks to Dan Strickland, @jawnsno, for commenting and sharing a great resources for developing questions and framing hypotheses in medical research: J Fam Pract. 1978 Jul;7(1):145\u201360.
