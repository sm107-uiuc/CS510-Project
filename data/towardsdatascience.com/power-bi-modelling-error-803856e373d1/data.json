Thank you everyone for reading it.", "If you need a refresher on joins \u2014 here is article 1 and article 2. Yes, they contribute to errors too and they are more subtle, and much more costly.", "Let\u2019s explore some of these error messages.", "In the image above, Power BI indicates it wants to load the model, but because of a \u201cprevious\u201d table, it\u2019s unable to load the model.", "The error is described by the [Expression.Error] section and the table with this error is the one you will need to trouble shoot in Power Query.", "The error message above indicates I have a null value but Power Query was unable to convert it into logical values.", "Here is how to fix it and think about it", "I tried to do a Unit x Price but the Price column is text. Hence the error.", "The error message is quite clear \u2014 cannot apply operator * to Number and Text.", "You can fix this error by Right Click > Change Type > Whole Number on the column that contains Text.", "Power Query cannot load this table because of failure in a step of the transformation. This type of error is considered a step level error. Here is a good example.", "I have removed columns from previous steps, then somewhere in the next steps, I started to refer to columns that were previously removed. This will cause an error.", "This type of error is very likely to be caused by changes being made to previous steps AFTER a completed query. Remember M uses step by step transformations, so if you make changes to one step, you will impact another.", "Here is how you can fix it.", "Here is what happens when you add in the [MissingField.Ignore] parameter.", "If you want to know a bit more about this parameter \u2014 here is a link . I recently discovered this blog and it\u2019s great.", "This is a conversion error. Power Query wants to load the table for you, but there is a value that cannot be converted into your specified data type.", "This error is a bit confusing because the column data type says number, so you\u2019d think that it has successfully converted the column into number.", "Power Query detects a column\u2019s data type by the first 1000 rows. This error indicates that somewhere in your source, after the 1000 rows, there is a value of \u201c11A11\u201d and Power Query doesn\u2019t know what how to convert this into number.", "Here is how to fix and think about it", "Power Query indicates a data source cannot be loaded because it can\u2019t find a file. If a table cannot load, the model cannot load.", "It error can be caused by users having different drive access. For example, you have access to Drive \u201cA:\u201d and the source is saved there. Your coworker doesn\u2019t have access to this drive, so they can\u2019t load it.", "Here is how you can fix it.", "2. You can also set up a parameter for your data source.", "Here I\u2019ve created a list of user names that can access a source file.", "I can go to Data Source Settings > Advanced > Select Parameter on the user name category in the directory.", "The file path will change according to the user name you\u2019ve selected.", "If your file path changes for whoever reason you can choose your parameter and your file path will change accordingly. Here is more details on Curbal if you need it. It\u2019s a great channel.", "This doesn\u2019t happen to me often, but once it did and it took me a long time to figure it out. Basically, it has to do with different privacy settings.", "For example, query A has a privacy level set to Private and query B has a privacy level set to Public. This will likely cause an error.", "If you merge results of A and B, Viewers will now be able to see what is Private.", "You have two options to fix this", "You can get more info here", "This error is probably the most costly.", "If you didn\u2019t read anything from before, read the below.", "This is important because your query will run and you model will load but data is incorrect.", "I have Table A and Table B, both have the same ID column. I am doing a simple inner join.", "Incorrect join results are returned and Power Query didn\u2019t throw any errors either. Inner join only matched 3 of the 5 rows, though we know it should return 5. (All ID, 1\u20135 are in both tables)", "It\u2019s hard to catch errors like this. You may have thought your model runs fine but upon further inspection, you realize you are actually missing records, all because of a space in the join column. (This is 5 records, imagine you have thousands?)", "The reason why the tables joined but returned the wrong results is because a few of the IDs actually contained a space after the value, so Power Query picked it up as a whole new ID.", "If I am joining on Text to Text, I\u2019ll make it a habit to do a TRIM and CLEAN and to make sure all characters are lowered as well.", "After this cleaning process- the join loads fine.", "I hope this article helps you and errors can happen.", "One of the best quote I\u2019ve heard is from Bill Murray. It applies to work as well.", "\u201cThe more relaxed you are, the better you are at everything \u2014 the better you are with your loved ones, the better you are with enemies, the better you are at your job, the better you are with yourself.\u201d", "Errors happen and sometimes models won\u2019t load.
