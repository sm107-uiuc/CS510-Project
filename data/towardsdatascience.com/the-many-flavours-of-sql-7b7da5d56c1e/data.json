Even when traditional databases (read relational databases) are not in use, SQL inevitably shows itself in the system. Cassandra has SQL-like CQL, Spark has SparkSQL, and even JIRA has JQL, which resembles basic SQL clauses like WHERE, IN, BETWEEN , etc. These clauses don\u2019t just belong to SQL, they are also part of almost all programming languages and are used in looping and conditional constructs. Not to get too far away from the point, I want to make a case that SQL will be around not just in the proximal future but in the distant future too.", "I was reading an essay by Paul Graham that talks about the languages of the future. He talks about how languages have evolved in the human timeline and how computer languages have evolved, and how there is a similarity there. It\u2019s an interesting question to ask, isn\u2019t it?", "What kind of programming language will they use to write the software controlling those flying cars?", "We never use the sentence \u2014 SQL is one of the programming languages \u2014 like we use the sentence \u2014 Python is one of the programming languages. SQL is the query language. Then there are flavors of SQL. It is the standard. But to think it can\u2019t change in the future would be an oversight.", "Having worked in this field for quite a bit now, I am aware of many traditional and non-traditional databases that use SQL. I wanted to explore the different flavors of SQL currently in practice. Here\u2019s a compilation of SQL's most used, most popular flavors.", "Most relational databases support the basic SQL functionality written down in the ANSI-92 SQL documentation. On top of that, every database has its own set of additional features, which call for additional SQL statements to utilize those features. Let\u2019s take a look at some of them.", "For the longest time, MySQL didn\u2019t support analytic and window functions. It just supported basic aggregations along with GROUP BY. However, drop-in replacements of MySQL, like Percona Server and MariaDB, had released these features even before MySQL.", "Everything you can do from a SQL client or a SQL terminal shall be considered SQL. For instance, in MySQL, you can run a SHOW SLAVE STATUS command to check the current status of the slave and if the replication is working or not, how far it has progressed, and so on. This is not part of standard SQL and isn\u2019t supported similarly in the other databases. To get to know the SQL-92 standard, you can go through this 500-page document.", "Some of the features unique of MySQL are", "Usually called the programmer\u2019s database, PostgreSQL has established itself as a real competitor to MySQL in the open-source space with native support for advanced abstract data structures like arrays. For instance, to check the replication status, you\u2019d go and check this table \u2014 pg_stat_replication. Some of the features that make PostgreSQL unique are", "Here are a couple of examples of the PostGIS extension at work \u2014", "What can be said about the Oracle database? It\u2019s probably the most resilient and durable database \u2014 which is why it continues to reign in time-critical businesses requiring the strongest ACIDity and the guarantees that come with that.", "Some of the unique features of Oracle databases are", "The one reason why MySQL and PostgreSQL have become more popular over the years is that they\u2019re free to use \u2014 they\u2019re open source. Oracle is the definition of closed-source. The licensing cost could kill a small company. Every business cannot afford proprietary databases like Oracle and SQL Server.", "The ultimate database from Microsoft also boasts similar features and levels of ACID support, etc., just like Oracle. Again, just like Oracle, it\u2019s too costly for most companies. Some of the unique features of SQL Server are", "These are the four main relational databases. I\u2019m not counting DB/2, SQLite, etc., anymore because there are not enough new users for those databases. Wherever DB/2 is being used is probably a legacy system. SQLite is not feature-rich and is unsuitable for production-grade applications.", "Moving on from relational databases, let\u2019s look into some of the databases that identify as NoSQL databases, NewSQL databases, or non-relational data warehouses.", "CQL is Cassandra\u2019s answer to SQL. It\u2019s very much like SQL, but again, like all the other databases you\u2019ll see from now on, this one, too, has additional features about the architectural implementation, which, in turn, necessitates additional features in SQL. For instance, CQL has something called ALLOW FILTERING which is explained very well here:", "Visit this page for the full list of features.", "Initially, Spark didn\u2019t have support for SQL queries, and the queries would have to be written with the Scala or Python APIs for DataFrames. SparkSQL provides another abstraction layer to make it easy for the SQL-educated workforce to fully use their knowledge. Here\u2019s a pretty good introduction to SparkSQL by Databricks", "Here\u2019s what a sample query would look like. You\u2019ll see more and more of new keywords popping in with every other database for features specific to that database.", "Here\u2019s an example from Rittman Mead on how to use SparkSQL:", "Although Spark has a lot to offer even without support for SQL, since it has started supporting SparkSQL, Spark has gained more traction as it has opened up avenues for data analysts and data scientists who otherwise wouldn\u2019t have had the chance to work on Spark (or would have had a steep learning curve).", "With the advent of the Hadoop ecosystem, it quickly got very difficult to analyze huge amounts of data because everyone wasn\u2019t familiar with programming languages, and one would have had to write many lines of code to analyze the data. Facebook had a lot of data to analyze, so they developed this SQL-like query engine that ran on top of Hadoop\u2019s storage system. Hive is also meant to query only structured distributed data. Here\u2019s what a Hive query looks like:", "Here\u2019s a Hive Cheat Sheet if you\u2019re interested.", "InfluxDB is a time-series database for applications that require real-time querying. It\u2019s a use case that traditional databases haven\u2019t supported fully. Some of the new-age streaming pipeline solutions provide this feature with some limitations. InfluxDB, on the other hand, specializes in continuous queries like the following:", "This query gives you the mean/average number of passengers over a period of one hour, and that time period of one hour is continuously changing with every second so the metric we\u2019re getting is a live moving average of passengers over an hour. Isn\u2019t it pretty cool?", "InfluxDB fits several high-volume, real-time, critical data collection applications like IoT, stock market movement data, astronomical data, etc. Here\u2019s a talk from David Simmons from InfluxDB, who discusses IoT use cases with InfluxDB.", "In this talk, David said that Inserts in InfluxDB are more than 50 times faster than MongoDB using the same hardware. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s accurate. Here\u2019s a better article to compare these two technologies", "In comparison to MongoDB, InfluxDB is more than 2 times faster on the same hardware. Try it!", "Although most relational databases now support full-text search, relational databases aren\u2019t meant for extensive full-text searching as it gets costly to manage storage, memory, and indexes after a while. Elasticsearch comes to the rescue as a dedicated full-text search engine.", "Here\u2019s an example POST call with a query payload to Elasticsearch.", "Other full-text search engines like Solr also support SQL syntax.", "The one graph database that matters, neo4j, also greatly supports SQL-like querying. See for yourself. Here\u2019s an example in regular ANSI SQL:", "Here\u2019s what it looks like in Cypher:", "You can learn how to translate regular SQL to Cypher using the guide loaded with simple to complex example conversions.", "Graph databases have picked up in the last couple of years, with one of the main widespread applications being recommendation systems. With increasing social media-based interactions, graph databases are expected to increase.", "Amazon\u2019s key-value and document database offering currently competes mainly with MongoDB. Though DynamoDB doesn\u2019t have native SQL support, an open-source project provides a SQL-like external DSL for querying and scanning data in Amazon DynamoDB. You can check out the project here. Based on my experience, I have made some notes on DynamoDB, you can go and check them here", "StackOverflow recently published its 2020 developer survey. It\u2019s always interesting to know what technologies people are working on worldwide. Because DynamoDB is closed-source and proprietary, it doesn\u2019t get so much attention. Open-source databases occupy the most space in the database world.", "It\u2019s an open-source distributed query engine like Facebook\u2019s Presto which was built to analyze large-scale data (structural and semi-structural). Drill supports a large number of storage file formats and external systems. Drill was inspired by Dremel \u2014 Google\u2019s closed-source large-scale distributed query engine.", "On top of supporting regular SQL, Drill also supports language extensibility like PostgreSQL. You can create user-defined functions using a jar file:", "Find more stuff about SQL support in the official documentation here", "It was one of the first proprietary in-memory columnar databases with additional support for document-based and graph-based data models. HANA is an ACID-compliant database. It is also one of the few databases with extensive native support for spatial, hierarchical, and full-text search queries. Here\u2019s an example of a query with hierarchical functions:", "This query joins the hierarchy to the fact table and calculates various aggregate measures from both the hierarchy itself and the fact table. The result set contains all nodes with a level less than or equal to 2 plus additional subtotal, balance, and total result rows.", "It is one of the first players in the data warehousing business \u2014 Teradata has been active for more than 40 years. Teradata operates mostly like a traditional relational database but is meant for data warehousing. Like Redshift, Teradata is also an MPP system that boasts of being linearly scalable. Here\u2019s a typical Teradata query from their documentation:", "Snowflake is one of the most trusted cloud data warehousing platforms. Competing mainly with Amazon Redshift and Azure SQL DW, Snowflake has managed to separate storage and compute and that\u2019s where it has an advantage. As the data analysis loads vary widely, decoupling storage and compute seems the right way to go.", "Here\u2019s an example of a SQL query in snowflake. Notice that everything except the QUALIFY keyword is exactly what you\u2019d find in any other relational database with full SQL support:", "In a SELECT statement, the QUALIFY clause filters the results of window functions.QUALIFY does with window functions what HAVING does with aggregate functions and GROUP BY clauses.", "One of the measures of how powerful your flavor of SQL is is to go through the full feature set that the database offers \u2014 and find out whether your flavor of SQL is Turing Complete. But even a Turing complete SQL cannot guarantee to handle specific use cases that the query DSL allows but the architecture doesn\u2019t. For this reason, so many flavors of databases/SQL exist. Most companies use more than one of these systems to store and interact with their data at a given time.", "Applications use a mix of relational databases and a document store, but data analysts and data scientists cannot use these systems as they are. Data engineers transport data to systems like data lakes and warehouses from the source systems so that the data can be used for reporting and analysis. I have tried to cover the most popular and loved flavors of SQL, for they have created their market because of their unique features.", "Recently, I wrote about different technologies and concepts that a data engineer needs to be aware of. Some of the technologies discussed weren\u2019t part of that piece. I have tried to incorporate the missing ones here. You can find the article here", "We started with Paul Graham\u2019s idea about how languages would look in a hundred years. It is hard to say what would happen in 100 years, but with a pinch of salt, it is possible to say that SQL will probably be around, more efficient, advanced, and widespread, in the 5-10 years timeframe. There\u2019s no reason to believe otherwise. So while it might seem like a secondary thing, it\u2019s not. SQL is at the center of the software engineering and development process because, as I can\u2019t stop saying, SQL is the language data speak. Learn to speak SQL!", "Your home for data science.
