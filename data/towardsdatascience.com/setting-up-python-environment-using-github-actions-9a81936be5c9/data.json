Configuring Github actions in the project CI folder would protect the codebase pull requests that don\u2019t meet the code standards regarding code formatting, syntax error, and version conflict. So, let\u2019s get started!", "Github actions are plugins that automate and manage the project workflow complete development life cycle. It is similar to Circleci, Travis, and Gitlab in functionality; however, it is free if the project repository is public.", "Workflows for GitHub actions are a series of steps or directions written in the yml file that run every time you push to a specific branch on Github.", "Setting up a workflow is a timesaver in the long run, where you can have peace of mind during pushing/merging code. The workflow could be customized to check against different tests stated as steps on the yml file. These checks could be using the correct version of the coding language, install dependence, or even check against code formatting and syntax error. This way, you could guarantee to be less anxious about merging code into the main branch \u2014 at least nothing would break!", "You might have multiple workflows, and each one might have multiple jobs. The workflow is triggered every time, pushing to a specific branch.", "In this guide, I will use the following:", "Github actions could be configured either on existing repos or creating one from scratch. For the sake of simplicity, I would start a new one from scratch; navigate to GitHub, and create a new repo and name it; I will name it github_actions . Then clone the repo into your local machine and create a GitHub workflow action file on .github/workflows/main.yml \u2014 this where the steps would be defined.", "You could use the github workflows template by heading to the action tap and trigger the yml file.", "You might include a requirements.txt file by running the following command in the terminal:", "Each workflow might have a bunch of jobs, and each job contains several steps to execute.", "I am using the pyenv-action action developed by Gabrial. This action would do the following:", "Open the main.yml file and start configuring pyenv and pick the right python version. The following snippet is installing pyenv using the pyenv-action version 7, then upgrading the pip after picking version 3.8.6 and set it as the default. Following that, create a virtual environment with the default version and install project dependencies.", "It has a successful build, and a green health check would appear associated with the commit id, as demonstrated above.", "It is the same as the previous step; however, we will define the Postgres database connection in the services section using the Postgres docker image.

I started by creating a demo file and developed a method for generating random sampling from an input array of distinct elements and size. All subsets should be equally likely.", "The next step would be committing and pushing the Github repository changes using a pull request or direct push to master. Once the changes are made to the remote, different tests would be run against the changes before merging the changes into master.", "As shown in the above image, there was an error generating because of inadequate formatting according to the pylint package; some of the errors were because I didn\u2019t follow the snake_case naming conventions. As you can see, the pushed code had a rate of 4.29/10.", "If you want to ignore the pylint checks for docstring, you could create a newfile named .pylint and add the following snippet into it to ignore docstring module.", "Now commit and push the Github repository changes after creating the pylint file, the build should be successful, and a healthy green check would appear near the repo \ud83d\ude0e.", "Github action is a powerful plugin that empowers the process of automating the machine learning development cycle. You could add more steps and jobs to the workflow, including deployment to different platforms, such as Iaas, Paas, Saas, and onsite premises. Also, it allows you to use docker containers as well as Kubernetes. There are plenty of GitHub-actions built by the community\u2019s marketplace; you can even create your customized action if you have a programming background or follow the documentation.", "Some of the references that helped me to configure this workflow are:", "Finally, I hope this provided a comprehensive guide to utilizing the GitHub actions to automate machine learning projects.
