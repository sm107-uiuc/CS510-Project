Good interviews have structure.", "Part 4. Good companies respect their candidates time.", "Part 5. Don\u2019t get emotional about compensation.", "A job description is often a candidates first exposure to your company and the role. If it\u2019s bad, you\u2019re going to attract the desperate or those that fail to read for detail. However, if you create job descriptions that position the impact the role can have on the company/world, and clearly set expectations for your candidates on what you\u2019re looking for/need, you start your discussion with a new candidate at a significant advantage \u2014 they\u2019ve already bought into your vision.", "Data scientists are useful creatures within any institution, but their role and job descriptions are often poorly defined. Thus, job descriptions for data scientists often come across vague, filled with red flag tropes like, \u2018work hard, play hard\u2019, or may even advertise your ignorance in the field (e.g., asking for more years experience in a software/package than is technically possible).", "As an aside, here\u2019s a great article from thinkful summarizing the differences between software engineering and data science (data science vs software engineering).

I have observed that most strong data scientists are driven by their motivation to make large-scale impact, to innovate/create something new, and to accelerate science.", "By definition, data scientists are interested in solving hard problems with smart people. What this means is that if your company is not known for data science, or innovation, or solving hard problems, you need to clearly establish why a data scientist would want to work for you.", "Here\u2019s a basic template for how to overcome the \u2018why\u2019 question:", "Here\u2019s an example from a position I\u2019m currently trying to fill that I think works nicely.", "Do things that matter. Diabetes, congestive heart failure, COPD, back pain, asthma, pulmonary fibrosis, chronic kidney disease, Alzheimer\u2019s, multiple sclerosis, cancer\u2026 everyone knows someone affected by these chronic conditions. Our goal is to decrease cost and improve health for members with chronic disease.

You care deeply about credible measurement and experimental design, and you are old hat at developing business cases and presenting to executive leadership.", "Research and Development data scientists.

They need to have deep experience coding and developing pipelines, in coordination with our other spheres and our data engineering colleagues.", "An important note on the ^^: The worst thing you can do here is oversell, if you\u2019re looking for a data scientist level 7 wizard to take command of the corporate scientific strategy \u2014 great. However, if what you actually need is someone to write SQL queries you\u2019re going to set yourself up for failure. These days, there\u2019s no shortage of websites where people can \u2018yelp\u2019 your company/interview/you. Not everyone wants a grandiose role. Those that do, are often unsatisfied with anything else, meaning that you\u2019re likely going to be looking for a new person sooner than you might otherwise.", "After you\u2019ve established the opportunity, follow-up with some fundamental actions that someone successful in the role will take. The specific actions, obviously, depend on the role.

Here\u2019s an example:", "At Aetna, a CVS Health company, we are joined in a common purpose: helping people on their path to better health. We are working to transform health care through innovations that make quality care more accessible, easier to use, less expensive, and patient-focused. Working together and organizing around the individual, we are pioneering a new approach to total health that puts people at the heart.", "Ok\u2026so this is a bit pretentious, but it\u2019s healthcare and some excuses should be made. That said, if you\u2019re looking for a data scientist to help you sell cars, you might consider dropping words like \u2018passion\u2019 in favor of \u2018impact\u2019 and other relatable factors (improve a frustrating experience, help those in need, etc\u2026).", "Finally, if you want people who are passionate about something (e.g., patient healthcare, experimental design, coffee, whatever), SAY IT. Some of the best conversations I\u2019ve had with candidates have come after they\u2019ve expressed that this role \u2018spoke to them\u2019 because you took 20 seconds to articulate that you want a real human to work with, not data science terminator\u2026", "Also, proofread.
