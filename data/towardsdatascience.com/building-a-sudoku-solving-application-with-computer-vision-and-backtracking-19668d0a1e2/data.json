The condition to have a valid solution to this puzzle is that no digit is used twice in any row, column, or 3x3 sub-grid.", "The number of possible 9x9 grids is 6.67\u00d710^21 so finding a solution can sometimes be challenging depending on the initial puzzle. In this project, we will build a Streamlit application that can automatically solve Sudoku puzzles given a screenshot of one.", "We will first build an Object Character Recognition model that can extract digits from a Sudoku grid image and then work on a backtracking approach to solve it. The final application will be accessible through an easy to use Streamlit application.", "The Sudoku python representation and the first version of the solver were both mostly taken and modified from this Repo: https://github.com/RutledgePaulV/sudoku-generator", "Once we have an image of a puzzle we need to extract all the digits that are written there, as well as their position.", "To do that, we will train a digit detector model and then a digit recognizer model. The first one will tell us where does a digit appears in the image and the second one will tell us which digit it is. We will also get a data-set for both of those tasks.", "The detector model we will use is based on a fully convolutional neural network with skip connections, very similar to what we used in previous projects like :", "You can read those two posts if you want to learn more about image segmentation.", "The objective of this model is to output a binary mask that tells us, for each pixel of the input image, if it is part of a digit or not.", "The recognizer model\u2019s role is to take as input a single digit and predict which one it is from the set {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. It is a mostly convolutional network but the output is a fully connected layer with softmax activation.", "To train the two networks described above we need annotated data. Instead of manually annotating a bunch of Sudoku grids we can generate a synthetic data-set since it does not cost much and hope it works \ud83d\ude09.", "To have a realistic data-set we use multiple types of fonts, sizes, background colors, grid elements \u2026", "Since we generate those examples from scratch, we can get all the details about the position and the class of each digit in the image.", "We will use backtracking to solve the Sudoku. This method allows us to step-by-step build candidate solutions in a tree-like shape and then prune this tree if we find out that a sub-tree cannot yield a feasible solution.", "The way we will do it in the case of Sudoku is as follows :", "If after exploring all the possible leaves of this tree we can\u2019t find a solution then this Sudoku is unsolvable.", "The advantage of backtracking is that it is guaranteed to find a solution or prove that one does not exist. The issue is, while it is generally fast in 9x9 Sudoku grids, its time complexity in the general case is horrendous.", "Implementation ( Some operations, like sorting, are performed in the \u201cBoard\u201d class):", "We build the app using Streamlit. The app needs to allow us to upload an image, solve the Sudoku, and display the results.", "Streamlit provides a simple way to create a file upload widget using st.file_uploader.", "We apply the detector and recognizer model to create the grid.", "We use backtracking to solve the Sudoku.", "We Display the results in a nice looking Html/Css table by specifying unsafe_allow_html=True.", "In this small project, we build a Sudoku solving application in Streamlit.
