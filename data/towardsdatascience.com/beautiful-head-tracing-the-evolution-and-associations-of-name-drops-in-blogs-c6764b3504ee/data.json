(In his context, he is concerned with authoritative names in academic discourse, but we can extend the discussion into the public discourse with little loss.) This implies that there is some threshold where the mechanism of name-dropping (referencing) becomes name-dropping proper. Kray further acknowledges that it is not easy to pin down name-dropping as simply a fallacious appeal to authority \u2014 that there is something more peculiar about the act that requires us to perceive it as a social practice rather than a rhetorical logic device.", "He refers to Goffman\u2019s classical study The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life:", "\u201cWhen an individual enters the presence of others, they commonly seek to acquire information about him or to bring into play information about him already possessed.

On one hand, name-dropping, whether to impress or not, is expected to build credibility and yet paradoxically, there is a latent skepticism that one is dropping names only to build credibility. In a strange twist, the conditions for credibility are cause for suspicion if one thinks this appeal for credibility is to mask something non-credible\u2026 this contradictory injunction arises from the structure of scientific discourse itself:", "\u201c\u2026The young scientist must learn both when to accept the authority of the consensus and when to resist it.\u201d (Overington 1977)", "\u201cA requirement like this is paradoxical in nature. The neophyte must learn to follow tradition while remaining sufficiently skeptical toward it. Every failure to meet the expectations connected to it will immediately be noticed.

Though as paradoxical it may be, this simultaneously acknowledges why we cannot refrain from name-dropping:", "\u201c..dropping names is a practice that cannot be avoided precisely because it links us to the intellectual heritage of our discipline\u2019s history.

While Kray ultimately frames a trust-skepticism tension that will exist inevitably and has to be navigated through experience, Jacobs takes the notion to its logical conclusion \u2014 that a command to \u2018think for yourself\u2019 often just means \u2018to think with the people I think through rather than who you are thinking through\u2019. For Jacobs, it would be silly to think there is a \u2018thought\u2019 that comes to us untainted by intellectual associations. To go further, Jacobs also makes the bold claim that were thinking for yourself not impossible, it would be undesirable.", "To think independently of other human beings is impossible, and if it were possible it would be undesirable. Thinking is necessarily, thoroughly, and wonderfully social. Everything you think is a response to what someone else has thought and said.

This does not, of course, translate into the phenomenon of name-dropping directly but it does open up the possibility of seeing names as orienting mediums \u2014 that is, mediums that construct and shape their content beyond just making it visible.", "As mediums, names can become \u2018anchors\u2019 of dynamic networks \u2014 stabilizing various concepts and topics over time in our knowledge domain as well as structuring how we both perceive and present them. Essentially, this gives us our second motivation. Most network analysis have tried not to favour one textual phenomenon over another or introduce hierarchies (part of a larger notion to \u201clet the data talk\u201d without interference of theory), but if names are truly privileged (as mediums governing all other concepts), network analysis techniques that rely largely on counts, aggregates, sums, etc. may not reveal their special status.", "Therefore, conceptualizing name-drops as mediums that anchor concepts, coupled with Goffman\u2019s implication of names as a uniquely informative social strategy, provides the underlying drive for this project \u2014 which is to attempt visualizations of dynamic information networks that privileges name-drops as the mediums described above.", "Though we have our motivation, I would like to use this section to caution that while this is a sort of \u201cin Praise of Name-dropping\u201d project, I am not eliminating the possibility of fallacious or vulgar uses that cause us annoyance. I do agree with Klay\u2019s assessment that there is a \u2018tipping point\u2019 when we label something name-dropping rather than mere referencing. However, I am bringing into question our determination of that point \u2014 specifically, the accusation that someone is name-dropping seems to have equal potential for sinister motives than the actual act of name-dropping.", "It seems that what separates the annoying phenomenon of name-dropping from something less annoying is really our judgement of the name-dropper\u2019s dark, deep intention \u2014 are they gesturing at this name to impress us or is it more akin to paying homage to the thinkers they are thinking through? In fact, stripping name-dropping of any vulgar desire to impress extraordinary appearance of oneself, but keeping more or less the same mechanism (i.e. alluding to someone else, who serves some sort of function for your expression), the act of name-dropping is reduced to little more than banal \u201cboilerplate for expression\u201d \u2014 acts we may call \u2018giving credit\u2019, \u2018referencing\u2019, or \u2018citing sources\u2019. Nevertheless, it is boilerplate we gladly tolerate in society because it provides safety from the even more unfathomable alternative of plagiarism.", "So I sense an equally paradoxical tension in the social-shame of name dropping.. on one hand, we are required to present our references to safeguard ourselves from the crime of plagiarism and one the other hand, there is an overflowing pressure to \u2018present our own thoughts\u2019, and the fear that \u2018name-dropping correlates with intellectual insecurity\u2019. In fact, if Alan Jacobs is right in that thinking for ourselves is impossible and undesirable \u2014 and I tend to think he is \u2014 the question could radically transform into \u2018why aren\u2019t we name-dropping more?\u2019 (under a certain notion of plagiarism and intellectual property).", "Letham, in his glorious essay The Ecstasy of Influence , boldly acknowledges this tension and argues for a radical embrace, arguing that denying the inevitability of plagiaristic activity is a \u2018source hypocrisy\u2019.

The kernel, the soul \u2014 let us go further and say the substance, the bulk, the actual and valuable material of all human utterances \u2014 is plagiarism. For substantially all ideas are secondhand, consciously and unconsciously drawn from a million outside sources, and daily used by the garnerer with a pride and satisfaction born of the superstition that he originated them; whereas there is not a rag of originality about them anywhere except the little discoloration they get from his mental and moral caliber and his temperament, and which is revealed in characteristics of phrasing. Old and new make the warp and woof of every moment. There is no thread that is not a twist of these two strands. By necessity, by proclivity, and by delight, we all quote. Neurological study has lately shown that memory, imagination, and consciousness itself is stitched, quilted, pastiched. If we cut-and-paste our selves, might we not forgive it of our artworks?", "Furthering, or perhaps stealing, this thought, Austin Kleon, through his project Steal Like an Artist (which in my reading expands beyond his book and up to his virtual identity) provides pragmatic guidelines for this \u201ccut-and-paste\u201d methodology of creativity and ideation. He outlines it succinctly in a Good-Theft / Bad-Theft comparison:", "In this sense, name-dropping is almost good manners \u2014 a means of not only fairly crediting but also honouring your \u2018heroes\u2019. (Note that in this project\u2019s conceptualizing of name-drops, they are not necessarily \u2018heroes\u2019 \u2014 as mediums, they could be anti-heroes, habitual objects of critique, etc.). So far you will notice that I have referred to a form of name-dropping which some might be inclined to view as simply referencing \u2014 but referencing is closer to the notion of a formal citation, rather than an informal, casual, good-theft mention like name-dropping. As Kleon emphasizes: \u201cIf it feels cheap or wrong to you, it probably is. I advocate an \u201celevator gut check\u201d for one\u2019s own work: If you met the artist you\u2019re stealing from in a stalled elevator, would they shake your hand or punch you in the face?\u201d It\u2019s not too difficult to apply this advice to the tension of name-dropping itself.", "Therefore, through the notions outlined in Letham\u2019s essay and Kleon\u2019s work (which is very popular among artists, writers, etc.), we can also observe personal theoretical frameworks \u2014 that govern someone\u2019s writings and other outputs \u2014 incentivizing name-dropping. This adds support to treating name-drops as an object of analysis as well as provides us with a context where such an analysis may flourish: a learning-in-public context. Learning-in-public is a loose term I use to describe an increasing trend within blogs and micro-blogs (social media) to document one\u2019s learnings (and thus the mediums they learn through). Kleon self-ascribes this process to his online output, referencing C.S. Lewis:", "\u201cI write for the unlearned about things in which I am unlearned myself\u2026 It often happens that two schoolboys can solve difficulties in their work for one another better than the master can\u2026 I write as one amateur to another, talking about difficulties I have met, or lights I have gained\u2026\u201d \u2014 C.S.

As Kleinberg demonstrates, tracking the evolution of topics over time, recognizing \u2018events\u2019 within streams, and informational visualization are all important aspects of the field \u2014 and this project touches all of these slightly. As mentioned earlier, fundamentally, this work is closer to providing a possible form of information visualization \u2014 one that privileges name-drops within an information network. Though certainly not close to the rigiour of formal studies \u2014 I don\u2019t really \u2018test\u2019 anything \u2014 , this is an informal exploration into what an approach might look like \u2014 and the interestingness of its results \u2014 if we were to visualize through a social theory of name-drops rather than a completely data-oriented approach.", "\u201cWhat are the right techniques for dealing with the temporal dynamics of information streams? Some of the complexities inherent in such streams can be seen in the paradigmatic examples of news and e-mail. Each provides a reader with a sequence of documents exhibiting a braided and episodic character: braided, in the sense that many parallel, topically coherent streams are merged and interwoven into the single stream that the reader sees; and episodic, in the sense that topics generally grow in intensity over a temporally coherent period, and then fade again. Despite these twin sources of complexity, however, these information streams in their raw forms lack any explicit organizing structure beyond the granularity of individual articles or messages. Thus, a first step in working with such information streams is to define appropriate structures that abstract their intertwined topics, their multiple bursty episodes, and their long-term trends.\u201d \u2014 Kleinberg, Temporal Dynamics of On-Line Information Streams", "There are numerous steps involved in generating this analysis, each with intricate technical parameter tunings to get meaningful results. Since I don\u2019t ultimately develop anything new here \u2014 but simply cut-and-paste various data mining, information visualization, and network science techniques \u2014 I will only go over the high level technical steps.", "The data for this project comes in the format of a stream of time stamped documents. Specifically, I scrape Austin Kleon\u2019s blog site to get each blog post (we will call this a document) and when it was published.", "Extracting Name-drops and Content To get our units of analysis, I pass each document through a parser, POS tagged, and a page rank algorithm to get the following:", "Generating Initial NetworkFor each name-drop that appears together in the same document, I formulate a connection between them with a relative weight of how important both terms are. Doing this for every pair of name-drops generated a network of nodes and edges. Since I am interested in name-drops that serve the most medium-like role, I measure each node\u2019s information-centrality \u2014 which calculates relative to edge weight \u2014 and extract the top 5%. Presumably, this provides us with the name-drops that have served the most central role over time.", "Note that name-drops other than the extracted 5% are treated like content. Essentially, these other name-drops, though mediums in their own right, are not strong enough to separate from the content for the sake of these visualizations.", "Following the media theorist Marshall McLuhan, we can also conceptualize that \u201cthe \u201ccontent\u201d of any medium is always another medium\u201d. Therefore, we are really just trying to extract the most relevant mediums \u2014 name-drops, nouns, proper nouns, are all mediums in a sense \u2014 and labeling the rest as \u201ccontent\u201d.", "Similarly, for each time step, we formulate connections between Name-drops and content based on if they appear in blog posts together. This gives us our dynamic network.", "Demo: Austin Kleon\u2019s Dynamic Network Animation", "The first view I present is semi-informative \u2014 it presents a story, but not seamlessly, though I include it nevertheless \u2014 and semi-art. The idea here is to create an animation that emphasizes specific properties of the network of Name-drops and content as it evolves over time.", "The general idea is to visualize when name-drops appear, their weight in the author\u2019s texts based on their vertical position and size and what is the specificity of the content they connect with based on their horizontal position. This results in an animation that shows the story of name-drops as mediums, navigating their place in an author\u2019s knowledge domain and information stream dependant on the content that is thought and presented through them.", "Demo: Austin Kleon\u2019s Diagram of Associations", "If we remove the animating factor from the previous view and summarize association weights, we can visualize a summarizing diagram that visualizes the influence and associations between the name-drops (author\u2019s mediums) as well as content.", "This view works interactively, the idea is to hover over a name-drop node to see its past or future influence on other name-drops.", "How to read this view after interaction:", "In general, hovering over a name-drop node Z highlights all the other nodes in the diagram that influence (in the future) or have been influenced (in the past) by node Z. This influence is a weighted measure calculated through connections with content-nodes taking into account the significance of the content node and name-drops in the author\u2019s works. Theoretically, this visual displays the influence between mediums over time \u2014 emphasizing the progression of influences that shape the author\u2019s works \u2014 as well as the large concepts that are widely discussed.", "Finally, if we further summarize the summarizing diagram, we can remove content nodes from the view and simply display the associations between name-drops. This serves as the simplest, most readable visual among the 3 that attempts to express the quickest history of an author\u2019s name-drops. The matrix, even without a detailed read, points to a \u2018gut-feeling\u2019 of how authors may work through their mediums.", "In general, hovering over a cell highlights the relevant name-drops whose association it represents. Practically speaking, looking at a column of cells for a given name-drop X on the horizontal axis reads as \u201chow strongly past connections of name-drop X influenced the future connections of other name-drops\u201d. Inversely, looking at a row of cells for a given name-drop Y on the vertical axis reads as \u201chow strong were the connections of name-drop Y influenced by the past connections of other name-drops\u201d. (Connections means the links between a name-drop and content nodes and influence is measured the same way as previous views \u2014 through a weighted measure of the connections with shared content nodes). Theoretically, this visual emphasizes both the major name-drops as well as what and when the name-drops are influencing. Furthermore, as the matrix is not symmetrical \u2014 the influence of name-drop X on name-drop Y does not equal the influence of Y on X \u2014 the visual depicts the reciprocity of influence between name-drops and any significant imbalances.", "In this section, I want to write out some general thoughts on the limitations of this approach and the insights these visualizations can provide.", "Perhaps the immediate effect of the presented visuals stems directly from the motivation \u2014 they serve as a (grand) \u2018informative gesture\u2019 that quickly disseminates the image of the self that authors wish to depict to their readers. By eliminating excess connections and scoping down to what can be safely visualized, this project tries to present the significantly habitual moves within an information stream (in this case, an author\u2019s blog). By visualizing habits in such a way, a reader can use these visualizations to quickly gauge multiple properties of an information stream, including:", "Thinking through these above properties and many others that are difficult to enumerate, combined with Kray and Goffman\u2019s theoretical notion of name-drops as informational gestures to inform-in-advance, we can conceptualize the visualizations as a grand informative gesture. As a grand gesture, the visualizations inform and prepare the audience for the information they can expect in advance through an aggregate view of the history of name-drops. Note that such a gesture does not necessarily rely on a reader\u2019s knowledge of the name-drops \u2014 name-drops in everyday conversation seldom do \u2014 but present an \u2018image\u2019 of the author (Goffman\u2019s self-presentation theory). This image itself is a medium through which we can perceive the author\u2019s information stream \u2014 as a crude, intuitive example, seeing a matrix of a variety of weighty name-drops with a spread of influence vs. a matrix of a single high-weight name-drop with little influence can immediately give us a different idea of what we can expect from the author\u2019s texts.
