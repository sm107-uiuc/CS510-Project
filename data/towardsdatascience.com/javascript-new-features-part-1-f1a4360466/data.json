The javascript parsing is 2x faster, promise on an avg is 11x faster on node version \u226511 from node version 8. The memory consumption as decreased -20%. So there is an improvement in performance and usability.", "In this article, we will see some of the presents and purposed features that you can test in chrome browser (version \u226576) or Node.js(version \u226511) CLI.", "Until ES6, we were not able to declare private properties directly. Yes there were ways like underscore convention (_propertyName), closures, symbols, or WeakMaps.", "But now private class fields use a hash # prefix. Let\u2019s learn it by an example.", "Note: There\u2019s no way to define private function as of now, although a TC39 stage 3: draft proposal suggests using a hash # prefix on names. \ud83e\udd1e", "If I have a string, with a global regular expression which has many capturing groups, I often want to iterate through all groups. Currently, my options are the following:", "The issues with the above approach are that they only work if /g is set on regular expression and the property .lastIndex of a regular expression is changed each time a match happens. This makes using the same regular expression at multiple locations risky.", "The matchAll() help resolve all above. Let\u2019s check out the definition and usage", "Given a string and a regular expression, .matchAll() returns all results matching a string against a regular expression, including capturing groups.", "Note: .matchAll() returns an iterator, not a true restartable iterable. That is, once the result is exhausted, you need to call the method again and create a new iterator.", "If you have struggled to read a long sequence of number, this is where your search end.", "Numeric Separators allow the human eye to parse quickly, especially when there are lots of repeating digits:", "Now it\u2019s easier to tell that the first number is a trillion, and the second number is in the order of 1 billion.", "It also works on other bases, for example:", "You can also use the separator in the fractions and exponents:", "BigInts are a new numeric primitive in JavaScript that can represent integers with precision larger than 2\u2075\u00b3\u20131. With BigInts, you can safely store and operate on large integers even beyond the safe integer limit for Numbers .", "BigInts correctly perform integer arithmetic without overflowing. Let\u2019s understand by an example:-", "We can see that max + 1 produces the same result as max + 2 .", "Any calculation on integers outside the safe integer range (i.e. from Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER to Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER) potentially loses precision. For this reason, we can only rely on numeric integer values within the safe range.", "Therefore, BigInts came to existence, BigInts can be created by adding the n suffix to any integer literal. For example, 123 becomes 123n or the global BigInt(number) function can be used to convert a Number into a BigInts.", "Let\u2019s revisit the above example with BigInts", "Note: Numeric separators are especially helpful with BigInts, for eg:", "BigInts support the most common operators. Binary +, -, *, and ** all work as expected. / and % work, and round towards zero as needed.", "Note: One gotcha is that it\u2019s not allowed to mix operations between BigInts and Numbers", "The toLocaleString() method returns a string with a language-sensitive representation of the BigInt.", "JavaScript\u2019s variable scopes are nested and form a tree whose root is the global scope and the value of the this keyword is a reference to the object that \u201cowns\u201d the currently executing code or the function where its looked at.", "To read more about this keyword and global scope read my below articles", "Usually to figure out the global this we use a function like", "The above function does not cover all cases when we need global this value.", "To solve the above problem globalThis keyword is introduced which returns global this object in any environment at any time.", "Note: The global object is now considered a mistake that JavaScript can\u2019t get rid of, due to backward compatibility. It affects performance negatively and is generally confusing.", "If you are wondering what\u2019s promise is in javascript then check out this \u2014 JavaScript Promises: an Introduction.", "A little gist, a promise is JavaScript\u2019s way of promising you that work will be done (or might fail if the work could not be completed).", "The new method returns a promise that resolves after all of the given promises have settled i.e either resolved or rejected, with an array of objects that each describe the outcome of each promise.", "This is different from the Promise.all as it rejects as soon as a promise within the iterable object rejected.", "Below is the comparison of current supported promises method", "This one is crazy before we dive into it, let\u2019s first see what static import is.", "Static import only accepts a string literal as the module specifier and introduces bindings into the local scope via a pre-runtime \u201clinking\u201d process.", "The static import syntax can only be used at the top-level of the file.", "Static import enables important use cases such as static analysis, bundling tools, and tree-shaking.", "This was not possible until dynamic imports \u2014 import(moduleSpecifier) returns a promise for the module namespace object of the requested module, which is created after fetching, instantiating, and evaluating all of the module\u2019s dependencies, as well as the module itself.", "Note: Use static imports for initial paint dependencies, especially for above-the-fold content. In other cases, consider loading dependencies on-demand with dynamic import().", "By Stable in the algorithmic sense means: does it preserve the order or otherwise \u201cequal\u201d items?", "If you\u2019re getting one of the last three results, then you\u2019re probably using Google Chrome, or maybe one of an assortment of browsers that do not implement Array.sort() as a \u201cstable\u201d algorithm.", "This is because different JS engines (across different browsers) taking different routes to implement sort, Also, some javascript engines use stable sort for short array but for long array uses unstable sort.", "This leads to inconsistent sort stability behavior and a lot of confusion. This is why in the development environment everything related to sort seems to work but in the production environment, we start to see something else due to the varying size of array the sort was tested on.", "Note: There are 3rd party libraries, I heartily recommend Lodash, which has stable sort", "But this has been resolved now, we have a stable sort on most of the browsers. The syntax remains the same.", "Since this article has a lot to digest and try-test features, we will continue with the more new feature in the next one.", "Please consider entering your email here if you\u2019d like to be added to my email list and follow me on medium to read more article on javascript and on github to see my crazy code.
