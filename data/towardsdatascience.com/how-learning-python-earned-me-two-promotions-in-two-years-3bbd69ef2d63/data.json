But behind all of this stood a simple insight: Focus on what\u2019s in your control. One can generate lots of value with small, zero-budget projects by standing on the shoulders of (open-source) giants. Larger assignments will come naturally.", "I am neither a motivational coach nor a professional developer \u2014 and what might be a successful pattern in my environment might not be the case in yours. I helped dozens of colleagues starting their coding journey and have seen the following playbook work out \u2014 that\u2019s why I decided to share it further, and I hope it can help you get started as well.", "To understand my story, it helps to know that I was always fascinated by technology. One of my first memories is playing with an old radio, taking it apart, inspecting the circuits, and reassembling it again (needless to say that the radio stopped working). As a teenager, I was fascinated by consoles and computers. I was always keen on learning how to program, but most of my attempts did not go beyond the replication of tutorials. During my time at university, I was writing small applications here and there, but it never really became a habit. When I started my first job at a large financial service company, I had big hopes.", "I\u2019ve been hired as a financial/economic valuation analyst straight after university. My dream was to write code, become a developer, and solve problems with technology. I imagined telling my manager & colleagues about an idea and then get an official mandate to proceed. Sounds delusional, right? How would anyone put their trust into my ideas if there was no substance or evidence that they could succeed? And on top, that wasn\u2019t what I was hired for.", "Surprise, surprise \u2014 the big assignments never came. Time passed by and I was three years into my first job. I kept watching tech conference broadcasts, reading blogs, seeing what awesome products the thriving open-source community was producing. My desire for becoming a developer was growing but the situation wasn\u2019t changing. I learned a lot about financial modelling and economic frameworks. But deep inside I was keen on applying the fancy technologies Silicon Valley companies boasted about.", "\ud83d\udca1 Wishing and hoping for the perfect assignment to fall into your lap is a nice dream \u2014 but unlikely and beyond your control.", "At university, the .NET framework with C# was my tech stack of choice. Up to this day, I still love the elegance and expressiveness of the C# language. However, at work, I was mostly crunching data and back then .NET libraries didn\u2019t seem most suitable for data science problems. So, I turned my attention to Python. Since I desperately wanted to write code, I entered a challenge: Write Python code for 100 days in my free time \u2014 without excuse. Some days were a delight and I couldn\u2019t stop coding for hours. On other days I felt lazy and wrote only a few lines. But I pushed through and after 100 days I wondered what my next step would be.", "Around that time, I had an assignment at work, for which I had to repeatedly perform some data validations for financial reports. In the beginning, it was interesting. Though, after like the 5th time I got bored of creating the same ten pivot tables in Excel, over and over again. That was when I felt urged to put my newly acquired Python skills into practice.", "Python with the pandas package offers all data crunching functionality that Excel does. However, while Excel gives you control over each single cell, with pandas you are thinking in table columns (vectors). Let\u2019s say you want to sum up two columns. In Excel, you define a formula in the first row and drag it down. With pandas, you are referring to column names \u2014 and behind the scenes, the operation will be applied to the entire column in one go. So you never need to adjust your logic if you suddenly have more rows. Data aggregations can typically be written with as little as one line of code.", "That fitted perfectly for my task since most of the checks I performed were simple aggregations and comparisons. You would think I was prepared after 100 days of coding with tutorials. Unfortunately, they did not teach me how to tackle the problems myself. It\u2019s one thing to follow a tutorial but a totally different one to translate a problem into manageable steps.", "Google was my best friend. Step-by-step, I crawled through blogs and StackOverflow questions until I could translate the problems into code. It was painfully slow, but eventually, the automation of all checks was complete. The hours it took to manually perform all the validations turned into an exercise of only a few seconds now.", "\ud83d\udca1 Following tutorials is a good starting point. However, to properly learn a programming language you have to find your own problem and solve it. Even better if you are paid to do so anyway.", "With this first success I was motivated. At that time, no-one in my team was using Python at work. Most people knew Excel VBA, PowerQuery and Access. When I demonstrated the benefits of Python, it gained lots of interest. People perceived Python as being easy to read and quite a few of my colleagues got inspired to learn the language, too. Even though I was a relative beginner, I was suddenly in the situation that I could advise others and help them get started.", "This on its own exposed me to totally new problems. Discussing them with my colleagues and eventually implementing many of the ideas together, I learned a lot about the language but also about best practices. Collaborating with a team on complex problems nudged me to expand my horizon with version control, unit testing and continuous integration/continuous deployment.", "\ud83d\udca1 Show your product(s) \u2014 people around you might face similar challenges. In the worst case they won\u2019t be interested, and you lose absolutely nothing. In the best case they will promote your work and bring new problems to your attention where you can sharpen your skills.", "From there on challenges kept getting bigger and bigger. Eventually a series of unexpected events rendered a legacy financial application useless \u2014 and my department was relying on it to publish financial results.", "What once was delusional, was now a natural choice. I was asked to put together a team and lead the development of a modern Python application. Time frame: two months. Together with my small team we pulled it off and delivered on time (I\u2019m proud that two years later the app is still productive!).", "Despite it being a nerve-wracking challenge, I never perceived it as unsolvable. But I\u2019m convinced, if I had kept waiting delusionally for the moment of getting my big assignment, the whole project would have failed miserably \u2014 and with it my dreams. Instead, slowly building up my and my teams skills set us up for success.", "What happened afterwards was outside my control. I got a first promotion and pay rise for the achievements from the Python dev project. The success story earned me a reputation, which landed me a new job within a year. Today I am responsible for data integration in a finance function. I use state-of-the-art data platforms and distributed computing to solve problems that would have been unimaginable a few years ago. I learn from smart people and love the new challenges.", "\ud83d\udca1 Start small and level up. Then you will be prepared for the bigger challenges when they come \u2014 and they will come", "Learning Python was a tough journey. But it would have been absolutely impossible without the open-source community which created the fantastic tools, the training material, and the answers to so many questions. I realized I\u2019ve been consuming all that in the last years. So it was long overdue to contribute and be active. Tweeting and blogging about technology & offering help are humble starting points \u2014 and I\u2019m keen on doing so much more!", "In the future, I will post more about Python and technology \u2014 if you liked the post follow me on Twitter, I\u2019d be happy to hear your thoughts and personal story \u2728", "Big thanks to Yingying for the thorough review and great feedback! \ud83d\udc4f You can read about her exciting journey into tech here \ud83d\ude80:", "Your home for data science.
