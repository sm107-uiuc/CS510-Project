I am not writing this article to pretend that I am either. Talk to me in 15 years and then I might consider myself to be approaching the expert title. I am on a path of learning something new and implementing it in real world situations every single day. This mindset is needed in the field and is a given for success.", "Like almost every other path to success, it all begins with a healthy mindset. If you cannot believe in yourself to be successful, then who will?", "It is extremely easy to compare yourself to the Ian Goodfellows, Andrew Ngs, and Lex Fridmans of the world. I do it all the time. However, the only thing they really have when compared to me is time \u2014 which is why they are who they are today. They decided to forge their own path, put in the work, deal with the stresses that come with that work and let time take its course. You and I \u2014nothing more than rookies when compared to Ian, Andrew, and Lex\u2014 must do the same.", "Patience mixed with long-term thinking will always yield success. If you want success quick, you can probably do it. Discussing the sustainability of that success is another conversation, however. Your mindset is key in deterring short term gratification for long term gains. This is the best sacrifice you can make for yourself, because you get to choose that sacrifice. My guess is that when you see those long term gains finally manifest, you won\u2019t look back at what you did as a sacrifice.", "With all of this being said, I would like to also hand off some of my favorite free resources for this field in hopes that your career will benefit from it.", "I was appalled when I saw Anthony\u2019s article on TDS. This YouTube channel covers nearly every key topic in Machine Learning that technology firms want out of a Machine Learning Engineer. If you want to learn more about the channel, I recommend you read article I mentioned above.", "Reddit\u2019s communities span across every single topic or interest you can find, with the field of Machine Learning being no exception. This resource is not like Machine Learning University where it is strictly tutorials and case studies, but rather serves as a broader community for those who feel isolated from the field. While learning new tasks and skills is extremely important, having a community to share what you learn is equally as valuable to your growth as an ML Engineer.", "Lex Fridman, as I mentioned above, is one of the few at the forefront of AI research. His podcast \u2014 formally called the Artificial Podcast with Lex Fridman \u2014 The Lex Fridman Podcast brings on various scientists of all disciplines and fields including but not limited to AI, Computer Science, Physics, Mathematics, and so much more. His YouTube channel, which hosts the video portion of the podcast, also contains his Deep Learning lectures at MIT \u2014 which I find to be extremely valuable.", "This podcast is one of the few that make me think hard with every episode regardless of who is speaking. The podcast is available wherever you listen to your podcasts.", "sentdex is a YouTube channel with various types of Python programming tutorials ranging from all levels of experience. When I first started to learn Python, his channel served as an exceptional resource to lay the foundations I am currently operating from. Whether it\u2019s becoming more familiar with Python, learning how to use Google Cloud, or building a Neural Network from scratch, setdex has you covered from these topics to everywhere in between. For those who are self taught, I heavily recommend using this channel as your \u201csearch engine\u201d for topics you may not be familiar with.", "Tech with Tim is a YouTube Channel with various tutorials and projects to learn and get inspiration from. Many of his projects are in Python, so if you are newer to the language this alongside with sentdex will be an invaluable combination to your growth as a Python programmer. Tim\u2019s projects utilize a lot of AI as well as some of them focused around game development for those interested in blending the two fields together.", "To become an expert in anything, it takes time, patience, and a sense of community. I hope that these resources (alongside my motivational introduction) can help you push forward during trying times and achieve your greatest dreams.", "Your home for data science.
