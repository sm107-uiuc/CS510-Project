He was a thespian at heart, knew how to hold an audience\u2019s attention, but the encouragement he showed those under his tutelage was no act; I have never met a more naturally caring, generous, and supportive person, and I consider it my personal privilege to have known him and to have spent some time under his wings.", "He passed earlier this year\u2013\u2013a loss for the whole data science community\u2013\u2013and I\u2019ve had it on my mind lately to share his iconic blueprint for a data science presentation. I\u2019ve used this blueprint for all my non-technical project presentations over the past 10 months, and they are, if I may so judge of my own work, one of the best parts of my projects thanks to Eli\u2019s outline. Without further ado, here\u2019s his masterpiece presentation blueprint, backed by industry experience, brought to you with love.", "Gotta have it. This is what everyone will be staring at while they wait for you to start, so it\u2019s worth making sure this looks good. A good title goes a long way for setting your audience\u2019s expectations. Capture the heart of what you\u2019ve worked on in one line.", "Talk about the goals you had for the project. What problems were you hoping to address with this work? What were the big challenges that opened this avenue for exploration? What was the opportunity behind the work?", "Tell them why they care, and tell them fast. Tell them, in a literal way, what business value this work can bring to the organization. Make it real.", "Give a brief overview of the steps you took to get the results you got. This can be a very high level overview. Just give them a sense of the journey that happened.", "Most of these sections work well as a single slide, but the findings section, I feel, lends itself well to taking up more than one slide. To borrow a military aphorism I\u2019ve heard from my dad: tell them what you\u2019re going to tell them, tell them, tell them what you told them. One slide that summaries your findings, and then a new slide for each individual finding. The last part, the \u201ctell them what you told them,\u201d can happen in the next section", "Restate points made and how they point to your recommendations. Tell them what actions you think these insights should drive.", "The work never ends. Tell them what you\u2019d like to keep working on, how this project can continue to add value to the organization in the future. Tell them how it can get better.", "This is a kind of insurance. You probably won\u2019t have the time or real estate to put every single important graphic and finding in your official presentation, but you can put extra evidence in appendix slides to help answer shrewd questions.", "If you follow this outline and general presentation best practices\u2013\u2013use graphics instead of words, and use less words instead of more words; keep the presentation between 5\u20138 minutes; one idea per slide\u2013\u2013you\u2019re setting yourself up for a successful presentation, one that\u2019s engaging, easy to follow, and succinct. At the same time, don\u2019t be afraid to modify this as your needs demand. Make it your own.", "Lastly, if a picture is worth a thousand words, then an example is worth at least, like, ten explanations, right? Below are the presentation slides from my capstone project for Flatiron School, a project in Japanese kuzushiji (hand-written, cursive) character recognition, and you can find even more examples of this template in action over on my GitHub. Please also feel free to leave a note in the comments outlining one of your preferred presentation templates.", "Your home for data science.
