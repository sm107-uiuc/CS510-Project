Understanding historical events, patterns and trends are some basic indicators that all businesses track. They want to understand how good they had performed in the past and where they are headed into the future. Nowadays, with the ever-growing amount of \u201cbig data\u201d and the need for near real-time insights, time series analysis is becoming an essential part of business decisions. Here are a few of many ways how historical data helps decision-making:", "Basic understanding of historical events through time series data doesn\u2019t require fancy modeling, just plotting data against time can generate very powerful insights. In the old days, spreadsheets were good enough to create powerful visual stories and insights. Nowadays most statistical and data analysis tools (e.g. Python, Tableau, PowerBI) can handle time-series data pretty well for creating time series charts, dashboards etc.", "Another high profile use of time series data is forecasting \u2014 making predictions into short-, medium- and long-term future. Many prediction problems that businesses typically face every day have a time dimension, and it is what makes time series data so important for forecasting. Here are some forecasting applications in different sectors:", "Time series forecasting is a significant part of data science and machine learning technologies that involve fitting statistical/machine learning models to make predictions. These tools are as simple as the extrapolation of historical trends into the future, to sophisticated stochastic autoregressive models such as ARIMA [read: Time series forecasting: from naive to ARIMA and beyond]. Deep learning models such as Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) and econometrics are increasingly adding sophistication to forecasting practices.", "An anomaly (or outlier) is any observation in data that is out of ordinary. A sudden spike in credit card transactions might qualify as an anomaly if it is unexpected given the customer\u2019s historical transaction behavior. Similarly, if there are spikes and dips in time series plots of any transaction/data points those may also qualify as outliers.", "Anomaly detection is a well-researched domain with many tools and techniques available. There are a few R packages dedicated to anomaly detection such as tsoutlier and AnomalyDetection. Here are some business applications:", "A comparative analysis is a way of showing similarities and differences between time-dependent observations. It can be used to compare the performance of multiple entities as well. For example, plotting time series data of population growth by different countries can reveal important information on how one country is headed compared to another.", "Correlation is usually understood as a relationship between two random variables and is usually visualized in bi-variate scatterplots. Two random time series variables can reveal correlation/association just as much. By plotting multivariate temporal data it is easy to identify the association between two features (e.g. sales vs profit). This association may or may not imply causation, but it is a good starting point in finding features that are associated with the output variable and using them in statistical analysis.", "Besides visualizing time series plots there are quantitative metrics that are also used for measuring time series correlations \u2014Pearson coefficient is one such metrics.", "Predictive analytics is a well established technical domain that draws heavily from statistics and machine learning to predict future outcomes. The domain also draws methods from a specialized economics sub-discipline\u2014 econometrics. Advanced statistical analysis such as panel data models (e.g. fixed and random effects models) rely heavily on multivariate longitudinal (time series) datasets. Below are some econometrics applications:", "Time series data provides a wealth of analytics and application possibilities in all domains of applications. Historical analysis, forecasting, anomaly detection, and predictive analytics are just a few of those possibilities. New analytical frontiers are also emerging with the development of new tools and techniques. Artificial neural networks (e.g. LSTM) and econometrics are such cutting-edge frontiers in time series data analytics.
