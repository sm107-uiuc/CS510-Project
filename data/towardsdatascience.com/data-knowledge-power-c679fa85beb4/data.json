What do they all have in common?", "We have all heard of the saying that knowledge equals power and it\u2019s true. Whether you\u2019re thinking of Facebook, Google, Amazon or the Government, they all have power because of their knowledge.", "But how did they get that knowledge?", "The often overlooked part of the statement knowledge equals power is how to gain knowledge in the first place. It isn\u2019t something you just have, you have to go out and obtain it. So how do they do it?", "All of the tech giants start by collecting data and then turn that data into knowledge. Then, because of the things they know, their power grows. It isn\u2019t just tech giants though, this is how governments run and in most cases how government leaders get elected in the first place.", "Do you think Donald Trump just happened to become president of the United States?", "He got there because he (well his team) collected data about citizens of the US, converted it to knowledge about which areas and even people could be swayed to vote for Trump which in turn, gave him power.", "Let\u2019s look at the good and bad of this data trend and why if you\u2019re looking for a career path, a safe bet is one in the realm of data.", "When Facebook started out, I\u2019m sure the initial intentions were to create a platform that remotely connects people. However, even in the early days, Zuckerberg will have known that the data he was collecting was inherently useful.", "Yes, he was providing a way for people to connect but this is now just a small side effect of Facebook. The reality is that the data he was collecting was way more useful than the service itself. Facebook collects data about who you are, who you know, where you are and have been and even what you are doing.", "Imagine how much knowledge can be extracted from 300 petabytes of data. This is how Facebook rose to power. It collected as much data as possible, even if it didn\u2019t know what it was going to do with it yet.", "This data greed still continues and Facebook isn\u2019t alone. Any modern company who wants to thrive and grow needs to collect data. Any business that isn\u2019t collecting data from their customers or services will struggle to survive the next couple of years.", "We often read stories of how these giant corporations and even our governments abuse our privacy to harvest this data. It\u2019s true, you should be concerned and take an active approach in protecting your data footprint.", "Large corporations always have and will continue to abuse in order to retain power. That\u2019s how they became powerful in the first place, so why stop now? People have known about companies and governments abusing power for years, way before computers even existed. I\u2019m not saying its right, I\u2019m just stating that it isn\u2019t a new problem.", "However, there are many ways that we can use data for good. Modern science requires data collection and processing in order to understand the world around us. We use this data for technology, renewable energy and curing illnesses and more.", "Visualize No Malaria is using data science to help health services understand where Malaria is cropping up in order to provide faster treatment in these areas to prevent the spread.", "Factom Blockchain allows people in remote areas to have accessible and secured health records. It\u2019s also preventing medical supplies from being sold on the black market so that it reaches it\u2019s intended destination.", "The Cancer Genome Atlas Program helped generate and process data that has been used to improve how we diagnose and treat cancer.", "As you can see, don\u2019t let the doom and gloom news reports about data-hungry corporations lead you astray. Data can be used as a tool, like anything for both good and bad. We need more people using data for good.", "I currently work as a Data Engineer, so I\u2019m going to be slightly biased in my thoughts on the longevity of a career in data, but luckily I have some data to back it up.", "The US Bureau of Labour Statistics stated in a report that \u201cmathematical science occupations\u201d (basically data science and analytics roles) will grow 7.4% from 2016 to 2026. This basically means there\u2019ll be around 11.5 million more jobs available in 2026 in data and analytics roles than there were just 4 years ago.", "I think it\u2019s safe to say that as companies strive for growth, especially in modern climates as they are forced to move online, a career in data is a pretty safe bet. Data, after all, is the first step in attaining knowledge.", "If you can help a company obtain and process data, you provide the key to its growth and success.", "If I was contemplating a career or study path today and have a passion for mathematics, science or technology, I would choose a data-oriented path. Data doesn\u2019t lie, and the current trend shows our collection and use of data is only getting bigger.", "Your home for data science.
