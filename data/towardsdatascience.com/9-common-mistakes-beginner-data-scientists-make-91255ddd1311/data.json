I personally made some of them myself a few years ago and my hope with this post is that you learn from my experience and stop making them yourself.", "PS: you can find this discussion on this Youtube video as well.", "This probably is the area where junior data scientists are the most inexperienced. At the start of each project, they tend to jump headfirst into the data and the code without taking a step back and clearly thinking about the added value they could bring in.", "What I learned from my experience in consultancy was that scoping the full delivery of a project right from the beginning is extremely useful later on to have a clear vision about what data science will bring at each step.", "Spending time to understand the problem particularly helps:", "There\u2019s no magic in here really: a successful data science project goes along with a clear understanding of the problem and an organized method to solve it.", "This goes without saying but I\u2019m gonna say it anyway: not having solid knowledge of probability, statistics, and machine learning will affect you in the long run.", "As a data scientist, you should never consider machine learning models as black boxes. You should at least be familiar with the basic concepts behind them: how they work, how they behave to particular types of data (missing data for example), and how their hyper-parameters impact the training.", "If you need to rework your basics in statistics, machine learning, or deep learning, I suggest you have a look at these videos:", "You can also have a look at this awesome machine learning repository: you\u2019ll find in here tutorials, blog posts, tools, and virtually anything you need to learn and apply machine learning.", "I\u2019ve seen many data scientists getting rapidly excited and jumping into the modeling part before properly and fully understanding the data.", "This is, unfortunately, a very common mistake.", "What junior data scientists don\u2019t probably know is that effective exploratory data analysis (or EDA) gives a strong edge both in data science competitions and real-life projects.", "Here\u2019s what I use EDA for:", "I can\u2019t remember how many times I had to go through the data again to better understand the problem or improve the score of a machine learning model.", "Now I can understand that EDA can be a tedious and unpleasant process since it requires building charts, graphics, and taking time to understand them. There\u2019s hopefully a great tool that can automate a large portion of this work.", "It\u2019s called pandas-profiling. It\u2019s a python package that takes the data as input, in a dataframe object and then automatically generates a full report on it. There\u2019s everything in this report, really: distributions, statistics, bar charts, outliers, correlation matrices, missing values, etc. What you\u2019d make in a day or two is generated in a few minutes only so that you can focus on understanding the problem and designing the best solution to tackle it.", "This mistake is linked to the way most data scientists build their models.", "What I usually notice is, upon processing and cleaning a first version of the dataset, most data scientists quickly start running intensive grid-searches to optimize some model parameters on a given task. Although this may work in a substantial amount of time, it\u2019s been proven that it\u2019s not the most efficient way to get a better score.", "What top machine learning practitioners recommend is spending more time building predictive features instead of waiting for a 2-hour-grid-search to find the parameters. This process is called Feature Engineering.", "Let\u2019s have an example here. Let\u2019s say that you want to predict house prices and have among the features the number of rooms and the total number of windows. One additional feature that can be interesting to create is the ratio of these two variables which is equivalent to \u201cthe average number of windows per room\u201d.", "Feature engineering is an art by itself and highly depends on the problem and its complexity. It may also require research, interaction with external parties like domain experts: it\u2019s a cycle of trials and errors most of the time.", "Here\u2019s what to keep in mind: machine learning algorithms are now commodities that can be used off-the-shelf and at the end of the day, a stable and robust solution is more a matter of smart feature engineering than total brute force. So instead of looking for the most sophisticated state-of-the-art model, the solution may lie in building the right features.", "If you want to automatically create features for your tabular data, there\u2019s a fantastic tool specifically designed for this purpose. It\u2019s called featuretools and it\u2019s opensource.", "This error is linked to the way we interact with the external world.", "As data scientists, we may believe that our tools and algorithms can solve all the business problems at the hit of the jupyter cell and without going out from our comfort zone and leaving our chair. Well, as attractive as this sounds, this is rarely the case.", "Interacting with domain experts is part of the data scientist\u2019s job, and I can give you at least 2 reasons why:", "This is something that is widely disregarded by data scientists, probably because more than half of the projects don\u2019t make it to production and stay at the Proof Of Concept (POC) level.", "A machine learning model lifecycle starts from the business need, then goes through the following steps:", "Each step has its own technical requirements. Even though, as a data scientist, you\u2019re mostly asked about data exploration and training, having the global picture in mind can help you make the right choices in an early fashion.", "Let me give you an example: if you know that the infrastructure of your client has limited resources, you can, from the beginning, have this constraint in mind while building your model: you could, for instance, choose a less complex architecture to make the inference faster.", "True story. I\u2019ve seen data scientists saying things like:", "Although these can be valid solutions, they can, however, be impractical to implement for different reasons.", "You may for example not have access to more data to improve your model or you may simply not afford an infrastructure with GPUs to train deep learning models.", "But most importantly here, you should consider simple solutions that achieve 80% of the work first. Simple models are often underrated and, surprisingly, they do most of the job when properly tweaked.", "Being attracted to fancy models and sophisticated solutions is a pitfall a lot of data scientists fall into. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m all for trying new models and techniques, but you should at least start with baselines and see how they work. Then, you can judge if it\u2019s worth the time to explore more complex ones.", "A common misconception among data scientists is thinking that it\u2019s not part of their job to produce quality code that gets delivered to the other team members.", "When data scientists stick to some tools such as jupyter notebook to the point of overusing them for everything, they neglect best practices that\u2019d sure improve their code otherwise. We\u2019re talking proper code versioning with GIT, unit testing, continuous integration and continuous delivery (CICD), virtualization and orchestration with Docker, deploying on a cloud infrastructure\u2026", "These are software engineers' skills and there\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t learn them as well. As a data scientist, I consider myself a software engineer as well: I\u2019m asked to build models, APIs, or applications. And at the end of the day, these artifacts are deployed to the client infrastructure.", "This probably is one of the most important mistakes data scientists make.", "It\u2019s one thing to solve a data science problem, it\u2019s another thing to efficiently communicate on it to a non-technical audience.", "When being a data scientist in an organization, presenting your findings to a business stakeholder is part of your job, and being able to make the shift from a technical talk to highlighting a business value expressed in human terms is extremely valuable.", "You\u2019ll most likely always present your work to a business sponsor. These people are not technical and they never will be as your team. They only listen to what matters to them. So my advice here: be clear, concise, and straight to the point.", "Thanks for reading and spending time with me! I hope you found these tips useful. This list is, by no means, an exhaustive one. So if you\u2019re aware of other common mistakes data scientists do as well, feel free to write them in the comments.", "For more content, you can follow me on my blog or my youtube channel.", "Your home for data science.
