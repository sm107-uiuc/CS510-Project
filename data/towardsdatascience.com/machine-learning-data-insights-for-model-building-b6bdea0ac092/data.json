This method can be interpreted as a data-driven approach since we will be relying on the information sought by data itself to arrive on a few decisions. The dataset will contain prices for houses sold in Seattle between May 2014 and May 2015. We will try to find a relationship between the prices and other parameters in this article.", "Data can come from any source, however, for this particular article, I will be using data from Kaggle (Available under the public domain). Our data would look like this.", "The data description straight from pandas would look like;", "Now that we have found out the attribute in the dataset (or features), we can plot to see how few attributes might be distributed. One way of doing this is having the histograms plotted for each attribute.", "Having a look at the histograms for a few attributes, we can see that they are distributed. This, in fact, says the attributes have varying values, thus contributing to the variation of the predicted attribute (the price). In order to see that we shall see the correlations. Commonly known as Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient.", "We can see that price varies somehow with no. bedrooms, bathrooms and square feet figures of few places in a house. This provides us with a clue as these attributes might actually make sense as an input to our model. Note that we decided this based on our data, not the intuition. It is indeed obvious that price would vary with the square area of a building.", "You may have noted that in our data we are given the locations as well. We might as well use them to see if the location as input would make any sense. For that task, we can visualize the prices as a heatmap on a city map of Seattle.", "In the above plot, the prices are marked in blue to red in increasing order of price. Though it is not very visible, the scale of each scatter point depicts the square area covered by the house. Just by observing the color of the plot we can say that the price distribution has not been significantly affected by the geographical location (Though it would make sense to see expensive houses near waterfronts). This lets us go off the location information since that is not a major player deciding prices.", "As for the preprocessing step, we standardize and scale the dataset so that each attribute is presented as a number within range [-1, 1]. This is really helpful in training a model using a Neural Network. The scale transformation can be easily reversed using the sci-kit-learn library itself.", "I tried several models that were evaluated using the Root Mean Squared Error (RMS). This is because the decision to pick the right model can be decided by picking the model reporting the least RMS error.", "Regression is almost always the first choice for analysis. This is because of its capability to provide a solid mathematical expression for the relationship. However, in this experiment, I was left with an RMS error of 0.71. Though the value might not make sense, we can indeed compare this value with other models. Here I used linear regression, which has the assumption of a linear relationship between the label value and features.", "Decision trees are trained to pick values using a tree that is traversed to estimate a target value. The observed RMS error was 0.87. This means that the model had trained too much specializing in the training dataset. We call this overfitting. This can be confirmed by running again to predict the training dataset which returned an RMS error of 0.03.", "This can be considered as an improvement in our models. This is because in Random Forest a random set of trees is gathered for decision making. The number of trees/estimators can be preset. Using 100 estimators resulted in an RMS error of 0.68. We have improved a tiny bit from our regression model.", "Using a neural network can be thought of like the graph version of the decision tree. In the neural network, however, we will be adjusting weights to estimate the final output. You might read my previous article if you\u2019re interested in knowing some neural net basics.", "I used a very simple architecture with Keras functional API.", "However, I was able to achieve the lowest RMS error of 0.64.", "I believe this article would help one starting with visualizing data and using such insights in building a proper machine learning model.", "Thanks for reading.
