However, I would ask you suspend your contempt prior to investigation. Cross-functionality has been key in industry for successful innovation. The same is true for coffee, so instead, I\u2019ve been building an education for myself.", "I got into espresso because I love the rich taste. As I got deeper into it, I wanted to understand it more. My background is computer vision and data science. I have a Ph.D., and I\u2019m a researcher by nature. So I started applying what I know to espresso after I found out there wasn\u2019t much information out there that follows the foot steps of a scientist. Of available espresso data, there is little.", "Yes, you can argue people have done some more scientific studies, but I was underwhelmed. I was underwhelmed by their design, their breadth, and the depth of their analysis. Most of the methods people have looked at used too few samples and didn\u2019t explore as much as I would have liked.", "A lot of the field of espresso is dominated by baristas. A barista will train to make espresso and espresso drinks all day, but that doesn\u2019t mean they are a trained scientist. Not that they don\u2019t have a wealth of knowledge, but there is a gap between scientists and baristas.", "There is a large body of knowledge from the espresso world, and people are generally told this is how it is done rather than it being some discussion on how to brew it better. There are plenty of people that enjoy espresso just how it is or espresso drinks from the likes of Starbucks.", "Initially, I stuck to what I knew, and I looked at filters and pre-heating. Then I discovered staccato espresso, and I really zeroed in on that. I believe I found something big that was overlooked even by some people who had done some sifting research before. They had made what should have turned into staccato shots, but they stopped short because they were focused entirely on coffee extraction rather than taste.", "So, I have read no books and taken no courses, but what I\u2019m looking for in espresso has not been written in books or taught in courses. I\u2019m looking for a far deeper understanding of espresso, and I am using all available avenues to get there.", "It isn\u2019t that I haven\u2019t searched on the internet for what\u2019s available. I have searched all over, have examined every bit of data I can find, and I even did the two week trial of Barista Hustle\u2019s catalog. I was underwhelmed by the volume of data and the lack of data available. A lot of available information has plenty of explanation but not supporting experiments.", "Many people fall in love with the experience and the aesthetic of brewing espresso.", "Some may think I don\u2019t have the qualifications, but one may overlook the Ph.D. A Ph.D. is a qualification that says I am able to search and research, to develop novel wisdom.", "Is coffee more complex than face recognition? Do you think it is more complex than designing and building a 3D face scanner or debugging a neural network?", "I won\u2019t be fooled by the idea that I am an impostor. While I have certainly had the symptoms of the syndrome, I only have to look at my achieves to know that I\u2019m not. As a result, I bring something different to the table than most of the espresso community, and I\u2019m up for the challenge to learn more and develop wisdom.", "\u201cDon\u2019t forget to look at the people running experiments in the field of coffee.\u201d", "What is their background? They may have a coffee background with years of professional experience, but that doesn\u2019t mean they have a science background.", "Just because you design an experiment and run a t-test doesn\u2019t mean you actually have the qualifications of a scientist. This is the problem with a specific industry like coffee where there is very little overlap between scientists and baristas.", "\u201cBut there are publications on coffee in peer reviewed journals!\u201d", "This is true, but many food related research areas are funded by companies and their data isn\u2019t public, which doesn\u2019t help a barista at home to make a better shot.", "While some would call me a coffee grifter, I\u2019m just a scientist with a dream of a shot of espresso I have not yet tasted.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
