Have you ever imagined if you can find the song you heard someplace with only music running in your mind? You might have asked your best friend like this.", "What\u2019s that song that goes like this \u201chum hum hum hum hum.\u201d But your friend (A Human Being) also fails to tell you the song name.", "Artificial intelligence has proved that it can now read what\u2019s going in your mind, but a human being can\u2019t. It is all possible with the massive amount of data present, Machine Learning Algorithms, and the high processing power machines.", "The main feature of this humming thing is that even if you are in a noisy background this features works well and accurately and also to use this feature, you don\u2019t need to be a singer, you can do the humming, and google will do the rest of the work using its AI-powered algorithms and high-end computational power.", "The feature currently works in 20 languages. That means we can do the humming, and google will find the song in 20 different languages. It is not yet known what those twenty lists of languages are. I have tested it in Hindi and English songs, and it works pretty fast and accurate.", "I was curious about the technology working behind the scenes, and I found out that it uses Google\u2019s Next Generation Music Recognition feature. It uses deep learning algorithms that can be feed with a large amount of data to train our model. Previously, Google launched a similar feature in Pixel 2 phones to play a song on another device, and Pixel\u2019s phone can recognize the song using the music and the lyrics. We can now use our voice in the Google Search feature and find the song just by humming even without lyrics.", "You can just say, \u201cOk Google, What\u2019s this song?\u201d or you can add the shortcut from the Google Widgets. You need to do the humming for about 10\u201315 seconds, and in the next moment, you can find the song running in your mind.", "This new AI-Powered searching feature was just launched last week. You can use this feature more efficiently after updating your Google app. For the IOS user in Siri, this feature is not available as of now. But being a breakthrough feature, Siri might have this feature soon. This feature is like a blessing for many of us as we can do the humming and find the song; We don\u2019t need to ask others or search around by guessing the lyrics.", "Your home for data science.
