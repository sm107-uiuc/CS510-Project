Not because they eat your brain (not literally, anyway) but because they are ever changing in their shape and structure.", "Even the surveys that are meant to stay the same \u2013 the studies conducted at regular intervals to track our feelings towards everything from politicians to toilet brushes \u2013 are in constant flux. Clients, in their lovable creativity, discard questions, invent new ones and come up with endless new aggregations to perform on the results.", "In this article we will show why Jupyter Notebooks, an interactive scripting and story-telling environment, combined with the python library Quantipy, is the perfect toolset to tame the brain-eaters and bend them to our will.", "Survey data is often stored as data on the one hand and metadata on the other. In SPSS, users can view the data (on the left in the image below) or the variable information, the metadata (on the right of the image).", "Out of the box, python is not great at handling the richness of survey metadata, its primary usage being with transactional data which is much simpler in structure. This means that after we have run a calculation using standard python libraries, we have to map variable labels, from the metadata, onto our results (making it clear that the percentage figure against \u20181\u2019 in our output, actually refers to \u2018males\u2019). This gets even trickier when dealing with proprietary data formats (such as Unicom Intelligence\u2019s ddf/mdd files) that python has no, native, understanding of.", "Quantipy however, provides ready made readers for SPSS and Unicom Intelligence (previously called Dimensions) files, and converts the data and metadata to a pandas dataframe and a metadata schema of its own.", "We start by naming and creating a dataset (a dataset is just the combination of data and metadata):", "Quantipy stores the responses in a dataframe(dataset._data) and the metadata in a python dictionary (dataset._meta). We can reference the metadata about specific variables by looking at the columns element of the dictionary.", "The data part looks the same as it does in SPSS, but the json metadata schema is unique to Quantipy. It supports multiple languages and variables (columns) of various types: single choice, delimited sets and grids.", "Quantipy, provides a convenient shorthand function for looking at the metadata which is available through the command", "So, let\u2019s look at how many men vs women did our customer satisfaction survey.", "Wait, we know that only 59% of our customers are women, but they are 64.1% of the respondents. We need to weight our variables so that our results are truly representative of our client base.", "We\u2019ll use Quantipy\u2019s implementation of the RIM weighting algorithm (it has other weighting options), which allows us to weight using an arbitrary amount of target variables. In this case, we\u2019re only using one; gender.", "When Quantipy runs the weights, it generates a weight report, which allows us to double check the weighting isn\u2019t doing anything crazy. The maximum weight here is 1.14, which we are happy with. We now have a new variable in our dataset called \u2018Weight\u2019 which we can use in our calculations.", "Now we can see that the 41% of our client-base which are male, aren\u2019t under represented in the results.", "The fact that we\u2019re in the Jupyter Lab environment means that we can easily visualise the results. We look at the price variable, which shows how happy customers are with the pricing.", "Now let\u2019s visualise this to get a better idea of the results. For the sake of brevity, we won\u2019t go into the details, but you can see how easy it is to visualise the data using standard functionality.", "Doing our work in Jupyter Notebooks adds a further benefit: It allows us to automate our work by making our Notebooks reusable. Building on ideas from Netflix\u2019s data science team (see: Beyond Interactive: Notebook Innovation at Netflix), we\u2019ve previously covered how data processing tasks such as cleaning, weighting and recoding can be automated and also how to automate the generation of PowerPoint decks. These are all underpinned by the fact that our work is done in Notebooks.", "Jupyter Notebooks are taking the data science world by storm and this time, survey data analysis shouldn\u2019t be left behind.
