Although machine learning architectures like Neural Networks (NN) have been known for a long time thanks to breakthroughs from top researchers like Geoffrey Hinton, only recently have NNs become powerful tools in an A.I specialist\u2019s toolbox. This is credited mainly to 3 changes enabled by the coming of the 21st century:", "Most data currently floating on the internet, in government systems, and on personal computers are unlabeled. Labeled data, (i.e data that corresponds to another existing dataset) is much more difficult to procure. Data types range from numeric, images, audio, and text.", "The monumental challenge to overcome was how fragile discrete molecular data is.", "Neural networks have a very unique process that make them different from other algorithms. Data that goes in is bound to be manipulated within the NN, that is to say that it will be influenced by weights, biases, activation functions, and a whole host of other adjustable, learnable, and specified parameters;", "Data that goes into a NN will be changed.", "Manipulating fragile discrete data is walking on thin ice. Currently, there are 4 main methods to represent a molecule, listed in order of lossyness:", "Each has it\u2019s own unique process, but the ones I use to build the molecular charge classifier are string representations and molecular fingerprints. Most cheminformatic data and molecular data is available in the form of InChi strings, or my preferred format, SMILES strings. Most of the time, SMILE strings look like a form of chemical gibberish:", "These strings are generated with the help of a grammar. Like English, a single molecule can have different SMILE strings; similar to how one word can have many definition, or how one idea can be communicated with different sentences.", "Diagrams are provided by Dr. Esben Bjerrum, a leading expert and researcher in the journey to conquer chemistry with A.I. To learn more about canonical SMILES enumeration, take a look at his blog post.", "To prevent duplicate SMILE strings, only one SMILE string variation was used per molecule. It is worth noting that every molecule has a primary string representation, also known as the canonical SMILE. Armed with a clean labeled dataset of molecules in SMILES format, I set out to build a molecular charge classifier.", "I used SMILE strings and a neural network to build a molecular charge classifier in python with the Keras library. Every molecule has a certain charge of 0, 1, -1, and -2 (there are also more, but all the molecules in my dataset where one of the 4 possible charges).", "The project was broken down into 4 steps:", "For this project, the model is trained with 1000 SMILE strings of a dataset of 250,000. I turned each SMILE string into 256 bit binary code, so that I could build the NN with the same number of input neurons; 256. The model halved the number of neurons at each progressing layer, from 256 \u2192 128 \u2192 64 \u2192 34 \u2192 16, and finally to 4 output neurons, one for each possible charge in the dataset (0, 1, -1, -2).", "10% of the data (100 SMILE strings) where taken out of the training set to be used as validation data. The model uses relu as its input layer activation function, and sigmoid for the hidden layers, before finally outputting results in the form of probabilities between 0 and 1 with the softmax function. Classification is therefore presented as a probabilistic decimal that the NN calculates based on its training.", "The model is tested with 10 new molecules and successfully predicted the charges of all ten, with some yielding higher likelihood percentages (80%^) and others with less (40%^)", "All the code and datasets for Project Charged can be found on my Github, in this repository.", "The challenge with chemical data is finding the method to represent the molecules you are working with. The ideal representation accounts for the fragility of molecular data, while still keeping inherent features and patterns intact. The representation should strike the right balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.", "Still reading this? Want more? Not sure what to do next?", "Your home for data science.
