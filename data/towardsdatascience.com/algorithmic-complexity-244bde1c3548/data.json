Algorithms used to handle these problems, in the best-case scenario, run in polynomial time. Although, most of the times, it is necessary to explore an exponential number of possibilities which grows with the network size. First problems are called P problems and, the second, NP problems.", "In the next sections, the problem of whether P = NP is explored and the consequences of this confirmation or refutation are broadly presented. After, it is introduced a system that characterizes algorithms\u2019 complexity in terms of their speed and memory requirements \u2014 Big-O Notation.", "P vs NP problem was introduced in 1971 by Stephen Cook [1] and, in 2000, was considered one of the most important open questions in computer science [2]. It is part of a set of six problems that were defined by the Clay Mathematics Institute as the 7 Millennium Prize Problems [3]. And the person who can solve one of them will be awarded a prize of 1 million dollars. P vs NP problem can be stated as: Can every problem whose solution can be quickly verified by a computer also be quickly solved by a computer? [4].", "P problems are characterized for being solvable in polynomial time by a Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM). On the other hand, NP category includes those only solvable in polynomial time using a Non-deterministic Turing Machine (NTM). They are both part of a set of decision problems whose answer is binary. DTM is a non-branching machine that can only proceed to one next step at each time. This is how an ordinary computer works. NTM is a conceptual machine that is able to analyze, simultaneously, a polynomial number of different options at each step. Thus, a branching device. A quickly verified solution means it can be found in polynomial time. The word computer refers to a Deterministic Turing Machine (DTM).", "Although the question whether P = NP remains unanswered, by definition, there is a relation between the 2 groups. NP problems include those whose solution may not be obtainable but can be verified in polynomial time in a DTM. This means every P problem belongs to NP once it is always easier to verify a solution than to find it. And they can find it in polynomial time as discussed. Trivially, \ud835\udc43 \u2282 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc43.", "A different class of problems are the NP-complete. Not only they are NP, but also NP-hard (Figure 1). A problem is NP-hard when an algorithm belonging to NP can be reduced to another in the first class. This means any problem in NP-hard class is at least as hard to solve than any in NP. The reduced term means that the inputs of a problem \ud835\udc34 can be converted in the inputs of a problem \ud835\udc35, using a polynomial time algorithm, and provide the exact same output. In case \ud835\udc34 can be reduced to \ud835\udc35, this has a couple of immediate consequences:", "Consequently, if a solution in polynomial time is found to a NP-complete problem, then P vs NP problem is solved and \ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc43. Thus, it is not only fundamental to find a polynomial solution but also to prove a problem \ud835\udc4b is NP-complete. Based on the definition above, this can be split in 2 steps:", "Although it is not proved, it is believed by the majority of computer scientists \ud835\udc43 =\u0338 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc43 [6]. Proving \ud835\udc43 = \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc43 would have important consequences in the real world. Not only biological modelling would be enhanced, but also the efficiency in transportation systems, multimedia processing, economic simulations, among others, would be dramatically improved. On the other side, there are real systems based on the fact \ud835\udc43 =\u0338 \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc43. One of them is the modern cryptographic systems which rely on prime factorization to secure data. This problem is considered NP.", "A significant proportion of problems in network science are either NP, NP-hard or NP-complete. Thus, it is not surprising the importance of the solution in, for example, finding communities in phylogenetic networks.", "A mathematical representation of algorithmic time/memory complexity is presented next.", "While analyzing algorithmic performance, time and memory complexities are usually considered. They are particularly important when there is limited computational power and big data analysis is required.", "In some cases, the solution for the same problem can be found in disparate time scales. For this reason, it is important to have a way to upper bond the algorithms\u2019 execution time, but also to estimate its average value. This led to the creation of Big-O notation.", "Depending on the number of instructions the algorithm has to execute and the size of the input, the runtime differs. Big-O notation offers a way to quantify the execution needs of an algorithm, independently of the machine that is running it. The identified complexity can be linear, logarithmic, quadratic, cubic, exponential\u2026 An ordered list, in terms of the time of execution of the most common algorithms (with some examples), is presented in Table 1.", "After determining the complexity of an algorithm, it is possible to predict the time and memory requirements of the machine to execute it.", "[1] S.
