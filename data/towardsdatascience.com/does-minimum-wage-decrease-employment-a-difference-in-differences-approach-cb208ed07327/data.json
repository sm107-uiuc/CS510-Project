Due to the lack of a random assignment, the treatment and control groups are not equivalent before the intervention. So, any differences from these two groups could be caused by the pre-existing differences.", "The quasi design has been well received by policy analysts, health care providers, and Direct-To-Consumer companies (in particular, Netflix and Airbnb).", "In other posts, I\u2019ve explained the benefits of experimental studies and why they should be the number one choice for causal inference, if possible. So, why don\u2019t we run experiments all the time?", "Great question! A quick answer is experimental designs are not good for some types of problems. For example, it\u2019s not ethical to randomly assign people to hazardous conditions (e.g., smoking) that may harm their health.", "In the policy arena, we can\u2019t randomly assign California, not New York, to receive a new tax break.", "Besides, there are spillover effects between the treatment and control groups in experimental designs.
