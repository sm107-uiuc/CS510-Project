When we see the cave paintings in Lascaux \u2014 one of the earliest examples of visual art remaining on Earth \u2014 we are looking at art made possible by technology. Humanity\u2019s ingenuity in persistently capturing rudimentary visual images was a remarkable advance even as, today, it seems mundane and fundamental to our existence. In the intervening thousands of years, art and technology have driven one another, now taking the form of things such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and 3D printing.", "So, how are artists using the latest technologies in their work? Much of the mainstream narrative centers around how AI creates recognizable, traditional forms of fine art. \u201cThe Next Rembrandt\u201d, a 2016 project funded by a variety of corporations led by financial services company ING, used AI to generate a new Rembrandt-like painting that was 3D printed and displayed. In 2018, the Obvious artist collective created \u201cEdmond de Belamy\u201d, a portrait that evokes what might be called an impressionistic Rembrandt, and which became the first AI painting sold at auction by Christie\u2019s.", "Mario Klingemann, a German artist who works at the leading edge of technology, is best-known for \u201cMemories of Passersby I\u201d \u2014 an autonomous machine that uses a system of neural networks to generate a never-ending, never-repeating stream of portraits of non-existing people \u2014 which was sold at Sotheby\u2019s Contemporary Art Day Auction. Klingemann\u2019s storied background also includes a stint as artist in residence at the Google Arts and Culture Lab. And, his works have appeared at the Ars Electronica Festival and the Museum of Modern Art New York, among many others.", "Klingemann has focused on technology throughout his career. \u201cI\u2019m trying to use artificial intelligence to allow me to take it beyond what I could just do myself,\u201d he says. \u201cThe very, very long term goal for me is to try to create these entirely autonomous machines that you might be able to call \u2018artists\u2019. \u2026 I am far away from that goal. But sometimes it\u2019s good to have some goal on the horizon and try to get there,\u201d says Klingemann.", "\u201cSo, right now you could say I\u2019m creating my own assistants, which have some capabilities that I have not. But, at the same time, it\u2019s still me that does the art, and the AI or the deep learning, machine learning, is just some very powerful tool that is able to surprise me.\u201d", "Klingemann describes the evolution of his technology-infused art. \u201cIn the past it\u2019s been mostly visual stuff \u2014 images, videos, installations that have some kind of visual component. So, I\u2019m very interested in image making. But, I don\u2019t feel like that\u2019s the only place I will always be,\u201d he says. Klingemann focuses on how future machines and tools will relate to humans. \u201cI want to make things that keep us interested, that entertain us, that will show us something that well we didn\u2019t think of ourselves,\u201d he explains. \u201cCurrently I\u2019m drifting off more into text generations. I\u2019m not so sure if you can call it storytelling. \u2026 Because, for me, that\u2019s a level deeper. In the end, a story is what everything boils down to.\u201d", "It is interesting that Klingemann, acclaimed for his AI-generated visual art, is shifting his focus to text. He\u2019s drawn to the future, moving to the next new thing when the future finally becomes the present. As AI visual creation tools become more mainstream, Klingemann sees AI and text as the next frontier. \u201cAs you probably know, now we have all these interesting models that are able to produce something that almost looks like a text that makes sense. But, of course, it\u2019s still far away from writing a novel or even a short story that is actually where we say \u2026\u2018This is a story I would want to tell somebody else.\u2019 \u2026 I believe that this will improve very quickly and we are already reaching this uncanny valley of text.\u201d", "\u201c[With images] we have reached a point where everything is so realistic \u2026 that you don\u2019t even know that you\u2019re looking at a machine-generated image. And the same will happen with texts. In some cases, cherry-picked examples, we have already reached that point. Of course, this will do something strange to ourselves,\u201d says Klingemann. \u201cWe are still feeling so sure that we can totally say what\u2019s real and what\u2019s not, and we will lose that ability very soon.\u201d", "At times, people question the role of the human in the creation of AI-augmented art. One typical reaction Klingemann encounters is: \u201c\u2018Oh, but it\u2019s the computer doing this.\u2019 or \u2018Well, all you do is write or program a little bit, but the machine does all the rest,\u2019\u201d he says. A deeply embedded belief Klingemann finds is this: \u201cYou still have to do something with your hands to [make it] true art, which of course, I find pretty ridiculous. If you look at particular contemporary art \u2014 let\u2019s say probably 80% of the artists that you know \u2014 the big names \u2026 none of them do their own art anymore. They have all their assistants and studios \u2026 that make [things] for them. So, they write a concept on the paper and then just come for a visit [to the studio] and see how it\u2019s coming along. Or, you take something like a movie, where a director directs something.\u201d", "Interesting questions of definition dance around this narrative. In different media, the expectation of what a creator does is variable. On one hand, a movie director is joined by hundreds of other collaborators in ways large and small, yet it is the director whose \u201cfilm\u201d the final product is anointed. On the other hand, while the assistant-driven model is well-known at the apex of the fine art world, there is a significant difference in value and prestige for something that comes directly and primarily from the master as opposed to a piece created under her direction. Why is there such a chasm between disciplines?", "The introduction of AI, which requires human head and hands at myriad points in the process, introduces a new vector to the question of creativity and credit. It might be a good reason to more broadly look at these questions across disciplines, and reconsider how we perceive collaboration and the work that spawned from it.", "Klingemann describes his latest thinking about deep learning as a technology: \u201cOne thing I have learned in the past four years or five years \u2014 where I would say deep learning has really exploded \u2014 is [around] this question of multidimensionality. This is for me currently, the holy grail, this idea that, if the machine learns something, whatever you try to teach it gets projected into this multidimensional space. And, from this multidimensional space, you extract information out again by setting certain boundaries or having the machine identify certain clusters.\u201d", "\u201cBut, the fascinating thing is that we as humans have this desire to get clear answers, or to say black and white or true and false,\u201d says Klingemann. \u201cBut, if you look at the raw data, there\u2019s just this continuous space. And, only by asking it, I want to know \u2018Is this a dog or is this a cat\u2019, then you have at some point to define a boundary or a threshold, which is almost arbitrary. I mean, the data defines it somehow, but there\u2019s never a clear edge.\u201d", "\u201cAnd so, I like this idea of, if we can take this multidimensional thinking at least into our consideration, and always thinking,\u2018Yes\u2019. So, hard categories are actually a very human invention, or, it\u2019s our desire to be certain, but there\u2019s never certainty. Of course, the world we currently live in is all about battle for certainty and who\u2019s right and who\u2019s wrong. So, I would rather say, \u2018It\u2019s all latent space and so maybe we can never be 100% sure. And maybe something\u2019s also a little bit of something else\u2019. Putting labels on things is a human thing. It\u2019s not a machine thing.\u201d The idea that multidimensional thinking requires moving away from hard and specific human definitions, from the crisp boxes we are drawn to put things into, is an interesting notion. In learning more about humanity and theories of social evolution and development, we\u2019re struck by the reality that we exist in a continuum and are rarely just one thing, or in just one place in our development and being. It\u2019s a human tendency and preference to reduce complexity to something simple, something black-and-white. Machines, processing power notwithstanding, don\u2019t have those limitations. They can consistently and at scale exhibit multidimensional thinking over all the data they survey. Beyond our thinking about how best to leverage and extend the tools thanks to these abilities, we should learn from their facility in these ways and attempt to be less black-and-white in our own framing of other people and the world.", "A generative adversarial network (GAN) is made up of two neural networks that compete with each other. The generative network creates output, based on a training dataset it is fed, while the discriminative network attempts to distinguish whether or not that output from the first is synthetic or real. For the GANs that Klingemann uses in his work, \u201cThey are actually trying to learn, in the case of portraits, how a portrait is made. So, it learns that eyes come in a certain statistical distribution and skin color, hair, that there are certain proportions about faces,\u201d he says.", "Klingemann describes how the GAN is an important tool in his creative process. \u201cOnce you have trained the GAN, some people are then just using it to create infinite amounts of images,\u201d he explains. \u201cBut, for me, usually the process only starts then. One GAN becomes almost like a Lego brick or some kind of little engine that I then combine with other bricks and build all these pipelines where complexity quickly starts building up. So, what one model creates, the other one deforms. And then, I really like playing with feedback loops. So, at some point, I feed the output of the sixth model back into the input of the first and then you get to these systems, which start behaving, hopefully, in an interesting way. Often they just break. So, with any kind of these loop systems, then it becomes about finding the sweet spots in which you get kind of a beautiful balance between almost chaos and something that died and is producing a black screen. And that process is very much like, you have to use a lot of gut feeling there.\u201d", "\u201cBecause these systems are so complex, you cannot really say, \u2018Okay, I change this number and that thing will work.\u2019\u201d says Klingemann. \u201cIt\u2019s really turning knobs here and turning knobs there \u2014 maybe like with analog synthesizers or cooking. You learn by experience that it probably goes in this direction but then there could always be something really strange happening around the corner. And of course that\u2019s what you\u2019re hoping for \u2026 that you end up in a space that you didn\u2019t even know was there.\u201d", "The human element in setting up a GAN properly is essential. It is a variant of the old axiom \u201cgood data in, good data out\u201d. As much as we call machines \u201csmart\u201d, or \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, they are just a more complicated tool for a human to use. We may not think of a brush, paints, and canvas as technology but they are on the same continuum as the palette of things Klingemann used in making his art.", "With his influential piece, \u201cMemories of Passersby I\u201d, Klingemann wanted \u201c\u2026 to create something that keeps on creating, in this case portraits, and never repeats and stays surprising. This piece consists of a computer that houses several GANs that work in a feedback loop and continuously create portraits. The idea is that when you are actually there to see it, you\u2019re facing this infinite stream of very slowly changing portraits that are actually being made in the moment you watch them. So, also, if you\u2019re alone in the room and you see something, you will be the only person who has ever seen this.\u201d", "\u201cThe other idea is that it\u2019s supposed to be a long-term piece. So, it\u2019s not just for a day or two but it\u2019s supposed to work for years. The idea is that it stays surprising in some sense, even though it\u2019s very limited in its possibility space \u2014 it will only create portraits. When we look at it and see it for awhile, we get a certain idea like, \u2018Okay, what will happen next?\u2019 And I like the idea that you come back in a day or two and you will actually see some new portrait that doesn\u2019t fit into how you estimated this system would evolve.\u201d", "\u201cOne of the pieces is at one of my collector\u2019s homes \u2026 She\u2019s the one who commissioned the first one. And, she\u2019s still happy with it, because she comes in every morning and sees it and it\u2019s a new face. And, it still hasn\u2019t grown old on her,\u201d says Klingemann. \u201cShe\u2019s still being surprised, which makes me happy \u2026 When you build a complicated system like this \u2026 in the end I\u2019m also limited in my abilities to foresee how it will develop. So, that\u2019s the tricky part, that I\u2019ve tried to build something that keeps on changing, but, of course, shouldn\u2019t break or shouldn\u2019t drift off into an area where it\u2019s totally just noise.\u201d", "\u201cI always say, \u2018This piece is like a child that I tried to educate and give some values. But at some point I have to cut the cord and send it out in the world and I hope it will keep on doing what I told it to.\u2019 So, that\u2019s unlike a painting where, when it\u2019s done it might age a little bit, but it will look the same in 20 or 50 years. In this case, it is a little bit alive, which makes it always, also like I hope it still lives.\u201d", "Klingemann is using GANs and related technologies for his experiments and explorations in text generation. \u201cI made these fake interviews with an artist \u2026 the whole interview is generated by the machine. And, it\u2019s interesting because then you start feeding the output of the model back into its input and it keeps on doing these things and then the question is, \u2018Okay, I\u2019ve tried to find ways to shape it further, how to take this and maybe filter it, adjust what it says?\u2019 So, that\u2019s currently ongoing experimentation, again to see because it is still a little bit uncontrollable. So, you can direct it in a certain way but then, well if you don\u2019t like it, you just have to try again, and again until you get something. And, of course then I\u2019m still the one looking at the text and deciding, \u2018Does this make sense or is this funny, is this interesting?\u2019 So, the next step is, of course, for another algorithm to determine if whatever it has given me fits into whatever current theme I\u2019m working on. But, of course this is one building block and further explorations will go into when I have the story can I turn this into a movie? Can I turn it into a comic book? Can I make music from it?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s what it always boils down to me. That, you have these latent spaces, these abstract multidimensional spaces, which, in theory, can become these universal translation spaces,\u201d says Klingemann. \u201cSo, in one side you put text in and you get images out. Or, you feed an image in and then you translate it into text. In the end, all information becomes one in these spaces, and the hope is to extract something out of it, which is enlightening to us or makes us happy or makes us wonder. That\u2019s an ongoing search, which probably will never end. The search is so enjoyable for me so \u2026 I never want that search to end.\u201d", "Perhaps, but of course everything does eventually end. And, as an artist who thrives in the new and unexplored, Klingemann is sensitive to how the landscape is shifting: \u201cWell, what I can already see is that unlike two, three years ago, now we have these practical tools become part of the tool sets of people who are not programmers. So, the ability to play with latent spaces gets into the hands of everybody. So, and, whilst in some sense, as I mentioned before, I\u2019m a bit sad that I now not the only one who\u2019s able to do it. It is of course a good thing because other people who maybe have a less technical background have very different ways of creating art. \u2026 It\u2019s great that it\u2019s out, just like the camera made it into the hands of the whole world. It\u2019s always had to see how it will change our world, but it definitely will.\u201d", "Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
