This article first appeared in Forbes.", "\u201cWhat\u2019s the value of a data organization? How should data leaders think about the ROI of their team?\u201d", "With the fast-paced growth in the number of data professionals \u2014 data scientists, analysts, engineers \u2014 and the lines between data roles being blurred, measuring and communicating the ROI of data teams is no easy feat. But given the large investment in this area, understanding this value presents an existential question for the data industry at large. In this blog post, we\u2019d like to suggest a pragmatic framework for measuring the ROI of the data team based on contributions to various business outcomes.", "Data teams typically play a critical role across the business in several ways:", "In other words, the data team works in collaboration with other business functions. So to holistically understand the ROI of the data organization, we have to examine it through the lens of each function in the company. A data team at its best makes every business function \u2014 and ultimately the entire company \u2014 data-driven.", "Let\u2019s walk through an example in marketing to illustrate how the data team makes marketing more data-driven. Data teams help their marketing peers in the following ways:", "Now, those qualitative contributions are clear. But how to measure it? We propose using a two-dimensional measurement framework for measuring the data team\u2019s ROI, as illustrated in the table below.", "To understand the value of the data team, we can map the team\u2019s current and future initiatives in one of the cells depending on the business function (here, marketing, represented through rows) and the nature of the work (represented through columns).", "From there, we can calculate the data team\u2019s ROI using one of the following two methods:", "In this method, we use a point system as described below to measure Data team\u2019s impact:", "In this method, we allocate a % of ROI of different business functions to the data team:", "In our marketing example scenario, the value of the data team can be measured as follows:", "Method 1: If the data team is engaged in all the above roles for marketing, they will get a score of 2.5 and leading to a total score of 12.5, i.e. the max possible score for the data team\u2019s engagement with a business function, for their contribution to the marketing function.", "Method 2: If the marketing team delivers $100MM value to the business through all growth, scaling and efficiency initiatives in a given period, we could attribute 25% to 35% of that to the data team, depending on the team\u2019s level of involvement.", "This ROI framework therefore puts a tangible value to the contributions made by the data team. It\u2019s also highly visual, which is another helpful way to demonstrate to leaders and other teams the value of the data team \u2014 and what it\u2019s been working on \u2014 at a glance. In that way, in addition to measuring ROI, this framework can be a useful tool for prioritizing and assessing future opportunities for the data team.", "Like any other measurement, it\u2019s important to measure the data team\u2019s impact at an appropriate cadence to allow for identifying opportunities to improve and to contextualize performance. We propose a quarterly lightweight measurement and an annual more thorough measurement. Quarterly check-ins allow for necessary mid-year course corrections to ensure organizations are getting the best value from their investment in data, and yearly will ensure creating longer term strategy to continue to accelerate the value creation.", "Measuring and communicating the ROI of our data team in this way allows us to align our team\u2019s work to meaningful value which drives our customers and the business forward. We strive to make sure we are always working on the company\u2019s highest priorities \u2014 full stop. If you were to measure the ROI of your data team using this framework today, what would you learn?", "Reach out to Barkha Saxena or Barr Moses if any questions, comments, or suggestions.", "Your home for data science.
