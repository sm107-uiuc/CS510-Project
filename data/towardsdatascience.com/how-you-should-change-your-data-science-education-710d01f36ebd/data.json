In my opinion, the most important groups you can segment data scientists into are those who write code used in production, and those who do reporting.", "For a lack of a better term, I called the second group analysts. This does not mean they are not data scientists, people in these roles benefit from knowing machine learning, the ins and outs of data, and general programming skills. However, in this position communication is much more important, and your knowledge of dash-boarding, charts, presentation, and interpretable statistics is more likely to be a key to success.", "An engineer writes code that gets used in production, meaning it effects business processes by being integrated with an organization\u2019s existing software. Here, your knowledge of machine learning is more important, and you\u2019re more likely to be working on a team that is code-oriented, unlike a business intelligence or business analysis team.", "There is no collegiate major for data science (at most universities), so pretty much everyone \u201cmoves\u201d into data science, but the people that studied computer science or were software engineers usually take the data science engineer position, while people with other backgrounds more typically move into the analyst position. Data science education, as it stands today is much more focused on the position of the analyst than the engineer. In my opinion, this is because it is much easier to teach the skills an analyst needs, and many individuals and organizations want to cash in on the sudden spike of people wanting to change their career.", "Since there is so much hype around \u201cThe Sexiest Job of the 21st Century,\u201d as some have put it, parties involved around data science education over emphasize the availability and demand for analysts. So, the primary issue I take with data science education is that there seems to be and not a lot of focus on engineering skills. I believe the engineering skills are more useful, in higher demand, and fewer people have them. When I talk with people beginning their career in data science I usually hear about their skills related to analysis, but I almost exclusively read about engineering skills in job posts.", "If you find yourself learning yet another algorithm, charting package, dashboarding tool, or your projects seem to be stuck in jupyter notebooks, then it\u2019s time for a change. Once you have the hang of a few of one of these topics, I don\u2019t see a large point in continuing to grow deeper knowledge. For example, if you already know Tableau and Cognos, is there much benefit to also knowing Power BI? I\u2019m sure you are a smart person so if you have a need to learn an additional tool in a domain you already know, I think you should wait until you have that need. There are other skills that have a higher return on investment, most of them are on the engineering side of things. It can be reassuring to learn more about things that are already familiar to us, but I encourage you to take a step out of your comfort zone. The I think you should make is to focus on engineering skills. The best reason to make this transition is that the ratio of jobs available to people with the required skills is better, which is probably what you care about.", "Now if you\u2019re convinced that you should care about being an engineer, next take the steps to learn further about programming and DevOps. I\u2019ve argued previously in Towards Data Science about the gap in programming ability and the struggle even many in technology have with basic programming here, but these are some of my recommendations to learn:", "Once you have done all of that I would move onto learning about DevOps, since it makes you more efficient, easier to collaborate with, and the best engineering teams place a lot of emphasis on DevOps practices. DevOps combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) into one field which enables the rapid production of new features while maintain system reliability. Knowing about DevOps can help with continuous integration (testing code and the build as you push to your repository), continuous deployment (updating models and having them hit the production immediately), packaging (making sure models can scale up to more users), and monitoring (keeping track of model scoring for users).", "Essential to understanding the DevOps is understanding the cloud, where services are deployed and called as you would an API. The cloud is a great enabler of machine learning, since your ML models can scale very easily on the cloud and they become easier to test, update, and replace. This is why you may frequently see job descriptions require experience with AWS, GCP, Azure, IBM Public Cloud, Cloudflare, or another provider. I think once you get to the point that you have comfort in doing data science on the cloud, if you don\u2019t look more attractive as a candidate for a data scientist job, you will at least have a better understanding of how the work of a data science engineer gets put into place.", "Your home for data science.
