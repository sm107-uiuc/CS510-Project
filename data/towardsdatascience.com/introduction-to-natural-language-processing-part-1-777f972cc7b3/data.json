Since its inception during the 1950s, machine understanding of language has played a pivotal role in translation, topic modeling, document indexing, information retrieval, and entity extraction.", "Nowadays, it is used to power search engines, filter spam and to obtain analytics in a fast and scalable manner. The performance of these systems have grown exponentially with computing efficiency and new developments in Machine Learning. Several NLP systems today are even able to boast of near human level parity.", "With the surplus of tools and technologies dedicated to NLP, it\u2019s so easy to get started. My goal is to cover the basic theories of natural language processing and show you how to build simple tools which illuminate their magic. Check out these follow up articles for more NLP reading.", "As a side note: this, and subsequent articles, focuses on NLP from the context of text processing.", "Language is fluid. Language is full of abstraction and ambiguity. Second languages are hard to learn as adults, so how the heck do machines manage it?", "The reality is that most natural language understanding systems are very construed. They transform textual data into numerical representations and use complex mathematical models to learn dependencies between each word, phrase and document. What the end user sees as an intelligent understanding of language is actually millions of parameters fitted over a large corpus.", "The process of turning text into numbers is commonly known as vectorization or embedding. These techniques are functions which map words onto vectors of real numbers. The vectors form a vector space, an algebraic model where all the rules of vector addition and measures of similarities apply.", "The distance between two words in a vector space measure some type of similarity between them. Word relations can also be quantified using vector addition. The above picture demonstrates that the relationship between King and Queen is the same as that between Man and Woman. In theory, this would mean that King Vector \u2014 Queen Vector = Man Vector - Woman Vector", "\u201cDocument\u201d refers to an unbroken entity of text that is of interest to the problem. For example, a spam classification system would consider each message as a document.", "A document can be mapped to a vector of vectors, where each vector corresponds to one word. In this case, the vector of vectors is ingested by the algorithm where the concatenation of word relationships and individual vectors is used to derive meaning. Alternatively, entire documents can be mapped to a single vector. This creates a more simplified understanding of language, but is less reliant on data volumes and computational resources.", "Document level embeddings are typically created by examining the frequency of each word. These embedding techniques are reliant on the distributional hypothesis, the assumption that:", "Distributional hypothesis: words which are used and occur in the same contexts tend to purport similar meaning", "Let\u2019s go through one of the simplest embedding techniques \u2014 Bag of Words \u2014 which is used to map each document onto its own vector.", "This technique is not often used in practice due to its oversimplification of language. Its use case lies primarily as an educational tool meant to ease students of NLP into the subject.", "Let\u2019s consider the following documents. If it helps, you can imagine that they are absurdly simple text messages shared between friends.", "The vocabulary we obtain from this set of documents is (High, five, I, am, old, she, is). We will ignore punctuation for now, although depending on our use case it can also make a lot of sense to incorporate them into our vocabulary.", "We can create a matrix representing the relationship between each term from our vocabulary and the document. Each element in the matrix represents how many times that term appears in that particular document.", "Bag of words is not a good representation of language, especially when you have a small vocabulary. It ignores word order, word relationships and produces sparse vectors that is largely filled with zeros. We also see here from our small example that the words \u201cI\u201d, \u201cam\u201d, \u201cold\u201d are mapped to the same vector. This implies that these words are similar, which doesn\u2019t really make sense.", "Here are some articles for more NLP readings. Spam or Ham introduces a new type of document embedding which takes the relative importance of each term into consideration. Exploring Neural Networks for Word Embeddings introduces embeddings created using Neural Networks, both of which are more practical alternatives to Bag of Words.", "Numerical representations allow us to use mathematical models to analyze our text. The next step is to take these embeddings and use them as features in a classification problem.", "Textual data is rich and high in dimensions, which makes more complex classifiers such as neural networks ideal for NLP.", "If you enjoyed this article, check out my other articles on Data Science, Math and Programming.
