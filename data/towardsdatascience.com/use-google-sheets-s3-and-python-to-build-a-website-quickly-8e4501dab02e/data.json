I thought that others might be doing the same, so I decided to compile some resources and publish them online.", "I started compiling the courses using a Google Sheet and was planning on sharing it after I had enough resources. However, something was bothering me. Opening sheets on a mobile suck and most people use their phones for browsing the internet. I thought I could do better.", "The thing is that I have little experience in web development. Also, I didn\u2019t want to dedicate more than a few hours on developing and launching the site. So I decided to build something quickly.", "Here are the requirements I set for building the site quickly and the approach I took to meet them:", "After a couple of hours, I launched stayhomeandlearn.org.", "The rest of this article is a tutorial on how to build a static site using Google Sheets, AWS, and Python.", "For this tutorial, we will set up a script that reads data from Google Sheets, generates a static site using a predefined template, and deploys it to an S3 bucket. This article is meant for programmers with little knowledge of web development that want to get something running quickly.", "There are five sections in the tutorial: Requirements, Review Code and Jinja Template, Using the Google Sheets API, and Build and Deploy Your Site.", "These you\u2019ll need to set up or review on your own. I added some links for that purpose.", "First, create a directory called my_pokemon_stats and open a terminal from there. Then, create a virtual environment and install the required packages as follows:", "Next, download and save these two files there: template.html and site_builder.py. These are the building blocks for generating the site.", "template.html is the Jinja template we will use for building the site. It's an HTML-like file where you can add logic that will be processed in Python and generate the definitive site. This file looks as follows:", "Next, we have the site_builder.py file. This script downloads the Pokemon's data from Google Sheets, processes the data and the template.html file, and then uploads the resulting file to an S3 bucket.", "The code is structured in 3 functions: download_sheets, generate_site, and deploy_site. We will fill the details for accessing AWS and the Google Sheets API in the next sections.", "Follow these steps to download the Pokemon\u2019s data using the Google Sheets API:", "Now, let\u2019s create the S3 bucket and configure our code to access AWS programmatically:", "10. Go to the site_builder.py script. Set the variable AWS_PROFILE variable to the profile name you use for accessing AWS (in a UNIX sytem it should be one of the profiles in ~/.aws/credentials).", "Finally, you should be able to run python site_builder.py from the root folder of the project to generate the site. This will download the data from Google Sheets, process the template.html file using Jinja and upload the site to the S3 bucket.", "If you want to check the site, go to the endpoint URL (step 6 from the previous section).", "This method is by no means perfect but will help you ship something quickly. I used this strategy to build stayhomeandlearn.org and it worked quite well. From April 1st until April 16th, the site got over fifteen thousand visitors, which exceeded my most optimistic expectations.", "The site is slowly walking towards its death now. However, this process taught me how important it is to focus on shipping instead of wasting time looking for the perfect tools. I built the site quickly, people liked it, and after the first day it already had more traffic than any of the side projects I\u2019ve done so far. That thing about perfect being the enemy of good is real.", "In my case, I had to add more functionality to the script for styling and deploying purposes. If you are interested, you can take a look at the code in my GitHub repository.", "Finally, there are a couple of things you can do now to make your site more interesting:", "This article was originally published in my blog.", "Your home for data science.
