To be specific, I did my undergrad in Chemistry and finished a master\u2019s in Bioprocess Engineering. I had fun researching on natural products and designing composite biomaterials.", "I\u2019m one of those data enthusiasts who had a bit more math in university than your average programmer and who happen to decide I want to use code to do some data magic to make some business people happy.", "Luckily, I get to make use of a lot of my scientific acumen and problem-solving in approaching business challenges with data. Two years in as a data scientist, I realized I\u2019m not as well versed as I thought I am with software and other tech stacks that can make my life as a data professional much easier and effective.", "Moreover, I realized while I\u2019m comfortable with coding in Python/R and getting my data using SQL, my scripts often look dry and often require a lot of refactoring afterward. I get things done with my code but sometimes my notebooks are not in a state I\u2019m proud to share with other people.", "I know I need to become more technically proficient, in a holistic manner. I want to become knowledgeable to a point I can engage with my more technical counterparts at an almost equal level.", "When I applied for my first data science job, I had a bit of git knowledge, but I have put all my existing starter projects on a WordPress site.", "While there\u2019s nothing wrong about using a blogging site for a portfolio, it took me painstakingly three more long years to realize how a self-hosted site (or even just a simple GitHub page) will do and 100x better (and cheaper!) than a blog site on a premium plan.", "Not to mention, you have to pay even more to do limited customization. I realized I want to build a better portfolio website for myself and not pay too much for it.", "I know maintaining a good portfolio website is going to be a mainstay for my data career so might as well learn to do it myself.", "Furthermore, I realize how boring typical portfolio websites could be \u2014 as more often than not, you just present your analysis and results in a very static way. However, some do take it to the next level. JP Hwang, in his article, compiled a few data science portfolios that will definitely awe and inspire you.", "I envy people who know how to deploy apps that demonstrate the value of their project. Hence, I want to learn more about web development to learn visual and interactive ways to share my work.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying that you should become a web developer yourself. I\u2019m not saying you can\u2019t build a good portfolio website without going in-depth in web development.", "If you\u2019re just like me, I always want to learn new things. And, I have decided I want to learn web development to complement my data science practice.", "I just don\u2019t want to learn it by getting by with fixing bugs by reading through Stackoverflow. I want to learn it the right way.", "I want to have a better perspective of what goes in the mind of developers I work with. I want to learn best practices in programming that extends beyond my Jupyter notebook.", "Disclaimer: I\u2019m still in the process of figuring out the best learning pathway. Rest assured, I will be documenting them as I learn more. I know there are existing web dev libraries and frameworks that are must-haves for data scientists like D3.js and TensorFlow.JS but will compile all of them in a different post.", "The reason why Chemistry fascinated me is the idea of being able to facilitate reactions between substances to create an entirely different material. Something that could be of potential value to society.", "I also found that same fascination in data science.", "The only difference is that I don\u2019t have to go to the lab and wear some protective gear to do some science.", "I can just be in my pajamas and do my experiments entirely on my laptop.", "I find it interesting to design and create solutions using data and programming alone. Although, like what I said in my first point, I realize how putting my work out there requires a ton more work than I am trained on.", "Knowing how powerful data science and AI is \u2014 and how widespread it is across industries, I know I might be able to stumble upon some bright idea that I hope I would be able to translate into some actual product myself (or with a team)", "Another thing known in the data science community is the curse and blessing of being in an overhyped industry. It\u2019s been touted as the sexiest job of the 21st century for a reason.", "It is a blessing that companies started to realize they lack a crucial capability to unlock insights from data (or could be just plain FOMO?). As a result, job prospects for data scientists and analysts skyrocketed.", "Unfortunately, many companies don\u2019t realize what it takes to onboard and unleash the full potential of their data scientists. Many companies think of data scientists as jack-of-all-trades and someone that have the powers to take their dirty data and make them millions in return in no time.", "Some even have absurd job descriptions requiring tech stacks not necessarily applicable in their problem domains.", "Here are some articles showing the disconnect between companies and data science, mostly from a hiring perspective:", "I bet things are going to stay the same way as companies are navigating this awkward phase as they figure out the proper way to take advantage of data science, and as the current data scientists specialize in specific data science domains.", "At the moment, I desire to be more flexible in terms of my skills and be able to add more value to the company I\u2019m working for. I would like to approach problems in a more agile way by having the know-how from both the data and the dev side.", "Is learning web development a way to stand out in the workplace?", "Perhaps. However, it is not the only way, as I can also do so by going deep into a problem domain. Nonetheless, I know learning software development is useful either way and can widen my perspective as I\u2019m building my career in the tech industry.", "Is this a way to get into a more Machine Learning Engineering career?", "Could be. Up until now, I know the definition of DS-related roles is still murky but one thing certain about ML engineers is their superior technical prowess versus your average data scientist. I guess, learning how to deploy web apps and tinker on the back end of stuff is a pathway to having a skillset closer to that of an ML engineer.", "To close, the reasons why I\u2019m learning web development, as a data scientist are the following:", "Learning web development can allow me to learn the ins and outs of software development in a fun and visual way, while at the same time learning some skills that can be useful in my career as a data scientist.", "Right now, I\u2019m going over the following online resources to get started with the basics:", "To add, I particularly like Andrei Neagoie\u2019s Zero to Mastery Course (the first link above). Not just because his course is one of the most actively updated ones (he recently updated his to the 2021 version) but because of the huge active community around it. I\u2019m currently part of a community of thousands of learners and an awesome smaller study group of 30 that makes learning more fun and engaging.", "I\u2019m looking forward to improving my portfolio, and all the websites and apps I would be building as I progress in the coming months. I would be posting my progress here from time to time.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "In constant pursuit of progress.
