Boaz did an excellent job in explaining the advantages of using MCC in his Medium Story titled \u2018Matthews Correlation Coefficient Is The Best Classification Metric You\u2019ve Never Heard Of\u2019, and I believe many people are inspired and excited to use it when they encounter a tough imbalanced classification problem next time.", "But wait\u2026 the best classification metric?", "Let\u2019s consider MCC more carefully in the context of binary classification problems. Similar to F1 score, MCC is a single-value metric that summarizes the confusion matrix. A confusion matrix, also known as an error matrix, has four entries: True Positives (TP), True Negatives (TN), False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN). The main benefit gained by using MCC instead of F1 score can be guessed easily by peeking into their formulae:", "F1 score ignores the count of True Negatives. In contrast, MCC kindly extends its care to all four entries of the confusion matrix. Davide Chicco, the author of Ten quick tips for machine learning in computational biology, commented that MCC \u201cis high only if your classifier is doing well on both the negative and the positive elements.\u201d", "Let\u2019s now put our first feeling aside and look at a concrete example (the same example used in MCC\u2019s wiki page):", "F1 score = 0.9524, which misleads us into believing that the classifier is extremely good. In contrast, by plugging in those numbers in the formula of MCC, we get a miserable 0.14. MCC ranges from -1 to 1 (hey, it is a correlation coefficient anyway) and 0.14 means the classifier is very close to a random guess classifier. From this example, we can tell that MCC helps one identify the ineffectiveness of the classifier in classifying especially the negative class samples.", "However, F1 score is highly influenced by which class is labeled as positive. The F1 score differs so much from MCC in magnitude as the minority class is labeled as negative. Let\u2019s look at another example by reversing the positive and negative labels:", "F1 score is 0.18, and MCC is 0.103. Both metrics send a signal to the practitioner that the classifier is not performing well.", "It is important to recognize that the majority class is normally labeled as negative (as in the second example). This is because of the convention that rarer or more \u2018interesting\u2019 samples are usually labeled as positive, such as patients who have a rare disease (they are tested positive). For these problems, F1 score fulfills its purpose of being a good metric by placing more emphasis on the positive class.", "The hard work that we have put in building a good model and selecting informative metrics serves a primary purpose: solve the real life problem. Therefore, try not to jump to conclusion that a certain method or methodology is the \u2018best\u2019, as one size can hardly fit all. If the data analytics practitioner is blessed with business domain knowledge, he or she might know how precision and recall are close to the heart of their clients. F1 score, in this case, merges precision and recall in a more interpretable way than MCC does. Only if the cost of low precision and low recall is really unknown or unquantifiable, MCC is preferred over F1 score as it is a more \u2018balanced\u2019 assessment of classifiers, no matter which class is positive.", "MCC is mathematically beautifully constructed, and it is all-rounded in the sense that output from the classifier is considered as one single entity \u2014 a variable that can be compared to true labels. It is arguably the best metric for binary classification problems.", "This Story strives to compare F1 score and MCC, and illustrates how F1 score can also be quite useful for classification problems that one usually encounters. Besides, prior knowledge of the problem (like domain knowledge), should always be considered when choosing the metric. What if F1 score is more of a concern by your dear clients?", "Your home for data science.
