This equation should look familiar to you as it represents the model of a simple linear regression. Here, E(Y|X) is a random variable.", "On the other hand, if Y was say a binary variable taking values 0 or 1, then E(Y|X) is a probability. This means 0 < \u03b2\u2080 +\u03b2\u2081X < 1, which is an assumption that does not always hold. But, if we consider log(E(Y|X)), we will have -\u221e < \u03b2\u2080 +\u03b2\u2081X < 0. This again is a restricted space, but much better than the initial case. If you are familiar with the simple logistic regression model, you will notice we are getting close to its actual form. Let us consider an odds ratio, which is defined as \u03a9 = \u03c0/(1-\u03c0) where 0 < \u03a9 < \u221e and \u03c0 is the probability of success. Here, let \u03c0 = E(Y|X) and then you will notice that", "and so we have range (-\u221e, \u221e). And that last equation is that of the common logistic regression.", "Before trying to build our model or interpret the meaning of logistic regression parameters, we must first account for extra variables that may influence the way we actually build and analyze our model. Often when dealing with categorical data analysis, there will be something referred to as a third variable that will have somewhat of an effect on the model you will be trying to build. Depending on the type of third variable you are dealing with, different measures should be taken to avoid false conclusions.", "A third categorical variable Z (with say k categories) is a confounding variable when there exists a direct relationship from Z to X and Z to Y, while Y depends on X. In other words, the confounder influences both the dependent and independent variables and often \u201chides\u201d an association. This latter phenomenon is referred to as a spurious relationship,which is a relationship where two or more variables are associated without being causally related as a result of the presence of a third variable.", "An interaction term, often, means that the third variable modifies the effect of say an exposure on the result. That is, if two variables of interest interact, then the relationship between them and the dependent variable depends on the value of the other interacting term.", "Consider first the simple linear regression where Y is continuous and X is binary. When X = 0, E(Y|X=0) = \u03b2\u2080 and when X = 1, E(Y|X=1) = \u03b2\u2080 + \u03b2\u2081. And so when interpreting the meaning of \u03b2\u2081, we say it represents the mean difference between the two groups i.e. the mean difference from when X = 0 (reference group) and when X = 1 (comparison group).", "Now, let us assume the simple case where Y and X are binary variables taking values 0 or 1.When it comes to logistic regression, the interpretation of \u03b2\u2081differs as we are no longer looking at means. Recall that logistic regression has model log(E(Y|X)/(1-E(Y|X)) = \u03b2\u2080 + \u03b2\u2081X or for simplification\u2019s sake, log(\u03c0/(1-\u03c0)) = \u03b2\u2080 + \u03b2\u2081X. This is all based on an odds ratio. When looking at what we would get for all possible values of X,", "If we wish to interpret \u03b2\u2081 from these two above cases, we will analyze it similarly as if it were a simple linear regression. That is, \u03b2\u2081 results from subtracting the result from when X = 1 to that of when X = 0:", "This shows that \u03b2\u2081 is a log odds ratio, and that exp(\u03b2\u2081) is an odds ratio.", "If the logistic model accounts for a third variable, whether it be a confounding or an interaction term, there could be different ways of interpreting the model parameters.", "Let Y and X be as discussed previously, and let Z be a third variable also taking values 0 or 1. The model that adjusts for confounding is log(E(Y|X,Z)/(1-E(Y|X,Z))) = log(\u03c0/(1-\u03c0)) = \u03b2\u2080 + \u03b2\u2081X + \u03b2\u2082Z. Again, let us see what we get for each value of the independent variables:", "Similarly, we will find that \u03b2\u2081 is the log(odds) between when X = 1 and X = 0 for each Z. And, exp(\u03b2\u2081) is the odds ratio.", "So we notice that when Z = 0, exp( \u03b2\u2081) is again an odds ratio and when Z = 1, exp( \u03b2\u2081 + \u03b2\u2081\u2082) is an odds ratio. Now, what about \u03b2\u2081\u2082 alone? In fact, exp(\u03b2\u2081\u2082) is interpreted as how much the odds ratio varies by the level of Z. This is referred to as the \u201cratio of odds ratios\u201d or \u201cdifference in difference\u201d.", "Let us consider a random subset of a large built-in dataset in R called the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study (NHANES).", "The data shown above is a subset of the original data, and only includes a few of the variables that are found in the original set. If you would like to find out more about the dataset, you may read more about it here.", "We will then fit a logistic regression model to the data as we wish to predict whether the subject is a smoker or not (SmokeNow). The summary of the model fitted is shown below.", "Significant variables, for this specific model, are those with a p-value less than 0.05. You will notice that they all have *, **, *** next to them, or \u00b7 if they are close to that level of significance. Note that this is just feature in R to help users visually identify significant covariates.", "The MaritalStatus variable is a categorical variable with six categories. Notice that that is one more than the number of categories listed in the regression summary above. This means that the unlisted category is the reference one. If we view all the levels of this variable, we will find that the categories are Divorced (reference group), LivePartner, Married, NeverMarried, Separated, and Widowed. In this case, the Married group is significant and has a beta \u03b2 estimate of -0.8162. What does this number mean exactly? Recall that we previously established that exp(\u03b2) is often the odds ratio between two groups. Here, the two groups are the Married group and the Divorced group (i.e. the reference group). Then, exp(-0.8162) = 0.4421. Thus, the odds of being a smoker in the Married group is 0.4421 times that of being a smoker in the Divorced group, when controlling for all other variables.", "The Age variable is a continuous one, and so there are no categories/levels to consider. This one has \u03b2 = -0.0363 and so exp(\u03b2) = 0.9644. We interpret this as, holding all else constance, one unit change in age will have 0.9644 units change in the odds ratio as the model is for log(odds) = log( \u03c0/(1-\u03c0)).", "A similar interpretation can be derived for the highest Education attained level if needed.", "Your home for data science.
