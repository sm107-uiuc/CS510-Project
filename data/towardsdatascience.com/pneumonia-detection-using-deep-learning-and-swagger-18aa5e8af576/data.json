Furthermore, we will also add a GUI to it using swagger API. An important thing to note here is that the GUI will be created with significantly less amount of time. Since there are two main parts in this article, we will discuss the deep learning usage in pneumonia detection followed by using swagger to create a quick front end.", "In any deep learning use case, the first term by which you can get started is the data. In this detection, we will use the data set of normal and pneumonia chest X-rays available here. The data set contains the three directory train, test, and validation. Subdirectory inside these three is: normal and pneumonia which contains the images used to train, test, and validate the model. In total, we have 5856 images. After understanding the data set now let us move towards the training part. Firstly we will import all the useful libraries", "In the above snippet, we have imported the library like NumPy, which is used for array processing, pandas, which is used in data frame creation and operation, OS, which is used in path and directory related operation. Other directories will be discussed as and when we will use it in our code.", "In this problem, we will keep the size of all image same. Hence, resizing all the image.", "We will declare the train and test path into the variable. After that in our case, we are using transfer learning techniques like VGG16 to get better accuracy. To perform this we have to import the VGG16 model.", "The input shape parameter has plus 3 because of three RGB channels. The weights are taken from imagenet competition. Furthermore, the include_top is kept False because we only need to classify among two classes.To not retrain the pre-trained layers we have to make all the layers trainable as False.", "To get all the categories under the train folder path in a list we use a glob method.", "By keeping include_top as False we have not specified the last layer in the model. Here, we will add our customized last layers.", "In prediction, while adding a dense layer we have passed the argument len(folders), which states the classes normal and pneumonia. So, len(folders) are two.After specifying the last layer, we will now create an object model. Which has standard VGG input, which we have defined above, and prediction as output.", "Now we will compile the defined model object.", "After compiling, to load the data set with some pre-processing and image augmentation so our model gets more image to learn from. We use an image data generator. This helps to rescale images and generate more images by performing horizontal flip, shearing, and zooming on given images.", "Now we will create a training set to feed into model training. This objective is achieved by using the flow from the directory function.", "Now, we will train the model with 5 epoch you may also increase the epoch if you wish to do so.", "After successfully training the model on five epochs it gives validation accuracy around 95% which is good enough in any scenario. After that, we will save the model in the \u201ch5\u201d form.", "This part shows how quickly we can make the front end to demo our output of the model. This will take less than 10 minutes to perform. This will be done in another file named app.py", "Firstly, importing required library like Flask, flassger, and swagger", "After that, we will load the saved \u201ch5 model\u201d.", "After this, the simple flask app is created and in which the swagger API is used to create a ready easy to use front end page. The flask app has two function welcome, to which we are redirected when we click on our local host link. Another function is predict_note_file which is displayed in browser by adding \u201c/predict_file\u201d to the local host link.The below code describes the flask app functionality incorporated with flassger.", "In the function predict_note_file, the data that is image is transferred in the post method form. The docstring contains the attribute, parameters, and responses. The described parameter in docstring is incorporated into the generated page with swagger API. Furthermore, to activate swagger API we have to add \u201c/apidocs\u201d to the end of the local host link. You will get more clarity on it when you will watch the below output demo video. After getting the image we pre-process it to make it compatible with our model input form and predict the output accordingly.This figure describes the step by step process in making pneumonia detection with the help of swagger API and other related classifiers.", "In this article, we have seen how we can implement pneumonia detection with a very simple front end UI without much effort for the front end. This flassger code could be considered as a template and you can deploy any of the machine learning models with the help of this front end easily. This is helpful for people who do not have any prior knowledge of web development. Moreover, this also helps them to test their model on a variety of data easily. Hence this article denotes the deep learning technique behind pneumonia detection and usage of swagger API to visualize the working of the model on the local server.", "If you have any queries, then you can ping me Here.", "For all the source code you can visit Here.", "Your home for data science.
