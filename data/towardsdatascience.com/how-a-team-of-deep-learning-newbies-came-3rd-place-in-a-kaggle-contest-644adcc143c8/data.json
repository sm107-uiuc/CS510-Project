The challenge was to create a model that predicts the presence of oil palm plantations in satellite imagery. Planet and Figure Eight generously provided an annotated dataset of satellite images recently taken by Planet\u2019s satellites. The dataset images are of 3-meter spatial resolution, and each is labeled based on the presence of an oil palm plantation in the image (0 for no plantation, 1 for the presence of a plantation). The task was to train a model that takes as input a satellite image and outputs a prediction of the likelihood of an image containing an oil palm plantation. Labeled training and test datasets were provided for model development by the competition creators. Read more here.", "My Teammates and I (Abdishakur, Halimah, and Ifeoma Okoh) used the fast.ai framework for this challenge. Big thanks to Thomas Capelle\ud83e\udd17 for his starter kernel on kaggle, it provided so much insight into how to approach this problem and also the fast.ai team for creating an amazing deep learning course that simplifies a lot of difficult deep learning concepts. Now beginners to deep learning can now go as far as winning kaggle contests \ud83d\ude01.", "Don\u2019t worry about understanding everything just yet, that\u2019ll come with lots of practice. This tutorial is meant to show you how cool fast.ai is for beginners to deep learning. I\u2019m assuming you know some python and you\u2019ve dabbled with ML a little. If that\u2019s you; then we are on track.", "All the code shown here is available on Google Colaboratory; a free Jupyter notebook environment that requires no setup and runs entirely in the cloud. With Colaboratory you can write and execute code, save and share your analyses, and access powerful computing resources, all for free from your browser. Click here to access the code we\u2019ll be using.", "To keep this as straight forward as possible, Abdishakur uploaded the competition datafiles to dropbox.com. You can find them on the competition webpage here. You\u2019ll need to accept the rules of the competition and join to have access to the data.", "The first thing to do when we approach a problem is to take a look at the available data. We\u2019ll need to understand the problem and what the data looks like before we can figure out how to solve it. Taking a look at the data means understanding how the data directories are structured, what the labels are and what some sample images look like.", "The main difference between handling image classification datasets and tabular datasets is the way labels are stored. Labels here refers to what\u2019s in the image. In this particular dataset, labels were stored in a CSV file.", "To find out more about how the score column was calculated, click here.", "We\u2019ll use seaborn\u2019s countplot function to look at the distribution of our training data.

We\u2019ll use a convolutional neural network backbone and use pre-trained weights from a resnet model that has been trained to classify a wide range of images. Don\u2019t worry about what this means in detail. For now, we are building a model which takes satellite images as input and outputs the predicted probability for the two categories.", "Next, we find an ideal learning rate using lr_find() and visualize this using recorder.plot().", "We\u2019ll select a learning rate close to where our slope is steepest,1e-2 in our case.", "We\u2019ll train our model for 5 epochs (5 cycles through all our data) using the fit_one_cycle function.", "Notice the metrics getting displayed i.e training_loss and valid_loss?

That\u2019s progress.", "You\u2019ll notice we\u2019ve been following a pattern during training and tweaking a few parameters in the course of this. What we\u2019ve been doing is called tuning. Most deep learning experiments follow a similar iterative pattern.", "We\u2019ll perform some more image transformations on our data. This should improve our model. A detailed description of what each transform does can be found in the fast.ai documentation:", "We find an optimal learning rate again.", "Compare the training metrics and compare with past metrics. Our model is slightly worse on this iteration 0.0169 versus 0.0163 . Don\u2019t despair just yet.", "Save the third stage of model training and print out the metrics. As you\u2019ll notice the model\u2019s accuracy is now 99.38% , it was99.48% in the previous stage. The AUC score improved from 99.87% to 99.91%, this is the metric the competition is graded on.", "If you notice we started with the images having size = 164 and we gradually built up till we arrived at size = 256 down below. We did this to take advantage of fast.ai\u2019s progressive image resizing for classification i.e using small images at the start of training, and gradually increasing size as training progresses. That way, when the model is very inaccurate early on, it can quickly see lots of images and make rapid progress, and later in training, it can see larger images to learn about more fine-grained distinctions.
