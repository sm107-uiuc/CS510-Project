The goal of research for artificial intelligence is to develop programs (software), which will enable computers to behave in a way that is characterized as intelligent. The first researches relate to the very roots of computing. The idea of \u200b\u200bcreating machines that will be able to perform various tasks intelligently was the central preoccupation of computer science researchers who ventured to research artificial intelligence throughout the second half of the 20th century. Today, research in artificial intelligence is focused on expert systems, translation systems in limited domains, the recognition of human speech and written text, automatic proofers of the theorem, as well as the constant interest in creating generally intelligent, autonomous agents.", "Artificial intelligence as a term in a wider sense means the capacity of an artificial creation to realize functions that are a characteristic of human thinking. The possibility of developing a similar creation has awakened people\u2019s interest since ancient times. However, only in the second half of the 20th century, such a possibility was given to the first tool (computers), which opened the way for this venture.", "With the advent of modern science, Artificial Intelligence research is developing over two basic directions: psychological and physiological research of the nature of the human mind, and the technological development of increasingly complex information systems.", "In this sense, the term AI is initially attributed to systems and computer programs with the capacity to realize complex tasks, simulating the functioning of human thinking, although even today, is quite far from the goal. In this sphere, the most important areas of research are the processing of information, the recognition of models from different areas of knowledge, games and applied areas, such as medicine, for example.", "Some areas of today\u2019s information processing research are concentrating on programs that seek to train a computer to understand written and verbal information, create summaries, give answers to specific questions, or redistribute data to users interested in certain parts of that information. In these programs, it is essential to have the capacity of a system to create grammatically correct sentences and to establish a connection between words and ideas, or the identification of meanings. Research has shown that while the problems of the structural logic of the language, or its syntax, can be solved by programming the appropriate algorithms, the problem of meaning, or semantics, is much deeper and goes towards authentic artificial intelligence.[1]", "The main tendencies today for the development of the AI system are the development of expert systems and the development of neural networks. Expert systems try to reproduce human thought over the symbols. Neural networks do it more from a biological perspective (they recreate the structure of the human brain using genetic algorithms). Despite the complexity of both systems, the results are far from real intelligent thinking.", "Many scientists are skeptics of the possibility of developing a true Artificial Intelligence. The functioning of human thinking is still not deeper known, for whatever reason, the information design of intelligent systems will be essentially incapable of presenting these unknown and complex processes for an even longer period of time.", "Research in AI focuses on the following intelligence components: learning, thinking, problem solving, perception and language usage.", "It has already been pointed out that AI represents a novelty in the history of humanity and that it is a revolutionary agent of science, economics, health, culture, and society in the widest sense. However, the fact is that most contemporary societies are strongly polarized, on the one hand, to layers of enormously rich and powerful, and on the other on plebs that do not have enough influence to change anything important. [2]", "Application of AI greatly enhances the existing structure of power and contributes more to its \u201csharpening\u201d, in that its use is richer and richer, and the poor remain where are they were or even impoverished and not only in material terms. In the domain of economics, analytics and decision-making, in one word of acquiring and using power, AI requires experts of superior knowledge, nothing less powerful equipment, and money capital, and it turns out that, in its full capacity, this tool is very expensive and available only to very wealthy individuals and companies. Because of this, middle and lower classes AI can be used to a much smaller extent for business progression. These layers are available mainly through massive mobile applications devices that significantly simplify a whole range of jobs, starting from the fast-tracking of the desired product or service, a much shorter time to make a purchase decision and the shortest route to reach these products, whether it\u2019s about physically going to the point of sale or purchasing over the Internet. This part of the society is, therefore, perfectly served in its own the role of the consumer, but he can use the AI much less as a drive for large-scale operations, like that can be rich companies and individuals. The rest of the massive AI services are fun and endless news and service information.", "True, the ordinary world is now incomparably more informed about the tiniest details of a tragic event \u2014 a terrorist attack, a traffic accident, a war conflict \u2014 as well sporting events, scandalous acts of public figures and political affairs. This should be accompanied by strong growth in communication through social networks.", "In the next section, I would like to talk about some of the larger implementations of AI in our current world.", "Everyone is talking about machines. Artificial Intelligence. AI. Replace the man. This is a big topic that is widely discussed at a global level. Because, logically, people are scared. For your future. Some of the biggest companies are working hard at the breakthrough in artificial intelligence. Numerous large IT companies have been actively (and increasingly) investing in artificial intelligence for many years.", "And it would seem that IBM went a step further. IBM has developed the IBM Watson cognitive computing application that is found in all areas \u2014 from making the most sophisticated business decisions to daily activities of broad masses. This system exists and has been developing for quite some time, and has managed to win the American popular Jeopardy show in 2011.", "Then, indeed, \u201chistory was made.\u201d Because one is to learn a supercomputer to play chess, and something completely different to understand the complex, difficult and complicated sets of sentences of an English language full of synonyms, slang, and logic, and based on that the correct answer.", "Today, Watson is even more advanced. To the extent of frustration. Because it is no longer intended only for large systems with huge money funds. No! Some of its services are completely free, and it is possible to apply them everywhere, even in the smallest startups. It\u2019s also used in cooking, where the Chef Watson application helps cooks in creating new recipes. The point is, nothing is programmed. Best of everything- after being \u201cinvolved\u201d with thousands of recipes, Chef Watson broke into his own mouth, which food, spices, and other things best go and agree with one another. And he continues to learn. So one cook managed to make the best risotto. In his opinion.", "Thus, such a gruesome AI system (artificial intelligence) can be applied in many business areas, from the smallest, such as the culinary industry to many advanced ones, such as time analysis and forecast and flight control. For example, this program can be applied to a small startup that has just begun to analyze its clients. You have a base of, say, 2,000 clients. He will analyze, instead of you, the way they came to your site, how long they stayed, from which countries (after registration), to compare with the culture and habits of people from those countries, and who knows what else, and that In the end, you can report how to \u201capproach\u201d and how to sell it to him. Scary. But impressive. Also, Watson can also be used as a chatbot. Instead of paying expensive support, because you just started with a startup, make it from a Watson chatbot that will suit your customers, which you\u2019ve previously analyzed.", "And when I see all this, I know that the future will be gloomy for some, but for some wonderful ones. That\u2019s how it always was in human civilization. Refrigerators have been replaced by ice sellers, car and car horses and horses, and the AI will surely take some of the cake to some other businesses like taxi drivers and truck drivers. Or maybe accountants.", "The rapid growth of processor power and memory capacity of computers during the eighties and nineties has increasingly reduced the difference between top chess players and the best systems. Finally, in May 1997, Deep Blue, a chess computer developed by IBM, defeated the then-current world champion in the chess, Gary Kasparov. The match consisted of 6 games, and the winning ratio was 2: 1 for Deep Blue, with 3 draws.", "Unlike chess, which is a game in a virtual world with a limited set of rules, dealing with problems from the physical world is much more complex: each rule has many exceptions, and often unforeseen situations occur on the way to the desired goal. One of these areas is driving a car. Since the end of the 1970s, research has been carried out in the field of autonomous vehicles \u2014 vehicles that could safely arrive from point A to point B without human intervention.", "After the second artificial intelligence crisis in the late 1980s, the US government and the defense ministry changed the funding strategy of the research. Within the framework of this strategy, DARPA organizes competitions in areas that fill the gap between fundamental research and military use. One of these competitions was the DARPA Grand Challenge, which offered a cash prize to a team that makes use of an autonomous vehicle. At the first competition, held in 2004, none of the registered vehicles failed to cross the envisaged, 240km long route through the desert and mountain roads of California and Nevada. Already next year, in 2005, as many as five vehicles reached the finish line, the award was given to the fastest vehicle, Stanley from Stanford University. During 2006 and 2007, successful DARPA sponsored competitions in the movement of autonomous vehicles in urban areas were held.", "In the last couple of years, answering questions posed in a natural language has become one of the features of smart mobile devices. Thus, the Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface (SIRI) became an integral part of the iPhone 4S smartphone launched at the end of 2011. SIRI communicates with the owner of the phone in a natural language, is able to answer questions and make recommendations for restaurants or films, as well as adjusting over time to his owner.", "Tests on the application of artificial intelligence that has been implemented in over 13 areas show that 86 percent of leading business people in banking already benefit from this technology. Most agree that by 2020, they will have embedded AI technology in various operations throughout the financial system, from a global to a local level. The main way in which technology is changing banking is through increasing the degree of automation. It is assumed that automation will reduce business costs by 15 percent, and artificial intelligence plays a leading role in this.", "The problem that opens when it comes to technological advancement and automation is the impact that will leave it to the number of jobs that are in circulation. Despite the well-thought that automation means the loss of many jobs, companies that use artificial intelligence in their business largely create new jobs. It is anticipated that the number of new businesses related to the development and management of AI systems will increase by 16% by 2025.", "However, as with any technological innovation, what determines its success is to what extent it facilitates business and improves customer experience. If the bank\u2019s customers are satisfied that the AI \u200b\u200bsystem saves time, directing them to a real financial product, this suggests that the application of advanced technology in business is successful. Good results will be absent if new services are a source of frustration for users or additionally confuse them. The effectiveness of the application of artificial intelligence in the financial sector over a longer period of time can be seen only through a noticeable improvement in the experience of the bank\u2019s clients and the ability of banking officers to offer customers better services. The good news is that AI systems have the ability to do so.", "As mentioned all current and future AI systems are going to be a great asset to human beings, but what about our real intelligence? Is it going to a decade as we rely on artificial one and never do the complex problems ourselves? Does that make us higher or lower in our IQ?", "All these questions are crucial to our existence and about AI. But what is more important are the answers to these same questions, which are very hard to be answered.", "In my opinion, robots are never going to take over the world, but it is a possibility.", "This modern world where everything is powered by machines and a small number is representing human power, we rely on machines to do everything for us, which could lead to terrible human perspectives of life on this earth.", "Artificial intelligence is no longer something that awaits us in the future. It has been long since it has become our present and, definitely, our future will be in the super-digital world. Children are already today, they work at their homework and sleep using apps with the help of artificial intelligence systems such as Siri (Apple) or Alex (Amazon). Researchers at Yale University are working hard on an \u201cartificial pancreas\u201d controlled by mobile phone and an application that with an algorithm knows unmistakably when your pancreas needs insulin. The largest supermarket in the world, Walmart, has already commissioned 15 electric vehicles from Tesla, which will be driven by artificial intelligence-powered autopilots without drivers. Large companies from the FMCG industry have long been using smart software for targeted and personal advertising. Artificial Intelligence allows them to predict what type of advertisement will best \u201cemotionally affect you\u201d and affect your consumer habits. Algorithms and smart machines are already traded on financial stock exchanges.", "Global technological changes may be happening too fast because in all likelihood, even more, developed and wealthier societies are unable to adequately monitor digital transformation. A great debate on the social consequences of the increasing use of new digital technologies has flooded all media and professional portals.", "Fear of artificial intelligence has flooded the world. There is an increasing number of those seeking guarantees and mechanisms for \u201cresponsible use of artificial intelligence\u201d. The first to be hit will be manual workers, but managers and doctors, professors will come to the scene. Robots will quickly take over a large number of jobs.[3]", "The question is what kind of fate awaits those people who will lose their jobs because of smart machines and whether they will be able to adapt and learn from the beginning some completely new digital interests.", "How much the modern economy has changed is best illustrated by the fact that today the richest are those companies that make money on something that is intangible, like software. Even countries have lost their significance. This was very graphically explained by the first man of Alibaba Jack Ma (Jack Ma). \u201cNo one will say \u2018Made in Germany\u2019 or \u2018Made in China\u2019, everything will be \u2018Made on the Internet,\u2019\u201d said Alibaba founder, who has just retired.", "There is no doubt that the world is in great technological transformation and that it will contribute to a better life and improvement of many areas. However, the so-called \u201cbig data\u201d and digital technology will be the largest resource around which the main political and corporate struggles will be conducted. The main players in global transformation such as Google, IBM, Facebook, Amazon or Alibaba have a great responsibility. As corporations, they have an obligation to meet human needs for digital technologies, but as members of the global community have a moral obligation to make these processes more humane. We will agree, in the end, the final decision is made by a man, not a robot or algorithm. At least for now.", "Your home for data science.
