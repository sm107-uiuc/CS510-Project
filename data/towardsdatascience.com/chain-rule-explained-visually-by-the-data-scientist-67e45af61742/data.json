On the x-axis, we measured how much they worked as a Data Scientist, and on the y-axis, we measured their salary.", "We can now fit this green parabola to the data.", "The equation for the parabola is", "salary = (years as Data Scientist)**2", "The derivative of this equation tells us the slope of the tangent line at any point along the curve. Whereas, the slope of the tangent line tells us how quickly salaryis changing with respect to the yearsworking as a Data Scientist. We can calculate the derivative of salary with respect to years by using the power rule!", "The power rule tells us to multiply yearsworked by the power which is 2 and raise yearsworked by the power 2\u20131, which results in the following equation.", "Well, that was a quick recap of the derivative :)", "Now let\u2019s dive into the chain rule with a super simple example! Imagine we collected weight and height measurements from three people and then we fit a line to the data.", "Now if someone tells us they weigh this much we can use the green line to predict that they are this tall.", "Now imagine we collected height and shoe size measurements and we fit a line to the data.", "Now if someone tells us that they are this tall we can use the orange line to predict that this is their shoe size!", "And now if someone tells us that they weigh this much then we can predict their height and we can use the predicted height to predict shoe size and if we change the value for the weight we see a change in shoe size!", "Now let\u2019s focus on this green line that represents the relationship between weight and height. Let\u2019s say that for every one-unit increase in weight there\u2019s a two-unit increase in height.", "In other words, the slope of the line is 2 divided by 1 which equals 2. Since the slope is 2, the derivative is", "Now since the slope of the green line is the same as its derivative 2, the equation for height is", "height = dHeight / DWeight * weight", "Note, that the equation for height has no intercept because the green line goes through the origin.", "Now let\u2019s focus on the green line that represents the relationship between height and shoe size.", "In this case, let\u2019s say that for every one-unit increase in height there is a one-quarter unit increase in shoe size. Following the same logic as above the equation for the green line is", "Shoe size = dSize / dHeight * height", "Note that again, because the green line goes through the origin the equation for shoe size has no intercept.", "Now because weight can predict height and height can predict shoe size we can plug the equation for height into the equation for shoe size. And if we want to determine exactly how shoe size changes with respect to changes in weight we can take the derivative of shoe size with respect to weight.", "The derivative of the equation for shoe size with respect to weight is just the product of the two derivatives! In other words, because height connects weight to shoe size, the derivative of shoe size with respect to weight is", "Shoe size = dSize / dHeight * dHeigt/dWeight * weight", "This relationship is the essence of the chain rule. Plugging in numbers gives us one half and that means for every one unit increase in weight there is a one-half unit increase in shoe size!", "Well, you can see that there is nothing complicated inside the chain rule, we are just calculating how one parameter changes w.r.t other parameters! I hope that this quick visual explanation of the chain rule was helpful for you and your future career!
