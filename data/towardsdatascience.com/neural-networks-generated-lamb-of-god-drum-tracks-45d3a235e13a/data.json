I did some quick experiments in Jupyter notebook back then, recently I finally have time to rewrite the code and write a blog post about it. LSTMetallica and #NeuralBeats have done similar works already. Both authors used LSTM to train on several drum tracks of their choice. For me, I choose Lamb of God.", "Note: If you are only interested in listening to the results, you can go directly to the result section. And the code can be found here.", "Generating drum beats as my target is rather straight forward for me since I had been playing drums in a band with my friends from high school until I decided to study abroad. Compared to Lamb of God, the music we used to play was much softer, but I admire Chris Adler\u2019s bass drum techniques. (Take a look of the \u201csimple\u201d beats he demonstrated in that video.) Additionally, there are more interesting drum patterns in the songs.", "The other reason to choose LoG probably just because there are more resources of MIDI files compared to the other drummers I like such as Steve Jordan and Aaron Spears.", "First, let\u2019s take a look at how human plays drums and why neural networks might be promising tools for generating drum beats. Playing instruments is an art, which might be affected by several reasons: emotions, techniques, the skills of the players, etc. However, in order to make the music coherent, one of the most important factors probably is the past patterns that have been played.", "Likewise, we can think of playing drums as a process of continuously predicting the rhythms, patterns we are going to play based on the previous ones which have been played. (Of course, if you were playing in a band, there is more information to take into consideration but that\u2019s another story and we are dealing with a single drum track here.)", "Instead of training a model directly on raw audios, I decided to use MIDI files as the data source since the format is more understandable for human, providing me more intuition when tuning the model. After some keywords search on Google, I was able to find some LoG MIDI tracks. The data preprocessing took almost 70% of my time on this experiment so I would work through the process in more detail.", "To work with MIDI format in python, I choose to use Mido to parse MIDI files. Mido parses MIDI file as an object, which consists of several tracks, in general, each track contains all the notes of one instrument.", "Each track has several messages, which control how and when to play a note. As shown below, the message type \u2018note_on\u2019 and \u2018note_off\u2019 control when the instrument (\u2018channel\u2019) should play. Channel 9 indicates percussion instruments and \u2018note\u2019 represent the exact instrument that should be played. There are other types of messages, but for this experiment, \u2018note_on\u2019 is the most important one. \u2018note_off\u2019 is usually not necessary for percussion instruments because they have no length although it\u2019s recommended to use \u2018note_off\u2019 whenever a note was on.", "Having this knowledge, the first thing to do is quantization, which means constraining a signal into a discrete set. In this case, I want to make every note to be played exactly on a 32-note. I am aware that this might distort the triplet and sextuplet notes, but most of the notes can be quantized into one 32-note. The image below gives a data frame view of some notes after one-hot encoding, where 1 means play and 0 means don\u2019t. The numbers in the columns represent the instrument. e.g. 36: bass drum. Thus, what we want to do is to predict the in the next 32-note, what instruments should be played based on the information we have previously.", "To reduce complexity, I cut off the columns to retain only the most frequent n (6 or 8) instruments and you might have already noticed, I ignored the velocity too.", "There is another encoding method, you can encode every combination of instruments and create a new categorical variable. For example, if we choose to encode 4 instruments, then in total we would have 2\u2074 = 16 combinations. This is exactly what #NeuralBeats did. However, I found that in my case, the encoding scheme shown in the figure works better.", "Long short-term memory (LSTM) is probably most people would come up with when using the neural network to deal with sequential data. LSTM is said to be able to remember long term dependencies. I am not going into details here as there are already plenty of resources explaining LSTM.", "On the other hand, convolutional neural networks (CNN) are famous for image classification, recognition, etc, but recent research has demonstrated that they also work pretty well on sequential data. One example is WaveNet, a state of the art generative model for Text-to-Speech. The authors also showed that it can be used for music generation.", "I built and trained both models with Keras. As in most of the machine learning project, I used early stopping to prevent the models from overfitting, especially we don\u2019t really want the model to generate exactly the same beats they have seen. In addition to model structures, I also experimented with different lengths, 32 notes, and 128 notes for both models. The image below shows the training loss and validation loss of both models with 128 inputs length. As you can see, CNN is able to capture the patterns quite fast but starts to overfit on the training set, while LSTM slowly improve until the end of the last epochs and it is still outperformed by CNN. Although the model was able to improve further after I increased the epochs, I found that LSTM works better with shorter input length in my experiment. I could have continued to try different LSTM settings such as stateful LSTM or even combining CNN and LSTM. However, tuning the models to get the best performance is simply not the target of this experiment.", "If we really think about how we formulate the problem, it\u2019s actually not that intelligent. Most of the drum beats in the music are repetitive in most bars. The most common pattern is to add drum fills at the end of every 4th bar. As you can see from the drum notes below, there are usually different beats at the end of each line. Let\u2019s say if we fit 32 32-note to a model and ask it to predict the next note. Then it only has to predict exactly the 1st 32-note in the input sequence. The difficult parts might be to detect this 4-bar cycle and predict the corresponding drum fills.", "In addition to looking into the evaluation metrics, I decided to check the quality of the model by directly listening to the beats it generated in two scenarios.", "First, because of the input-output setting, we need to predict multi-step ahead to create a pattern, otherwise, the model is only going to predict one step ahead. (one 32-note) There are several ways to do this, one of them is to predict recursively, which means we take the predicted result to the next input and recursively forecast until we reach the ideal length. In a recursive setting, I would expect the model can at least duplicate the given notes in the same length and continue to do so until the end.", "The second setting is to concatenate all the one step ahead predictions to get the drum beats with target length. The expectation should be higher since, at every time step, the model get the ground truth of what has been played by the drummer. A good model should not only be able to duplicate the given beats but also detect the drum fills and cycles shown by the real song.", "Finally, let\u2019s first hear how the models perform in these two scenarios.", "The beats are all generated by models trained on 128 inputs length. I concatenate the real inputs at the beginning so we can hear what the model actually get. You can find that the model did a quite poor job, it can not even detect the 1 bar pattern for track 1 and 2. The 3rd track is generated by the LSTM trained on 32 inputs length. Fortunately, it at least captures the 1 barpattern and repetitively generated the same until the end.", "As we expect, since the model gets the ground truth every step, the model does not predict repetitively. However, the generated beats are still not very pleasant to hear, especially the wired bass drum in track 1. I guess it tries to predict the sextuplet but is forced to be quantized in 32-note. In general, I believe LSTM could be improved by increasing the epochs and reducing the input lengths with reasonable batch size. As mentioned earlier, one can also try different structures. In this post, I just want to demonstrate what a poor model might sound like compared to a better one. If you are interested in better results, let\u2019s move on.", "Cool! It seems like CNN is able to not only detect 1 bar pattern but also \u201cimprovise\u201d a bit. Note that the first 4 bars are the inputs.", "The generated tracks are getting more realistic.", "Except for directly listening to the generated tracks, I was thinking about a way to visually inspect the model quality. For cardinal time series analysis, there are autocorrelation plot, time plot, etc. After training a model, one can use these tools to check the residuals to see if your model still left out some useful information.", "However, we are dealing with categorical time series data, the categorical variable is lack of natural order. Eventually, I found this paper\u00b9 which presents a couple of visualization tools, especially for categorical time series data. One of them is the pattern histogram and I think it would be a nice visualization to compare the generated patterns and the true patterns.", "The basic idea is to calculate the frequency of an event after it occurs until the desired time. For example, if we want to get the bass drum patterns of length 128, we get all the occurrences of the bass drum and their following 128 notes to see how frequently does bass drum play in each of the 128 steps. You can see the figures below. Bass drum apparently appears to be the most frequent. (It\u2019s Chris Adler\u2026) In general, there are spikes in every 8th, 16th, 32nd note, etc.", "If we compare the predicted pattern bar chart with the real one directly, we can see that the model is able to capture the overall bass drum patterns, for the snare drum, the model detects the spikes for every 16th note but seems not able to find the patterns in between. However, it is very hard to find any difference for bass drums by just visually comparing them. A better solution is to subtract the predicted value from the truth.", "I considered the value after deduction as some kind of residuals of drum patterns prediction. As the figure below, in general, the model predicts fewer played beats than the real patterns, as there are remarkably positive differences (real - predict) in all instruments. This might be fixed by lowering the threshold from 0.5 to 0.4 for instance.", "Generating music with algorithms is not something new. And strictly speaking, the trained models do not really \u201cgenerate\u201d drum tracks. The setting of the model \u2019s loss function (Binary cross entropy) is simply to ask the model to play exactly like Chris Adler, a typical setting for classification problems. The closest one in this small experiment probably is to let the model predict recursively but as we can see that the models tend to repeat the same patterns after a certain length without capturing the long term structures. We cannot blame the models, this is just the safest guess based on what the models have been trained on. Some research has introduced additional structures such as Attention RNN and Lookback RNN to tackle this problem. For CNN, the most direct way for the model to detect long term structure probably is to increase the length of inputs to include most of the patterns.", "However, to better realize the idea of applying neural networks to generate music, there are some advanced neural network structures such as Generative Adversarial Networks or Variational Autoencoders. They have been applied to image and music\u00b2 generation. Implementing a generative network to generate drum beats would be a good idea for writing another blog post."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
