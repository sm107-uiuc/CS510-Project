Some of these books cover comprehensive knowledge about the programming language while some are excellent in giving you hands-on experience with it.", "Regardless of your previous experience with Python or any programming language for that matter, we\u2019re sure you will find some great handy tips from these books for your next project.", "Disclaimer: Those affiliate links are for information purposes only.", "Get Both Books here \u2014 Amazon, Amazon", "As the name suggests, the author has written this book to act as a quick crash course for readers with little to no programming exposure. The author has made all the introductory concepts as easy as ABC for beginners so that they can start implementing their knowledge on fun projects. The introductory nature of this book also makes it a fitting choice for academics.", "This two-part book covers the introduction to programming in its first part, whereas in the second part, it takes on a project-driven approach where the readers are encouraged to complete any or all three programming projects.

Also being a two-part book like the previous one, the author Mark Lutz has tried to create a solid foundation with Python in this part, while the other part focusses more on real-life examples and situations for better practical programming exposure.", "The latest edition of the book covers Python v3.3 and all its latest improvements along with the older v2.7.

If you constantly find yourself occupied with analyzing and manipulating structured data or are simply keen on learning about how efficient Python can be for data analysis tasks, you might find this book useful.", "The author has explained the fundamentals of working with data in a very comprehensive manner while also touching upon the topic of scientific computing.

Though it does require some knowledge of using Python to implement the vast collection of algorithms and models covered by the libraries followed in the book, such as scikit-learn, NumPy, and matplotlib.", "Data Science is becoming more of an imperative skill in various domains lately as the benefits it offers is invaluable. The author of this handbook has put more emphasis on learning Data Science as a skill than a new domain of knowledge, as it can prove to be advantageous while applying the skill to a problem in hand.", "The contents of the book have been structured into five different libraries provided by Python for extensive coverage, i.e, IPython, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn.

If you do know the basics of programming, hop on.", "Python can be a very versatile and powerful programming language when used efficiently, and this very motive is the sole driving factor for the book Fluent Python. It is clear that learning Python and achieving fluency in Python are both very different things. Most developers will often achieve what they want with Python anyways but at the cost of its full potential.", "The author has emphasized on highlighting some of the less utilized features and techniques to make it possible to get the most out of Python. If you have recently started learning Python, this might not be the right book for you, as you might find it hard to follow.", "Python is a programming language that puts a high emphasis on creating clear and extremely readable code, but there can still be some situations where that isn\u2019t achieved.

The recipes come with relevant examples and detailed background studies on the problems from some of the most insightful members of the community.", "To make it absolutely clear, the author has targeted this book towards experienced Python developers looking to strengthen their understanding of the various modern techniques in Python. Beginners are suggested to pick up something that covers the introductory parts of Python before starting with the Python Cookbook.", "Python is an elegant and powerful programming language that can do wonders if utilized correctly. The books covered in this write-up should provide you sufficient knowledge to get you started with Python along with some additional tips and tricks to write a clear and optimized code that works beautifully.
