Being from Chicago, every time I meet people from out of state, they can\u2019t help but talk to me about murder rates in the city but very few people bring this topic up from a point of data awareness.", "In part one of this series, I cleaned the crime data but now I will attempt to extract some insights from the data on the ground. In this section I will use the newly created pandas dataframe from the previous section to paint a picture of homicides across the city of Chicago.", "the most dangerous place in Chicago is on the streets, in the summer time, on a weekend, between 11 pm and 2 am.", "The first thing we want to see is the homicide crime distribution for the whole city grouped by police districts.", "We will use Seaborn for this. We\u2019ll draw inspiration from the earlier scatter plots in part one to visualize all homicides from 2001 to February 2018 by districts. Below is the code and the resulting plot.", "From the visual above we can observe the following:", "Since each district is a different color, the big insight we can get from this chart is that the districts with a lot of points clustered together have more homicide rates than the ones that do not. So now, to some degree we have an idea of homicide from a spatial dimension but I would also wanted to understand these homicide rates from a time dimension.", "Below I created some homicide vs time visualization and made notes on the observations thereafter.", "From the above barchart visualization we can draw the following conclusions:", "Next we digger deeper for a more granular look from the monthly to the weekly time frame.", "Continuing with the time frame analysis, it makes sense to look at homicide rates in Chicago from a time of the day perspective. I think it is easy to make assumptions that murders occur more at night than during the day but at best it\u2019s just a guess so it was wise to look at the numbers no matter how obvious we think the conclusion is.", "One way to look at the above plot is from a normal work day or school day perspective.", "Above I created a heatmap comparing all Chicago Police Districts vs. the number of Homicides per district from 2001 to 2017.", "As we observed from the heat map earlier, some districts are more dangerous than others but now we can explore this observation more closely. From the various visualizations we have created, we can at least conclude that 2016 and 2017 have been the most active years for homicides in Chicago.", "Next I looked at the relationship between arrest and homicides by plotting some relationships below.", "It looks like you could get away with murder in Chicago.", "The chart above compares arrest vs. non-arrests for all homicides in the dataset for all 17 years.", "A further break down of the arrest vs. non-arrest on a district level, of just the high homicide districts, added more weight to my previous observation of decreasing number of arrests over the years in the dataset. The plots above show regression lines of both arrests and non-arrests on the same axis for the top 10 most dangerous districts.", "The trend of police making less arrests than the previous year had already began before 2006 and by 2010 the tables flipped in all districts to making arrests on less than half of all homicides.", "It may well be that the odds of getting arrested for a homicide are less than half. The odds get much better if you are a criminal living in a high crime district.", "Next I used Folium which is a python visualization album to create some maps illustrating some of my findings and make notes below. The maps on the original code are user responsive so you can zoom in and out and move them around.", "Note: I also created time lapse heat maps and cluster maps which are more interactive and can be viewed here and on github.", "Finally, I created cluster maps that show clusters of murder locations. A live interactive notebook rendered on nbviewer is located here.", "These map individual crime scenes which is more or less like the heat mapping without the color added to these geo locations. One of the maps is for the 2016\u20132017 period and the other is for the 2 month data available for 2018 (January and February).", "The January and February map is particularly interesting because it shows where crime is already starting to appear in larger numbers at the beginning of 2018. Sadly, the homicides follow the same pattern as previous years with an overwhelming majority of the crimes happening in the same districts.", "The map would be a great tool for anyone in the right field trying to identify which problem spots need more resources. The maps can also be great tool for visually inspecting individual crime locations for people in the community and combined with their knowledge of the area could bring new insights that can be explored and acted upon to make the community safer. An example would be community members identifying a problem spots and establishing a safe passage route for children to and from school. The map would be a great aid in helping them identify blocks that are less dangerous.", "Throughout this notebook, I used data compiled by the Chicago police department to extract some insights on homicides in Chicago. While the data analysis performed here is devoid of a national perspective my key findings can be distilled to a few key points below:", "While these observations are very illuminating, I should mention that they don\u2019t paint the whole picture and comparisons should be made with national or other comparable data to give them more perspective. For example, while the number of homicides per year seem high, we don\u2019t know if that is within the national average or too high. Such comparisons would help us build more compelling arguments in our data story telling by using them to support our local findings.", "With that being said, our findings are still very relevant to local decision makers because they are very clear on the where and the when but not the why.", "Your home for data science.
