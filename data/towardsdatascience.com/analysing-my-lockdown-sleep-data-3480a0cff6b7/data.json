Whether that turbulence comes from a complete lifestyle overhaul, or simpler things, such as being cooped up with your flat-\u201cmates\u201d 24/7.", "Therefore, a question I had for myself was to what extent had this change in lifestyle changed the key attributes that impact my health: sleep, exercise, and diet. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t yet record any data on my diet, however, I was lucky enough to invest in a health wearable last September, allowing me access to my sleep and exercise data pre, post, and mid-lockdown. Here are my findings\u2026", "A couple of weeks ago, I was rummaging around in the settings of the fitness app that allows me to check my sleep and fitness data (tracked by the movement that my watch detects), and I noticed the following option:", "After realising I could request convenient CSV files, containing a simplified view of my data, I knew I had to do it. This would allow me to perform whatever analysis I wished, removing all constraints of the app (i.e. now I can compare data across larger periods of time, rather than scrolling through weekly averages).", "With a small amount of Python code, I now had the power to visualise a full year\u2019s worth of health data. The first metric to analyse that came to mind? Total sleep per night.", "And so, in order to avoid seeing an un-readable, jagged mess, I chose a 30-day rolling average, added some colour, and voil\u00e0:", "It\u2019s great to see that I\u2019m consistently achieving greater than 7 hours of sleep a night (on average). Further to this, we can see a clear increase in total sleep as the country enters into lockdown, and a continuation (if not another increase) of this after I moved house.", "On the surface, this looks great. But we should look at it with at least some skepticism (maybe you are already). More sleep doesn\u2019t necessarily mean better sleep. Interestingly, we can dive deeper and look at how the sleep breaks down into light and deep sleep:", "I didn\u2019t expect that! As my total sleep starts to increase during the lockdown period, there\u2019s no noticeable change to deep sleep; but then, a clear drop as we enter August. At the start of the year I had close to a 50:50 split of light to deep sleep (which is actually what the standard application metrics recommend), but a very clear difference emerges as I move into a new environment and a new house.", "Finally, my watch also measures the amount of time that I spend awake during the night:", "Another interesting plot, since the total awake time at any particular point is never that high (thankfully), however, there is still a noticeable increase as we progress through February and into March, and the eventual lockdown. Perhaps a result of consistent inconsistencies during the era of Covid-19?", "And so there we have it, a year long review of sleep, spanning a global pandemic, national lockdown, and local relocation. To summarise:", "And my final thoughts on the future:", "If you enjoyed this article, you might also enjoy a similar analysis I did of my activity data during lockdown \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f To be released soon\u2026.", "Your home for data science.
