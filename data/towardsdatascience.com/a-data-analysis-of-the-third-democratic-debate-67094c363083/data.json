Just as sports blogs and ESPN argue about ballgames, so do news sites and pundits on CNN obsess over the minutiae of political campaigns.", "In the spirit of politics as sporting event, I thought it would be fun to steal one more trick from that field\u2014 sports statistics. Nate Silver and others have perfected the art of poll punditry, but I hope to take it a step further. Just as Sabermetrics gave new insights into the world of baseball, I hope that political data might give us a better view of the political landscape. To that end, I parsed the transcript of the last Democratic debate and analyzed the data to look for trends. Here\u2019s what I found.", "In terms of data, the one piece of information that the news does cover is the speaking time. In theory, the more popular candidates should get more time since viewers are more interested in what they have to say. In practice this isn\u2019t exactly the case.", "Below are two plots for comparison. On the left is a graph of the latest Morning Consult Poll. On the right is the number of words spoken by each candidate during the September debate.", "As expected, frontrunner Joe Biden got the largest number of words in during the debate. However below him, there are large divergences between polling and speaking time. Sen. Cory Booker who only polls at 3% spoke almost as much as the former Vice President. Granted, most of this was towards the end of the debate. Still, it illustrates how establishment candidates are given favorable treatment on television.", "Interestingly, Bernie Sanders, who got a good amount of time was near the bottom of the list in terms of words spoken. It\u2019s clear that he speaks more slowly and uses fewer words than his opponents. I also observed that he was less willing to exceed his allotted time and didn\u2019t need to be cut off as much as the other candidates.", "Finally, no matter how you slice it, Andrew Yang was short changed during the debate. In most polls, Yang is doing better than O\u2019Rourke, Booker, Castro and Klobuchar. And yet, he only managed to get a measly 1600 words on TV. This isn\u2019t surprising since Yang is often ignored in mainstream coverage, to the point that he has sometimes been completely effaced from political reporting.", "When comparing a candidate\u2019s speaking time to their polling, the biggest discrepancy observed was with Julian Castro. Despite polling at only 1%, he uttered more words than even Pete Buttigieg. This is mostly because Castro used his speaking time to go on the offensive.", "Conflict makes for good TV, so Castro was given ample opportunity to spar with Joe Biden. This is born out by the data. Looking only at the number of times a candidate spoke (which includes short exchanges), we see that Castro did really well.", "It remains to be seen whether this strategy will improve his polling, but it is clear that going on the attack will allow for more airtime.", "One of the most telling words in a debate transcript is \u201c(APPLAUSE)\u201d. If we count the number of applause breaks per candidate, we get a sense of who did the best with the live audience.", "Amazingly, frontrunner Joe Biden is almost at the bottom of the list. Only Amy Klobuchar was less popular with the people in attendance (I expect her to drop out soon).", "Perhaps it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the progressive agenda espoused by Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren played the best with the Democratic crowd. Both received positive audience reactions when describing their \u201cmedicare-for-all\u201d plans.", "Another word to note any debate transcript is \u201c(LAUGHTER)\u201d. Being able to make a crowd laugh is an easy way to make them like you. In this respect, Cory Booker did best. He got a few good laugh lines during the evening, especially when he was self-deprecating about his vegan diet.", "The fact that Booker is so skilled as a communicator and that he is so well liked by the media suggests that he may be a dark horse in this race. If Kamala Harris starts to slip, I expect the more polished Booker to take her place as a charming and palatable centrist candidate.", "Another bit of data we can glean from the debate is what words were used the most. If we remove boring politician words like \u201cwill\u201d, \u201cmust\u201d and \u201cAmerican\u201d, we can count the most common terms used by each candidate. These terms are represented in word clouds below.", "Looking at the frontrunners, all of them are appealing the \u201cpeople\u201d. This word is by far the most common. The nature of these appeals differs with each politician. Biden is focussed on \u201cfacts\u201d and \u201cnumbers\u201d, suggesting his attempt to appear pragmatic. Sanders and Warren spend more time talking about \u201chealth care\u201d, \u201cinsurance\u201d and \u201ccompanies\u201d. Warren talks personally in terms of \u201cfamilies\u201d while Sanders frames things in terms of the \u201ccountry\u201d.", "The mid-tier candidates also appeal to the \u201cpeople\u201d. Harris through her opposition to \u201cTrump\u201d and Booker through appeals to \u201ccommunity\u201d. The blandness of Pete Buttigieg\u2019s word cloud goes to show that his central message is vague and hard to pin down.", "Finally, of the lower-tier candidates, we observe a few interesting trends. O\u2019Rourke is mostly riding high on mentions of Texas and El Paso. Yang wants to give people money and work to fix health care with private companies. Klobuchar probably says \u201cI think\u201d too much and also wants to \u201cunite\u201d people. Finally, Castro is pushing his own health care \u201cplan\u201d hard, and also attacking the plans of other candidates.", "After Moneyball was published, statistics came to dominate sports commentary and analysis. The same has yet to happen to politics. Most pundits still rely on gut feeling to describe the political landscape and only get reality checks when polls come out. With Twitter, news stories, and now televised debates, we have a wealth of data at our disposal to do more objective analysis. In time I believe that these tools will have better predictive power.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Engineer in San Francisco.
