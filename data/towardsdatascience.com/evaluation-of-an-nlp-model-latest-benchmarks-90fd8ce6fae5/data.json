Therefore, we can calculate the loss/offset from ground truth at a pixel. level.", "In case of regression, the number of values in the output is fixed and hence loss can be calculated for each value, even though the possibilities for each value is infinite.", "Note: I use problem and task interchangeably in this post, as each problem sort of defined around a task that a model needs to perform, so please don\u2019t get confused by that.", "In case of NLP, even if the output format is predetermined, the dimensions cannot be fixed. If we want our model to output a single sentence, it will be counter intuitive to restrict the number of words in that sentence, because we know that there are multiple ways to express the same information.", "If I ask you to choose the incorrect caption for the image above from the following options:", "You can choose any of them and still be correct, none of them is incorrect, only the details vary. If the ground truth for this image in our dataset is \u201cA gray car on the road\u201d. How will you teach a model using the ground truth label that all 4 outputs are correct? Not so easy, is it?", "Before we dive into the details and nuances of various metrics out there, I want to talk here not only about why it matters to have a good metric, but also what a good metric is \u2014 in my opinion \u2014 just in case you don\u2019t make it till the end of the article.", "The main purpose of developing these AI solutions is to apply them to real-world problems and make our lives easier and better. But our real world is not a simple one. So how do we decide which model to use for a particular problem? That is when these metrics come in handy.", "If we are trying to solve two problems with one model, we would want to know the model\u2019s performance on both of these tasks, to make an informed decision, to be aware of the trade-offs we are making. This is also where the \u201cgoodness\u201d of a metric comes in. The real world is full of biases and we don\u2019t want our solutions to be biased as it can have inconceivable consequences.", "Quick example, if we are translating a text from language X to English. For a particular sentence, if we are talking about Group A, it is translated to \u201cThey did a good job.\u201d in contrast for Group B it is translated to \u201cThey did a great job.\u201d, that is a crystal clear sign that our model is biased towards Group B. Such biases should be known before it is deployed in the real world and metrics should help us in surfacing these.", "Even though learning biases has more to do with training data and less to do with model architecture, I feel, having a metric for capturing biases or a standard for biases would be a good practice to adapt.", "As the name suggests, it was originally used to evaluate translations from one language to another.", "Step 1: Look at each word in the output sentence and assign it a score of 1 if it shows up in any of the reference sentences and 0 if it doesn\u2019t. Step 2: Normalize that count, so that it\u2019s always between 0 and 1, by dividing the number of words that showed up in one of the reference translations by the total number of words in the output sentence.", "Continuing with the example above: Ground Truth: \u201cA gray car on the road\u201dS1: \u201cA car on the road\u201d will get a score of 5/6,S2: \u201cA gray car in front of a house on the road\u201d will get a score of 6/6,S3: \u201con car gray the car road\u201d will also get a score of 6/6!In fact S4: \u201ccar car car car car car\u201d will also get a score of 6/6!!", "This does not seem to be correct; we should not be scoring S3 and S4 so highly. To penalize the last two scenarios, we use a combination of unigram, bigram, trigram, and n-gram by multiplying them. Using n-grams helps us in capturing the ordering of a sentence to some extent \u2014 S3 scenario. We also cap the number of times to count each word based on the highest number of times it appears in any reference sentence, which helps us avoid unnecessary repetition of words \u2014 S4 scenario.", "Lastly, to avoid missing out on the details in our captions by encouraging them to be too short, we use the brevity penalty. We do this by comparing it to the length of the reference sentence that is the closest in length.", "In this type of metric test, a question and a text are given, and the model needs to predict the answer from the given text.", "[In case you aren\u2019t familiar with the fantasy reference, here is all you need to know to understand my analogy: Harry Potter is a book series by JK Rowling; Percy Jackson & the Olympians is a entirely different and unrelated series by Rick Riordan;In the Harry Potter series, the protagonist \u2014 Harry Potter, is either in trouble or is on the way of getting into one, for like 90% of the time;Percy Jackson is the protagonist of the other book series I mentioned, and also shares the tendency of getting in trouble with Harry;There is a character named Percy, albeit not a very important one, in the Harry Potter series.Yep, that is all you need to know for this. :D]", "If I give you a text from the Harry Potter series and ask you \u201cWhy were Percy Jackson and his friends in trouble\u201d? A human would be able to tell that the question and text aren\u2019t contextually related and hence the question is not answerable; a Potter-head would just disown me. But when asked to an NLP model, it might just try to predict the most probable answer, which could be about some other character getting in trouble \u2014 hint Harry Potter or something a character named Percy or Jackson did.", "To address these weaknesses, SQuAD 2.0 combined existing SQuAD data with over 50,000 unanswerable questions written adversarial-ly by crowd workers to look similar to answerable ones. To do well on SQuAD 2.0, systems must not only answer questions when possible, but also determine when no answer is supported by the paragraph and abstain from answering.", "You can check out the SQuAD Leader board here.", "It is a large scale dataset focused on machine reading comprehension. It consists of the following tasks:", "The dataset started off focusing on QnA but has since evolved to focus on any problem related to search.", "The dataset comprises of 1,010,916 anonymized questions \u2014 sampled from Bing\u2019s search query logs \u2014 each with a human-generated answer and 182,669 completely human rewritten generated answers. In addition, the dataset contains 8,841,823 passages \u2014 extracted from 3,563,535 web documents retrieved by Bing \u2014 that provide the information necessary for curating the natural language answers.", "GLUE and SuperGLUE evaluate the performance of a model on a collection of tasks, rather than a single one to get a holistic view on the performance. They consist of single-sentence tasks, similarity and paraphrase tasks, and inference tasks.", "I went through the paper for both of them and collected a brief overview of the tasks in each. I organized them into these tables for quick and better understanding. If you want to understand each task in detail, please go through the papers, linked in the reference section, at the end of the post.", "Do check out the respective leader boards for GLUE and Super GLUE.", "Knowing about these metrics would not help you in improving the performance of your model by any means. However, it will certainly help you in understanding the bigger picture, the problems we are currently trying to solve in this field!
