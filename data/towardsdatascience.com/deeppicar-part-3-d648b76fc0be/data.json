If you have been following my previous two posts (Part 1 and Part 2) on DeepPiCar, you should have a running robotic car that can be controlled via Python. In the article, we will give your car the superpower of Computer Vision and Deep Learning. By the end of the article, it would be transformed into a true DeepPiCar, which is capable of detecting and identifying objects in your room.", "Note that the only Perception Sensor of our PiCar is a USB DashCam. A DashCam gives us a live video, which is essentially a sequence of pictures. We will use OpenCV, a powerful open source computer vision library, to capture and transform these pictures so that we can make sense of what the camera is seeing. Run the following commands (in bold) to install it on your Pi.", "Here are the most basic tests to see if our python libraries are installed. The Python module name for OpenCV is cv2. If you don\u2019t see any error when running the following commands, then the modules should be installed correctly. Numpy and Matplotlib are two very useful python modules that we will use in conjunction with OpenCV for image processing and rendering.", "Ok, let\u2019s try to some live video processing!", "If you see two live video screens, one colored and one black/white, then your OpenCV is working! Press q to quit the test. Essentially, the program takes the images captured from the camera and displays it as is (the Original window), and then it converts the image to a black and white image (the B/W window). This is very important as in Part 4: Autonomous Lane Navigation, we will bring up as many as 9-10 screens as the original video images will be processed through many stages, like below.", "Google\u2019s TensorFlow is currently the most popular python library for Deep Learning. It can be used for image recognition, face detection, natural language processing, and many other applications. There are two methods to install TensorFlow on Raspberry Pi:", "The first method installs the CPU version of TensorFlow. We will NOT use Pi to perform any deep learning (i.e. model training), as its CPU is vastly insufficient for backward propagation, a very slow operation required in the learning process. However, we can use the CPU to do inferences based on a pre-trained model. Inference is also known as model prediction, which uses only forward propagation, a much faster computer operation. Even with the CPU just doing inference, it can only do so on a relatively shallow model (say 20\u201330 layers) in real time. For deeper models (100+ layers), we would need the Edge TPU. As of May 2019, the most recent production version of TensorFlow is version 1.13 (2.0 is still alpha)", "Now let\u2019s test and make sure the installation went fine. When you import TensorFlow, it will report some warning messages. But they can be safely ignored. You should not see any errors. (If you do see other errors, please post the commands you typed and the error message in the post down below, and I will try to help.)", "When the deep learning models are very deep, 100 layers or more, to achieve real-time performance, it needs to run on the EdgeTPU coprocessor instead of the CPU. However, at the time of writing, Edge TPU is so new (release to the general public around early 2019) that it cannot run all models that can run on the CPU, so we have to choose our model architecture carefully and make sure they will work on EdgeTPU. For more details on what models can run on Edge TPU, please read this article by Google.", "Follow the instructions below to install EdgeTPU drivers and APIs. When asked if you want to enable the maximum operating frequency, answer y. The models we run will be relatively lightweight for the TPU, I have never seen it run very hot.", "After reboot, let\u2019s try to test it by running a live object detection program. We will run a demo object detection app from the DeepPiCar repo.", "You should see a live video screen coming up, and it will try to identify objects in the screen at around 7\u20138 Frames/sec. Note that the COCO (Common Object in COntext) object detection model can detect about 100 common objects, like a person, chair, TV, couch, book, laptop, cell phone, etc. Don\u2019t let this simple program fool you, this is Deep Learning at work. The object detection model used in this program is called ssd_mobilenet_coco_v2, and it contains more than 200 layers! (For comparison, I have tried earlier to run the COCO object detection model with Pi\u2019s CPU, it was a much longer set up, can only run at 1 Frame/sec, CPU\u2019s utilization is 100%, and CPU temperature heats up very quickly. So running deep models on CPU is not recommended.) Of course, this is just a demo app that confirms that Edge TPU is set up correctly. We will exploit Edge TPU\u2019s full capabilities in Part 6 of this series, Real-Time Traffic Sign and Pedestrian Detection and Handling.", "Update (March 2020): Coral EdgeTPU\u2019s installation has been updated since my blog\u2019s published date of Apr 2019. Please follow the current official instructions from Google here to install Tensorflow Lite API and EdgeTPU runtime, so that you can do the object detection example above.", "Congratulations, we have now given your car both an eye (camera and OpenCV) and a brain (TensorFlow), so it is indeed a DeepPiCar.
