Since we are in the midst of heated discussions about the 2020 elections, I thought it\u2019d be a good idea to make an analysis of the previous US presidential elections.", "The dataset contains elections from 1976 to 2020. I will approach the data from various different perspectives and try to gain some insight into how people voted.", "I will use the Pandas library for data analysis and visualization so it will also be a good practice of using the functions and methods of Pandas.", "Let\u2019s start by importing the libraries and reading the dataset into a Pandas dataframe.", "There are some redundant columns for the analysis. I\u2019m not sure what state_fips, state_cen, and state_ic stand for but they might serve as an indicator or a unique value for a state.", "We can confirm by checking and comparing the values in these columns. These three columns have 51 unique values (one for each state).", "For a particular state, the values in these columns are the same:", "Since the dataset already contains state information, these columns are redundant in terms of analysis so they can be dropped.", "The office column just indicates this is the presidential election so it contains one unique value (US President). The version and notes columns are also of no use.", "We can drop these columns using the drop function of Pandas.", "We are ready to start the analysis which I divided into three sections:", "The first thing we will check is the number of votes per election. The \u201ctotalvotes\u201d column shows the total number of votes in a particular state. Thus, the following code will create a dataframe that contains total votes in each state for each election.", "We can apply groupby function on the \u201cyear\u201d column and sum the values in the \u201ctotalvotes\u201d column which will give us the total number of votes per election.", "I used the plotting tools of Pandas to plot the results. It is simpler than using the pyplot interface of Matplotlib but you have less control over the plot.", "The number of people who voted has been increasing steadily except for 1996 and 2012. It may well be due to the population increase so a better measure would be the number of votes per million population (eligible to vote). As a rough comparison, the population has increased by approximately 50% from 1970 (203 Million) to 2010 (308 Million). Thus, the ratio of people who vote has remained roughly the same over the years.", "Some elections were so close that the winner won by a small percentage. There were also some elections in which the winner won by a big margin.", "We can calculate the ratio of votes of each winner. We will first add a \u201cwinner\u201d column to our dataframe.", "This Wikipedia page contains a list of presidents of the US. The tables can easily be read into a pandas dataframe using the read_html function. It converts the tables in the web page to a list of dataframes.", "The second dataframe contains the list of US presidents. We only need the data for elections from 1976 to 2016.", "We need the names in the same format as in the president dataframe. \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d needs to formatted as \u201cCarter, Jimmy\u201d. I will use the pandas string operations to do this task:", "We need a few small adjustments so that the names of presidents exactly match.", "I also converted the election dates to integers to be able to use the merge function in the next step.", "We can now merge the \u201cpresident\u201d and \u201cwinners\u201d dataframe based on the election year.", "We will filter the president dataframe to include only votes for the winners.", "Each line contains the number of votes of the winner and the total votes in a particular state for a particular election. A simple groupby function will give us the country-wise values.", "We can calculate the ratio of the winners by a simple math operation and sort the results.", "The number one is Ronald Reagan in his second term.", "If you are into politics, you have an idea about which party each state is likely to support more. Let\u2019s also check that with the numbers.", "This is the winner_votes dataframe. We will add a ratio column which is candidate votes divided by total votes.", "We want to see the top ten states for both democrats and republicans. The following groupby operation will return top ten states based on the highest average ratio for democrats.", "Here is the result of the same operation for the republican side.", "Note: All images created by author unless stated otherwise.", "We have analyzed the US presidential elections with regards to the number of votes over time, the dominance of each president in terms of votes, and the state-wise votes for democrats and republicans. The results may not be surprise to you especially if you are into politics.", "The other focus of this post is practicing how Pandas can be used in data analysis and manipulation. We have done a great deal of Pandas operations in terms of data analysis and manipulation.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
