Call centers need to know the increase in call volumes five years from now to maintain adequate staffing to serve the customers. Electric companies want to forecast growth in power consumption in the next ten years so they can invest in new installations to keep up with additional demands. Small businesses need to see how their investments are paying off over the next few years and make necessary adjustments.", "All these business needs require forecasting. Traditionally these forecasting is done on an ad hoc basis with limited tools at the disposal of data scientists. Time series techniques have been around for a long time, but they have their own limitations and often they do not provide necessary accuracy and point toward specific uncertainties. With time series it is also difficult to develop scenarios and do sensitivity analysis of key performance indicators (KPIs) as a result of new policies.", "With that in mind, in this article I introduce a blueprint for a different kind of forecasting technique that relies rather on few data points. As well will see below, this technique also allows for scenario analysis of the impacts of specific business decisions and their impacts on KPIs.", "System Dynamics is a methodological approach for complex systems modeling, where a change in one element leads to a change in others.", "It is widely applied in healthcare, epidemiology, transportation, business management, and revenue forecasting. Arguably the most famous of all is modeling Limits to Growth by the Club of Rome.", "A System Dynamic model represents a complex system in terms of stocks & flows and their interactions via feedback loops to predict the behavior of the system. Let\u2019s say a bank account has a \u201cstock\u201d of $100. Every month $20 is deposited (represented by Flow 1), and an amount of $15/month is withdrawn (Flow 2). In this simple case, a change in Flow 1 will cause a change in Stock 1 and Flow 2. So if we know how Flow 1 will evolve into the future, we can forecast both Stock 1 and Flow 2.", "Using a similar concept, below I\u2019m presenting an approach to forecasting that depends on fewer data points rather than complex time series modeling which is used in traditional forecasting.", "A simple blueprint with necessary codes is presented below. I\u2019m also testing it in GDP forecasting of three major economies in the world. But this concept can be applied to any other business forecasting and decision-making process.", "So basically I created a function called forecast() that takes 4 parameters:", "The model then computes \u2014 given the initial values & a rate of change \u2014 future values in each time step. The function gives outputs of a list of forecast values for all the time steps.", "The forecast values are then plotted against time. Multiple forecasts are produced to compare different entities here, but the concept would work in a similar fashion if we were to make forecasting scenarios of a single entity. In this case a change in business policy or activities will take different parameters and model the changes in forecasting estimates for each time-step into the future.", "So the question that I am asking in this demo is how the GDP of major economies will evolve and how are they going to look like in 2030? This simple model only takes 2 parameters, 2019 nominal GDP (US dollars) and GDP growth (%) but as you will see it can generate powerful insights even in this simplified version. The following data were used for the demo:", "The GDP of the United States, the European Union and China were forecasted using the function above and potted in the same panel against each forecasting year.", "Everyone in the business knows that the economy of China was is on fire. This forecasting gives an idea of how big is the fireball. At this point the economy of China seems way behind the US and EU, but considering the growth rate it\u2019s just a matter of time that China will surpass shortly. But how soon?", "2023 is the year that China takes over EU, and in 2025 it surpasses the US economy in terms of GDP.", "And between the US and EU, at this point their GDP is in a similar magnitude, but as the forecasting shows, the gap will keep widening due to higher US growth rates.", "But of course, these are all pre-COVID scenarios and everything is going to change post-COVID. We\u2019ll need to wait a bit to get a sense of where things are headed.", "The purpose of this article was to demonstrate how a simple program can generate powerful forecasting insights. Of course this is a simple demonstration but my goal was to give an intuition of the possibilities to go beyond traditional time series forecasting and try something different, especially when data is a limiting factor.", "Your home for data science.
