It\u2019s job is to explain all design constraints and goals, and covers topics such as floor areas, potential tenants, and building typology [1]. To write a good brief, a client must consider a variety of factors including urban zoning, cash-flow projections, land-values, as well as tacit business knowledge. Even before a single line is drawn, a good brief can influence the financial viability, sustainability, and even the quality of a building design.", "In this post we explore how to apply Machine Learning (ML) to augment the briefing process. Presently, anyone is able to access troves of free data describing building type, tenants, property values, and energy use by location. With ML it is possible to identify hidden relationships between these datasets to predict the requirements of a new building at a specific location.", "In the next section we will explain how to do this. We show how to set up a project in Python to learn from a free data source to make location-based predictions for a hypothetical development in Zurich.", "We will show how to set up a project in Python to learn from a free data source to make location-based predictions for a hypothetical development in Zurich.", "For the sake of simplicity, the following example focuses on predicting the building type based on attributes extracted from the contextual data. To do the tutorial, you will need to sign up for Jupyter Notebook, a web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.", "To help you along, we have shared all code for this project in a GitHub repository here.", "The first step is to come up with a good question you are trying to answer. This will require some knowledge of both the technicalities of data science as well as domain knowledge of your given topic. An on-going architectural debate is whether to adopt the position of \u201cstanding out\u201d or \u201cfitting in\u201d to the the context [2]. For this project, we have taken the approach of \u201cfitting in\u201d. Based on this approach, we need to then consider what data we had available, and what types of answers a ML model could provide.", "An on-going architectural debate is whether to adopt the position of \u201cstanding out\u201d or \u201cfitting in\u201d to the context", "The second step is to harvest the data you will use to train the model. For this example, we use OpenStreetMaps (OSM); a collaborative, free, global mapping API that provides 2D and 3D geodata about different cities in JSON file format. OSM is a \u2018structured dataset\u2019, meaning textual and numeric elements such as coordinates, street names, postal codes, building geometry, and building attributes are organized in table format. Structured data makes it easier to train a Machine Learning model.", "Since our code is in Python and the OpenStreetMap\u2019s data is stored in JSON format, the first step is to convert it into a Python data structure called a \u2018Pandas DataFrame\u2019.", "The third step is to process our input data. We must clean the data, meaning we only use the data-points relevant to our design problem. This process is called feature engineering[3] . The OSM data contains a variety of features and finding the right and useful features was a tough task. As has been said \u201cGarbage in, garbage out\u201d; hence having the right data as input for the machine learning model was a necessary step.", "The target variable is the feature or a variable we are going to predict using other input features in the data. For this example project the target variable we are focused on is Building Attribute Type (ie. building use). To train our Machine Learning model, we will use the following features of the OpenStreetMap data to predict our target variable for a new development site.", "We will convert the points (coordinates of the buildings) into Shapely geometry. Shapely is a Python package for spatial analysis of planar data as well as for working with computational geometry.", "After preprocessing, the data is divided into training and test sets, each of the two sets again divided into labels and features.", "The fourth step is to train our Machine Learning model. A Machine Learning model is a file that has been trained to recognize hidden relationships between features in a dataset. Training is the process where the model analyzes a portion dataset using a special algorithm. At this step, input features (Predictor variables) are mapped to the variables we are predicting (Target variable). These learned patterns are then applied to testing data\u2019s input features to predict the required outcomes which are the labels.", "We us a \u2018Random Forest Classifier\u2019 to classify (predict) a discrete set of values, in this case the building attribute for a specific location. While other classification algorithms could be used here, we opt for Random Forest because it\u2019s relatively easy to implement. Random Forest works by building a set of decision trees based on random segments of training data. The final output is an average of the outputs of each of individual decision trees [4].", "Here we use a Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter tuning Gradient Search method to determines the best parameters for model training.", "Once we train the ML model on the training data, we need evaluate it using a testing data-set.", "In this example, we predict the building attribute, our target variable, (y_test) using the input features / variables of the testing data (X_test) . The model applies the patterns it learns from the training data to the testing data.", "The final step is to evaluate the model in order calculate its accuracy so we can understand how confident we can be in the predicted result.", "In this case, the prediction accuracy of 61.1 %. Accuracy is a metric for evaluating the success achieved by our Machine Learning algorithm based on the outputs. The accuracy was low in this example because we use only 100 data points in our training data.", "This article outlines an initial ideas and an example to highlight ML and open data can be used in the architect-client briefing process. While we have provided a relatively simple example, the methods described here can be further improved and applied to predict more specific and useful aspects of a design brief. This could be expanded to building size, ideal tenants, and energy use, forming the basis of a briefing recommendation system.", "Rutvik Deshpande is a machine learning and data science research intern at Digital Blue Foam and Architecture Student at @NITRR.
