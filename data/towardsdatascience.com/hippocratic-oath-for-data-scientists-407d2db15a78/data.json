This exponential increase is mainly linked to the rise of digital platforms, wireless sensors and the billions of smartphones in circulation. However, in such a flow of data, respect for morals and the human person can be endangered.", "In fact, Data Science reached the point at which an ethical pledge is deemed necessary.", "Justifying the need to focus on Data Science ethics goes beyond just observing these opportunities and challenges, as the practice of Data Science challenges our perception of what it means to \u201cbe human.\u201d", "While universities quickly implemented Data Science programs focused on statistics, Machine Learning and Data Engineering, few programs address the broader societal concerns of Data Science. Fewer still are those who analyze how responsible data practices can be conditioned and even encouraged.", "Although the impact of information technology on the organization of private and public enterprises has been widely debated over the past four decades, the impact of Data Science on the management of enterprises has been the subject of much less attention.", "By focusing on Data Science, these contextual concerns bring to light their own ethical considerations. If data is never objective, to what extent does management need to understand the context in which the data was collected, analyzed and transmitted?", "Likewise, with algorithms becoming more and more widespread and complex, to what extent should data scientists understand their own assumptions and their limits?", "\u201cIn medicine, you learn about ethics from day one. In data science, it\u2019s not very commun. Actually, it has to be there from day one and at the forefront of your mind in every step you take.\u201d", "Many organizations started to employ data scientists who have a solid understanding of how to analyze data and gain maximum insight to make decisions based on algorithms. When analyzing this data, the data scientist faces ethical challenges such as data collection bias, algorithmic bias, explanation results, confidentiality, etc. In order to formulate and produce morally good solutions, he needs to stick to some ethical rules that will guide him", "How then can we make a data scientist more ethical, what could inspire a data scientist to do ethical work or what moral laws or rules have been established to inspire an ethical environment?", "To date, there has been no law or rule to inspire an ethical environment for data scientists. However, as a member of the data science community and a fresh data science consultant, I tried to establish several principles of ethics that will guide me and inform the good data science practice. I also wrote a draft referring to the Hippocratic oath for Data Science that I will share with you in this article.", "For every professional data scientist who is brought to collect, store, analyze data and design algorithms, there is a necessity to evaluate the impact of what his work can have on individuals and on society as a whole.", "This is why he needs to respect the following three principles:", "Every data scientist has to assume his responsibilities in the event of breaches or conflicts of interest and he must alert if any illegal acts related to data are observed. He must also exercise his professional activity respecting the privacy and dignity of people in all their dimensions.", "As a data scientist, I have the right to inform all stakeholders in an understandable and precise manner about the purposes, modalities and potential implications of my use of data.", "I will always ensure that individuals or groups are not discriminated on the basis of illegal or illegitimate criteria, directly or indirectly, related to my data work.", "In this section, you will find some promises about your behavior and your actions that will help you advance your data science career.", "Ethics is undoubtedly important, and in a perfect world would form part of any education. This oath of ethics will help to create an ethical environment, as great power is said to come with great responsibility.", "Data scientists need such an oath, just like medical doctors who swear to act only in their patients\u2019 best interests.
