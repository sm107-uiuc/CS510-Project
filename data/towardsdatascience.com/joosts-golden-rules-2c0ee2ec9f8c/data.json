Or, 12 simple rules for writing better\u2026 | by Jeroen van Zeeland | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Joost\u2019s Golden Rules", "description": "12 rules for better code. Not specific to any language, but specifically useful for all."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html", "anchor_text": "MATLAB", "paragraph_index": 1}], "all_paragraphs": ["You don\u2019t have to understand a lot about coding to be able to see the difference between readable and unreadable code. Pick-up any piece you\u2019ve put together in a hurry and it\u2019ll probably be unreadable a few months later. Code that you\u2019ve invested time and effort in is probably readable months, nay years, later. Here are a few rules to make your code better.", "In one of my first jobs in university, I\u2019ve had the distinct pleasure of working for Joost \u201ca mouse is for users\u201d den Haan \u2014 who would never touch his mouse when navigating his PC. He was a master of his keyboard and MATLAB, his language of choice.", "Joost was a principled man who would think before acting. He always had a plan to overcome the challenges thrown at him. He was a work-smart-not-hard kind of man; long before it was cool. He was writing legible, clean and tidy code long before the concept was hyped. Joost was a man ahead of his time.", "He had a few simple rules that anyone can apply to any project, regardless of programming language. A few simple rules to help you think a bit about what you are coding and how you are coding. Some Golden Rules, to keep in mind when you are punching keys on your keyboard.", "The first rule of Joost\u2019s Golden Rules is that every programmer can ignore any golden-rule locally if that makes the work faster, or easier, or cheaper\u2026 Rules are a means not the end. Rules are meant to guide you, but never to make you stop thinking about what you are actually trying to do.", "Every programmer can ignore any golden-rule locally.", "Exactly that, you might move on to a different job or position and at some point in the future, someone else is supposed to update your code. You are not only writing code for your future-self, but also for someone else in the future. You will be doing both people a huge favour if you keep them in mind when you are coding.", "Code will grow over time, ignoring the impact of your code on processing power will at some point come back to haunt you. Consider it while you are", "When starting a new project start by setting up the infrastructure for your project. Think about the structure of your code at a high level. Set up database connections, integrations, and write the framework for, say, your functions. This should be including test routines, only then start to program the content.", "If you write code always copy names you\u2019ve created. This stops you from making typo\u2019s and creates 100% consistency.", "Never copy code-snippets (without checking), this is error-prone and creates unnecessary double code that is hard to maintain. So when you are copying there is probably a smarter way to go about it. See the 6th rule.", "The 0 \u2014 1 \u2014 \u221e is for repetition of scripts. (By the way, the infinity symbol is called a lemniscate.) You either use an operation zero times or one time. If you have to do the same repetition more than once, you have to figure out a way to scale it to infinity (for instance by creating a function).", "The underlying idea is that if you have to change code you don\u2019t have to do the same operations in two places at the same time since there is a real chance you might miss one.", "Create functions that are intended to be re-usable. Code that can be called from different sources. Not because this is leveraging your own work, but more importantly it ensures that the functions are simple, immutable, and easily manageable afterwards. Keep them as small as possible.", "Of course, you can write comments but as a rule, you should write as little commentary as possible. Code and scripts need to be self-explanatory. Only simple comments for oversight are allowed.", "There\u2019s no extra cost to writing meaningful variable names. Use descriptive names when naming your variables, much easier after the fact to understand code. (So don\u2019t use t when you can use time.)", "When naming your variables, keep all hardcoded variables in ALLCAPS, this way you have a visual way of remembering that this is a hardcoded variable. For all other variables choose whether to camelCase or underscore_case.", "Relate the input arguments explicitly. Even though the following are equal:", "The former holds a direct relationship to the number of inputs (i.e., 2), whereas the latter does not. This gives a direct link to between the elements in your program.", "Separate your function\u2019s internal names and external labels. This makes it easy to change the UI / API interface for the customer without having to change the internal workings of the function. It also makes debugging easier.", "If you keep these simple rules in mind (or close by) you\u2019ll make your own life, and lives of those around you, a lot easier in the long run and probably save some money and time, too.", "It goes without saying that Joost actually deserves praise for these rules. And it was probably him who should have been writing this or something like \u201cClean Code.\u201d", "Your home for data science.
