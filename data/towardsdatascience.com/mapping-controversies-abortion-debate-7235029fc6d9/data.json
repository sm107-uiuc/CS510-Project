While it is often easy to find the controversy outside in the real world, we went to Wikipedia to investigate how an online encyclopaedia that pursues neutrality would present it.", "Through the use of digital methods and harvesting online data we investigate how the abortion debate unfolds itself in the arena of Wikipedia. Our finding perhaps shows us more about how Wikipedia and the Anglo-American world functions when it tries to settle controversial topics in society.", "First we harvested the data needed to map the controversy. We made use of several python-scripts, then we cleaned andordered the data such that visualizations could be constructed. Here we applied several different programs and applications.", "The scripts either used the Wikipedia API, thus \u201casking\u201d the Wikipedia database for information, which was then returned or they were scraping and crawling Wikipedia. This process involved the script \u201clooking through\u201d the pages in question and pulling information from them, such as text or links, and moving through to other pages connected.", "In doing this we chose the Wikipedia category of Abortion debate as seed, or \u201cthe origin page\u201d, and a depth of 2, thus moving to all pages connected to this, and then all pages linked to those.This gave us members of the seed category, the sub-categories linked from this and their sub-categories, a total of 204 Wikipedia pages.", "Our dataset was then processed using a combination of other scripts and programs, such as Gephi, CorTexT, alteryx and Tableau.", "This produced 5 types of data for our visualizations;", "The produced dataset of 204 Wikipedia pages was then scraped with two different python scripts to generate files with the full text. One was used for semantic analysis through CorTexT, while the other queried for user specified keywords. Then we retrieved the revision history through the API to generate two timelines of selected pages.", "Finally, we scraped the HTML of Wikipedia to generate a network of the 204 pages connected by the links in text, meaning the main text of the Wikipedia articles. This was then combined with the keyword search to generate 11 derivative networks, showing selected issues by size of notes.", "We started out by using the open source application Gephi to arrange the scraped Wiki-pages from the Abortion Debate category into a visual network. This gave us a map consisting of two distinct things. Points, which are the visualization of the Wiki-pages, called nodes. The second thing is the lines which connect these nodes. These lines are representations that the nodes are connected \u2014 on this map, the lines show how the different Wiki-pages link to each other inside the text of the Wiki-pages. In our terminology the lines are called edges.", "In order to make sense of this network, we used a force-directed placement algorithm, called ForceAtlas2. The algorithm give the data points and their connections a sense of space, which we need in order to visually analyse the network. ForceAtlas2 works by giving the edges and nodes a form of push-pull effect, where the edges functions as a form of springs, binding together the nodes, which repulses each another. This way nodes that have many edges in common are closer to each other. Thus, the algorithm spreads out the nodes and makes it possible to spatially analyse the network through the 4 rules stated by Venturini et al. (Venturini et. al: 2015):", "2:Which are the main structural holes that separate them?", "3: Which are the sub-clusters within each cluster?", "4: Which are the smaller structural holes separating them?", "Our problem though is that there are nearly no structural holes in our network \u2014 it resembles a starfish more than connected clusters with holes in between. So we ended up drawing circles around the clusters we saw as the obvious arms of the \u201cstarfish\u201d.", "This gave us the clusters of Ireland, Canada, Religion, and American Legal system \u2014 but it left us with a big centre, that we did not know how to analyse.", "In order to try and make sense of this starfish, we used a tool built into Gephi, called the modularity tool. Modularity is a way of trying to make large clusters into smaller sub-clusters, through mathematically locating how large networks compartmentalize into smaller groups, with more internal attachment to each other. These sub-networks might then indicate certain communities inside the larger network.", "To put it simply, it is an attempt to make the computer do a part of the analytical work in understanding the clusters. This is done through colouring the different sub-clusters in different colours.", "The modularity tool gave us approximately the same clusters as the ones we picked ourselves. But it also gave us two new clusters, which we labelled Rights and Fringe after consulting the Wikipedia articles.", "The modularity map also forces us to bring up another point \u2014 bridges. Bridges are nodes that connect clusters \u2014 they are representations of the pages on Wikipedia that connect different topics by linking to both. The modularity tool simply assigns a bridge node to the sub-cluster, that it finds most likely. Likewise the Abortion node becomes a part of the American Legal System for instance, although it is not in the immediate vicinity. And this might not be the best case, once you manually look at the pages and their content on Wikipedia.", "But our new clustering perhaps also gives us some insights into Wikipedia as a medium \u2014 the debate is focused on the Anglo-American world, but also on the legal aspects. Perhaps the network also shows us how English Wikipedia orders the controversy of abortion debate, or in the words of Marres & Moats (Marres, Nortje & David Moats: 2015):", "\u2026We can extend this symmetrical approach from a focus on the relation between knowledge content and political interests in controversy, as was the aim in early STS, to include the relation between medium and content.", "In essence; we are seeing how the medium, here Wikipedia, structures how to talk about something controversial.", "In order to better differentiate between our clusters, we searched for specific keywords to see, if these were used more in certain parts of the corpus of articles. Notice that the networks below are rotated versions of the one above.", "First of we investigated the topic unfold in different regions. We scrutinized the prevalence of several english speaking countries. By conducting a keyword search for national terms, and in grouping these (i.e. \u201cIrish\u201d, \u201cIreland\u201d and \u201cIrishmen\u201d) we see two geographical clusters (Canadian and Irish), closely related to that made by the modularity tool. We furthermore see that American notions heavily influences the network.", "We found great interest in the green cluster, which is a result from using the modularity tool. To explore this, we made keyword searches for Islam, Judaism, Christianity and Catholicism. Each constructed by searching for several words covering the faith (i.e. \u201cmuslim\u201d and \u201cIslam\u201d). By comparing these we both see that all religions is greatly related to each other, most being very present in the bottom left, while also seeing their differences as with Catholics being more present in the \u201cIrish\u201d section.", "When investigating the networks we noted that a large part of linked pages were of court cases. We therefore decided to investigate the extent of this topic influencing the debate. We see that \u201claw\u201d heavily affects the debate allover, while \u201ccourt case\u201d is mostly situated in the upper left, with a majority being within the orange cluster. Most interesting is perhaps the differences between prohibition and regulation (both groups composed by the verb and noun). We see that prohibition is more prominent within the \u201creligious\u201d green cluster. This might be due the religious communities being more prone to talk about prohibiting abortion, whereas regulation might be more of a juridical topic. As some clusters also have a geographical resemblance (as argued above) the differences here might also be due to either culture or language differences.", "These two maps show how Wikipedia\u2019s linking might work as a sort of hierarchy. Some articles on Wikipedia, such as Roe v. Wade are big in both networks. In the case of Roe v. Wade, this representation in both maps is a product of its historic and legal ramifications. Abortion in America is simply nearly impossible to discuss without having to link to this 1973 United States Supreme Court case. And the aftermath of it continues today in political and judicial circles.", "But the more interesting ones are the ones, that are large and visible on one map, but disappear on the other. Abortion is very linked, but this makes sense in the way that Wikipedia is structured, and how we gathered our data. Nearly all pages in the category of abortion debate, and its subcategories would link to the article on abortion. The abortion article itself mainly reads like a medical run-through of the procedure and its relation to historic and religious practices. Very little of the article is used on the debate, which has its own article.", "Some of the ones that are not very well linked to, but contain links to other pages are pages like Army of God (United States), The Turner Diaries, Eugen Relgis and various Articles about marches surrounding the topic of abortion. So, having a large out-degree without a large in-degree might show us that the node in question is on the fringes of the network. Some of the linking might even be an attempt to gain more legitimacy, or to follow Latour, attempt to mediate ones own position in the controversy. Perhaps especially if the user base is very unique to that one article?", "We made a range of different semantic analyses using the website CorTexT.net. The website is an online platform of the LISIS research unit, funded by two French governmental institutions \u2014 IFRIS and INRA. CorTexT is an interesting tool since it lets us run our digital spreadsheets through an algorithm, that makes a semantic analysis of the contents of those spreadsheets. This gives us the chance to scrape Wikipedia for a large amount of text and then turn it into networks of often used phrases.", "We did this with all the article pages in the Wikipedia category of abortion debate and the resulting map is below.", "This map confirms our findings that the American judicial system features prominently in the way the articles portray abortion debate. Might this be a sign of how this controversial topic is handled through the legal system and its way of deciding on matters? Evidently the American system seem to function like that. The weight of the judicial eclipses other forms, that might be avenues of handling the controversial topic, such as religion or politics, they play a smaller role in the relation.", "The map also lacks something \u2014 controversy. Or rather, it does not show it. Perhaps this tells us something about the way Wikipedia is structured for debate \u2014 that the handling of controversies between users is hidden away somewhere other than the articles, an information source that the medium would rather keep clear of the messiness of debating people on the internet? We have to take a deeper look into the world of Wikipedia pages in order to find the struggle.", "The following visualizations are composites of three graphs, all derivatives of the base cluster, removed from the entire network, a semantic analysis of the article pages in the cluster, and a semantic analysis of the articles\u2019 Talk pages. The semantic analysis has been done through CorTexT.", "For us, it is apparent that the separate semantic analyses of articles and talk pages gives us an overview of the media-technological effect, that Marres and Moats (Marres, Nortje & David Moats 2015: 6) discuss.", "It becomes a mapping, not just of users and their disagreements, but also of how these disagreements can only be exercised in specific spaces on Wikipedia. The Talk pages is a sort of backend, even though it is publicly visible \u2014 you have to be looking for it to use it.", "This arrangement works as a sort of filter for the articles. What is deemed problematic due to Wikipedias policies is quarantined into the space of the Talk pages in order to either become part of the article, or simply be discarded and eventually archived in the Talk section. Therefore, we also see what we did not see on the semantic analysis map of the articles in the Abortion Debate category. Simply because the controversy has already in some way been filtered out, due to the inner workings of Wikipedia.", "This filtering in the Talk pages is very apparent in the Fringe, Irish and American Legal System clusters. Here we have a large semantic cluster in all of these maps, that concerns Wikipedia\u2019s policies of good behaviour in editing \u2014 one of the obvious ways in which disagreements are handled on Wikipedia.", "The analysis of the Fringe cluster also highlights a critique of the modularity tool. It appears to have bonded several different communities of articles together, and this clusters fractured themes do not easily connect. The modularity tool is not a perfect tool it seems, but is still quite useful when used critically.", "This bipartite map shows the relation between editing users and Wikipedia articles. Some interesting things appear by producing our data in this way.", "The cluster towards the lower right corner for instance, is a cluster of mainly Irish users editing articles relating to Irish abortion laws. This highlights the geographic nature of the editing in some articles. Irish abortion laws were in the media in 2018, due to there being a referendum surrounding the changing of these laws. This probably produced more interaction with these pages from local Irish Wikipedians, who wanted to expand on the articles on this unfolding discussion.", "Then there is the large cluster in the middle, surrounding articles such as Abortion Debate, Anti-Abortion Violence, and United States Anti-Abortion Movement showing a large number of users editing on many different pages in a large cluster.", "The most interesting are the ones we also started to see on a former network \u2014 the out-degree map. Many of these pages did not seem important before, but as we can see there is an great interest in editing them. Especially pages like James O\u2019Keefe and White Genocide Conspiracy Theory are interesting on this map. These are pages with a large number of Wikipedians, who only edit on these specific articles in the network. These pages are interesting anomalies \u2014 they do not feature as prominent articles in the network, but they draw a lot of activity. This is something that could be said for many of the larger green nodes in this map. Most of them did not feature prominently before user-data entered into our mapping. Is this a sign of controversy? Some of the articles do feature controversial topics and persons. Perhaps this is worth a bit of digging into.", "When we take the plunge and look into the specific Wikipedians editing the White Genocide Conspiracy Theory article, a map of controversial topic emerges. These users seem to navigate in a sea of articles and talk-pages where topics that are seemingly in a state of never-ending debate are being described and made into a sort of encyclopaedic knowledge.", "Many of the articles we recognize as the battlefields of the internet from years past. The articles of Gamergate controversy, Alt-right, and Me Too movement are all places where heavy editing takes place.", "This leads us to the moderating aspect of Wikipedia. It becomes obvious, that Wikipedia\u2019s policies like Neutral Point Of View or Original Research are quickly becoming classics in how we look at controversy in articles. These policies are used as a weapon in the discussions \u2014 especially in controversial talk pages. The rules are ways of discarding dissenting voices, or shutting down claims against the authority of the wording of the articles.", "But this of course does not show us, how the users are engaging in the controversial discussions. Are they moderators or problematic editors? Going into the talk pages of individual articles and mapping the comments of individual users would give us an overview of this and could be an avenue of pursuit if we were to follow this path.", "For our use it is sufficient to say, that these users are nearly all related to a large number of very controversial pages \u2014 in some way. In that sense it is a map of the battleground of opinions on Wikipedia \u2014 from the articles and their talkpages to the noticeboards of the administrators. The meta-discussions on what is Facts on the biggest encyclopaedia on the internet is being arranged by adhering to strict rules of conduct and aggressively enforcing these.", "Until now, we have seen how users engage differently in different topics and ways. Above we saw how users had different levels of engagement on different pages. Below we will outline how they do so over time, and how we have mapped this. By introducing the time-variable into the equation we see how different pages or topics are prominent at different times.", "Above we see 13 different pages mapped out by considering amount of revisions (or edits) over time. All pages were found to be significant either as being center of a cluster, or through our other visualizations.", "The first thing we notice is how the \u201cRoe v Wade\u201d-page for the most part completely overshadows any other, thus underlining our previous idea of this being a central actor in the abortion debate. It is so both by amount of revisions (size of nodes) and by unique users engaging (thickness of lines).", "Next thing we want to highlight is how we see a pattern in how the pages are subject to more activity during the first years after being created (noted \u201cBirth\u201d), exceptions from this is the \u201cAbortion Law\u201d and \u201cAbortion Debate\u201d pages, which seems to be rather constant in activity over time.", "This might suggests that if a page should see a rise in activity after the first years, it is either because the topic suddenly becomes contested or due to new events which are then included. We see two pages exhibiting this behavior, namely \u201cWhite Genocide Conspiracy Theory\u201d and \u201cEighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland\u201d. Investigating the page of the first-mentioned, we see indications of events in South Africa starting a dispute that travels across the Atlantic to Donald Trump, which then travels further to the page of the conspiracy theory.", "In the following section, we will dive further into possible explanations of the rises in the Ireland case.", "The point we want to make with the timeline visualization of edits in both the wikipedia pages on the Eighth and the 36th Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland, is that they both go through the same process of editing. All four graphs have similar spikes around the same months. As our larger chart above showed us, a large spike \u201clater in life\u201d indicates a change made outside of Wikipedia but the 36th Amendment is created only months before the the revisions and edits happens.", "While the 36th Amendment is a new Wikipedia page created on the 18th of January 2018, we can see how the spikes in revision amount and unique users involved in the editing are connected by time period. A similar trend is visible on the visualizations of the editing history of the Eighth Amendment.", "While we know from reading the content of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland that it forbids the use of abortion, and that the 36th Amendment opens up for the possibility to circumvent the Eighth Amendment if need be.", "The content of the two Wikipedia pages explains the connection between the two, and the need for the simultaneous revisions of the two pages. The similar spikes we see within the editing community from unique user activity shows the relevance of the changes. We see the number of unique editors on both pages as an indicator of a political change to the two Amendments of the Constitution of Ireland.", "Above, we looked at the more general way Wikipedia users edit over time. Now, we take a deep dive into the editing of parts of the Irish cluster. We want to explore if the changes to the Irish Constitution is followed by Wikipedia users on a global scale.", "In the first part of our visualization, to the far left, we see how a majority of the edits are done by identified humans and almost all revisions are done by identified users. This has been illustrated through the use of bar charts. If we compare the \u201chigh\u201d number of user edits and revisions with the second and third graph in our visualization, we see a rise in unique users interested in updating information on Ireland and Irish matters, specifically abortion. The first graph leads us to believe that the users mainly are humans, and not automated bots. The spikes in the second graph also indicates a change of some sort, that needs integration into the Wikipedia pages, like the previous timelines. The Wikipedia pages describes two laws, which influences each other and the change in question is probably the passing of the 36th Amendment which directly influences the Eighth Amendment.", "The visualization above shows a group made up of humans, with a mostly Irish scope on their actions within Wikipedia. This answers the question of who and to some degree when. From the data, there doesn\u2019t seem to be a concern or a controversy about abortion in this cluster only a controversy or concern about Irish abortion, which isn\u2019t a similar concern in the rest of the cluster (Munk:2014).", "Because of this, we want to understand the timeline of events in a higher degree. Therefore we continue our mapping of the Irish activity.", "On the first graph we see an increase in anonymous and non-anonymous use of revisions in the same period as the Amendments timeline spikes above. The new thing we can learn from this chart is the massive drop in anonymous users we see after only two months of increasing action.", "When following the timelines of revisions and unique edits, in the middle of the visualization, we can see that the two lines follows each other until around October 2017, when the pages edits drops more than the revisions. This could indicate a \u201crevision war\u201d where users use their energy on changing existing content instead of contributing with new information. It could also point to a dedicated core of users that revise and edit new information. From the chart on the left, we can also see that most of the users on the Amendment-pages are identifiable. This might also be the case In general in the Irish cluster. As we saw above, there exist a large group of contributors involved in the topic of Irish abortion.", "When we crack open the comments on the Eighth and 36th Amendments Wikipedia pages, we see a lot of changes done on the polls. Single issues like the polls on the Eighth and the 36th amendment can generate a lot of revisions, and therefore generate spikes.", "By delving a bit deeper into the semantic keywords of the abortion debate found through CorTexT, and systematically reviewing the most frequent noun phrases, we could identify 12 keywords that we could map out on the overall category of abortion.", "\u201cPro-Life\u201d and \u201cPro-Choice\u201d are predominantly associated with the North American abortion debate. However the keyword \u201canti-abortion\u201d, a term most often used by the pro-abortion segment to name those who oppose abortion, is observed mainly in the page about anti-abortion violence showing that when violence is used to attack abortion practices, it is named anti-abortion rather than pro-life.", "The keyword \u201cdeath\u201d occurs mainly in pages about specific cases on people that contributed to the abortion debate in Ireland and the U.S. The case of Savita Halappanavar had monumental impact on the Irish abortion debate and associated legislation, and the case of Kermit Gosnell was likewise a controversial case about the results of illegal abortion in the U.S.", "\u201cRights\u201d are seen both associated with the right of the fetus, a pro-life focal point, and the concept of reproductive rights, an issue mostly associated with women\u2019s rights in less developed countries. This shows the duality of the issues of rights around the world.", "\u201cBaby\u201d is predominant in the cluster on miscarriage and the philosophical debate about abortion. This shows the different views, baby vs. fetus depending on miscarriage vs. abortion, and also how the terms are debated philosophically in regards to the morality of abortion.", "\u201cViability\u201d, being a central concept in the legal disputes on abortion in the U.S., is located mainly in this cluster, likely due to its association to fetal viability.", "That \u201cmother\u201d shows up under pages like abortion under communism can perhaps be explained by present and former communist countries laws that allow abortion to preserve the life of the mother.", "The distribution of \u201chealth\u201d shows that this concept is largely associated with reproductive rights and the health of women in developing countries.", "It is apparent that mapping a controversy as complex as this one at some point takes on a life of its own, and that diving deeper and deeper into the rabbits hole eventually creates more questions than answers. Ultimately here we wish to show that there is no real finality, we still have new opportunities for investigation and that this keyword analysis reveals aspects of the controversy previously not explored. This final analysis marks the end of our exploration into the controversy of abortion and the inner workings of wikipedia. It has been a ride; an intense, exciting, and sometimes grueling learning experience.", "Returning to our original network, we no longer see just a lonely starfish.", "Instead we see different combating perspectives on abortion with sub-disputes arising from these. We see connections to topics, never imagined connected, and we see an enormous lack of medical experts in our starfish-network, something we did not expect to see.", "So what is the abortion debate about? Who are disagreeing parties, where do they meet, what is the disagreement about, and will it ever stop?", "In our mapping, the actors participating in the Abortion Debate are reduced to editors of Wikipedia. They can be anonymous or regulars, even bots. And they meet only at Wikipedia, which here, acts as the local pub; the place where one learns of the latest gossip, discusses life, yells and hangs out. We have made no visualizations that shows the actual content of the disagreement, although we have shown the topics of debate. The evidence for the core of the disagreement seems hidden in the talk pages, and in the lines of reverting articles and adding view points on pages. Although we have touched upon this, what the disagreement really is about seems to slip through our fingers.", "A few words must be said of the role Wikipedia plays in how the controversy is mappable. Wikipedia\u2019s structure and policies provide a certain arena for disagreement. What is mapped by us is structured through layers of pages. Most people never click further than the uncontroversial webpage of the article \u2014 but we seldom think of it as a page that might be ever changing because of the inner workings of users, debating on the talkpages behind it \u2014 revising and editing. The users of Wikipedia are constructing the facts all the time, using the policies of the website as devices to structure the articles into literary bearers of facts.", "The abortion debate still have lots of aspects to explore, but with the above walk-through, both of the debate and the process of mapping a controversy, we hope to at least have illuminated a little part of it.", "Munk, A.
