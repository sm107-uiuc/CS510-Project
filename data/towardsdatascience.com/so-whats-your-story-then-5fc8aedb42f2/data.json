According to Danny P. Wallace, a professor of Library and Information Science, the origin of the DIKW Pyramid is uncertain. At the same time, many authors agreed that DIKW, at least IKW, originated from the play \u2018The Rock\u2019 by \u2018T. S. Eliot\u2019 in 1934.The Knowledge Pyramid, like other hierarchy models, has rigidly set building blocks \u2014 data comes first, information is next, then knowledge and wisdom is on the top.", "Each step up the pyramid answers questions about the initial data and adds value to it. We move up the pyramid, the more questions we answer, (somewhat like Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs). In other words, the more knowledge and insights we get out of the data depends on how much we enrich it with meaning and context. When we reach the top of the pyramid, we have turned the knowledge and insights into a learning experience that guides our actions.", "It is about time to take a deep dive into each component of the pyramid:", "\u201cData are just summaries of thousands of stories\u201d (Dan Heath)", "We started our journey with data by exploring the \u2018Data Pyramid\u2019, but the foundation of this pyramid is data, so what is it? Data is a collection of facts, such as words, numbers, measurements, observations or just descriptions of things. Data can be raw or organized, but if we do not put it into context, it is meaningless to both human or computer. Data on its own has very little direct value, but knowing the accuracy of the data underpins everything else.", "Freytag\u2019s PyramidIt seems like pyramids are a great way to structure data, so I have another one for you, and it has to do with stories:Most great stories, whether they are a Novel or a Pixar film, follow a specific dramatic structure. Dramatic structure is an idea, originating in \u2018Aristotle\u2019s Poetics\u2019, that compelling stories can be broken down into five elements, including; Exposition, Rising Action, Climax, Falling Action, and Resolution. Writers should include these five elements when they are constructing a story.", "Gustav Freytag originally formulated \u2018Freytag\u2019s Pyramid\u2019 in his 1863 book \u2018Freytag\u2019s Technique of the Drama\u2019, and it has become one of the most commonly taught dramatic structures in the world.", "As people engaged with data and trying to visualize it, they often say, \u201cLet\u2019s tell a story with this data\u201d, and in the end, they create some sort of chart or other representation of the data.

Similar to \u2018Maslow\u2019s Hierarchy of Needs\u2019, \u2018Monica Rogati\u2019s Data Science Hierarchy of Needs\u2019, is a pyramid (yes! another one), showing what is necessary to add intelligence to the production system. At the bottom is the need to gather the right data, in the correct formats and procedures, and in the right quantity. It is crucial to acknowledge that any application of AI and ML will only be as good as the quality of the data collected.", "What makes the data useful and more meaningful is putting it into context.

Basic information is created when the data is analyzed and assessed.", "The Pyramid Principle Assuming we have our story in place, gathering and processing it into valuable information might be a bit challenging. This is where another pyramid comes into place: \u2018The Pyramid Principle\u2019 was invented in the 1970s by Barbara Minto, the first female post-MBA hired at McKinsey. The Pyramid Principle is a methodology for structured communication but can work really well with data processing, as it is a natural partner for hypothesis-driven thinking.", "The Pyramid Principle starts with the end in mind. Give your conclusion or answer first, follow it up with your main arguments, and then follow those with data that supports each one. That is the core of The Pyramid Principle: a principle that allows you to quickly seize your data and get the information required for your purpose, by creating a compelling story that is easy to understand and remember.This is the art of telling your story tailored to your audience.", "Narrow AIBack to AI \u2014 The first level of AI is considered to be a basic concept of AI and called \u2018Narrow AI\u2019 or \u2018Weak AI\u2019. It is a stream of intelligence, which is able to handle just one particular task at a time with smartness by improving its execution. The main goal is to find a solution to a problem or inconvenience or simply to make better something that already works.", "A good example of Narrow AI is the various voice assistants like; \u2018Alexa\u2019 or \u2018Siri\u2019, which perform a particular action upon voice command. Ben Goertzel, an AI Researcher, stated on his blog in 2010 that \u2018Siri\u2019 was \u201cVERY narrow and brittle\u201d, evidenced by annoying results if you ask questions outside the limits of the application.", "Even the \u2018IBM\u2019s Watson\u2019 supercomputer, which out-performed human contestant Ken Jennings to become the champion on the popular game show, \u2018Jeopardy!\u2019, can only be classified as an example of \u2018Narrow AI\u2019. Watson is a type of expert-system, combined with cognitive computing, machine learning and natural language processing, in order to perform as a \u2018question answering\u2019 machine and simulate the knowledge and cognitive ability of a human within a particular realm.", "Narrow AI tends to be a software that is automating an activity which typically performed by humans. Currently, most of Artificial Intelligence applications are Narrow AI.", "We can think of Narrow AI as information \u2014 although the concept of information has different meanings in different contexts, but, if we are to simplify this, it consists of input-output. It is the answer to the question of \u2018what an entity is\u2019. I will argue that to break it into a very simple method; this is the same base concept of Narrow AI: an intelligent continually learning, output, which is a result of an input.", "Information answers a question, but when we get to the \u2018how\u2019, this is what makes the leap from information to knowledge.", "\u201cWhen you talk, you are only repeating what you already know; But when you listen, you may learn something new\u201d (Dalai Lama)", "Knowledge, the next building block of the DIKW Pyramid, refers to awareness of or familiarity with various events, ideas, objects or ways of doing things.", "We turn information into knowledge when we understand how to apply it to achieve our goals, and don\u2019t only view information as a description of collected facts. This knowledge is often the edge that one can have over others playing in the same field. As we uncover relationships that are not explicitly stated as information, we get more in-depth insights that take us higher up the DIKW Pyramid.", "General AIThe next step towards more comprehensive machine intelligence is \u2018Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)\u2019, or \u2018Strong AI\u2019. It is also called by some \u2018The True AI\u2019. As its name suggests, it is general-purpose, and rather than focusing on a single task, the machine has the ability to comprehend and reason on a wide level, like a human, \u201cat least as smart as a typical human\u201d.", "An easy way to understand Strong AI is to think of it more like a brain. It does not classify but uses clustering and association to process data. As opposed to Weak AI, there isn\u2019t a set answer to your keywords. The function will mimic the result, but in this case, we aren\u2019t sure of the outcome.

Kurzweil describes Strong AI as when the computer acts as though it has a mind, irrespective of whether it actually does.", "Tests for AGIThere are various tests we use to claim a Strong AI.

Or, \u2018The Robot College Student Test\u2019, by Ben Goertzel, an AI researcher, in which a machine enrolled in university and obtained a degree. Another test, suggested by Nils John Nilsson, an American Computer Scientist, is where a machine is being employed and performing as well as humans within the same job.", "Strong AI does not currently exist. Some experts predict it may be developed in the next few decades. Others more conservatively predict that it may be developed within the next century, or that the development of Strong AI may not be possible at all.But, for machines to achieve real human-like intelligence, data is clearly not enough. They will need to be capable of experiencing the consciousness, and this is something that even a vast amount of data cannot achieve.", "Common Sense KnowledgeCommon Sense is the knowledge that all humans have. It is unspoken and unwritten knowledge that we acquire imperceptibly from the day we are born and take for granted. This knowledge is often used by human experts, even when solving a task.", "John McCarthy, one of the Fathers of AI, who also coined the term \u2018Artificial Intelligence\u2019, was amongst the first to realize its importance. He wrote a paper that was the first to propose common-sense reasoning, through a hypothetical program called \u2018Advice Taker\u2019 in 1959.

Yet, no one has ever come up with a single, irrefutable description for it.

Aristotle distinguished between two different kinds of wisdom, \u2018Theoretical Wisdom\u2019 and \u2018Practical Wisdom\u2019. Theoretical wisdom is \u201cscientific knowledge, combined with intuitive reason, of the things that are highest by nature\u201d, according to Aristotle. But the idea that scientific knowledge is knowledge of necessary truths and their logical consequences is no longer a widely accepted view.", "Both Knowledge and Experience do seem to be necessary conditions for being or becoming, wise. But this definition doesn\u2019t sit well with me. It is certainly possible to have the experience, but little if any wisdom. Not everyone with lots of life experience is wise \u2014 which is just to say not every older person knows how to live well.", "Wisdom as Knowing How To Live WellAccording to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Although one has an abundance of essential factual knowledge, they might still lack the kind of practical know-how that is a mark of a wise person. Wise people know how to get on in the world in all sorts of situations and with all kinds of people. Extensive factual knowledge is not enough to give us what a wise person knows. \u201cWisdom is not just knowing fundamental truths, if these are unconnected with the guidance of life or with a perspective on its meaning\u201d, As Robert Nozick points out. There is more to wisdom than intelligence and knowledge of Science and Philosophy or any other subject matter.", "Or as Eleanor Roosevelt said, \u201cNever mistake knowledge for wisdom.

And with the rise of Big Data we will achieve a better and more robust AI. But as I hopefully managed to explain, if we want to achieve a Strong AI, we need much more than only data. Data is fantastic for building a Weak AI. You can become an expert in one task by endlessly repeating the same set of actions. You can build a Strong AI, surpassing humans in a single task, by feeding it all the possibilities.

It is like saying that humans are nothing more than data consumers. If that was the case, we could have achieved world peace by now. Humans are the most complex species that exist; they might lack the ability to process quantities of data, but are way advanced in other skills.I am not arguing against data and its importance in building AI. It is indeed right for the short term, Weak AI. But I will argue that this might be the wrong direction if we want to make the leap to AGI and eventually ASI.
