It utilizes statistical concepts as well as mathematical approaches to work on big data via coding languages such as python and R. There are multiple machine learning techniques. However, this article will be covering regression and classification.", "Regression is used to predict continuous numerical data. It is a widely used statistical concept that can be applied manually for small data sets with about two variables and few elements. When dealing with large data sets with multiple variables and loads of elements, regression is done by uploading files containing data sets into coding platforms and running a bunch of codes.", "There are different kinds of regression techniques such as linear regression, polynomial regression, multiple linear regression and multiple polynomial regression. Their applications vary based on how many independent variables are going to be used for predicting the dependent variable. Below are some useful terminologies associated with regression:", "A regression equation is an equation that takes uses the independent variable(s) to make predictions of the dependent variable. It can be expressed as y=mx + b, y = ax^n + bx^n-1 + \u2026+ c, y = ax+ bx2 +\u2026+ c or y = ax^n + bx^n-1 + \u2026+ c for linear regression, polynomial regression, multiple linear regression and multiple polynomial regression respectively.", "Regression coefficient is a constant value that is applied in linear regression or multiple linear regression. It can have an increasing or decreasing effect on the dependent variable. Let\u2019s use an example where variables such as age and height(cm) are used to determine weight (pounds).", "For linear regression, it can be either expressed as weight = 5*age + 30. This equation suggests that for every increase in age by 1 year there is an increase in weight by 5 pounds.", "For multiple linear regression, it can be expressed as weight = 4*age +2.5*height + 30. This equation implies that given that age is zero, weight is going to increase by a magnitude of 2.5 for every cm of height and given that height is zero, weight is going to increase by 4 pounds for an increase in age by one year.", "This is the can be described as the value of the dependent variable given that the regression coefficient(s) or x is set to zero. It can be expressed as y=c. It is also the point at which the line of regression cuts the y-axis.", "The data set is split into two groups: the training data set and the testing data set. After splitting the data set into groups, a regression equation is generated using the training data set. Once developed, the regression equation is applied on the testing data set to create predictions.", "The predicted values can be compared with the actual values to test for accuracy. Metrics for evaluating the predictions are described below:", "Coefficient of Determination, r-squared, is a useful mechanism for explaining how the accurate the regression equation is for making predictions. This is done by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. It provides a value that signifies what proportion of the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s). In order to improve the r-squared score, one can switch from one style of regression to another.", "This is another very useful value that describes the relationship between the values in both the actual results and predicted results. It ranges from -1 to 1. If the correlation coefficient is negative, then the predicted results increase as the actual results decrease and vice-versa. If it is positive, the predicted results increase as the actual results increase. The closer the value is to |1|, the more perfect the relationship is.", "Mean Squared Error is the average of the total squared differences between the predicted values and actual values at each data point. This value is a measure of how close the data set is to the line of regression on average. The square root of this value is called the root mean squared error. The goal is to make the root mean square error close to 0 to obtain an optimal fit.", "Classification is another great machine learning algorithm that can be used to predict categorical data sets. The independent variable(s) can be continuous or categorical while the dependent variable is categorical. Classification can be used to build either a model that provides a yes (1) or no (0) answer or multiple categories (0,1,2\u2026.) depending on what the user\u2019s agenda is. It makes use of training and testing data set just like regression.", "Using the results from one of my former project in which I predicted loan application status, classification methods such as K-Nearest Neighbor and Decision Tree Classifier and their metrics shall be explained below:", "This is a classification method that uses the closest data points to that specific data point to predict what category that data point should belong to. By evaluating each data points\u2019 independent and dependent variables and comparing them to the k nearest ones, it creates a predictive model using the training data set. This model is used in predicting the category of each data point in the testing data set and its accuracy is measured.", "Multiple iteration is done by setting k to a value of 1, measuring its accuracy and increasing the k value until it reaches the point of peak accuracy.", "This k-max value predictive model is used to further analyze the data set by fitting a predictive model with the training model and categorizing the data points in testing data set using the predictive model.", "Decision Tree Classifier uses a different approach from the K-Nearest Neighbor. It starts off by looking at all the data points in the training model and evaluating an independent variable and assigns it a Yes (1) or No (0) label according to the value of this variable. Then, it proceeds to other independent variables based on the output of the previous independent variable(s) to arrive at a final label of Y or N as the predicted outcome.", "The predictive model that is generated from the decision tree classifier training data set can be used to predict the categories of the data points in the testing data set.", "A confusion matrix is a table that is used in classification to show how many values were predicted correctly and how many values were predicted wrongly. There are two types of errors: Type I error and Type II error. A type I error is regarded as a false positive, that is, a negative value which is categorized as positive. A type II error is a false negative, that is, a positive value which is categorized as negative.", "Classification performance can be measured using metrics such as precision, recall and accuracy can be calculated using the confusion matrix.", "Precision is used to see how much of the positive value recorded are actually positive. Its formula is TP/(TP +FP). For the confusion matrix above, the precision is: 119/(119+54) = 0.69", "Recall is also a called true positive rate. It calculates proportion of true positive values among the actual positives. Its formula is TP/(TP +FN). Recall in the confusion matrix above is 119/(119+10) = 0.92", "True Negative Rate measures proportion of true negative values among the actual negatives. Its formula is TN/(TN +FP). For the confusion matrix above, it is 9/(9+54) = 0.15.", "Accuracy is simply the total of all the accurately recorded values divided by the sum of all the recorded values. Its formula is (TP + TN)/(TP +TN + FP+FN). Accuracy in the confusion matrix above is (119 + 9)/(119 + 9 +54 + 10) = 0.67.", "The F-1 score is similar to the r-squared score. It is a measure of how well the dependent variable is explained by the independent variables. This is done by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. The closer it is to 1, the stronger the predictive model. The F-1 score can be measured for the predictive models of different classification methods to decide which one to use.", "Machine Learning is a field that has the ability to guide us towards making effective decisions in our daily activities. It is going to be very helpful in assisting humans and companies to make intelligent decisions in the future. For instance, classification can tell us whether or not to invest in a certain business and regression tells us how much we are likely to make if we invest in that business.", "Your home for data science.
