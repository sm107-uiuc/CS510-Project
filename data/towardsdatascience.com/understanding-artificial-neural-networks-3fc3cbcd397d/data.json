This trend comes shortly after the \u2018big data\u2019 boom in 2010 and the \u2018data science\u2019 boom in 2011. The upticks in interest are not surprising because companies now realized that they needed individuals who were capable of deciphering insights from the information tsunami that was now present.", "With data science now being referred to \u201calmost everything that has something to do with data\u201d, the process of data utilization evolved beyond data collection and analysis. Now, it was possible to use large sets of data to accurately model events and create data applications. This surge made it possible to train computers and machines to perform all sorts of tasks, some of which might be taken as standard practices today.", "Now, when a complexed task needs to be modelled, deep learning is almost the go-to method. This is a powerful process which enables a computer to mimic human behaviour by automatically extracting the most useful pieces of information needed to inform future decisions. It is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), and the goal of deep learning is to use computational methods which allow machines understand information directly from data without relying on a predetermined equation as a model.", "Both ML models and deep learning models are expected to learn something from data that can be used to help inform future decisions. However, deep learning models take ML just a bit further. The idea is that typical ML algorithms attempt to define a set of rules within data, and these rules are usually hand-engineered. Therefore, ML models can underperform when placed outside of a development environment. Deep learning models, on the other hand, learn complexed features directly from raw data and do not necessarily require a set of hand-engineered rules.", "Deep learning models are built on the idea of \u2018neural networks\u2019, and this is what allows the models to learn from raw data. Recall that the goal of these types of models is to somehow get machines to mimic human behaviour. Therefore, think of the neural networks within deep learning models similar to the human brain. The brain consists of billions of cells called neurons. Each neuron has multiple connections carrying information towards it, and a single connection carrying information away from it.", "With these neural connections established, the brain develops, and humans learn through a process called neuroplasticity. This is the ability of the neural networks within the brain to change through growth and reorganization. When the reorganization occurs, new pathways between neurons are developed and the brain can delete connections that are no longer necessary or strengthen connections that are found to be more important. Essentially, the brain assigns a weighting along each pathway, where connections which were found to be more important receive a higher weighting than those which were found to be unimportant. Thus, a set of inputs are fed to a neuron along a path that has a particular weight, the information is processed, and then output to perform some task.", "Similarly, an artificial neural network (ANN) contains a set of inputs that a fed along weighted paths, these inputs are then processed, and an output is produced to perform some task. Like with neuroplasticity, paths within an ANN can have higher weightings if they are found to be more important within a model.", "This idea helps build upon the foundation of neural networks; that is, the perceptron (or a single neuron). Information is propagated forward through this system by having a set of inputs, x, and each input has a corresponding weight, w. The input should also include a \u2018bias term\u2019 which is independent of x. The bias term is used to shift the function being used accordingly, given a problem at hand. Each corresponding input and weight are then multiplied, and the sum of products is calculated. The sum then passes through a non-linear activation function, and an output, y, is generated.", "The non-linear activation function can take on a variety of forms. However, a common one is a sigmoid function. This is an S-shaped curve which is bounded between 0 and 1, where negative input values are assigned output of less than 0.5 and positive input values are assigned an output greater than 0.5. The choice of the activation function is largely dependent on the situation at hand, especially because different functions contain different properties. The importance of this function is its non-linearity. In \u2018real-world\u2019 problems, a large portion of data is non-linear. Applying a linear form to a non-linear problem will undoubtedly result in poor performance.", "Now that we understand how a perceptron works, a deep neural network is essentially formed by having multiple connected perceptrons. If all the inputs are densely connected to all the outputs, these layers are referred to as dense layers. But, unlike with the perceptron, a deep neural network can contain multiple hidden layers.", "The hidden layer is basically that point between the input and output of the neural network, where the activation function does a transformation on the information being fed in. It is referred to as a hidden layer because it is not directly observable from the system\u2019s inputs and outputs. A neural network which has only one hidden layer is referred to as a single layer neural network, while those with more hidden layers are known as deep neural networks. The deeper the neural network, the more the network can recognize from data.", "It must be noted that although learning as much as possible from the data is the goal, deep learning models can also suffer from overfitting. This occurs when a model learns too much from the training data, including random noise. Models are then able to determine very intricate patterns within the data, but this negatively affects the performance on new data. The noise picked up in the training data does not apply to new or unseen data, and the model is unable to generalize the patterns found. Like with the perceptron, non-linearity is of high importance in deep learning models. Although the model will learn a lot from having multiple hidden layers, applying linear forms to non-linear problems will still result in poor performance.", "The importance of deep learning (and ANN\u2019s by extension) is rooted in the idea that better data-driven decisions can be made from understanding more from data. Humans have the ability to spontaneously put information together by recognizing old patterns, developing new connections, and perceiving something that they have learnt in a new light to develop new and effective processes. But humans are not good and handling highly complexed situations, and most \u2018real-world\u2019 problems are highly complexed. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if computers were more like the human brain?", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist? Yes. Researcher?
