How did society look before Six Degrees, Friendster, LinkedIn, MySpace, Twitter, Snapchat, Reddit, Instagram, and Facebook?", "In 2004, MySpace became the first social media site to reach 1 million monthly active users. Today, Facebook has over 1.62 billion DAILY active users. While companies like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger have helped this number grow, there is no denying that social media has become deeply embedded in society.", "Rapid technological change doesn\u2019t come without a cost. Users have slowly evolved social media platforms to fit their UX needs, but it is often forgotten how social media equally influences society.", "\u201cTechnology are not merely aids to human activity, but also powerful forces acting to reshape that activity and its meaning.\u201d \u2014 Langdon Winner", "Ever heard the old fable about boiling a frog?", "To cook a live frog, it won\u2019t work to place it in a pot of boiling water \u2014 it will simply jump out of the pot. Instead, it must be placed into a pot of room-temperature water, with the heat slowly being raised over time. The frog won\u2019t realize that its soothing stove-top hot tub has become a grave until it is too late.", "Every social media platform is at risk for manipulation from hackers. Algorithms have been under attack for years. With over a billion active users every day, these algorithms have the capability to steer society \u2014 for better or for worse. Some platforms are at much greater risk of attack than others.", "Twitter\u2019s most vulnerable algorithm is the one that allows hashtags, events, and phrases to reach an audience of millions for free (or for an advertisement price). Though Twitter Trends were originally created to display the information that is actually trending around users, it has become a large target for engagement manipulation.", "For hackers, Twitter trends are significantly more powerful than a simple #throwbackthursday. An audience of millions can easily be enough to sway an election, spread fake news, and hide important truths.", "In 2011, the spam-as-a-service market attacked Twitter trends, censoring public opinions about Russian parliamentary election results. In 2012, politicians running for the presidential election in Mexico hired thousands of citizens to shape public opinion through Twitter trend manipulation. In 2015, the trend algorithm was exploited in an attempt to disengage the public from nuclear negotiations in Iran, and also used to drive political opinions of the public in Venezuela.", "Hackers discovered how to artificially inflate fake trends and artificially deflate real trends to manipulate public knowledge and engagement. There even exist secret markets and groups that can be hired to artificially create a Twitter trend for a small price.", "In other words \u2014 hackers, spammers, and politicians have figured out very efficient ways to control what content reaches the front page of Twitter. Though Twitter has done a great job at battling fake trends and bots on their platform, the algorithm that determines when something is trending is still proprietary. This means that there is no way for a user to know if a Twitter trend is real or fake.*", "The Zuckerberg memes and big data buzzwords between 2015 and 2018 left many digital citizens scared, amused, and heavily confused. What really happened between Facebook and Cambridge Analytica that went so wrong?", "It began a few years back. Cambridge Analytica didn\u2019t originally break any laws. Neither did Facebook. Cambridge Analytica was simply a strategic communication firm. They used data on prospective voters to strategically communicate election details with them (and hopefully sway them to vote for their client). However, they made some bad decisions.", "In 2013, Cambridge Analytica began to collect data on Facebook users through entirely legal means. Every user\u2019s account they originally collected was through consent. This wasn\u2019t problematic.", "Problems arose when the analytics firm began abusing this consent. For every consenting user, they were also able to obtain all of the profile information from all of the friends on their accounts, with no consent required.", "They began to collect data; a lot of data.", "Data became power. The more they knew about people, the more they were able to influence them.", "\u201cToday in the United States we have somewhere close to four or five thousand data points on every individual \u2026 So we model the personality of every adult across the United States, some 230 million people.\u201d \u2014 Alexander Nix, chief executive of Cambridge Analytica, October 2016.", "In 2015, Cambridge Analytica was hired by the Ted Cruz campaign to help him sway targeted potential voters. In 2016, the Trump campaign did the same. In 2018 a whistleblower brought this political activity to the public.", "Did Cambridge Analytica break the law? There is still debate about this.", "Did Cambridge Analytica behave unethically? This is a bit more clear. In a nutshell:", "When it comes to research, most ethical issues are not legal issues.", "After inhumane scientific experiments were conducted on people during WWII, the Institutional Review Board (IRB) was created to provide ethical guidance for scientists.", "At Universities, the IRB board regulates research ethics. Social media data mining is tricky to regulate, because it can be hard to know what is considered \u201cpublicly available data\u201d or not. For example, collecting and analyzing public Twitter posts for research does not typically require consent. But, downloading a Facebook friend\u2019s private posts would require consent.", "If Cambridge Analytica had asked the IRB to approve their activities, they would have been denied. They wouldn\u2019t have been able to collect any \u2018friend\u2019s\u2019 profile information without consent. They also wouldn\u2019t have been able to utilize human data for a purpose that was different from their initial intent.", "It is still debated by some whether or not Cambridge Analytica really made that big of a dent in the US election process. As of now, there is no way to measure its impact.", "However, it is undeniable that the data collected by Cambridge Analytica was dangerous and powerful.", "Social media companies may be publicly traded, but they are privately owned. Users get to play for free, so how do these large tech giants make their cash?", "If you aren\u2019t the customer, you are the product.", "UX design wasn\u2019t originally created for user satisfaction. It was created for user retention. Social media users don\u2019t pay with money, they pay with data. Users are the product. The real customers are those who want the data, those who want the likes, and those who want the engagement.", "For Cambridge Analytica, engagement was voter turnout. For Facebook, engagement attracted advertisers. For Twitter Trends, engagement influenced everything from elections to public censorship.", "How else can society be silently harmed by social media?", "Billions of people use social platforms every single day. Trillions of words are posted, liked, shared, tweeted, and dispersed to the masses. Algorithmic manipulation is just one of many dangers. Recent research has highlighted some interesting phenomena that occur on social media:", "Psychologically, humans are more likely to spread information that appeals to two things: emotion and trust. Emotion is triggered by click-bait and extremism. The more exciting that something looks, the more it triggers our attention. Trust on social media comes in the form of likes and shares. AKA: people trust posts that have been shared and liked a lot.", "The irony here is that fake news appeals to controversy. Controversy breeds emotion. Emotion triggers more likes and shares. Likes and shares create trust. People are directly led to trust misinformation.", "In summary, content on social media is always subjective and often fake. But there is no way for users to measure its subjectivity or validity.", "The frogs are enjoying the warm water.", "About a year ago, I switched my phone to Spanish to prep for some travel to South America. While switching languages gave me a newfound appreciation for good UX design, it also provided an interesting insight one morning while I scrolled through my LinkedIn feed.", "In English, when I want to react to someone\u2019s post on LinkedIn, I click the \u201clike\u201d button. However, on my Spanish phone I noticed that the \u201clike\u201d button wasn\u2019t replaced with the verb \u201cgustar\u201d (to like) in Spanish. Instead, it was replaced with \u201crecomendar\u201d.", "Liking something on social media doesn\u2019t necessarily equate to agreeing with something. If I like a tweet or a post, I could easily hate that post. I could feel a wide variety of emotions about a post and still like it. I could like a fake political news article that I feel very angry about. I could like a piece of clickbait because it has an intriguing title.", "In Spanish, recomendar means to recommend, to advise, or to suggest.", "If I see a fake news article, would I recommend that others look at it? Would I suggest that my friends be influenced by it? Would I advise its dissemination into the public? Probably not.", "This made me wonder how social media might change if \u201clike\u201d buttons became \u201cendorse\u201d buttons. When engagement equates to endorsement, users spread less misinformation, and fake news no longer holds as much power as it once did.", "Cambridge Analytica wasn\u2019t the first time that Facebook was put under public scrutiny. In 2016, an A/B testing-gone-wrong case highlighted an eery future. Facebook researchers released a paper on Facebook\u2019s ability for emotional contagion.", "The article highlighted some scary truths, one of which was that Facebook timeline content heavily influences user emotions offline. The researchers discovered this by randomly selecting one group of Facebook users to be guinea pigs for more negative timeline content and another group to be given more positive timeline content. Not surprisingly, the results proved that the emotion of the content in Facebook feeds does have a correlation to the emotion of the users who consume that content. AKA: negative social media feeds create negative people, and visa versa.", "When this study was released, there was massive public backlash. Facebook users were furious that the company had been using their online lives as a laboratory without their consent. Ironically, these studies happen all of the time. Private companies do A/B testing on users every day without asking them. This is one of the many things that users agree to while signing their lives away to social media\u2019s bestselling Terms & Conditions documents.", "Either way, the public was angry at Facebook for experimenting on them. Facebook fortunately responded by creating their own internal IRB board, just like universities have. Facebook\u2019s IRB consists of five employees who review research submissions to decide if they are ethical or not.", "While Facebook\u2019s IRB has a lot of room for improvement, it is a step in a very good direction.", "Right now, privately owned companies aren\u2019t held accountable or responsible for unethical acts until they become a legal issue. When it comes to social media, this concept can be really dangerous for two reasons: (1) With data privacy, most ethical issues are not legal issues. (2) With engagement manipulation, by the time a tech scandal becomes a legal issue, the harm has usually already been done.", "An IRB for private tech companies could combat these fears. If policy won\u2019t back up tech ethics, then PR can provide motivation for compliance. For social media companies, if an IRB means increasing user retention, ethics is sexy.", "For years Trump has been waging a war against media. This is a dangerous game. If news outlets lose the trust of entire populations, is it possible to differentiate between reality and clickbait?", "Even now, as you log into your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or preferred form of social media \u2014 what convinces you that what you see is real? Are you truly sure that the article you shared last week wasn\u2019t fake? What about those recommended articles in your feed, can you trust those? What about that trend on Twitter, was that started by a human, or by a bot?", "In a world full of misinformation, where is the source of truth? Is there one?", "I don\u2019t think Trump should wage war with media outlets. When all news is seen as fake news, society doesn\u2019t know who to trust.", "However, skepticism isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing.", "Many subjective truths pieced together can paint a picture that resembles objectivity.", "This is why it is so important to be a responsible digital citizen, especially on social media sites. There is no Rotten Tomatoes for fake news. There is no IRB for private tech companies. All that\u2019s left is intuition and trust.", "If an article pops up in your newsfeed that feels controversial, do some research before clicking that share button. Don\u2019t believe clickbait until you read where it takes you. Be mindful online. Contribute to an informative internet as opposed to a toxic one.", "Don\u2019t be a frog in a boiling pot of water.", "Calling all coders!! If you are interested in being a more mindful digital citizen, feel free to check out this tutorial I made.
