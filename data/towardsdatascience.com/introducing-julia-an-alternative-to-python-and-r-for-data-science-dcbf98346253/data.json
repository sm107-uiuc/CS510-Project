For a while now I\u2019ve been a heavy Python user, looking at it for 8 hours at work, and an additional 3\u20134 hours at home \u2014 and I like it, there are no reasons not to.", "Well, maybe there are a few\u2026", "As you can imagine, someone who is coding in Python for half or even more of the day can be a bit skeptical when it comes to trying out new languages. A while back a couple of folks tried to convince me to switch to R, and I honestly tried but disliked so much about it.", "Data science isn\u2019t all about statistics, you also have to create APIs and stuff, so the end-user can somehow interact with what you\u2019ve made, so for me, it\u2019s only natural to choose programming language instead of a statistical language. But you might disagree, and that\u2019s fine.", "Anyway, let\u2019s get back on the topic. So what is Julia? According to a quick web search, Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic, and general-purpose programming language created by MIT and is mostly used for numerical analysis. The work on the language started around 2009, and the first release was in 2012. So the language has been around 8 years now, not a short period, but surely not long as for example, Python has.", "That\u2019s quite a sentence. You can think of it as a mixture of R and Python, but faster because it\u2019s a compiled language. Some of the major advantages Julia has over R and Python are:", "However, for every advantage there is a disadvantage, to name a few:", "Okay, I just hope you\u2019re still here, as now we\u2019ll explore some key concepts of Julia programming language. First, however, we should install the language, right?", "In this quick section, we\u2019ll quickly go over the process of installing Julia, and also setting up a kernel for Jupyter. If you don\u2019t use Jupyter feel free to download plugins for your editor of choice.", "Let\u2019s get started. Open up the following URL, and hit that big green button that says Download. You\u2019ll be asked to specify your OS, which is Windows x64 for me, and then you can download the file. The installation itself is straightforward, only press Next a couple of times and you\u2019ll be ready to go.", "Jupyter-wise we still have some work to do. You\u2019ll need to open up the Julia prompt, the window should look like this:", "Now enter the following two lines:", "After a minute or so the Julia kernel will be configured with Jupyter, and we can verify that by opening up the JupyterLab, where now I have the Julia interpreter alongside with the Python one:", "That\u2019s great, now create a Julia Notebook and you\u2019re ready to have some fun!", "In your newly created Notebook you can define a variable just as you would do with Python:", "By default, the variable value will get printed out, to avoid that you can put the semicolon (;) at the end. If you\u2019ve noticed, the strings need to be surrounded with double quotation marks, as single quotation marks are reserved for character types.", "You can easily concatenate two or more strings:", "The multiplication sign might be strange at first, but you\u2019ll get used to it. You can also easily check the data type of any given variable (or value):", "Julia is similar to Python for the array creation (well, to a degree), where you don\u2019t have to specify data type or the number of elements:", "But that doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t:", "You can declare vectors in a similar manner, just don\u2019t separate items with the comma (,):", "In a similar fashion you can declare multi-dimensional arrays:", "Now we\u2019ve covered some basics of basics. Up next I want to quickly cover how to handle data with Julia.", "To begin with, let\u2019s install 3 libraries \u2014 for dealing with CSV files, data visualization, and data frames in general:", "It will take a minute or so to install, but once done we\u2019ll have to import them before using:", "Okay, now we\u2019re ready to go. For some quick data analysis, I will be using the Iris dataset, available freely on GitHub. Let\u2019s load it in and do some magic:", "In case you\u2019re wondering, normalizenames param will ensure that column names don\u2019t have any unwanted characters, like dots (.), and those will get replaced with an underscore (_).", "You can explore the data in a similar fashion as with Python\u2019s Pandas library. Let\u2019s see how to grab first 5 and last 5 rows, alongside with a quick statistical summary:", "And that doesn\u2019t even scratch the surface. Anything you can think of that Pandas library has, most likely has an alternative in Julia.", "And yeah, the language is also amazing plotting-wise. Take a look at what these couple of lines are able to produce:", "Out of the box, it looks better than anything I\u2019ve produced with Matplotlib. You can also do some fancy stuff, like combining plots:", "And there\u2019s plenty more you could do, but that\u2019s out of the scope of this article.", "There\u2019s no doubt that Julia is an amazing language. The goal of the article was to showcase just the basics \u2014 be it of a language itself, or its capabilities to handle data.", "In the following articles, I will focus on individual parts in much more depth, while also considering how it differs from Python, and whether I think the difference is positive or negative. For now, I\u2019ll say that the data visualization capabilities are far beyond anything traditional Python visualization libraries can offer.", "How I stand on the other subjects, well, you\u2019ll have to stay tuned to find that out.
