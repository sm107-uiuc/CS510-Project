RPA provides companies with a \u201cdigital worker\u201d strategy that can have a significant quantifiable impact for teams that plan and execute automation projects using best practices that help clearly identify automation-friendly processes while avoiding automation of poorly designed or broken processes. The ability to evaluate \u201cas-is\u201d state processes helps clearly set ROI expectations, assure agile service delivery, or realize the benefits of an improved customer journey.", "RPA offers immense promise for better service, increased process accuracy, and tremendous cost efficiencies \u2014 no doubt the reason that service-focused industries are adopting it in droves.", "If your organization is using a manual approach to understand end-to-end process execution, you\u2019re making a substantial upfront investment of time and money, and only getting a piece of the picture. The software tasked with executing operations and back-room transactions generate immense amounts of process-related data. Being able to extract that data and aggregating then analyzing it provides you with actionable insights into your \u201cas-is\u201d processes. This concept may sound simple and easy to implement but it is proving to be a substantial challenge for most organizations to undergo. Why is this hard? One big reason is that when multiple systems execute different aspects of any process, it\u2019s virtually impossible to recreate a single, usable view of how processes using old approaches. Another is that the analytic tools used to generate key metrics deliver snapshots in time, rather than viewing process execution in the context of time.", "Intelligent Process Mining easily and cost-effectively aggregates process data across many disparate systems and re-constitutes it as an interactive model that reflects 100% of process execution actually operates.", "While the majority of current RPA initiatives focus on automating high-volume, relatively simple processes involving structured data without human intervention. Bots are increasingly being considered in processes with unstructured data, as well as more complex environments in which humans are part of the process, or where some cognitive reasoning may need to be employed. Increasing complexity and sophistication drives up deployment costs, in turn challenging RPA ROI justifications. The ability to access actionable process intelligence is just as valuable in the digital worker environment, as it is when human workers are involved. It allows you to:", "A Process Intelligence platform instantiates a corresponding risk and compliance framework for your Robotic Operating Model that both monitors and assesses automated process performance regularly:", "Process mining is used by many different industries to automatically model and present process flows. Similar to the digital twins first used in manufacturing settings, it exposes the inner workings of any business process as it actually happened, based on real data. A detailed process digital twin is the heart of intelligent process mining. Intuitive BI-style analytics makes it easier and faster to discover, analyze, and automatically monitor near real-time process flows \u2014 exposing the true depth and breadth of automation opportunities and challenges.", "Here are four key common RPA challenges that an Intelligent Process Mining solution addresses \u2014 improving both implementation and at-scale sustainability:", "Target processes with the greatest automation potential while reducing time to value", "Intelligent Process Mining delivers 100% process visibility. Find high-risk or costly patterns you don\u2019t expect.", "Avoid automation of broken or poorly executed processes", "Maintain post-RPA visibility for impacted processes", "An Interactive Process Model, also known as a Process Digital Twin, not only delivers 100% visibility for any process flow executed by your RPA bots or IT systems, it makes it possible to understand the complex dynamics that drive unexpected or undesired behaviors. Chances are you already have a significant IT platform investment as well as a variety of departmental systems, to ensure every meaningful piece of information is acquired about every support incidence or assigned task.", "Intelligent Process Mining unlocks more of that value by automatically Discovering process flows, providing sophisticated tools to Analyze process behaviors, helping you Optimize productivity, customer satisfaction, and quality of service. Then, Monitor process execution in near real-time to sustain peak performance.", "A Process Intelligence platform can help you improve every aspect of the RPA process \u2014 from end-to-end, regardless of the number of systems being used to store your data. Converting process data from any number of IT systems into actionable insight results in more accurate automation decisions, made faster and at lower cost. Intelligent Process Mining provides the confidence of making data-driven decisions that have sustainable impact on any aspect of service delivery. In short, utilizing Intelligent Process Mining technology, you can ensure that your processes are flowing at peak efficiency in less time at a lower cost.", "Your home for data science.
