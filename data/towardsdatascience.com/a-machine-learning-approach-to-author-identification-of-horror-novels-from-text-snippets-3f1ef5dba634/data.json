The novels are of several genres and cross genres (mixture of several genres). Horror is one particular genre of novels. There are many famous horror novels, which are absolute favourites of readers even after decades of their release. For example, the Goosebumps Series (1998\u20132016) by RL Stine has been a household name and one of the most celebrated horror novels of the modern times. But many classic horror novels appeared prior to the 21st Century. For instance, the horror novel, The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath (1943) by H.P. Lovecraft has been one of the must-read horror novels of the 20th Century. From here, if we rewind further to the 19th Century, how can anyone forget Mary Shelley\u2019s Frankenstein (1818 & 1823) and Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s The Fall of the House of Usher (1839) ? But one thing is quite obvious that,", "Every author, whether it is a Lovecraft or Mary Shelley or Poe, had their own style of writing which includes their signature fashion of using certain words, making their literature unique and recognisable", "So, let\u2019s use this fact to identify the author (Lovecraft/Mary Shelley/Poe) from text snippets or quotes drawn from their horror novels. Machine Learning powered by Natural Language Processing (NLP) is an excellent solution to the above problem. So, let\u2019s state the problem clearly and get started !!!", "Problem Statement: \u201cGiven Text Snippets/Quotes from renowned novels of Edgar Allan Poe, Mary Shelley and HP Lovecraft, identify that who is the author of the text snippet or quote\u201d", "For the purpose, Spooky Author Identification Dataset prepared by Kaggle is considered.", "So, let\u2019s commence the Machine Learning Model Development in Python using NLTK (Natural Language Took Kit) and Scikit-Learn !!!", "I. Loading (reading) the Dataset using Pandas:", "As this is a classification problem, here classes are the 3 authors as mentioned. But in the dataset, it can be seen that labels are non-numeric (MWS, EAP and HPL). These are label encoded to make them numeric, starting from 0 depicting each label in the alphabetic order i.e., (0 \u2192 EAP, 1 \u2192 HPL and 2 \u2192 MWS)", "As the Machine Learning Model is being developed, banking on the fact that the authors have their own unique styles of using particular words in the text, a visualization of the mostly-used words to the least-used words by the 3 authors is done, taking 3 text snippets each belonging to the 3 authors respectively with the help of a Word Cloud.", "Machine Learning Algorithms work only on numeric data. But here, data is present in the form of text only. For that, by some means, textual data needs to be transformed into numeric form. One such approach of doing this, is Feature Engineering. In this approach, numeric features are extracted or engineered from textual data. There are many Feature Engineering Techniques in existence. In this problem, Bag-of-Words Technique of Feature Engineering has been used.", "Here, a vocabulary of words present in the corpus is maintained. These words serve as features for each instance or document (here text snippet). Against each word as feature, its frequency in the current document (text snippet) is considered. Hence, in this way word features are engineered or extracted from the textual data or corpus.", "Multinomial Naive Bayes Algorithm (Classifier) has been used as the Classification Machine Learning Algorithm [1].", "According to the Performance Analysis, it can be concluded that the NLP Powered Machine Learning Model has been successful in effectively classifying 84.14% unknown (Validation Set) examples correctly. In other words, 84.14% of text-snippets are identified correctly that it belongs to which author among the three.", "Based on our Model Performance, can we conclude which author has the most unique style of writing?", "The answer is YES !!! Let\u2019s look at the Normalized Confusion Matrix. Here label 2 is the most correctly classified. As label 2 refers to Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, it can be concluded that", "Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley has the most unique style of writing Horror Novels w.r.t Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft.", "Also, in a different sense, can we say who is the most versatile author among Mary Shelley, Edgar Allan Poe and HP Lovecraft?", "Again the answer is YES !!! Again looking at the Confusion Matrix, label 0 is the least correctly classified. Label 0 refers to Edgar Allan Poe, so it can be concluded that", "Edgar Allan Poe is more versatile than HP Lovecraft and Mary Shelley.", "In this way, a Text Detection Model can be developed using Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.", "A relevant web-application using trained Bernoulli Naive Bayes (instead of Multinomial Naive Bayes) has also been developed and deployed in Heroku using Flask API.
