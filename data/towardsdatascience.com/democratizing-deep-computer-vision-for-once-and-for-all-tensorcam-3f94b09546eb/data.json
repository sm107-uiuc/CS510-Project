You will be able to push your deep learning models from Deep Learning Studio to TensorCam. Moreover, TensorCam will come with full software SDK.", "If you want to know more about DLS check this out:", "and this great article by Rajat:", "Here you can see how it works with Alexa:", "You can create a model for shelf inventory monitoring:", "A model that can start recording when your baby moves (yeah you can do that right now):", "Their deep learning chip with 2.4 Tera Operations Per Second (TOPS) it\u2019s also the highest of the market right now as you can see in this comparison:", "And don\u2019t get me wrong, DeepLens and the Google Vision Kit are awesome too, I actually have used the Google Vision Kit in the past, and the only part I wish it was easier back them was the programming and interface. I mean you have to have everything in a RaspberryPi to then create a model, train it and hope for the best that it will run there. Also although the camera was very good it didn\u2019t move.", "And that\u2019s a big difference with TensorCam because it comes with PTZ (pan\u2013tilt\u2013zoom) meaning that the camera is capable of remote directional and zoom control. Which is awesome and necessary for so many applications.", "You can get started by using the TensorCam sample projects, which cover some of the most popular computer vision use cases. As your skills and ideas develop, you can build custom deep learning models using Deep Learning Studio\u2019s cloud or desktop version. As a developer, here are some of the examples that you would be able to build and deploy on TensorCam with minimal or no-coding:", "If you want more ideas checkout these ones here:", "Here you can see a full video example of an Employee Tracking system (so you know who really shows up):", "Oh and you also have night vision if you are wondering:", "Now for the most important part, if you are amaze (you should), these guys needs our help to fund their project. This is the first time I see something like this in a KickStarter campaign so please make sure to enter the webpage and support the project:", "If you are unable to do it please tell your friends and company, you can get a big discount if you are able to make a pledge right now. A final words from the creators:", "We anticipate the on-time delivery for TensorCam in March 2019. We\u2019re wrapping up the product development phase for the main features, but we\u2019d still like to hear great ideas to implement from the Kickstarter backers, about some extra features which we can include (as long as it doesn\u2019t impact the delivery date). We\u2019ve found reliable manufacturing partners for the camera and AI-board, but even with the best manufacturing processes setup, unexpected hiccups can happen. Logistics issues are also being solved to ensure smooth delivery for when we\u2019ve exceeded our goal.", "Thanks for reading this.
