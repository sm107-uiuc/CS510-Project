I bet it did. Not many data scientist has expertise on the Titanic ship or Iris flowers, but they are perfectly okay working with those datasets.", "Data scientists often complain about 80% of their time being spent (wasted?)in data cleaning. While that\u2019s true, the time spent on data cleaning is not entirely wasted. Quite the opposite. The more time you spend with data, the more you know about it, the better analytical intuition you develop.", "The purpose of this post is \u2014 let\u2019s say you have an open mind, not knowing anything about a dataset, having no question in mind , just being a curious \u2014 how would you find out what interesting story and information a dataset will give away?", "As I wrote in a previous post, there are two possible starting points in data science \u2014 starting with a question or starting with data. In that post I talked about the life cycle of a project that starts with a question. In an ideal case, yes, a data scientist would ask a question first and then try to find an answer to that question using all the tools and techniques available at disposal. However, this is not always the case in reality. Occasionally you come across some data that you know nothing about. You ask no questions, you just want to find out what information they hold.", "In the following sections I will walk you through the process. For that purpose I downloaded a dataset from The World Bank microdata database to work with (more about it in a minute). I am going to use python jupyter notebook environment using three main libraries: pandas , seaborn and Scikit-Learn. But it doesn\u2019t matter which tools you use \u2014 R, excel, tableau, power BI, whatever \u2014 the thing that is important is what you do.", "Disclaimer: To be fair with the spirit of this writing, I choose a domain I had no prior knowledge in and chose a dataset that I had never seen prior to writing this post. Previously I worked with other kinds of World Bank datasets, but aid in Africa was never relevant to my work or interest.", "When you get an unknown dataset the first thing you do is ask a few basic questions to know the origin/lineage of the data: what is this data about? where is it coming from? who produced it and for what purpose? when was that collected and how? There might be associated documentation describing the dataset, definition of some key variables etc. where you will likely find these information", "The dataset I am using here is a time series data collected between 1990 and 1996 from aid-dependent countries in Africa. According to the documentation, the dataset was created in 2010 for the purpose of understanding whether donor aid given for one purpose ends up being used for another purpose.", "Next up: firing up your favorite data wrangling library, and for the first time taking a peak into your data. I don\u2019t know what other people do, but the very first thing I do after importing data is just calling the head() function and see what it looks like in its original condition. Then I will check (not necessarily in this order) what kind of columns are there, what are the data types, what is the data size, if there are missing values. Honestly, for me this is the most exciting part of working with data, especially with unknown data, as if I am discovering something new!", "Data cleaning indeed can take a lot of your time, especially if you know next to nothing about it. It took quite some time for me too, to clean up my dataset. Not to make this post too long, the whole process of data cleaning I have documented in a jupter notebook and uploaded in GitHub if you are interested.", "Now that your data is cleaned, you brought it into your environment for doing something. If you knew about exploratory data analysis (EDA), you already know what you could do with a dataset:", "You probably can extract hundreds of different pieces of information from a dataset. That\u2019s definitely one way to go about it. But I think the more interesting way to go about is by asking some questions that you might find interesting. That way your time would more efficiently utilized. Since my dataset is about aids to Africa, the first question I am interested in:", "Q. How many and which countries took aid?", "Now that we know how many and which countries received aid, next the obvious countries is:", "Q. Which countries received comparatively higher aid over the years?", "This is a panel dataset, meaning every country has a time series of its own for all variables. So the next question:", "Q. what is the overall temporal trend in aid during the study period?", "I could go on and on \u2026\u2026 asking similar kind of questions for each of the variables, but I\u2019ll stop here. I\u2019ll move on to a bit more interesting questions, some bi-variate analysis:", "Q. Is there a correlation between government expenditure and aid?", "This dataset isn\u2019t an end. I would supplement the findings from this dataset with other sources of data or literature to verify and support answers to my questions.", "Things I have done so far in the previous section is about getting your data ready for analysis and asking trivial questions to extract some interesting factoids. It doesn\u2019t end here, rather could very well be the beginning of something more interesting and useful. Below is one example of using the dataset to build a linear regression model to predict per capita GDP based on agricultural expenditure [caution: this model is for demo purpose only, I skipped a lot of intermediate steps].", "Storytelling and communicating what you have learnt from the data is the most underappreciated yet a fundamentally important part of doing data science. As a data scientist you need to be able to summarize the most interesting parts of the story and be able to communicate it to people who might be using them. This communication can take any form, from writing a blog post, creating Power Point slides, writing a report for company executives to publishing in scientific journals.", "Note: The jupyter notebook with further codes, notes and associated data is in the GitHub repo.", "Your home for data science.
