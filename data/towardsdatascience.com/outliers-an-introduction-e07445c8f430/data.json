This article will just be an introduction. I will try to dispel some myths, give some scope to the problem and cover some of the easier cases. I plan on writing more articles covering particular issues.", "There is no generally applicable quantitative definition of an outlier. Generally, an outlier is a surprising observation. However, what is surprising is partly due to substantive knowledge and the nature of the data. One way to try to make the definition a little bit objective is to say an outlier is a point that is \u201cfar\u201d from the main part of the data, but \u201cfar\u201d varies.", "One way of categorizing outliers is into data entry errors and others. Sometimes, it\u2019s clear that a data entry error has been made. Some values are impossible. There are no 5 meter tall humans. If you can identify this sort of outlier then you have two choices: Correct it or delete it. But, if the outlier is only on one variable for an observation, you may want to keep the other variables for that observation. For instance, suppose that 5 meter tall person had reasonable entries for age, sex, income and so on. You might want to keep those values.", "Do not neglect or underestimate the possibility of data entry errors. Data cleaning is important and can be time consuming.", "For the rest of this article, I will assume you have done the above", "What an outlier is and how to detect them depends on several things. One is the number of variables. You could have", "Detecting outliers gets harder as you go down that list and I will write more about that in later articles but, just as a sample, in a sample of the population of the USA, a 12 year old is not an outlier and a widow is not an outlier but a 12 year old widow is an outlier \u2014 not necessarily impossible, but certainly unlikely and unusual.", "What\u2019s unusual or surprising if you have an N of 10 is not so surprising with an N of 10,000,000. For instance, if you are measuring the heights of adult men, then, in a sample of 10 a guy who is 6'6\" (2 meters) is pretty surprising. In an N of 10,000,000 he isn\u2019t surprising at all. In fact, it would be surprising to not get at least one person that tall in that size sample.", "This is one reason that simple rules such as \u201cMore than 3 standard deviations from the mean is an outlier\u201d. Sometimes that 3 should be 1. Other times, it should be 5.", "Many variables are roughly normally distributed but by no means all of them are. For instance, income is not. Age is not. There are lots of other examples. The shape of the expected distribution affects what we regard as an outlier.", "This is another reason that the simple rules of thumb are not much good.", "Whenever you have more than one variable, all these \u201ctypes\u201d combine in ways that add enormously to the difficulty of detecting outliers. For a relatively simple case, look at the distribution of height and weight in adult men. Both variables are roughly normal (weight isn\u2019t that close). But they are highly correlated. A person could be an outlier on:", "And that\u2019s just with two variables, both of which are roughly normal.", "Detecting outliers (much less dealing with them) can\u2019t be automated very well (and this is one big problem with big data).", "Feel free to ask questions in the comments and I will either answer or incorporate the answer in a later article.", "Your home for data science.
