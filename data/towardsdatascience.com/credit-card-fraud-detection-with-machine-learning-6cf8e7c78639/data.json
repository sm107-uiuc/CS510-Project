Is there any way to predict whether a transaction is fraudulent or not based on the history of transactions? Let\u2019s explore a neural network architecture as it attempts to predict the cases as frauds or not. By the end of this article, we\u2019ll be able to build an encoder-decoder architecture from scratch using Keras and classify the transactions as fraudulent or non-fraudulent.", "We use a dataset credit card fraud detection by the ULB machine learning group. The dataset contains 28 anonymized variables, 1 \u201camount\u201d variable, 1 \u201ctime\u201d variable, and 1 target variable \u2014 Class. The variables are anonymized to protect the privacy of the customers as the dataset is in the public domain. The dataset can be found here. \u20180\u2019 as target variable corresponds to the non-fraudulent cases whereas \u20181\u2019 in target variable corresponds to fraudulent cases.", "After performing a minimalistic exploratory data analysis and measuring whether the dataset is skewed or not, we arrived at the following distribution result.", "As it is evident from the above figure, one of the biggest challenges we face is the skewness of datasets. The target class is highly unbalanced with only 0.17% data belonging to fraud transactions.", "For our use case and to make our life simpler, we\u2019ll take only about 1000 rows of non-fraudulent transactions. You can read how to counter skewed data points from here.", "To visualize our distribution of data, we use T-SNE. T-SNE or T -Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding is a data decomposition technique that reduces the data into specific dimensions and displays the top n dimensions with maximum information, a technique similar to Principal Component Analysis", "Every dot in the following figure represents a transaction. Non Fraud transactions are represented as Green while Fraud transactions are represented as Red. The components extracted by T-SNE are represented with the two axes as shown below.", "From the above figure, we can observe that many non-fraud transactions overlap with the fraud transactions in this spiral like shape and thus are difficult to classify using a decision boundary. We are going to use a Neural Network architecture known as Autoencoders to solve this problem.", "Autoencoders or Encoder-Decoder architecture are a special type of neural network in which we have the same number of attributes in the input and output layer i.e. an architecture which has the same number of neurons in input and output layer. Autoencoders use regression techniques under unsupervised learning to learn the low level/latent representations of input data. These low-level representations or the \u2018encoded\u2019 representation are deformed or \u2018decoded\u2019 back into original shape to project actual data. In other words, the network is expected to predict its actual input. Autoencoders contain a tight bottleneck of few neurons in the middle, from where the encoded representations can be obtained. Effectively, in an autoencoder, data is compressed into a low dimension code, from where it is decompressed back into the actual dimensions as of the input.", "We will create an autoencoder model in which we\u2019ll try to learn the latent representations of non-fraud cases. The same model will be used on fraud cases as well and we expect fraud data points to be diverse from non-fraud cases.", "Note that input and output dimensions are equal. The architecture tries to mimic the output from input. As we can see, there is a symmetry between encoding and decoding layers, which is the main idea behind the architecture.", "To avoid any data mismanagement, we apply data normalization and fit the data into our neural network.", "The beauty of this approach is that we do not need too many samples of data for learning the good representations.", "The idea of small sampling is based on the intuition that one class differs subsequently from another target class. We show our network a single class of data in order for our network to distinguish other classes distinctively.", "After training our model, we are interested in finding the hidden or encoded representations of the input. This can be obtained by the weights of the encoding layers. We create another sequential model containing just the encoding layers. We will only add the trained weights till the third layer where latent representation exists. This is to ensure that we are able to obtain the encoding of a specific case, whether fraud/non-fraud as output.", "We now aim to create a dataset using hidden representations obtained.", "\u2018rep_x\u2019 contains the encoded representation of the target class denoted by the corresponding \u2018rep_y\u2019 variable.", "Let\u2019s now try to visualize these encoded representations and if they are distinguished or not, now that we obtained the encoded representations.", "We can clearly observe that fraud and non-fraud transactions are distinguishable and in fact linearly separable to some extent. We can now even employ simpler linear models to predict the desired class.", "The choice of a simple linear classifier is an idea that can be fiddled with depending on the underlying algorithm, computational efficiency, and memory limitations.", "With this, we have successfully created an Encoder-Decoder architecture which can be proved to be effective with comparable accuracy on employing a suitable classifier. You can follow this GitHub repository for a complete walkthrough of code along with the output.", "So what are you waiting for? Go out and catch those bad guys. Be sure to have a lookout for good guys (false positives) too who may get falsely accused, as we all know \u201cwith great power comes great responsibility\u201d!", "Your home for data science.
