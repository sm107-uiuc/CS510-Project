The important thing is to make sure we don\u2019t make the same mistake twice. This is not possible if we don\u2019t even know we are making a mistake.", "In the sequel, I discuss three common mistakes regarding the use of data science tools and practices. These mistakes make your work inefficient and may cause unnecessary charges.", "A few years ago I joined a company and found out that they had paid $80K to IBM to build them an on-premises Hadoop cluster. What were they doing with it, you may ask? Once a month, it was processing a few thousand PDF files to extract some data out of them. That\u2019s it! This could have been done at the worst case in a few hours using a command-line tool, or a procedural programming language like Python, and it would have cost $0. There was absolutely no need for a Hadoop cluster for this task. Even if there was a need, given that it was being used only for one task in a month, the task should have been done using Big Data tools in the cloud, not an on-prem cluster that costs $80K!", "The idea behind Big Data is simple. If you have a task that cannot be done in the expected time by one computer, you should distribute the task between multiple computers, perform the sub-tasks in parallel, and aggregate the results of sub-tasks.The key element to decide whether you need to use Big Data tools (i.e. whether your data is actually \u201cbig\u201d) is how much time you have for processing your data. If you need to process 10 GB of data and the allowed execution time is 24 hours, then you don\u2019t need Big Data tools to perform this task. On the other hand, if you need to process 10 GB of data in 5 minutes (because for example you receive 10 GB of data every 5 minutes), you very likely need to use Big Data tools.So the size of your data isn\u2019t the deciding factor. The important factor is how much time you have for processing that data.", "The example I gave at the beginning of this section is not rare in non-tech companies. One of the main reasons that such decisions are made is that middle-management keep hearing these technology buzzwords (in conferences, demos, etc.) and after a while they are persuaded that every other company is using these technologies and they are being left behind. As a data scientist, you should evaluate the business needs, and help the middle-management to make the right decision regarding the use of Big Data solutions.", "The computational power of processors has been increasing exponentially since the invention of transistors. In the first decade of the 21st century, this computational power reached a level that made it possible to implement algorithms that were previously computationally infeasible. This resulted in a new era of Artificial Intelligence, where Machine Learning (ML) became the new technology buzzword. While this \u201crevolution\u201d has been a great breakthrough and has made it possible to provide solutions that were previously not possible or efficient, it doesn\u2019t mean that ML-based solutions are the best option in every scenario.", "For specific problems such as image classification, speech recognition and text translation, a Machine Learning solution is our best option, because there is no exact solution for these problems. But if we consider all the technological challenges that a company may face, most of them actually should be solved using non-ML solutions.", "Let\u2019s say you work at Company C, who produces large quantities of some products, and you are tasked with reducing the cost of shipping between warehouses and retail stores. Since there are multiple sources and multiple destinations, you basically want to answer the question \u201cwhat/how much/where to produce and what/how much/where to ship to, so that the total cost of production/shipping/warehousing is minimized, meeting all the demand\u201d. This is actually a well-studied problem, and there are exact solutions for it using Linear Programming. Using ML-based solutions here would give you sub-optimal answers.", "As another example, let\u2019s say you are tasked with providing the best set of products that should be sold at any new store that Company C wants to sell its products (the shelf space is limited, so a subset of Company C products needs to be selected to be sold in each store). You may quickly think of building a model to find the relationship between the demographics of a store\u2019s neighborhood and the sales of each product of Company C in that store. And then for a new store, based on the demographics of that store\u2019s neighborhood, your model would suggest a set of products that would sell well. While you can make fairly reasonable suggestions this way, there is a more accurate and straightforward solution for this task. Let\u2019s assume s is a new store and you need to provide a set of products for it. If for each product p of Company C, you calculate the average sales of p in the neighboring stores to s (for example in 1KM radius), this gives you a good estimate of how good that product is selling in that neighborhood. Then you just need to pick the top n products.This way you likely would have a more accurate answer, compared to the ML-based solution mentioned above. Note that in this approach, we are indirectly capturing the demographics, because we are calculating the average sales of the stores in the neighborhood of s, and these stores have more or less the same demographics as s.", "As a data scientist, your task is to use the data to come up with solutions for business problems. In this effort, ML solutions should be regarded only as the last resort. The reason is that ML solutions are approximations. We use approximation when no exact solution exists.", "On Stack Overflow I often see posts like \u201cHow to do X with Python?\u201d where in many cases X isn\u2019t something that should be done with Python. Don\u2019t get me wrong; Python is a great programming language and I love it (based on StackOverflow data, currently Python together with JavaScript are the most popular programming languages). But it doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s the best tool for every task. Here, I provide three examples of misuse of Python, but of course, the cases are not limited to these.", "The fact that I can accomplish a task using X, doesn\u2019t mean I should do it using X, because there may be a tool Y which can perform the task better. To work efficiently, we need to use the right tool for each task. This requires broadening our skill set and knowledge so we have more than one option for the tasks at hand.", "Your home for data science.
