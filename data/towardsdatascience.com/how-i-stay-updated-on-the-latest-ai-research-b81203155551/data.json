Every day another application is disrupted by cutting-edge machine learning research. Trying to keep up with the endless stream of new technologies is heart-breaking. If you fancy trying to cope with it, here I present you with what are my top 5 resources for AI-related news and knowledge.", "The deeplearning.ai weekly newsletter. Each week, it packs recent break-throughs and noteworthy news alongside a short intro by Andrew Ng himself. The best thing about The Batch is that it is quick, self-contained, and always includes some perspective on the news, such as \u201cwhy it matters.\u201d", "This is the best place to start, as it is not overwhelming, is self-contained, and is not focused on any particular sub-topic.", "Yeah, this place is incredible. Make sure you check AI and Data Science as topics of interest and start following people and publications that have similar interests as you. Most of what I see on The Batch I also see here but in more detail. Sometimes I find stuff here before it even gets to The Batch.", "The distinctive feature of Medium are the voices. You often see people that work at major companies, startup CEOs, or Ph.D. students of top universities. The tech stuff is more often than not being written by people that are actually in tech. They are not written by trained journalists but by real damn nerds. The cherry goes to the comment section. You are not only reading from these folks, but you also get the chance to talk to them directly and ask anything.", "Find the people whose work you like and follow them on Twitter. This is enough for the platform to email you their most important tweets. I was surprised by the number of useful links I started receiving after I started doing this. If you don\u2019t know where to start, begin by following the guests of #5.", "Twitter is where the news is born. After I created my account and started following AI people, I began to see stories that would only pop up on larger channels after weeks. Before anyone can write a piece on something, its author has already twitted about it. I don\u2019t use twitter for anything else.", "Similar to Medium, YouTube has many tech people doing essays on AI. The bad thing about YouTube is that it doesn\u2019t have as much curation nor a helpful email digest. The positive side is that it is less demanding on you. Watching a video is way more relaxing to the eyes than reading articles.", "My recommendations are TwoMinutesPapers and Yannic Kilcher. The former focuses on presenting eye-pleasing research on AI and graphics, and the latter is more in-deep on analyzing AI papers down to the math. I confess that I don\u2019t really like Yannic\u2019s videos that much, as they are too long, but I love his selection. Whenever he uploads something, I search for the paper to read.", "Lex Fridman is a former MIT professor that runs a podcast on AI and Computer Science. The selection of guests is outstanding. It includes Turing Award winners, Nobel winners, and many brilliant individuals, such as 3Blue1Brown\u2019s host Grant Sanderson and Elon Musk. To me, the beauty of this podcast is that Lex always asks his guests to explain fundamental concepts, but the conversation never shies away from going technical.", "This is the place to get perspective. Where else can you find Noam Chomsky and Daniel Kahneman discussing AI\u2019s future? Or maybe the lead engineer behind TensorFlow discussing its history in-depth and not being shy of talking technical? Reading papers is nice, but hearing what the people behind some of the most ground-breaking research to date have to say helps a lot with understanding what is happening now and what will likely happen next.", "Disclaimer: the Podcast recently changed name from AI Podcast to Led Fridman Podcast, as Lex has been interviewing more and more guests from other fields, such as philosophy, neuroscience and etc.", "Here I feature additional resources mentioned by other users on the comments section. Please let me know if you would like to add to this list.", "Davide Giordano suggested AI Trends, MIT Technology Review, and Papers with code. This last one has a newsletter which I was unaware off. Just signed in myself.", "Marc von Wyl recommended the TWiML podcast and the Twitter profiles @omarsar0, and @seb_ruder, gold mines for NLP news.", "Gaurav Ragtah added CatalyzeX, a curator/search engine for AI models and ML repositories. Browser plugins are available for Chrome and Firefox.", "Unmesh Kurup highlighted the Data Science Weekly and Data Elixir newsletters, two other sources of curated news for practitioners.", "A huge thanks to everyone\u2019s suggestions and permission to add them here in this bonus section.", "The Batch has the general news, Medium features all voices, Twitter has the latest things, and YouTube shows you the shiniest results. On top of that, hearing the podcast helps to put it all together by giving you some perspectives from significant figures in the field.", "The real magic happens when you start to consume these sources regularly. Over time, you will realize that some of the news you saw in one place are popping up on the other, but in different amounts of detail. This dramatically helps to get a deeper level of understanding as you are exposed to the same ideas over and over in various degrees of depth. You start to draw connections.", "Feel free to comment or connect with me. If you are new to Medium, I highly recommend subscribing.
