From choosing the milk-can in the grocery store to choosing the next best career step, while on one hand the \u2018what\u2019 is important for the decision-maker, on other hand, companies continue to seek \u2018why\u2019 behind it. Every retail or manufacturing company, as well as service-providing organization, is curious to know how are their customers \u2018making choices?\u2019", "These long list of questions are exciting to explore and so are consumer models. Overall there are 3 types of consumer models:", "This article sheds a light on \u2018consumer choice models\u2019. Choice models seek to find the answer to \u2014 how a customer chooses the final product i.e. how does a customer ranks items in a given set based on some latent scale such as \u2018utility\u2019 which is the \u2018perceived value\u2019 of every item as seen by that customer. So for example, given a set of 4 items, let\u2019s say \u2014 shampoo \u2014 consumer tend to evaluate the utility of each option and rank them based on individual preferences. Factors such as \u2014 price, being sulfur-free or not, fragrance, brand\u2019s goodwill, public review, personal experience \u2014 play major roles. As evident, this \u2018utility\u2019 can vary from one individual to another drastically. And again, among consumers, it can further depend on factors like \u2014 age, gender, location, profession, income, and sometimes, something as complex as personality.", "These challenging questions make \u2018consumer choice modeling\u2019 even more interesting. As much as it is exciting to seek answers to these questions, it is equally, if not more, important to find it for providing customers with better choices. In the end, a consumer wants the best product and a company wants to sell the most!", "And Goal is simple \u2014 to make more of what will sell more!", "Hence, Choice modeling enables data scientists to leverage the vast amounts of consumer data of purchase transactions, surveys, and product reviews to find out models that describe, prescribe, and predict consumer choice-making behavior enabling businesses to create better strategies. With the advent of advanced applications of Artificial Intelligence, many new ideas have emerged. For example, studying consumers\u2019 changing facial expressions while scanning a shelf, analyzing consumers\u2019 body language while finding a product of interest, or making sense out of consumers\u2019 overall excitement while shopping which provides deeper insights and hence, deeper knowledge to work towards improving consumer experiences.", "As the Wikipedia definition goes as well, Choice modeling attempts to model the decision process of an individual or segment via revealed preferences or stated preferences made in a particular context or contexts.", "Now, the next interesting question that comes to mind is \u2014 how to define these customers? \u2014 one group as a whole? in a certain number of segments (and if yes, then how many)? or each customer separately on the individual level?", "After all, every human being is different, and so are diverse their preferences. The answer lies in the trade-off between the granularity of results with high complexity or generalization of results with more simplicity. Its nothing but the old-school \u2018bias-variance\u2019 trade-off as they call in the language of Machine Learning. One can make this decision based on the end-goal, business knowledge, and size and characteristics of the available data.", "1) Collective choice models: It assumes that every customer will rank certain items in the same order \u2014 eg. When an FMCG company creates a new product \u2014 usually it is based on the presumed collective consumer preferences", "2) Segment-based choice models: Once found an optimal number of segments given the business, business problem and end goal, it divides entire consumer base into those segments and assumes that each customer in the same segment will rank items in the set in the same order while those in different segments will rank items such that at least one ranking will differ. Eg. \u2014 When different offers, discounts, and products are offered to customers grouped on various criteria such as loyalty, frequency, recency, location, gender, etc.", "3) Individual Choice Models: It assumes that each customer will rank items differently. Although, even if only limited permutations of ranking are possible, each individual is evaluated and treated separately taking into account individual preferences and personalities on a more granular level \u2014 eg. Recommendation systems on e-commerce websites", "Let me share my recent experience with creating consumer preference models!", "As part of the capstone project at Columbia University, I got a chance to work on creating a consumer preference model for a top car manufacturing company in North America with 4 amazing teammates. In this article, I share, top 5 tips, that I learned, for every data scientist out there, to build a successful collective consumer preference model based on this project.", "Production in many companies happen not based on orders, rather in bulk at once \u2014 hence, just like any business, they too were inquisitive to know their customer preferences. We, hence, set out to create collective consumer preference models \u2014 to know which car features do consumers prefer!", "So, here are the top 5 lessons that we discovered while working on that project and would love to share with everyone:", "1) Choices affect the Choice Models \u2014 The very first question that the data scientist should ask herself/himself, \u2018what is the consumer buying-decision making journey?\u2019 Unclear right? Think in this way \u2014 how your buying of milk-can differ from buying a laptop? The consumer is involved in both cases. Choices are made in both cases. A variety of options, possibly a similar number of options, are available in both cases. So how are the two decision-making and purchase-behavior different? \u2014 The difference lies in the answer to the question \u2014 how and through what psychological decisions \u2014 consumer makes the final decisions? While milk-can options are dependent on the store\u2019s stock and the consumer usually chooses any one option out of all those placed in the shelf, laptop purchases include days of research, brainstorming, and rather visiting only that store which is expected to have desired option. Further, certain choices are dependent on the store stock, however, certain other choices of features such as brand, RAM, price, etc in the chosen alternative are more dependent on consumers \u2018pre-set\u2019 preferences than the stock itself. Choice models have this assumption that consumers see all the options present together at a particular time and make decisions based on their utility ranking. Thus, depending on the business setting, one might need to alter the choice models, create complex constraints, hypothesize complex functions to make a good model. Reading more on the theory of choice models, assumptions behind each method of solving them and also strengthening one\u2019s probability and statistics game, for example, this is a good compilation, can lead to great insights and better modeling.", "2) Variable reduction v/s information loss \u2014 This trade-off is one of the most important decisions that a data scientist needs to make while solving a business problem. Imagine your dataset has colors of cars and there are 100+ kinds of unique colors. What is the first thought, that will come to your mind as a data scientist? Let\u2019s reduce these color categories because, after one-hot encoding, it will lead to 100 columns!!!", "We, data scientists, have this temptation to reduce variables as much as possible because our goal is to make a robust model. This is still a good strategy to start with fewer variables. So to deal with this issue of so many variables, this is how our journey looked like:", "Our first idea was to group colors together based on RGB scores but! wait a minute!\u2026 Do consumers perceive black, dark blue, and dark green cars as similar color cars while buying a car? No! They perceive it quite differently! So although \u2018mathematically\u2019 it sounds most logical argument to group colors based on RGB codes, it removes the essence of \u2018how car colors are perceived by customers\u2019.", "Caution: Incorrect grouping is worse than no grouping (i.e. no variable reduction)!", "This variable reduction would, hence, have led to the loss of information which we are somewhere seeking our model to capture and then want it to learn to make a good prediction!", "Our next idea was to group colors based on popularity \u2014 Initially, we thought grouping based on frequency would be the best choice because grouping together all those colors which are occurring in extremely low frequencies will reduce data without much \u2018information\u2019 loss. And anyway, we are removing the texture of colors because \u2018data scientists love variable reduction, by hook or by crook!\u2019 But, information loss was happening here as well! A black \u2018matte\u2019 and a black \u2018metallic\u2019 are perceived as totally different!", "Making life easier by removing this kind of granularity made no sense and hence, results were achieved by keeping colors as they were!", "3) Choosing the right target variable \u2014 The target variable is the dependent variable that is to be first modeled and then predicted. And sometimes this target cannot be explicit, rather it has to be either created or decided on the basis of business acumen depending on the end goal that is to be solved. The target variable in choice models is usually the binary variable if a customer picked a particular choice or not and then it is modeled either using Machine Learning or Maximum likelihood Estimation. Most importantly, it has to be ensured that the dataset follows the underlying assumptions behind the choice model. In our class, for example, cars are sold out sequentially in a particular dealership and we had daily level data of how many cars are sold. Applying this straightforward choice model would force the model to \u2018assume\u2019 that each customer on a particular day, saw all the options, which in reality is not true. In fact, in reality, the \u2018most consumer-preferred option\u2019 is getting sold out at first, which our model would learn as being rejected. So we, in the end, used \u2018stock-time of the car in the dealership\u2019 as the target variable, as it indicates the \u2018popularity\u2019 of the car \u2014 the longer the car stays, the lesser popular it is and the sooner it gets sold out, the more popular it is. Next to it, while applying regression on this newly created target variable, the model didn\u2019t perform well. Wasn\u2019t it intuitive as well? With a small dataset of 1000k x k dimensions, does it make sense for the model to predict accurately if a car will get sold in 35 days or 36 days? More than sense, most importantly, is it even needed for our business problem to be solved? And hence, we converted this variable into a binary variable where the cut or the \u2018popularity stock-time threshold\u2019 was chosen based on the dealership i.e. the market segment it was serving. This XGBoost model outperformed all the models giving an average AUC of 80%.", "4) Consumer market/segment \u2014 Collective choice models, although simple, deal with the issue of generalizing too much to lose the important information about\u2014 varying customer behaviors. Even if your client or business problems ask to create a collective consumer preference model \u2014 a data scientist should always ask oneself \u2014 Can I incorporate these varying customer behavior in prediction? We had this option of creating a separate model for each car dealership, which is usually more than 50 miles apart. Its always a good idea, to make a collective as well as separate market/area wise models and compare them if the average AUC improves for the latter or not. The downside of the latter is the \u2018reduced size of data\u2019. And hence, this trade-off has to be carefully analyzed keeping in mind the business problem we are solving!", "5) Real-world Implementation \u2014 What happens when we create a successful model? \u2014 We hand it over to the client? \u2014 Right? \u2014 Here\u2019s how it went: In one call, we told the team that we have successfully made the model with xx accuracy! There was some appreciation but expected excitement was lacking which makes sense? The people who use the model in the end, usually, aren\u2019t expected to be proficient with machine learning? \u2014 Can they transform the new inputs into the desired format and then call the predict function successfully? No, right? It could be challenging! and Hence, I learned that a data science project, especially one that solves the business problems isn\u2019t complete without a user interface, even if a basic one built inside the Jupyter notebook itself. It is a must for them to be able to implement the model in the real world. In the next call, when we showed them a very basic UI where they can insert all the inputs\u2014 they were amazed! The model was the same, it was just the comfort and convenience that UI added, which made all the difference!", "Hoping you enjoyed reading the article, do share your valuable feedback!"],
