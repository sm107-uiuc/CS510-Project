However, some languages die before their natural life-span because of some dominant languages. When the dominant languages become more common in the world, local languages with fewer speakers become extinct. For example, you are reading this article in the most common language of modern times, although it is not my mother tongue!", "The first sign of a language becoming extinct is kids speaking their parents\u2019 language only at home. They use the dominant language in all their social, educational, and professional lives.", "After one or two generations, this language is spoken by only the old people. If kids speak a language only with their grandparents, this language is in danger of becoming extinct.", "A dead language is one that is not the native language of any community. Latin is a dead language. There are people who know Latin, but there is not a nation or community whose native language is Latin.", "An extinct language is a language that no longer has any speakers. Even if there is no one speaking an extinct language, there are books, papers, and monuments in that language that we know how to read and learn from. Currently, there are 573 known extinct languages.", "A lost language is an extinct language that we know it existed but we don\u2019t know how to read. Most of the extinct languages are lost languages.", "Language researcher David Graddol estimates that 90 percent of currently spoken languages will have become extinct by 2050. When a language is lost, the entire culture is also lost with the language. There are at least 12 lost languages waiting to be encoded but none of these languages are as lucky as the Ancient Egyptian language. They don\u2019t have a Rosetta stone!", "Because encoding a language is a time-consuming process, decades of human effort is spent discovering the languages and civilizations behind these languages. Most of the ancient scripts don\u2019t have whitespace and/or punctuation. It may take a lifetime for a linguist to figure out a language from these ancient scripts. Can natural language processing (NLP) methods be helpful in bringing some speed and accuracy to encoding extinct languages?", "Enrico Santus, Jiaming Luo, Frederik Hartmann, Yuan Cao, Regina Barzilay from MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) developed a new algorithm to decipher the lost languages from scripts.", "Machine learning algorithms can successfully decipher lost languages by relating them to living languages. The decipherment process is made easy by identifying the closest living language. For example, Ugaritic language was solved with the help of Hebrew, because it was known that they come from the same language family. This known as \u201ccognate-based decipherment.\u201d", "What do scientists do if the language family of the lost language is unidentified? For example, there is no consensus about Iberian\u2019s close known language. It can be Greek, Latin, or Basque. The existing algorithms don\u2019t work properly in deciphering Iberian.", "The model developed by CSAIL team can solve this problem. Because their model is provided with under segmented words in the lost language and the vocabulary in a known language. The lost language in the scripts is not assumed to be similar to any modern language. Instead, the model tries to match spans in the lost texts with known tokens.", "The model was designed to work in languages like Iberian. However, Gothic and Ugaritic were used in the experimental setup because of the lack of ground truth. The model was applied to deciphered languages to be able to check the model performance.", "The model does not assume any similarity between languages. It surprisingly finds a measure of relationship and identifies the closest language similar to the lost language itself.", "Regine Barzilay and her team hope to expand their work to finding the meanings of the words from the context even if they don\u2019t know how to read them.", "This model suggests a decipherment model to extract related words from non-seperated texts without an assumption of similarity between lost and known languages. The results on Gothic, Ugaritic, and Iberian shows that the model can effectively handle undersegmented texts even the lost language is not related to any known language.", "When lost languages are encrypted , lost civilizations are also discovered!", "Your home for data science.
