In this piece, Aileen Nielsen looks at how government agencies and academics use state-of-the-art modeling for the flu.", "The CDC actively encourages researchers to work on forecasting the flu, even sponsoring an R package to make its data readily available. For more than five years, the CDC has also sponsored flu forecasting competitions, although it was only for the 2017\u20132018 flu season that it actually incorporated a flu forecast into its official communications and bulletins. The Delphi research group from Carnegie Mellon has won the majority of competitions so far, and the group forecasts the flu with what they describe as three distinct efforts:", "An Empirical Bayes approach that applies past flu season data with a series of manipulations to form priors for the current season\u2019s data based on the overall \u201cshapes\u201d of the time series from past flu seasons", "A crowdsourcing platform where anyone is welcome to submit a prediction of flu rates", "A nowcasting method that uses sensor fusion, aggregating data from many sources, such as Wikipedia access counts and relevant Twitter queries, to produce geographically localized flu predictions", "This is the set of diverse approaches used in just one academic research group! If we look further afield into academia, we see even more diversity:", "Using deep convolutional networks (CNNs) to classify Instagram pictures and use the outputs of these CNNS along with text-related features from Twitter as inputs into a variety of machine learning models, including XGBoost trees. One such paper had the advantage of focusing on a small linguistic community (Finnish speakers), which enabled the use of mainstream social media platforms in a way that could still be regionally specific.", "Identifying reliable users within larger social media clusterings. One paper focuses on improving flu predictions by finding the users best placed and most trustworthy on social media platforms.", "Accessing electronic health records to have a more complete and complementary data source in addition to publicly available data. One paper showed that extremely large gains in forecast accuracy at a number of timescales could be obtained via the integration of electronic health records into forecasting input streams. Unfortunately, this is difficult to arrange and suggests that accurate flu forecasting abilities will go to wealthy data holders rather than to the most creative researchers (although, of course, sometimes these can be one and the same).", "As we can see from the diversity of approaches to this problem, there are many routes to make a flu forecast, and none is the definitive winner just yet. This continues to be an area of active research and development, even as some of the better strategies have been applied to governmental uses and public information.", "Our discussion here is only the tip of the iceberg. There is a lot of biology, sociology, medicine, and economic policy that goes into determining the course of a flu season, and there are a variety of models that are less oriented toward time series analysis and more oriented toward other aspects of the flu behavior. Time series brings one rich perspective to a very complicated topic.", "Join the O\u2019Reilly online learning platform.

Her interests range from defensive software engineering to UX designs for reducing cognitive load to the interplay between law and technology. Aileen is currently working at an early-stage NYC startup that has something to do with time series data and neural networks. She also serves as chair of the New York City Bar Association\u2019s Science and Law committee, which focuses on how the latest developments in science and computing should be regulated and how such developments should inform existing legal practices. In the recent past, Aileen worked at mobile health platform One Drop and on Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign.
