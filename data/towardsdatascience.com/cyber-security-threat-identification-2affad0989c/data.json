The vulnerability was so damaging that a security researcher revealed to Motherboard:", "\u201cAll you had to do was put in a search term and get millions of results, just instantly \u2014 in cleartext, through a web app.\u201d", "The intent here is not to single out Equifax \u2014 in the USA alone, cybercrime has cost the economy between $57 billion and $109 billion in 2016.", "The good news is that as many as 85% of targeted cyberattacks are preventable. However, the challenge lies herein: There are more than 150,000 known Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), but only 5.5% are ever exploited in the wild.", "It is logistically impossible to patch every single vulnerability, so how can we strategically target critical cases? If there are tens of thousands of CVEs, how do we identify ones that are actively exploited?", "In this post I will show how data science can be leveraged to identify critical vulnerabilities in an efficient and targeted manner. This will allow for organizations to mitigate their cyber risk and allocate resources to mending critical weaknesses while avoiding unnecessary patches.", "First, I will show how to collect data from disparate sources, and how to transform it into an ingestible format. Next, I will lay out the evaluation metrics, what they mean in terms of cybersecurity, and build a classification pipeline.", "For implementation, check out the GitHub repository.", "To build a model, we need data that reliably map features to a CVE and determine if it was exploited \u201cin the wild\u201d. Cybersecurity data is not easily accessible: those who have it might be wary of sharing it with malicious actors.", "To make matters more complicated, our findings are limited by the visible surface of the web that we can scan. Nevertheless, there are some public resources that can be leveraged to form a comprehensive dataset. This section presents publicly available sources used in this project.", "The National Vulnerability Database (NVD) is a US government repository of common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVE). NVD also provides a Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) that evaluates the severity of the vulnerability.", "With over 150,000 entries, the NVD is an authoritative source of cyber activity. Each vulnerability is assigned a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE), a naming format that allows the easy sharing of information.", "Take for example CVE-2019\u201312518 shown in the screenshot below. Each CVE will contain a description of the weakness, the CVSS score, and a summary of the attack vector. The information from NVD is used to build a repository of known CVEs, the corresponding attack vectors, and the text description.", "Exploit-db is a database maintained by Offensive Security. It lists if an exploit is verified and if it has an application. In addition, it gives the platform, type of attack, and the code snippet that supposedly executes the software hack.", "Exploit-db is also CVE compliant, meaning that one can map it to NVD for a more holistic information set. Exploit-db also has papers which provide a proof of concept for a hack. We opted to exclude theoretical papers from our data and limit the scope of this project.", "For example, we can find the same CVE-2019\u201312518 as EDB 48092 shown in the screenshot below. For this particular CVE, we know that it is verified, has a downloadable exploit, is remote, and affects Windows. Data from Exploit-db is used to augment the NVD database.", "Also known as CISA, it is a US government agency and can be thought of as the nation\u2019s risk advisor. CISA protects critical government infrastructure against compromising cyberattacks. As a result, it often releases alerts and advisories about ongoing CVE exploits and potential remediation. CISA takes on a variety of roles and was recently in the spotlight for its campaign to combat erroneous rumors about voter fraud.", "The screenshot below illustrates an advisory for CVE-2020\u20130688, where CISA calls on those potentially impacted to patch the weakness. Advisories like the one below are used to make a collection of exploited CVEs.", "Symantec keeps track of attempts to exploit a known operating system or application vulnerability. When an intrusion is detected, an attack signature is logged along with a description of the attack. The descriptions of each attack signature can be examined for mentions of a CVE.", "The screenshot below pertains to CVE-2019\u201312518 from before, and an attempt to exploit it has been flagged by Symantec. Information from this source is used to expand the list of exploited CVEs.", "We may not know all of the exploited CVEs. The validity of the target variable is dictated by the depth and rigor of search for data sources. There may be CVEs that we label as not exploited that are being exploited in the wild.", "In addition, a CVE might be actively exploited in the wild but of no concern to you if it lies outside your orbit. For example, if you don\u2019t use Adobe Flash Player then CVE-2018\u20134878 should be of no concern to you. On the other hand if your application is data driven, any CVE that involves a SQL injection should be on your radar.", "To better visualize the problem, the Venn diagram below gives a global snapshot. Note how not all verified exploits have a CVE identifier and an exploit can be verified but not used in the wild.", "We begin with the assertion that the CVSS score was designed as a measurement of severity and not of risk. The CVSS V3 successor to V2 was designed to better reflect this intent. To put things in perspective, consider a car accident and an earthquake. Every time you get in a car, it comes with a risk for a car accident. The severity of the accident can vary from negligible to loss of life. On the other hand, an earthquake is a very rare event. However, the severity of the earthquake can be exponentially higher than a car accident.", "Exploring the NVD reveals that many attack vectors have descriptive words such as none, low, or high. For example, one component of the attack vector is the level of privilege (PR in the vector string) and varies from none to high, based on the diagram below. When ingesting data from NVD, such categorical features are transformed into numbers on a sliding scale.", "The descriptive text for a given CVE is expected to be rather formal and free of grammatical errors based on a perusal of the data entries. Note that some entries explicitly call for the CVE to be rejected and will therefore not be used for model training and classification. Moreover, because individual words bring little context, a TFIDF vectorization with unigrams to trigrams tends to deliver better ML results.", "For ExploitDB we make use of one hot encoding for the type and the platform. This potentially adds a lot of features to be inputted, however it ensures that the machine learning algorithm does not assume that higher numbers are more important.", "The data is heavily imbalanced, such that only 1% CVEs are exploited in the wild. That 1% is far off from the 5% reported in scientific literature, however, we are constrained by the information available to us.", "This section presents the metrics for selecting a winning model, what they mean algebraically, and their interpretation in the context of cybersecurity.", "I assume that the reader is familiar with the notion of a confusion matrix and its components. I will begin with precision and recall.", "Precision determines how many selected items are relevant:", "If we want better precision we need to have as few false positives as possible. Therefore, an efficient model will have high precision, and allocates time and resources only to vulnerabilities that require patching.", "Recall is defined by the following formula:", "Recall poses the question: How many relevant items are selected? A perfect recall score of 1.0 implies no false negatives were selected, therefore our model has perfect coverage. In the context of this project, the recall determines how many vulnerabilities that should be remediated have been flagged.", "Looking at these two metrics individually is insufficient since, for example, we can achieve perfect recall by flagging all the CVEs in the dataset as exploited in the wild.", "Therefore, the F1 score offers a better evaluation metric:", "Moreover, the ROC score is another useful metric for imbalanced datasets. A high AUC score signifies a high true positivity rate and a low false positive rate.", "The question here is what to prioritize? An organization with limited resources might want to prioritize efficiency \u2014 A more precise model is the clear favorite. A large firm with sufficient time and resources will prefer the conservative approach and cover all their bases \u2014A high recall is preferable. The general F1 score uses a positive real factor \u03b2, where \u03b2 is chosen such that recall is considered \u03b2 times as important as precision. For the purpose of this study \u03b2 is taken as 1.0.", "An evaluation metric beyond the scope of this project, yet worth mentioning, is the economic and intangible impact of a vulnerability. Consider a hypothetical CVE that affects a digital wallet (e.g. Apple Pay) and reveals linked credit cards. It\u2019s easy to make the case for prioritizing this CVE because we can quantify the loss in dollar terms.", "Conversely, consider another CVE that gives the attacker remote access to your entire iPhone, over WiFi, and you won\u2019t even know about it. How do we measure the privacy impact of this exploit? More importantly, how do we bake these measures of urgency and importance into our classifiers?", "The flow chart below summarizes the previous sections and where we want to take this project. For vectorizing the text data, I opted for a simple TF-IDF vectorization, and for the ML model I found XGBoost to have the best overall performance.", "On the topic of parameters, I wanted to find out how optimizing for precision, recall, F1, or AUC would yield different hyperparameters. These parameters are:", "The table below shows how the cross validation grid search selected parameters based on the preferred scoring strategy. Notice how recall, which translates into better coverage, is averse to overfitting.", "Visually, we can see different PRC and ROC curves in the two plots below. Overall gains in AUC scores are negligible, however, Precision/Recall vary significantly.", "How reliable are the ML models though? One easy way to find out is by bootstrapping the data. Using the ML model optimized for F1 score, i.e. balanced recall and precision, we get the histogram below. 95% of the time, the precision will be in the range of (0.149, 0.234), for recall it is (0.333, 0.55), and for F1 it is (0.180, 0.337).", "The benefit of the above graph is that it could be used to validate hypotheses for improving the ML pipeline. For example, say I declare that TorchText will deliver superior results. To back up my claim, I need to test my hypothesis and show that TorchText is significantly better.", "It\u2019s crucial to state that the findings here might be challenged in the future as new data becomes available. This project also omits existing defense mechanisms organizations might have, and only takes a bird\u2019s eye view of things. To put it plainly: your mileage may vary based on how secure your defenses are and on the jackpot in your safe.", "Furthermore, this project does not take into account the effect of time. Indeed, some CVEs might already have an existing patch, which may or may not have been implemented. It is also possible that with more sophisticated tools and higher computing power, previous innocuous CVEs can wreak havoc on an organization.", "With a rather simple workflow, critical vulnerabilities can be identified with a relatively high performance. This means that as new CVEs are released on NVD, a ML model can be used to evaluate if they are likely to be exploited in the wild.", "The inspiration for this project was from the conference paper Improving Vulnerability Remediation Through Better Exploit Prediction by Jacob et al.
