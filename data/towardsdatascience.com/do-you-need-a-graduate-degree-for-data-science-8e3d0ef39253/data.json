In some ways, it\u2019s the ultimate humble brag. Graduate with a PhD, and you\u2019re one nerd among ten thousand. But drop out 2.5 years into it, and you\u2019re an edgy nerd. People will wonder what other edgy shit you might to do next. \u201cElon Musk dropped out of grad school,\u201d they\u2019ll say. \u201cThis guy could be just like Elon!\u201d", "As much good as dropping out of grad school has done for my reputation as an unpredictable, 4-D chess playing, closet nerd genius, it\u2019s become clear to me that two of the key ingredients to becoming a PhD dropout aren\u2019t for everyone: 1) starting a PhD, and 2) dropping out of a PhD. And the same goes for a Master\u2019s. This is true for the average aspiring STEM professional, but it\u2019s even more true for aspiring data scientists. And I\u2019ll get to the reason why in a second.", "But first, you might be wondering how I know this.", "Well here\u2019s the thing: I work at a data science mentorship startup. And through that work I\u2019ve probably interviewed over a thousand aspiring data scientists \u2014 some with PhDs, some with Master\u2019s degrees, some with undergrads, and some who dropped out at every stage in between. And that\u2019s left me with a rare and precious thing: a statistically significant sample of data science career stories.", "And here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from those stories: there\u2019s a time, a place, and a person for whom different degrees make sense. But because most people turn to university and college graduate advisors to decide whether or not to do grad school, they tend not to get a complete picture of what\u2019s what before they sign up.", "So take it from a former academic-turned-startup-founder: not all degrees are for everyone. Here\u2019s why.", "\u201cI\u2019ve seen that a PhD is required for a lot of data science jobs. Do I need a PhD to become a data scientist?\u201d", "Oh my god no. Not a thing.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, going through life with those three extra letters in your email sign-off is a definite plus. I sometimes wish I\u2019d stuck around for that reason alone. But then reality sets in.", "If your goal is to become a data scientist or machine learning engineer/researcher, a PhD *might* be a good move. But there are also two big reasons why it might not be:", "To the first point: in the U.S. or Canada, a PhD takes anywhere from 4 years to 7 or 8 years to complete. The median time to completion is usually 5 or 6 years, depending on the institution. Now let\u2019s put that into perspective.", "You know what wasn\u2019t a thing in data science 5 years ago? Spark, XGBoost, jupyter notebooks, GloVe, spaCy, TensorFlow, Keras, Pytorch, InceptionNet, ResNet, reinforcement learning (like, basically at all), etc, etc.", "So unless you decided to learn about these things on your own when they came out (in which case, I\u2019m not sure that grad school deserves the credit), there\u2019s a chance your PhD would have left you in the position of someone who was cryogenically frozen in 2012, only to be re-animated today as a complete newbie. You\u2019d find yourself in a brave new world of data science techniques that you\u2019d have to learn on your own after graduation day anyway.", "The point is, things move very fast in data science and machine learning. And they\u2019ll only move faster in the future. So if you\u2019re considering a PhD in a data science or machine learning-related field, and your goal is to work in industry some day, just keep in mind that you\u2019re essentially placing a bet on the area you\u2019re specializing in: you\u2019re banking on it being both relevant and in high demand when you finally graduate. And that can be a risky bet, with some pretty high stakes.", "To the second point: take a moment to think about who would be supervising you, and why they aren\u2019t already working at Google or Facebook.", "Of course, there are people who simply prefer academic research to doing data science or machine learning in industry. But it\u2019s worth keeping in mind that the amount of money offered to top-tier ML talent in industry is high enough that there\u2019s definite downward selective pressure on people who stay in academe.", "And of course there are places where you can consistently find exceptions to this rule. These are usually super-elite programs like the Vector Institute or MILA in Canada, or data science programs at MIT and Berkeley in the U.S. You\u2019ll know them when you see them, but just keep in mind that your state college, or that school that\u2019s ranked among the \u201ctop 200\u201d in the world, probably won\u2019t be one.", "To sum up: if you\u2019re only interested in becoming a deep learning engineer at Airbnb, then sure, a PhD might be one of relatively few ways through the door. But don\u2019t expect to get hired at a platinum+ company if you\u2019re not doing your PhD in a platinum+ program.", "But if you\u2019re looking for a more typical (read: more realistic) data science role, a PhD is rarely the right move. You\u2019ll be better off investing those 4 to 8 years into getting work experience as an actual data scientist, where you\u2019ll learn new techniques when they come out, and where you\u2019ll be in a better position to anticipate new trends and stay ahead of them.", "Oh, and if you\u2019re considering a PhD in an area that\u2019s not data science-related at all (e.g. physics, biology, chemistry), and you\u2019re aiming for a data science role, here\u2019s a useful yet harsh heuristic: if you\u2019re within 18 months of graduation or more (and you\u2019re really sure you want to be a data scientist), just drop out. The sunk cost fallacy will have you second-guessing this strategy (and you should), but in my (statistically significant) experience it\u2019s much more likely to be the right move than not.", "Do you need a Master\u2019s to do data science?", "It depends. Here\u2019s a scorecard I just made up. Add up the points that apply to you, and if the total is greater than 6, then the answer is \u201cprobably a Master\u2019s will be helpful.\u201d", "\u2192 Something to think about is whether you need a full Master\u2019s in data science, or a bootcamp. If you choose to do a bootcamp, keep their incentives in mind: are you being asked to pay upfront without the guarantee of getting hired afterwards? Is there a careers service associated with the bootcamp?", "\u2192 Most people are skeptical of bootcamps. Rightly so. But what most people miss is that they should be equally skeptical of any university Master\u2019s degree that doesn\u2019t provide a guarantee of placement. Master\u2019s degrees are bootcamps. Treat them that way. If you do one don\u2019t focus on your grades, focus on what you\u2019re learning. Ask what the postgraduate employment rates look like for your program. Universities have a funny way of convincing their students that an easy program is a good program, or that they\u2019re doing you a favor just by letting you in. This is a psychological game, and one that\u2019s reinforced by the outdated \u201cconventional wisdom\u201d that university degrees have independent value. But your goal is to get hired, not to \u201cput in your time\u201d and get a piece of paper.", "\u2192 Even if you complete a Master\u2019s, you\u2019ll have a lot of skills polishing to do. And probably quite a bit more than you expect. But as long as the program is short (NEVER to a 2-year + Master\u2019s program), and the price tag isn\u2019t too high, it can definitely be worth it.", "In general, yes, you\u2019ll need an undergrad degree to become a data scientist. Not necessarily because you need the knowledge, but because companies aren\u2019t yet ready to accept the idea that being self-taught + doing a bootcamp and some online courses can actually get you job-ready (even though in some cases it absolutely can).", "But here\u2019s the thing with undergraduate degrees.", "They\u2019re not jobs. And if you talk to just about anyone in tech, you\u2019ll quickly realize that tech jobs >> school for learning about tech. That\u2019s partly because the curricula that are taught in undergrad are generally about 5 to 10 years out of date. And that can be fine if you\u2019re in a field that doesn\u2019t change a lot, like physics, math or statistics.", "But if you\u2019re in engineering or CS, and you get a summer internship at a great company, and you want to defer your degree (or drop out) to get more work experience, that\u2019s something you should 100% consider doing. If the point of your undergrad is to get a job, there\u2019s little purpose in paying more tuition to wrap up if you\u2019ve already secured a position at a company that has enough runway to get you your first 2 years of experience.", "Now I\u2019m absolutely not saying that you should just drop out of your undergrad. All I\u2019m saying is that more people should in general be more open to leaving their degrees unfinished *if* they\u2019ve done an internship and that\u2019s converted into a concrete offer of full-time work. It doesn\u2019t happen terribly often, but I suspect that\u2019s in no small part due to the fact that so many undergrads just assume that completing your degree is \u201cwhat good people do.\u201d", "The advice I\u2019ve given here is unconventional in many ways. But in a rapidly developing field like data science, convention can often lag considerably behind what\u2019s optimal. As a society, our perception of the value of graduate education is one of the aspects of conventional wisdom that\u2019s most badly in need of catching up to reality.", "None of this means that formal education, or even graduate degrees aren\u2019t worth obtaining, of course. But no one should take the need for a Master\u2019s or a PhD for granted: if you\u2019re signing up for a M.Sc. just to fit your stereotype of what a good data science career trajectory should look like, you might want to rethink your strategy.", "Your home for data science.
