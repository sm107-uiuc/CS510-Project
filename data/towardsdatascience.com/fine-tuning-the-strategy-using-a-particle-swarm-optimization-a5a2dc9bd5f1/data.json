In this experiment, we use a more sophisticated and complex function that tries to compose a few factors. I describe this function in one next part.", "A lot of researchers described the PSO approach in their works. My task is to collect in one place the main algorithmic scheme and principles behind the method. Also, I give links to get more information and dive into it depending on your interests.", "In computational science, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is a computational method that optimizes a problem by iteratively trying to improve a candidate solution with regard to a given measure of quality. It solves a problem by having a population of candidate solutions, here dubbed particles, and moving these particles around in the search-space according to simple mathematical formulae over the particle\u2019s position and velocity. Each particle\u2019s movement is influenced by its local best known position, but is also guided toward the best known positions in the search-space, which are updated as better positions are found by other particles. This is expected to move the swarm toward the best solutions.", "PSO is a metaheuristic as it makes few or no assumptions about the problem being optimized and can search very large spaces of candidate solutions. However, metaheuristics such as PSO do not guarantee an optimal solution is ever found. Also, PSO does not use the gradient of the problem being optimized, which means PSO does not require that the optimization problem be differentiable as is required by classic optimization methods such as gradient descent and quasi-newton methods.", "It sounds great, we can use the objective function that could be non-differentiable. This is a very convenient point because our function usually is complex and consists of different parts. Also, the algorithm can work with no assumptions in large spaces. The scheme of the algorithm looks like this", "The math description you can get in this source article. The algorithm is iterative that tries to converge step by step, this picture shows the animation of the process.", "Generally, the pseudo-code independent of a programming language with basic operations is the next.", "The good explanation of the algorithm with hands-on implementation by Tarlan Ahadli you can find here.
