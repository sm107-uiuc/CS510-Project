Founded in 1962 and headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, the company operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores across the world along with Sam\u2019s Club retail warehouses. According to 2019 statistics, Walmart is the world\u2019s largest company by revenue, with US$514.405 billion, and also the world\u2019s largest private employer with over 2.2 million employees.", "Walmart is also a data-driven company. With over 70 million different products sold at Walmart and over 275 million weekly customers, Walmart generates a huge amount of sales data across stores around the world daily. To make sense out of the data, Walmart launched the Data Caf\u00e9 Analytics Hub, a state-of-the-art analytics hub that can process 2.5 petabytes of data every hour [1].

The minimum requirement for a data science position at Walmart is an undergraduate degree with at least three years of experience.", "Try solving this question on our interactive SQL editor.", "Walmart has a similar interview process like most big tech companies. Generally, the interview process starts with a 30 minutes initial phone call with recruiting and then a take-home challenge or technical interview with a team manager. After passing the take-home and technical interview, you will then progress to the onsite interview comprising of 4 to 5 one-on-one interviews with various members of the team.", "Walmart initial phone screen is done over a 30 minutes phone call with a recruiter. Most often, this interview is non-technical in nature and may include a brief run-down of your resume, discussion of past projects relevant to the team you are applying for, and potential team members you will be meeting with. Note also, that there may be some basic technical elements in the interview to make sure your resume matches your experience.", "Generally, depending on seniority of the role, Walmart may send a take-home challenge after the recruiter call to make sure you can pass a technical baseline. This challenge is most likely done in Hackerrank and will involve writing Pandas and Python code to manipulate a dataset.", "Want to practice take-home challenges? Check out Interview Query\u2019s take-home challenges.", "Walmart\u2019s technical screen is done via Hackerrank as well with a data scientist over video chat.

In this case for Walmart, their biggest problems are in improving service delivery and customers shopping experiences.", "Walmart tends to be a large company that allows for a lot of flexibility in different data science roles. Because Walmart has such a large multi-conglomerate business, you can find many opportunities to move around or move up in the career ladder.", "Lastly, while Walmart\u2019s offices are headquartered in Arkansas, Walmart Lab is headquartered in San Bruno, just north of the heart of Silicon Valley.
