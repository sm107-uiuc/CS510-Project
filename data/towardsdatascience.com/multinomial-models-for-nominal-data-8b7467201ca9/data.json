The difference is that there is no order to the categories in nominal multinomial data while there is an order to those in ordinal multinomial data.", "For example, if our goal is to distinguish the three classes of plants in the IRIS dataset, we need to treat the plant categories as a nominal outcome because there is no specific order in the classes of plants. However, if we want to predict the score at the end of the first half in an NBA final into three categories, \u201cwinning\u201d, \u201closing\u201d, or \u201ctie\u201d, we need to regard it as an ordinal outcome because the pairwise distances are not the same among the three classes.", "Therefore, it\u2019s necessary to figure out what the type of outcome is before the multinomial modeling.", "In this post, I am going to briefly talk about the multinomial regression models for the nominal data. I hope it will help you in your real-life work.", "As aforementioned, the multinomial logistic regression was specifically designed for the nominal data. The idea is very similar to that of logistic regression on the binary data, which is to link the probability of belonging to one of the categories to the predictors.", "For those who struggle to understand the link functions, you can refer to one of my previous posts about it.", "Let Yi be a random variable that can fall in one of the classes, 1, 2, \u2026, J. And we define pij as the ith variable to be in the jth class.", "the formula above is for the general case, so when J=2, it becomes the case with binary data.", "If we have the total number of observations as ni, then the multinomial distribution could be described as below.", "In the multinomial logistic regression, the link function is defined as", "In this way, we link the log odds ratio between the probability to be in class J and that to be in class 1 to the linear combination of the predictors. Now let\u2019s take a look at the real data and coding of the multinomial logistic regression.", "The example is from Faraway\u2019s book, which describes the 1996 American National Election Study. The response variable involves three categories, Democrat, Republican, and Independent. The predictors include age, education level, and income group of the respondents.", "After some pre-processing of the dataset, we build the multinomial logistic regression in R as below.", "where \u201csPID\u201d is the response variable, \u201cage\u201d, \u201ceduc\u201d, and \u201cnincome\u201d corresponds to the age, the education level, and the income of the respondents, respectively. And nes96 is just the dataset name.", "We then check the summary of the fitted model.", "The estimated coefficients, as well as the standard errors, are reported by the model summary. The output is a little different from those in the linear models.", "Only the statistics of \u201cIndependent\u201d and \u201cRepublican\u201d are listed in the summary because here \u201cDemocrat\u201d is used as the baseline category and the regression is modeling the log odds ratio against this baseline category.", "You may notice that there is no indicator to show the significance of the predictors in the model. We can evaluate them in two ways.", "First, we can use the popular Z-score to evaluate the significance of the preditors.", "This procedure is easy to implement because it has a simplified assumption of the normal distribution which holds for a rough estimation. Let\u2019s look at the p-values.", "It seems that income is a strong preditor with no doubt, but not all the education variables are listed as significant. This is also a shortcoming of using Z-distribution to evaluate the coefficients, which makes it hard to interpret.", "A more precise way is to build a new model with a reduced number of predictors and then check the change in the likelihood. First, let\u2019s build the model without variable education.", "Then we use a chi-squared distribution to evaluate the change in likelihood between the two multinomial models. The p-value could be calculated as below.", "which indicates that the variable \u2018education\u2019 is not significant relative to the full model. If we do the same thing to the variable \u2018income\u2019, we will get the following result.", "These results indicate that \u201cincome\u201d is a significant predictor in the full model.", "The interpretation of the coefficient should be such: one unit change in some predictor will result in k unit change in the log odds ratio between the target category to the baseline category (\u201cDemocrat\u201d in this example). I will not explore the details of this part.", "Another very important check on the response variable before the multinomial modeling is whether the response outcome is hierarchical.", "Let\u2019s look at an example of the central nervous system disease data from Faraway\u2019s book.", "Here, \u201cNoCNS\u201d means no central nervous system disease, \u201cAn\u201d means anencephalus, \u201cSp\u201d means spina bifida, and \u201cOther\u201d means other types of CNS. \u201cArea\u201d, \u201cWater\u201d and \u201cWork\u201d describe the features of the families.", "If we want to model the CNS status using the features of the families, we can simply implement the multinomial logistic regression on the four categories.", "However, we can see that \u201cAn\u201d, \u201cSp\u201d and \u201cOther\u201d are just subtypes of CNS and the response variable is dominated by healthy individuals (NoCNS). In such a situation, we\u2019d better treat the response variables as hierarchical variables, where \u201cCNS\u201d and \u201cNoCNS\u201d form a binomial distribution and \u201cAn\u201d, \u201cSp\u201d, and \u201cOther\u201d form a multinomial distribution within the \u201cCNS\u201d category.", "Let\u2019s compare the codes and results.", "Let\u2019s first establish a binomial logistic regression between the \u201cCNS\u201d and \u201cNoCNS\u201d.", "We can find that both \u201cWater\u201d and \u201cWorkNonManual\u201d are significant variables in predicting CNS or not.", "Then, we perform the multinomial logistic regression on the subtypes of CNS.", "We can see that neither \u201cWater\u201d nor \u201cWorkNonManual\u201d is significant to distinguish different subtypes of CNS.", "These results suggest that water quality and manual work do have an influence on the new births\u2019 CNS condition, but neither of them explains the subtypes of the CNS.", "However, if we throw everything to a four-category full model, the results are different.", "This time the predictors show some mixed results in interpreting the subtype of CNSs with different p-values. The fact that subtypes of CNS cannot be predicted by the two variables is not disclosed in the full model.", "In summary, I introduced the multinomial regression model and its application situations. The most important point is to check the response variables before the modeling.", "Faraway, Julian J.
