The most dominating factor in choosing a model is the performance, which employs the KFold-cross-validation technique to achieve independence.", "The chosen model usually has a higher mean performance. Nevertheless, sometimes it originated through a statistical fluke. There are many statistical hypothesis-testing approaches to evaluate the mean performance difference resulting from the cross-validation to address this concern. If the difference is above the significance level `p-value` we can reject the null hypothesis that the two algorithms are the same, and the difference is not significant.", "I usually include such a step in my pipeline either when developing a new classification model or competing in one of Kaggle\u2019s competitions.", "A statistical hypothesis test quantifies how plausible it is to witness two data samples, considering that they have the same distribution. That describes the null hypothesis. We can test this null hypothesis by applying some statistical calculations.", "Examining machine learning models via statistical significance tests requires some expectations that will influence the statistical tests used. The most robust way to such comparisons is called paired designs, which compare both models (or algorithms) performance on the same data. That way, both models (or algorithms) have to deal with the same difficulty.", "In the following, each test has some pros and cons that you should consider during the selection.", "P.N: There are other statistical tests used to compare classifiers, but those are the most recommended one.", "2. Ten-fold cross-validation: It uses the ordinary paired t-test. This method has good repeatability relative to other ways as well as a decent type II error. However, it has a high type I error; that\u2019s why it is not recommended.", "Comparing training algorithms via cross-validation makes stronger assumptions than comparing specific (fully trained) models\u2019 predictive performance.

It is applied to 2 \u00d7 2 contingency tables with a dichotomous trait, with matched pairs of subjects, to determine whether the row and column marginal frequencies are equal (that is, whether there is \u201cmarginal homogeneity\u201d). \u2014 Wikipedia", "It is recommended for the last twenty years. However, this method\u2019s challenge is that you either need to build your functions to implement it or use a third party library where it is not commonly packed up for you in the tools you use.", "4. Non-parametric Paired test: this method involves making a few assumptions. For example, assuming the distribution of model accuracies has a normal distribution(Gaussian).", "The Wilcoxon signed-rank test is a non-parametric version of the paired Student\u2019s t-test. Although the test is non-parametric, it still assumes the independency for observations inside each sample. Although using the k-fold cross-validation would break that assumption.", "5. Estimation statistics: A data analysis framework that uses a combination of effect sizes, confidence intervals, precision planning, and meta-analysis to plan experiments, analyze data, and interpret results \u2014 Wikipedia. Nevertheless, when evaluating the model using the resampling method, the assumption of independence is broken. As an alternative, other statistical resampling methods like bootstrapping. Bootstrapping could estimate a robust non-parametric confidence interval. Hence, we can interpret the results and compare classifiers.", "An approach to evaluate each model on the same k-fold cross-validation split of the data and calculates each split score. That would give a sample of ten scores for ten-fold cross-validation. Then, we can compare those scores using the paired statistical test.", "Due to using the same data rows to train the model more than once, the assumption of independence is violated; hence, the test would be biased.", "This statistical test could be adjusted to overcome the lack of independence. Also, the number of folds and repeats of the method can be configured to achieve a better sampling of model performance.", "Thomas Dietterich proposed this approach in the \u201cApproximate Statistical Tests for Comparing Supervised Classification Learning Algorithms.\u201d \u2014 1998", "For this tutorials, I will make use of the load_iris dataset within the sklearn library.
