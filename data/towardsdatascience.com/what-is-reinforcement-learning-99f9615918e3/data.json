Rewards and punishments | by German Sharabok | Towards Data Science", "h1": "What Is Reinforcement Learning?", "description": "Machine Learning is one of the most discussed fields in the IT world. With the large spread of image and speech recognition, self-driving vehicles, product recommendations, and fraud detection\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Machine Learning is one of the most discussed fields in the IT world. With the large spread of image and speech recognition, self-driving vehicles, product recommendations, and fraud detection, Machine Learning is everywhere.", "One subfield of ML focuses on discovering solutions to problems through self-learning. Here, we can take the example of video games. When a small group of researchers from a company called Deepmind has published a paper on playing Atari with Reinforcement learning, this field has received a lot of attention. So much that Google has later purchased the company for a large sum of money.", "When AlphaGo has beaten the world champion in the game of Go, the power of reinforcement learning was no longer left unnoticed. After reading this article you will have a basic understanding of the ideas behind reinforcement learning and its applications.", "Reinforcement learning is the training of machine learning models to make a sequence of decisions for a given scenario.", "At its core, we have an autonomous agent such as a person, robot, or deep net learning to navigate an uncertain environment. The goal of this agent is to maximize the numerical reward.", "Sports are a great example of this. Let's consider what our agent will have to deal with in a tennis match.", "The agent will have to consider its actions, such as serves and volleys. These actions change the state of the game. In other words, the current set score and the leading player.", "Every action is performed with a reward in mind. The agent has to win a point in order to win a game, set, and match.", "Our player needs to follow certain rules and strategies to maximize the final score.", "To build a model based on this, it will have to take a state and an action as input, which then will be transferred into the maximum possible reward. The model will also have to think ahead and consider the long term results of such actions.", "This process varies for each task, which is not surprising. Building a model that can play tennis versus Atari is fairly different.", "Reinforcement learning is not just a smart way to say supervised learning. Supervised learning is focused on making sense of the environment based on historical examples.", "However, this is not always appropriate. A common example would be driving in traffic.", "Imagine doing this based on the observations made from the day before, when there were barely any cars. That\u2019s as effective as driving by only looking at the rearview mirrors.", "Reinforcement learning is all about collecting rewards. The agent focuses on making proper turns, signaling when necessary, and not breaking the speed limits. Also, the bot can lose points for dangerous actions, such as speeding.", "The goal is to maximize the number of points by given the current state in traffic. The emphasis here is that an action causes the change in state, which supervised learning does not focus on.", "Let's say we place a brand new robot into a room. His goal is to find bolts and screws. The robot here is an agent and the room is the environment. He has four possible actions: moving left, right, forward, or backward.", "The robot\u2019s state consists of a few things, which are his current location and previous location. If he moves, the state changes but we do not know yet whether the move was right or wrong.", "So we let our robot explore the room. After walking around for a while, our robot finally finds some screws. The bot receives a reward for doing the right thing.", "Now, the policy our robot has to follow is the maximization of points. He knows that by taking the same route to the screws again he will definitely reach the goal and receive some positive feedback.", "However, this path is far from optimal and any type of robot can just follow the same path again and again. Here comes the tradeoff between exploration and exploration.", "If our robot follows the same path, he will exploit what he has learned and eventually reach the goal. However, if we let the robot wander around looking for better paths, he will be making use of exploration.", "Let\u2019s say we give our robot 10 rounds to learn about the environment and find better routes. After some time he finds a path that takes only half the amount of steps needed previously. However, in the process, he has taken some bad paths as well.", "In this case, if we let another robot run the 10 rounds and only use the first path he found, this bot might end up collecting more bolts and screws.", "This is the tradeoff researches have to deal with when developing reinforcement learning models.", "Reinforcement learning models have to be well-trained and optimized to navigate real-life situations. The scenarios and the environment around the agent can change every time.", "For example, we are inside a self-driving vehicle and we want the car to be optimized for safety. Then, if we see the brake lights of the car in front of us it is probably time to slow down. However, if we saw a massive rock on the road, we expect that the car will stop.", "Another impressive project was aimed at building prosthetic legs, which will be able to recognize the walking patterns and adjust accordingly. As a prototype, the researchers have developed a virtual runner that had to learn on its own.", "We have learned that reinforcement learning is a powerful tool with high potential. The only thing is that we need a lot of data and training to be able to navigate real-world situations.", "There have been some optimistic and impressive results in the field of large-scale computing. These systems can explore massive environments with a huge number of states, such as the ones in large-scale video games.", "Reinforcement learning is simple and powerful. Given the recent development and rapid progress, it has the potential to become a big force in the field of deep learning. However, it is important to remember that reinforcement learning is only one of the many existing approaches to solving real-world problems, which has its advantages and disadvantages.", "Reinforcement learning has the potential to make machines creative, as we have seen in the AlphaGo example. Getting started with this field can be as simple as taking a short course or developing a small program, such as for the robot searching for bolts.", "Your home for data science.
