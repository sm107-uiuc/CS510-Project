By using sentiment analysis, companies don\u2019t have to spend endless hours tagging customer data such as survey responses, reviews, support tickets, and social media comments.", "Sentiment analysis helps companies monitor their brand reputation on social media, gain insights from customer feedback, and much more!", "In this post, we\u2019ll go into more detail about what sentiment analysis is, how to perform it, and how it can help your business.", "Sentiment analysis uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and algorithms, including:", "To identify polarity, this method defines a set of rules using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques (like tokenization, stemming, and parsing) alongside manually crafted rules.", "First, you\u2019ll need to define two lists of opposing words (e.g. negative words such as bad, worst, ugly, etc and positive words such as good, best, beautiful, etc). Once a rule-based system has been fed these predefined lists, it will count the number of positive and negative words that appear in a text, returning a positive sentiment if there are more positive than negative words, and vice versa.", "However, this method doesn\u2019t take into account word sequences within texts, such as, \u2018the UX ain\u2019t that great\u2019. While \u2018ain\u2019t that great\u2019 expresses negativity, rule-based systems will detect the word \u2018great\u2019 and add it to the list of positives.", "Now, being a rule-based system, you can implement new rules to take into account new vocabulary and expressions, but systems can become quite complex and hard to maintain with so many rules. As a result, these systems require large investments to fine tune and maintain.", "These systems don\u2019t rely on manually crafted rules, but on machine learning techniques, such as classification. Classification, which is used for sentiment analysis, is an automatic system that needs to be fed sample text before returning a category, e.g. positive, negative, or neutral.", "There are two stages involved in implementing automatic systems:", "In the training stage, a sentiment analysis model learns to correctly tag a text as negative, neutral or positive using sample data. The feature extractor then transforms the text into a feature vector, creating pairs of feature vectors and tags (e.g. positive, negative, or neutral) that are fed into the machine learning algorithm to generate a model.", "In the prediction process, the feature extractor is used to transform unseen text into feature vectors, which are fed to the model, enabling it to make sentiment predictions.", "As the name suggests, hybrid systems combine rule-based and automatic techniques, and often deliver more accurate results.", "Companies are receiving more information than ever before via social media, surveys, online reviews, emails, and other channels. But, did you know that 80% of this data is unstructured? So, if you want to analyze this data to get insights about your customers opinions, you\u2019ll need to sort it first.", "For example, let\u2019s imagine you just launched a new product and carried out a survey to see what your customers thought. The survey was really successful, and you received 1000 open-ended responses. That\u2019s great, but you have limited resources, so it\u2019s gonna take forever to read and analyze them.", "Performing sentiment analysis, however, can save you time, effort, and resources when analyzing your survey responses. It\u2019s far more efficient than manually sorting data because it\u2019s completely automated, meaning your team can focus on more urgent and important tasks.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the benefits of sentiment analysis in more detail:", "Businesses today receive huge amounts of information \u2014 more than 2.5 quintillion bytes of data are produced daily! This makes it almost impossible for human agents to manually analyze this data accurately and efficiently. Instead, machine learning models for sentiment analysis can automatically tag your texts in just seconds, whether you receive 50 or 5,000 survey responses, reviews or social media comments.", "Urgent issues will often arise, and they\u2019ll need to be dealt with immediately. A complaint on Twitter, for example, could quickly escalate into a PR crisis if it goes viral. While it might be difficult for your team to identify a crisis before it happens, it\u2019s very easy for machine learning tools to spot these situations in real time.", "Let\u2019s imagine you carried out a customer satisfaction survey and received this response: \u201cThe support agent was fast but very rude\u201d. How would you tag it? Positive, Negative, or Neutral? As you can see, identifying the sentiment of a text manually isn\u2019t always straightforward. Some of your teammates might classify texts differently according to their beliefs and experience. And if they are bored or tired, they might end up making mistakes, or even change their criteria over time!", "Machine learning models for sentiment analysis, on the other hand, apply consistent criteria at all times, plus they never get tired or bored.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how sentiment analysis is already being used:", "Sentiment analysis can be used for political analysis.", "In 2016, the US elections were being discussed by millions of people on Twitter worldwide. We wanted to find out the general public\u2019s opinion about each candidate, and performed sentiment analysis on all tweets mentioning each of the candidates, for example:", "Here is a graph of the results, showing sentiments of Twitter users over a period of time in relation to Trump and Clinton:", "As you can see, Donald Trump has a lot more mentions than Clinton, suggesting he has a larger presence on Twitter (Trump received around 450,000/day mentions, while Clinton received only 250,000/day). We also discovered that, out of all those tweets, Trump received more positive mentions than Clinton.", "You can also analyze sentiments related to customer service. Online conversations, for example, can help businesses understand how customers feel about their brand, their response times, overall customer service, and so on.", "Below, we analyzed the sentiment of tweets for four different telcos (T-Mobile, AT&T, Verizon, and Sprint) and obtained the following results:", "Percentage of positive tweets mentioning a telco.", "The results show that T-Mobile is winning with almost 20% of positive tweets, with Sprint coming in second, with 15% of positive mentions.", "When comparing T-Mobile\u2019s tweets with those of its competitors, it\u2019s clear that T-Mobile\u2019s personal approach on social media results in more positive responses, which might encourage the other companies to adopt a more informal personality on social media.", "You could also use sentiment analysis to analyze customer feedback, from online reviews to NPS surveys.", "Let\u2019s say Tripadvisor wants to perform sentiment analysis on hotel reviews to explore overall sentiment. Well, we ran this analysis on over 1M hotel reviews and discovered some interesting insights:", "We also classified Slack\u2019s reviews on Capterra into Positive, Negative, and Neutral and obtained the following results:", "As you can see, Slack\u2019s receiving more positive mentions in categories such as Integrations, Channels, and Groups, but more negative mentions about Pricing, Calls, or Search. This type of analysis can help businesses derive crucial insights on how to improve their service or product.", "In short, sentiment analysis can improve your business in many ways, from preventing a PR crisis to understanding how your customers feel about your product or service.", "Classifying by hand is no longer scalable for businesses. They need fast, accurate, and efficient automated systems that can deliver new insights and empower teams.", "Want to get started with sentiment analysis right away?
