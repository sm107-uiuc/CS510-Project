We also found the network highly skewed \u2014 most characters had few connections or shortest paths between characters while a small number of characters had many connections and shortest paths. The skewness also implied a relatively few steps between characters in network, which we indeed found.", "Finally, to quantify the \u201csmall-worldliness\u201d of the co-appearance network, we compared its clustering and path lengths with those of random networks with the same numbers of nodes and edges. Characteristic of a small world, the co-appearance network was much more clustered but similar in path lengths to the random networks. We also saw, however, that the small world structure collapsed at the end of Season 7 as the main characters built broader alliances to face of the White Walkers, and the network folded into a single clique.", "Phew. We did a lot in Episode 2!", "In Episode 3, we turn our attention to the positions of main \u2014 regular and recurring \u2014 characters within the character co-appearance network. Who is advantageously positioned? Who has the opportunity to control flows of information and resources? Who can command trust and loyalty?", "Before we dive into the characters\u2019 network positions, we need to know what to look for; that is, what kinds of positions might be advantageous. Social networks research indicates that network positions can affect outcomes for their occupants, and points to two kinds of positions \u2014 dense and sparse \u2014 that can create differential advantages and better outcomes for their occupants.", "Network positions within closely-knit structures \u2014 positions comprised of ties with others who are already linked \u2014 benefit their occupants by fostering development of reciprocity norms and sanctioning mechanisms, trust, and shared identity, all of which foster high levels of cooperation and coordination that can facilitate collaboration and limit opportunism.", "Network positions within sparse structures \u2014 positions comprised of ties with others who are not already linked \u2014 benefit their occupants by situating them between otherwise disconnected groups, exposing them to and giving them the opportunity to control the diverse information and resources flowing through the network, all of which enables better anticipation of problems and exploitation of new opportunities.", "Sound familiar? I certainly hope so! These positions reflect the two defining structures of small world networks, which are comprised of dense clusters of actors spanned by sparse connections that cut across them, binding distinct regions of local clustering via short paths into a larger network and acting as conduits for information exchange and control. Small world networks \u2014 like the character co-appearance network \u2014 thus afford opportunities for both kinds of benefits.", "The significance of small world structures is that by combining dense and sparse they create a \u201chybrid\u201d relational structure that enhances information diffusion and processing properties by providing efficient channels to diverse information across regions of the network while maintaining the benefits of high trust and information sharing.", "So, while dense and sparse network positions are generally portrayed as rival options that force a trade off between benefits of trust, information sharing, and collaboration and benefits of information and resource access and control, the basic insights from small world networks suggests, instead, that they are complementary benefits, and that a combination of density and sparseness can be advantageous in a network position.", "Network positions \u2014 like network structures \u2014 may gain advantages over purely dense or sparse positions both by mitigating effects of excessive density (e.g., isolation and constraint) and excessive sparseness (e.g., opportunism and instability) and by joining the trust and integration benefits of density within their local cluster with the information access and brokering benefits of sparse ties that cut across clusters.", "Okay, then. So what kinds of network positions have the Game of Throne\u2019s main characters carved out for themselves?", "All kinds it appears! Figure 1 shows the mix of density (clustering) and sparseness (betweenness) that characterize network positions of 13 key Game of Thrones characters. Clustering and betweenness are averaged across episodes, node size reflects cumulative degree across episodes. Nodes for female characters are blue; for males, red. The characters\u2019 positions range from dense (Daenerys Targaryen) to sparse (Tyrion Lannister), and mix the two to fill the continuum between the extremes. The other 134 regular and recurring characters add observations primarily to the top left; the key characters thus tend to exhibit the highest betweenness (and lowest clustering).", "Figure 2 shows the evolution of these positions over time, charting the time path of clustering and betweeness from episode to episode. Their positions are relatively stable, but several characters shift substantially. Among these, Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s betweenness rises and clustering falls early in Season 6. Betweenness also spikes for Tyrion Lannister from mid-Season 5 to mid-Season 6. In a later episode, we\u2019ll look into the shifting patterns of co-appearances behind these movements to better understand how these network positions develop\u2014and to consider how to make \u201cnetwork moves\u201d to better them.", "In Episode 2, the skewness of the degree and betweenness distributions suggested that a small number of characters might be particularly influential by virtue of their potential to control flows of information and resources across the network \u2014 and with them, the Lands of Ice and Fire. Who are these \u201cskewed few\u201d?", "Figure 3 plots degree and betweenness for the same set of key characters. Degree and betweenness are averaged across episodes. Node size and color are as before. Among these key characters, Tyrion Lannister has both the highest degree and the highest betweenness; Daenerys Targaryen the lowest. A group of characters\u200a\u2014\u200aCersei and Jamie Lannister, Sansa and Arya Stark, Jon Snow\u200a\u2014\u200ahave high average degree, but vary in their betweenness. As we saw in the distributions of these measures in Episode 2, high betweenness is somewhat rarer than high degree. The remaining 134 regular and recurring characters add observations primarily to the bottom left of the plot. These key characters thus make up the \u201cskewed few\u201d.", "Figure 4 shows the evolution of their positions across the seven seasons. Tyrion Lannister occupies the network position with highest betweenness and degree except for a short period second half Season 4. Jon Snow increases on both dimensions through the first 5 seasons, but then declines on both. Arya, Bran, and Samsa Stark all have 4\u20135 episode-length periods of high betweenness, as does Jamie (but not Cersei) Lannister. Degree and betweenness for these key characters converge and fall during Season 7. This reflects the collapse of the Small World that we observed graphically in Episode 1 and quantified in Episode 2, as the result of the alliances forming among these characters in the face of the White Walker threat. As noted above, in a later episode, we\u2019ll look into the shifting co-appearances behind these movements to better understand their development and consider ways to enact beneficial movements.", "Now that we have seen the range of positions the key characters occupied in the co-appearance network, can we also observe differential outcomes associated with the different positions? Are dense positions advantageous? Sparse ones? Hybrids? What about the \u201cskewed few\u201d? One metric by which to gauge the benefits of network positions is to assess their association with character survival. Of the 147 regular and recurring characters, 100 died (and only one by \u201cnatural\u201d causes). Did the characters who were killed occupy different types of network positions than those who survived?", "Figure 5 shows the mix of clustering and betweenness that characterize the network positions of all regular and recurring characters. As before, clustering and betweenness are averaged across episodes and node size reflects cumulative degree across episodes. In this plot, however, nodes for surviving characters are blue; for characters killed, red.", "The pattern seems clear: clustering kills, betweenness protects. With few exceptions, characters killed have clustering above 0.5 and betweenness below 0.02. Few characters survive with clustering above 0.7. Exceptions to this pattern are Ned, Catelyn, and Robb Stark, Barristan Selmy, as well as Ramsey Bolton, Rickard Karstark, Janos Slynt, and Rast. Jon Snow is also coded \u201ckilled\u201d, but his resurrection befits his network position.", "Hybrid positions also appear beneficial, with survival relatively high for characters with whose positions are characterized by a mix of clustering (0.4\u20130.6) and betweenness (0.02\u20130.04).", "In the Lands of Ice and Fire, it would seem that the power to control flows of information and resources afforded by betweenness are more critical to survival than the trust, cooperation, and loyalty benefits associated with clustering.", "What about the skewed few \u2014 characters with high degree and/or betweenness? The pattern, shown in Figure 6, is perhaps even clearer. Of the 100 regular and recurring characters killed, only two occupied network positions with average degree over 20 and betweenness above 0.02\u2014 Ned Stark and Jon Snow, who was, of course, returned to the living.", "For completeness, Figure 7 shows the pattern for degree and clustering. As was apparent in Figure 5, although few characters with clustering below 0.5 are killed, low clustering provides more limited protection than high betweenness. Still, the only characters killed with average degree over 20 and clustering below 0.6 were, again, Ned Stark and Jon Snow.", "So, it seems that network positions do indeed matter for survival in the Lands of Ice and Fire \u2014 degree and betweenness save; clustering kills.", "In the next episode, we\u2019ll turn our attention to modeling character deaths in greater detail and to generating survival predictions for the main characters alive at the end of Season 7.", "New to GoT Season 7.5?
