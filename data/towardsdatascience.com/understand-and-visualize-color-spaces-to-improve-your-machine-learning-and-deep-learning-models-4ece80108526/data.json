Sure, it\u2019s the simplest color space because it\u2019s the default color space. But are there other color spaces that may be more suitable? And can it improve our models?\u201d", "These questions came to my mind and I absolutely had to find the answers. So I investigated and did some experiments. I would like to share my results with you. \ud83d\udcad", "At first, I started by exploring different color spaces that I found inspiring. So in the first part of this article, I will introduce you briefly to these color spaces and their possible applications in Machine Learning and Deep Learning.", "There is a wide (infinite) number of color spaces, so I made a selection of the most interesting ones for you. \ud83d\ude07", "In the second part of this post, I experienced these color spaces with the same model, in the same configurations. We will see that from one color space to another, the accuracy of our model can go from simple to twice.", "So how is an image in RGB structured? Basically by adding red, green and blue with different \u201cproportions \u201c. But I don\u2019t tell you more than you already know, I think. The more you add the colors, the more you get a lighter color. That is because they emit light (it is this same principle that we can observe by looking very closely at a screen).", "This is to be distinguished from primary light-reflecting colors. It is the reverse mechanism, the subtractivity. The more you add the colors together, the darker the color you get. This is the system that is used in printing, the CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black).", "Then why the RGB? The truth is, there are as many color spaces as you want. We will see how we build them. But the RGB is about simplicity. That\u2019s how our computer hardware is composed.", "RGB is the default color space, even in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. But take a look at the alternatives.", "We saw that the RGB is device-oriented. The International Commission on Illumination, CIE for its French name \u201cCommission Internationale de l\u2019Eclairage\u201d has set standards in colorimetry. It designs more abstract color spaces to break the boundaries of the RGB standard.", "The RGB space, encoded on 3 bytes, allows representing 40% of the colors that the human eye can perceive. This is why the CIE suggests color spaces to extend the field of possibilities to what man can actually perceive. Hence the color space CIE XYZ. It provides an extension of the boundaries of the color space to contain all the visible. If we simplify it a moment:", "Take a look at the schematic and the way we switch from one color space to another and you will understand two key elements:", "The CIE XYZ space is an instrumental space that serves as a support for other spaces: The CIE L*a*b and the CIE L*u*v will be interesting to deal with because it introduces the notion of lightness.", "The eye has 3 distinct cones to detect colors. One for red, one for green, one for blue. But these cones don\u2019t have the same responsiveness. So the perception of colors is different from the real color (speaking in wavelengths). The CIE L*a*b* color space try to distort the CIE XYZ space to better represent color perception for the human eye:", "To train learning models, the CIE L*a*b may be suitable. This can be seen in Wilson Castro\u2019s paper, where they try to classify Cape Gooseberries according to their ripeness. He and his team tried SVM, ANN, DT and KNN. On each of these models, the CIE L*a*b* color space proved to be more effective than the RGB color space.", "Finally, the CIE L*u*v* space is another attempt to approach the perception of the human eye. It has the advantage of being good at representing images of natural scenes. Color distances are easier to estimate, especially for distances between greens. In M.P. Rico-Fern\u00e1ndeza\u2019s paper where they use a SVM approach to categorize cultivated species, the CIE L*u*v* color space allows greater accuracy.", "Other color spaces are based on a psychological approach. This is the case for HSV, HSL and HSI spaces. All are based on the concepts of color psychology, which is the best way to explain what you see:", "These color spaces are said to be cylindrical since they are represented by a cylindrical or conical shape around the color hue. All these spaces have the same base: the hue representing the dominant wavelength.", "But these spaces diverge from the definition of what luminance of the is.", "Saturation is therefore also defined differently depending on the definition of what the luminance is.", "These three color spaces all have this foundation: the color psychology. This helps to easily make thresholds on luminances. In robotics, this color space can be used. As an example, we can look at the paper written by L. Nalpantidis. They use the HSV color space to design a stereo camera system taking into account non-ideal lighting conditions.", "These color spaces were born with the ambition to compress the bandwidth involved in video transmission. Let\u2019s take the example of Y\u2019CbCr. This color space is a standard designed to ensure compatibility with black&white and color TVs.", "So you have a signal Y\u2019 which represents the luma for black and white. Then two other components that are used to transmit the color information using two chromas: the blue Cb and the red Cr. It allows recovering the missing information from a B&W color image. But in practice, the efficiency of the phosphor (which colorizes the television screen) is not linear, so we apply corrective coefficients.", "Several standards have this same common base of Luma Y\u2019 and correction with two chrominances :", "All these spaces are therefore more or less similar but can also play an important role in our models. The A. M. Aibinu paper shows that an ANN based on a YCbCr color space is what gives the best performance compared to the RGB space for skin detection.", "I1I2I3 was introduced by Y-I. Ohta for image segmentation. It has also been proposed by The Media Integration and Communication Center (MICC) in another form which proposes to be invariant to highlight effects.", "The MICC also suggested a C1C2C3 color space to be invariant to shadowing effects.", "I1I2I3 and C1C2C3 are sometimes used as a complement or hybrid combination with other color spaces as you can see in the paper of A. Rasouli. He and his team evaluated a large number of color spaces to measure their suitability detecting and discriminating different colored objects. The combination of C1C2C3 and XYZ was the best of the studied combinations.", "I then decided to test the color spaces as proposed by the MICC.", "A last one. HED for Haematoxylin-Eosin-DAB is a color space designed by A.C.C. Ruifrok and D. A. Johnston to analyze specific tissues in the medical field.", "This color space can be used in blood analysis through images for instance with the paper of K. Ben-Suliman, A. Krzy\u017cak where they deal with images seen under a microscope.", "Now that the little trip is over, I suggest you try these color spaces under the same conditions and evaluate their impact on the same model.", "I decided to train a CNN, more precisely, inspired by Yann Le Cun\u2019s LeNet5. For the fun fact, this model has been used for years to sort postal letters. It was used to identify handwritten zip code numbers for the US Postal Service.", "A classification model will be established using the CIFAR-10 database. The training will take place in the same conditions each time:", "So I trained this model in the exact same conditions for 14 different color spaces. I\u2019m not gonna lie to you. I was secretly hoping that the RGB color space would be outdistanced by several other color spaces. \ud83d\ude10", "Not at all. The RGB space remains in my case a satisfying color space. However, we can notice that the Y\u2019UV color space is the most appropriate for my model on the CIFAR-10 dataset. \ud83d\udc7c", "After analyzing the average precision of our color spaces, I wanted to know if there was a variance in the precision of our model on the color spaces depending on the classes.", "Our two best color spaces (RGB and Y\u2019UV) are very good at categorizing vehicles but are relatively weak in the categorization of animals.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the RGB space:", "Well, now it is time to see if another color space is interesting for categorizing animals.", "The color spaces CIE XYZ, CIE L*a*b*, CIE L*u*v* are very interesting in our case:", "I don\u2019t know about you, but in this case, I will try to feed my model with Y\u2019UV image input for its overall accuracy and CIE L*u*v* color space for its stability in accuracy.", "Finally, I would like to finish with a last little graph that summarizes the training of our model with the different color spaces and these few points:", "Knowledge is all about sharing.Support me and get access of all my articles in one click here.", "Your home for data science.
