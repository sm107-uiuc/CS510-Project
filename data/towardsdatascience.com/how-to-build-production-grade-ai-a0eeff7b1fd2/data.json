It\u2019s too complex. We\u2019ll just rerun the code again.\u201d", "The above is a typical response of aspiring data scientists within many leading organisations.", "A production-grade AI model is one that helps humans make business decisions in a sustainable and predictable approach.", "In the last few years, I have led organisation transformation in advanced analytics and data science with great success. These were some of the most common mindsets \u2014 and see if you could differentiate the fact with fiction:", "All of the above are currently fiction. Humans build AI models for humans. Great data scientists can build AI models that work together with humans. Also, AI models provide additional insights, but a lot of work, investigation and decisions are still needed.", "So, what are the pillars of production-grade AI?", "\u201cAll models are wrong, the question is how wrong they are\u201d \u2014 John Evans", "Model strength is not quite the same as model accuracy. Accuracy is still needed to measure AI model strength. Confusion matrix is a common way to measure model accuracy, which displays discrepancies between model prediction and actual outcome. Despite its default fit for classification model, it is possible to transform non-classification model to this form. While the name is difficult to understand, the outcome is easy to understand.", "Higher accuracy is not necessarily better. In statistics, this is known as \u201coverfitting\u201d, where the model resembles training sample too closely. This means the model predicts past events perfectly, but does not predict future events correctly.", "A better way to measure model strength is model lift. It proves how the model discriminates between success and random selection.", "Under model lift, there are a few relevant goodness-of-fit statistics such as AUC (Area Under Curve) or K-S (Kolmogorov-Smirnov). For a K-S statistic, anything over 25% is usually considered production grade.", "Additionally, show AI model strength degradation over time. A metric that we could use is PSI (Population Stability Index). It tracks how the model strength through scorecard along with critical thresholds to revisit the model.", "\u201cI used 10% hold out sample so that should suffice\u201d said typical data scientist or a typical machine learning software", "10% hold out sample, or any other default percentage, is not enough.", "There are 2 types of time validation associated with AI model development:", "The traditional hold out sample is often referred to as In-time Validation because it is a subset from the observation time window. However, would it hold for future time periods?", "OTV is a great check for future model stability. I have seen countless times where a model passes ITV, but it does not pass OTV. This includes significant degradation in model accuracy, model lift or even changes model directional parameters. It also serves as a gate-keeper check for overfitting.", "A production-grade AI model must pass rationality or common business sense. While sophisticated AI models discover extreme anomalies, its key findings are rooted in common business sense.", "Partial Dependence Plots (PDP) demonstrate key correlations of your dependence/outcome variables with the main drivers. Despite the sophisticated inner machinery of AI models, if built correctly, the outcome interpretation clarity will be crystal clear.", "The above example clearly shows semi-linear relationships between the number of rented bikes with temperature, humidity and wind speed. Despite the complexities of the AI model, business executives need to utilise its outcome to make important decisions. This could involve pricing, bikes supply and potentially profitable business locations.", "In conclusion, data scientists need to learn to build production-grade AI models which are strong, stable and rational.", "AI models are challenging to build. It requires complexity, simplicity and creativity at the same time.", "However, it is essential to remember that AI models are built by humans \u2014 calculated by machines \u2014 and utilised for humans.", "If you like this article and would like to see more content, please consider joining Medium membership to support me and other fellow writers using the link below:", "About the author: Albert Suryadi is a proven leader in enabling advanced analytics and data science capability in blue chip organisations.
