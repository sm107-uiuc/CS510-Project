The most basic statistical analysis you can do is to look at word frequency distribution, that is, to visualize the word frequency distribution of a given textual data.", "Broadly, there are three types of words in any textual data \u2014", "Normally, there are two reasons for the removal of the stop-words \u2014", "However, there are scenarios in which these stop-words provide meaningful (grammatical) information such as in concepts like part of speech tagging, parsing, etc. and hence must not be removed. But overall, they do not provide much information.", "To build any machine learning model, one needs to provide it with features/attributes that the algorithm can take in and build the model. But, a generic text does not have any pre-existing features, it is just a combination of words, letters, sentences, etc.", "Therefore, to extract features out of a text, we need tokenization.", "Tokenization is a technique to break the given text into smaller parts such as characters, words, sentences, or even paragraphs depending on the application you\u2019re working on.", "Different types of tokenization techniques can be used to break down a given text and each has its o use-case. Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides you with the following:-", "Now, if you use word tokenizer, you would get every word as a feature to be used in model building. Thus, you will get a lot of redundant features such as \u2018get\u2019 and \u2018getting\u2019, \u2018goes\u2019 and \u2018going\u2019, \u2018see\u2019 and \u2018seeing\u2019 and along with a lot of other duplicate features. They are certainly not duplicates, but they are unnecessary in the sense that they do not give you additional information about the message.", "Therefore, separating the two hinders the performance of the machine learning algorithm because it is unnecessary information. Also, this repetition increases the number of features so that the classification can face the \u2018curse of dimensionality\u2019. To overcome this problem, we have two methods, Stemming and Lemmatization.", "Stemming is a rule-based technique that just chops off the suffix of a word to get its root form, which is called the \u2018stem\u2019. For example, if you use a stemmer to stem the words of the string \u2014 \u201cThe driver is racing in his boss\u2019 car\u201d, the words \u2018driver\u2019 and \u2018racing\u2019 will be converted to their root form by just chopping off the suffixes \u2018er\u2019 and \u2018ing\u2019. So, \u2018driver\u2019 will be converted to \u2018driv\u2019 and \u2018racing\u2019 will be converted to \u2018rac\u2019.", "You might think that the root forms (or stems) don\u2019t resemble the root words \u2014 \u2018drive\u2019 and \u2018race\u2019. You don\u2019t have to worry about this because the stemmer will convert all the variants of \u2018drive\u2019 and \u2018racing\u2019 to those root forms only. So, it will convert \u2018drive\u2019, \u2018driving\u2019, etc. to \u2018driv\u2019, and \u2018race\u2019, \u2018racer\u2019, etc. to \u2018rac\u2019. This gives us satisfactory results in most cases.", "Lemmatization is a more sophisticated technology that does not cut the suffix of a word. Instead, it takes the input word and goes through all the variations of dictionary words and searches for its source word. The root word, in this case, is called a lemma. The terms \u2018foot\u2019, \u2018drive\u2019, \u2018\u2019 up \u2018\u2019, \u2018\u2019 up \u2018\u2019 and \u2018\u2019 bought \u2018\u2019 cannot be reduced to their proper basic form with the stemmer. But the lemmatizer can reduce them to the correct basic form. The most popular lemmatizer is the Wordnet lemmatizer created by a team of researchers at Princeton University. You can read more about it here.", "However, you may sometimes be confused about whether to use a stemmer or lemmatizer. The following factors can help you make a decision:", "Generally, you can try both and see if it is worth using a lemmatizer on the stemmer.", "That\u2019s it for today folks. Feedbacks are appreciated. Also, if you want me to cover any of the above topics in detail then please leave it in the response.
