You can learn more about Wales at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wales.", "The Wales workplace employment by industry, year-on-year is available at https://statswales.gov.wales/Catalogue/Business-Economy-and-Labour-Market/People-and-Work/Employment/Jobs/Whole-Workforce/workplaceemployment-by-industry-area. This is where we will scrape our dataset from. For the sake of understanding the fundamentals of Data Analytics, let us consider 10 years of employment data, which shall be between the period 2009 and 2018.", "There are 10 industries available for which the data has been collected. The industries are Agriculture, Production, Construction, Retail, ICT, Finance, Real Estate, Professional Services, Public Administration and all the other remaining sectors and services are put under the Other_Services.", "We shall be using Python for the task and the following packages:", "The first step is to download the dataset. Open the Webpage, click on the year 2009 in the drop-down box that is available on the top left, and click on export as CSV file. Repeat the same for all the years till 2018. This way, we shall have 10 CSV files stored in the same folder.", "The next step is to create a data frame in python, with which we can work on further.", "The function data_extraction() will be the first function we will write, which is going to extract the needed data from each of the CSV file, and store it in a list \u201clist_values\u201d and then store it in a dictionary \u201call_years\u201d. This is the dictionary from which we shall create the data frame. The function also checks for any null values in the data. On running the code, we can find that there are no null values, and hence we need not worry at this point about dealing with null values. (P.S That is a topic of its own)", "The function create_dataframe() shall use the dictionary \u201call_years\u201d and create the data frame \u201cdf\u201d.", "Let\u2019s now consider a particular year, say 2009, and then look at the number of employees in each of the industry by plotting simple line charts. We will then loop it over to get similar charts for every year between 2009 and 2018.", "The advantage of such a plot is that visually we can identify which industry has performed the best and worst with respect to the number of employments.", "For example, when we look at the plot for the year 2009 (check \u201cFigure 2\u201d), a very easy inference is that the \u201cPublic_Administration\u201d industry has employed the maximum number of people in 2009 and \u201cReal_Estate\u201d has employed the lowest number of people in 2009.", "Another inference is that \u201cICT, Finance and Real-estate\u201d have a near equal number of employees and \u201cPublic Administration and Retail Sectors\u201d have a near equal number of employees.", "Let us now try to check which industries have shown the highest and the lowest percentage overall growth, over the period 2009\u20132018.", "The output of this function tells us that the overall growth of the Real_Estate sector in terms of the number of employments has been a tremendous 86.67%. On the other hand, the lowest overall growth is shown by the Retail Industry, which is a mere 0.6% growth over 10 years in terms of the number of employments.", "Till now, we saw how to extract the data, create the data frame, found if there were any null values, plotted a few line charts to find the best and the worst-performing industries for each year, and also we found which industries had the highest and the lowest percentage overall growth over the period 2009\u201318.", "Now we shall move a step ahead and try to get more insight into the employment landscape of Wales.", "We shall now create dynamic scatter plots using \u201cPlotly\u201d to show the change of workforce number over the period. Let us look at the actual plots to understand this better.", "The above function yields the required plots. The plots will open up in your default browser with a local IP.", "In the First Plot in Figure 3, we have plotted the number of employments in each year for the \u201cProduction\u201d industry. In the second plot, we have the change in the numbers from their respective previous year numbers. Let\u2019s understand this better.", "See the second plot of Figure 3. The year 2009 always has the value 0, since it is the start of the timeframe of consideration. From there on, each of the value on the y-axis for the current x-axis value indicates the change in numbers from their previous x-axis\u2019s y-axis value.", "We can notice a line passing through the graph. This line is the OLS (ordinary least squares) regression line. You can learn more about Ordinary least squares here. It is basically a linear regression line which is very helpful for us to get some insights on the trend in the data. For example, in the First Plot of Figure 3, the regression line shows a growing trend, which means there is more probability that year 2019, 2020 and so on.. shall have a higher number of employments over 2009\u201318.", "But here is the billion-dollar question. If the first plot shows a growing trend then why does figure 3\u2019s second plot show a neutral trend (a straight horizontal line)(i.e. the change is remaining constant).", "The second plot of Figure 3 is something like a derivative of the first plot. The neutral trend shows us that the change has remained constant on an average over the period 2009\u201318. To get the answer to our billion-dollar question, consider an industry \u201cX\u201d which has a change of +2000 employees each year. i.e. Each year the number of employments increase by 2000. This means the first plot of Figure 3 has to show an increasing trend. But since the change remains constant in our imaginary scenario, the second plot will have a neutral trend line. i.e. The neutral trend line indicates that the change is constant.", "We also have violin plots to the right of each of the plots in Figure 3. These plots give us the maximum-minimum numbers and also show us (with a bulge) in which range, the maximum number of data points are found. The bulged region indicate that more number of data points lie in this region.", "Its time for Principal Component Analysis. The first question is why? Let us consider each year as a dimension. Which means our data is now \u201c10-dimensional\u201d. But do you really think we can visualise and understand a 10-dimensional graph? The maximum dimensions, an average human being can visualise and understand is \u201c3-Dimensions\u201d. To make things simple, we use Principal Component Analysis to reduce our 10-Dimension dataset to a 2 or 3 Dimensional dataset, so that it is easy for us to visualise and understand the data. This is known as Dimensionality Reduction in stats.", "With this code, we are reducing our 10-dimensional dataset to a 2-dimensional dataset.", "When we plot the newly created two-dimensional dataset (Figure 4), we can find that there are several industries that naturally cluster together. For example, a very obvious cluster is the Red, Yellow, Blue and the Black Dots in the bottom left of the plot which corresponds to the Agriculture, Finance, Construction and the Real Estate Industries respectively.", "Clusters indicate that they are more correlated to each other over the period 2009\u201318. Which means, the trend of change in the number of employments in the industries within a cluster is almost similar. We can observe that naturally, four clusters are occurring and interestingly the Professional Services industry is the only industry in its cluster.", "Till now, We created dynamic plots using Plotly and used the Principal Component Analysis Technique to reduce the number of dimensions in our dataset. We finished by asking \u201cIf the industries within a cluster found in the PCA Plot are really correlated?\u201d. Let\u2019s get back to this question shortly.", "What we will be doing now is that we shall be finding the correlation between the industries over the period 2009\u201318. The correlation between any two entities can range between -1 and 1 where -1 is the least value possible and indicate that the industries are highly \u201cUncorrelated / Negatively Correlated\u201d and a maximum value of +1 indicate that the industries are highly \u201cCorrelated\u201d. It can take any value between -1 and +1. Okay, what do two industries being correlated / negatively correlated really mean in our context? Let\u2019s not forget that we are working with the employment numbers here. This means if two industries are highly correlated, then the trend of change in the number of employment is similar for them. i.e. To understand this, Let\u2019s again take an imaginary scenario of two industries X and Y and assume their correlation value to be +1. This means if the number of employees in X rise by M percentage, then there is a very high chance (theoretically, it is 100%) that the number of employees in Y will also rise by M percentage.", "Now that we understood what correlation really means, let us look at the correlation between each of the pair of industries in our dataset.", "These few lines of code give us what is called the Correlation Matrix\u2019s Heat Map.", "We can infer from Figure 5 that the maximum value of Correlation (Except the value \u201c1\u201d, because the correlation with itself, will always be equal to 1) is 0.8. This means the Professional Services and the Other Services are 80% Correlated. Meaning, a change in M percentage of employment numbers in the Professional Services sector can possibly (80% chance) result in a change of around M percentage in all the sub-sectors in the Other Services Category.", "Here\u2019s the catch, if you remember in the previous part of the article we said that there are 4 naturally occurring clusters in the PCA plot and in one of the clusters, Professional Services is the only member. Which means, according to the analysis we did in our PCA Plot, Professional Services and Other Services are uncorrelated (in other words, they don\u2019t belong to the same cluster). But in the correlation matrix, we find that they are 80% correlated and have the highest correlation value between any two industries. IRONY? Where did we go wrong? Pause reading this article and think for a couple of minutes on where could we have possibly gone wrong in our analysis.", "Got the answer? No issues, I am here to help you out. In PCA, we did dimensionality reduction. The Principal Components 1 and 2 are a representation of the 10 dimensions. But these two principal components are not of equal worth to us. To understand this, consider a company X where there are two shareholders A and B (These two shareholders are the Principal Components 1 and 2). Consider that, \u2018A\u2019 holds 75% shares of the company X and \u2018B\u2019 holds just 25% of the shares. Now tell me, if A had to take a decision in the company, does B\u2019s opinion really matter? No right. A has the complete authority to make decisions for the company. Similarly, we need to find out how much is the worth of the two Principal Components 1 and 2.", "With this single line of code, we can get the Variation in the Principal Components. And voila! the output is", "Saw it? This indicates that the first Principal Component, PC1 accounts for 99.8% of the variation and the second Principal Component, PC2 accounts for only ~0.1%. If we increase the number of Principal Components to 3 (i.e. if we want three dimensions in our dataset), the third Principal Component, PC3 will have a further lesser value compared to PC2.", "Now things seem to fall in place. We can see that PC1 tells 99.8% about the industries, and PC2 contributes only ~0.1% to this information. What we actually needed to plot was just the PC1 and not the PC2.", "Scroll Up to the PCA plot, and imagine collapsing the y-axis. i.e. imagine the \u2018y-value\u2019 for everything to be only 0. (in other words, project all points on the x-axis). Now there will be just two clusters occurring, one to the right with two points and one to the left with all the other points. Which tells us that, we need to now move ahead from just PCA plots since they don\u2019t give us much information on the relationship between the industries.", "We will now look at the K-Means Clustering technique and see if it can provide better results than that of simple PCA plots.", "But here\u2019s the catch. We cannot work with 10 dimensions. But the dimensionality reduction technique of PCA wasn\u2019t that fruitful in this fundamental analysis. There are several other dimensionality reduction techniques that are available, but to keep things simple, what we shall do is find out the best and worst-performing years for each of the industry and create a data frame something like this.", "This way, I am making it a two-dimensional dataset. Let us have the k-value to be 2. i.e. The number of clusters required to be 2.", "This gives us the following plot.", "In Figure 6, we can see that our problem has been solved to an extent. The Professional Services and the Other Services are now in one single cluster (The Purple Cluster). But we will not stop here and increase the number of clusters to 3 and then to 4.", "We can see that the 4-Means seems to little overfit the data, and 2-Means seems to little under-fit the data. 3-Means seem to be optimal. i.e. The industries can be grouped into 3 clusters.", "And yes, we have neared the end of this article on Understanding Fundamental Data Analytics with the employment landscape of Wales. To conclude, we must understand Why did we do all this? What is the purpose of such Data Analytics?", "The main purpose of any Data Analysis is Intelligence. It can be Business Intelligence or Environmental Intelligence (From Environmental Data) or any other Intelligence. This helps the decision-makers to make better decisions. Let us understand how, with a simple scenario. Consider an imaginary situation wherein, in Wales, there are sudden large layoffs in the Construction Industry. Now since the numbers are significant, the government begins to notice this and starts taking action on this serious issue. But the government now also has extra information in their hands, i.e. they now know with the help of our data analysis that the trend in the employment numbers in the Construction industry is 73% correlated with the Agriculture Sector. So the government can now take action on the layoffs in the Construction industry and as well take preventive measures to prevent any such unfortunate incidents in the Agriculture sector. Such preventive steps can make a huge impact on a nation\u2019s economy by preventing any severe economic impact. This was just one simple scenario for understanding the power of Data.", "The analysis we have done so far is just a drop in the ocean. Data has so much information hidden in them, and when properly used, they are one of the most powerful assets in this era.", "Thanks for your time!
