According to a Nilson Report, the amount of global credit card fraud alone was USD 7.6 billion in 2010. In the UK fraudulent credit card transaction losses were estimated at more than USD 1 billion in 2018. To counter these kinds of financial losses a huge amount of resources are employed to identify frauds and anomalies in every single industry.", "In data science, \u201cOutlier\u201d, \u201cAnomaly\u201d and \u201cFraud\u201d are often synonymously used, but there are subtle differences. An \u201coutliers\u2019 generally refers to a data point that somehow stands out from the rest of the crowd. However, when this outlier is completely unexpected and unexplained, it becomes an anomaly. That is to say, all anomalies are outliers but not necessarily all outliers are anomalies. In this article, however, I am using these terms interchangeably.", "There are numerous reasons why understanding and detecting outliers are important. As a data scientist when we make data preparation we take great care in understanding if there is any data point unexplained, which may have entered erroneously. Sometimes we filter completely legitimate outlier data points and remove them to ensure greater model performance.", "There is also a huge industrial application of anomaly detection. Credit card fraud detection is the most cited one but in numerous other cases anomaly detection is an essential part of doing business such as detecting network intrusion, identifying instrument failure, detecting tumor cells etc.", "A range of tools and techniques are used to detect outliers and anomalies, from simple statistical techniques to complex machine learning algorithms, depending on the complexity of data and sophistication needed. The purpose of this article is to summarise some simple yet powerful statistical techniques that can be readily used for initial screening of outliers. While complex algorithms can be inevitable to use, sometimes simple techniques are more than enough to serve the purpose.", "Below is a primer on five statistical techniques.", "Z-score is probably the simplest one yet an useful statistical measure for anomaly detection. In a statistical distribution, Z-score tells you how far is a given data point from the rest of the crowd. Technically speaking, Z-score measures how many standard deviations away a given observation is from the mean. A Z-score of 2 means that the data point is 2 standard deviation far from the mean.", "To calculate Z-score you only need two parameters: mean and standard deviation, and they are fairly easy to get in any programming language (for example in Python you just apply the functiondescribe() to a data frame).", "Once these two parameters are obtained, Z-score for any given data point is calculated using the following simple formula:", "Z-score is easy to calculate using mean and standard deviation, but it has its own limitations. There are a few situations when it\u2019s not an ideal technique, for example:", "In addition to these, Z-score is sensitive to extreme values (because one of its parameters \u2014 mean \u2014 itself is sensitive to extreme values), so it may fail to screen outliers appropriately.", "To overcome these shortcomings, several modifications are made to the standard Z-score:", "Putting them all together, the equation looks like the following:", "If you arrange data from small to large, the mid-point is called the median. The median splits data into two halves. The mid-points of each of these halves is called a quartile.", "In other words, you can split data into 3 quartiles \u2014 1st, 2nd and 3rd (the 2nd quartile has a name for it\u2014 the median). So the Interquartile Range is the distance between 1st and 3rd quartiles. The theory behind anomaly detection using IQR is that, if a data point is too far from the 1st and 3rd quartile, it probably is an outlier.", "IQR can be used standalone for outlier detection, but boxplots below use the same algorithmic theory and are probably more intuitive than IQR.", "Boxplot provides a better graphical representation of IQR, but also provides additional information.", "In the boxplot below, the length of the box is IQR, and the minimum and maximum values are represented by the whiskers. The whiskers are generally extended into 1.5*IQR distance on either side of the box. Therefore, all data points outside these 1.5*IQR values are flagged as outliers.", "I wrote a separate article on boxplot for outlier detection with an example and a small snippet of Python, you might want to check that out.", "The final statistical tool for outlier detection is the distribution plot or histogram. It\u2019s another way of tracking outliers both visually and programmatically. Take a look at the following figure for example:", "From this distribution plot alone it is pretty clear that while most values in the dataset are grouped together, there are quite a few values that seem to be out of the ordinary. So you could filter those values and check whether these are anomalies or not.", "However, if the distribution of the data is skewed, sometimes you may need to apply data transformation techniques (e.g. logarithmic or square roots). For example, if we apply a logarithm to the same data as above, the data becomes approximately normally distributed and tells a different story about outliers.", "The purpose of this article was to introduce five simple statistical techniques \u2014 z-score, modified z-score, IQR, boxplot and histogram \u2014 that are commonly used in data science as coarse filters for outlier/anomaly detection. Sometimes these simple techniques are good enough for anomaly detection, but sometimes we need to move on to more sophisticated machine learning algorithms \u2014 kNN, SVM, DBSCAN etc. \u2014 a subject of my future articles (stay tuned!).", "If you like my articles feel free to follow me on Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
