The event was called Welcome to the Forest and was described as \u201cthe biggest party Waltham Forest has ever seen and everyone is invited\u201d.", "Families and children flocked to the forest, as did Sadiq Khan, the Mayor of London, and Justine Simons, Deputy Mayor for Culture, with all their mates! Hundreds of people from local arts organisations and musicians contributed. Sounds like loads of fun, right?", "Everyone was, in fact, invited, but unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to make the party! So, to overcome my FOMO, I decided to collect 3,300 tweets about the event using the official hashtag #WelcometotheForest. This blog post presents the findings of my analysis.", "Please scroll down to view my analysis via data visualizations!", "The official hashtag promoted by the organisers was #WelcometotheForest. At the time of the event, I used the Twitter API to collect 3,300 tweets which contained this hashtag. It\u2019s important to note that I only collected tweets that contained #WelcometotheForest; there were, of course, many tweets about Welcome to the Forest that did not contain the hashtag.", "Having collected the tweets, I performed a range of advanced statistical and machine learning techniques \u2014 notably, natural language processing and computer vision \u2014 to help me understand the event in a bit more detail.", "Specifically, I used the Google Cloud Natural Language API to calculate the sentiment for each tweet, then I used the gensim library\u2019s Word2Vec model to perform semantic analysis from the entire corpus of the tweets, additionally, I also used Google Cloud\u2019s Vision API to detect features and labels about each image uploaded online, and finally, I used a pre-trained convolutional neural network to undertake feature extraction and reverse image search to cluster those images based on visual similarity.", "The meat of my analysis draws insights from the 3,300 tweets I collected via the Twitter API. Below, I report on the following five metrics:", "The bar graph below shows all tweets from the Wednesday before the event to the Wednesday after the event, 9th to 16th January. The most popular day at Welcome to the Forest was Friday 11 January with 932 tweets using the hashtag #WelcometotheForest. However, a significant proportion (66% on average across all days) of the tweets were retweets (RT), so there were actually only 364 distinct tweets on Friday 11 January.", "The busiest time of the day (averaged across all days of the event) was in the late evening between 7 pm and 10 pm \u2014 8 pm was the busiest hour with 324 tweets in total (185 without retweets).", "In order to gauge whether the party was good or bad, I performed sentiment analysis. The sentiment for each tweet was calculated using Google\u2019s Cloud NLP API. The bar graph below shows the average sentiment of tweets per day, with -1 being very negative sentiment and +1 being very positive sentiment.", "We see that Welcome to the Forest started with relatively high sentiment, dipped on Thursday 10th January until climbing all the way up-hill to a very strong sentiment of 0.73. Overall, Welcome to the Forest had an average sentiment across all days at 0.57, which is very good! Looks like I missed out on a lot of fun\u2026", "The bar graphs below show the number of times a word and also a hashtag appeared throughout the body of all the tweets, left and right, respectively. It\u2019s worth noting that because hashtags also appear in the body of the tweet, they become a confounding variable when calculating the frequency of words. Therefore, I took steps to remove the hashtag count from the word count.", "Predictably, the hashtag #welcometotheforest appeared the most, however, interestingly, the hashtags #wfculture19 and #mylocalculture also appeared in abundance. Even after discounting the hashtag count, the word \u201cwfculture19\u201d appeared the most, followed by \u201cculture\u201d, but \u201cwfcouncil\u201d and \u201cerlandcooper\u201d also got some shoutouts!", "I did a quick Google search on the back of this information and I found that #wfculture19 and #mylocalculture are official hashtags being promoted by Waltham Forest Council\u2019s and the Mayor of London\u2019s Culture team\u2019s twitter accounts.", "However, the results above are not very useful in telling us what people thought about the event. In the subset above, we only find nouns rather than adjectives. Accordingly, I used other machine learning techniques to try and unearth some adjectives.", "In order to get a more granular understanding of the text from the tweets, I undertook semantic analysis using natural language processing and machine learning.", "Word2Vec is a neural language machine learning model that takes a large corpus of text \u2014 in this case, the text from the 3,300 tweet \u2014 as input and outputs a vector space, typically of several hundred dimensions, with each unique word corresponding to a vector in space \u2014 a word embedding. Specifically, objects that are closer together in that space mean that they are similar. \u201cNearest neighbours\u201d are the handful of words from the Word2Vec model that are most similar to \u201cWelcometotheForest \u201d based on a cosine metric similarity score. The scatter plot below shows the nearest neighbours for \u201cWelcometotheForest\u201d.", "Importantly, the words \u201cfantastic\u201d, \u201cfun\u201d, \u201cenjoy\u201d and \u201cproud\u201d are close by, and also \u201cchildren\u201d, \u201cfamilies\u201d and \u201cinvolved\u201d. This is a very positive outcome! It statistically demonstrates that these words most represent how people felt when they tweeted about Welcome to the Forest. It seems like it was a very enjoyable and inclusive event!", "After retrieving useful textual information from the tweets, I finally turned to the image data. 732 tweets outs of the 3,300 tweets in total had images attached to them. Using those images, I programmed the computer to learn visual similarities between them. A technique called feature extraction and reverse image search did exactly this.", "Using a Keras VGG16 neural network model running on a TensorFlow backend, I first extracted a feature for each image in the dataset. A feature is a 4096-element array of numbers for each image. Our expectations are that \u201cthe feature forms a very good representation of the image such that similar images will have a similar feature\u201d (Gene Kogan, 2018). Then the feature\u2019s dimensions were reduced using principal component analysis (PCA) to create an embedding, and the distance \u2014 cosine distance \u2014 of one image\u2019s PCA embedding to another was computed.", "Now that I had an embedding for each image in a vector space, I used a popular machine learning visualization algorithm called t-SNE to cluster and then visualise that vector space in 2-dimensions. \u201cThe aim of tSNE is to cluster small \u201cneighbourhoods\u201d of similar data points while also reducing the overall dimensionality of the data so it is more easily visualized\u201d (Google AI Blog, 2018).", "The image above shows really good clustering for Nest by Marshmallow Laser Feast in the top right-hand corner and Into The Forest by Greenaway & Greenaway in the bottom right-hand corner.", "So there you have it! Although sitting at my laptop doing research about the party did not make up for all the fun that I missed out on, I did learn a lot about the event! There is still huge potential to dig into the tweets further.", "Congratulations on such a great event and achievement and all the best for the rest of the year as London\u2019s Borough of Culture!", "Vishal is a Cultural Data Scientist and Research Student at The Bartlett at UCL in London. He is interested in the economic and social impact of culture in cities. You can get in touch with him on Twitter or LinkedIn.
