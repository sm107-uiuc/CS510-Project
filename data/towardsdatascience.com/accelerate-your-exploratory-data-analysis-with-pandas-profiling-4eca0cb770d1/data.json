We achieve this by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This includes finding out the data type of each variable, the distribution of the target variable, number of distinct values for each predictor variable, if there is any duplicate or missing values in the data set etc.", "If you have ever done EDA on any data set (and I assume you have as you are reading this article), I don\u2019t need to tell you how time consuming this process can be. And if you have been a part of many data science projects (be it in your job or by doing personal projects) you know how repetitive all these process can be. But with the Open source library Pandas-profiling that doesn\u2019t have to be the case anymore.", "Pandas-profiling is an open source library that can generate beautiful interactive reports for any data set, with just a single line of code. Sound\u2019s interesting? Let\u2019s take a look at the documentation to get a better understanding of what it does.", "Pandas-profiling generates profile reports from a pandas DataFrame. The pandas df.describe() function is great but a little basic for serious exploratory data analysis. pandas_profiling extends the pandas DataFrame with df.profile_report() for quick data analysis.", "For each column the following statistics \u2014 if relevant for the column type \u2014 are presented in an interactive HTML report:", "Now that we know what pandas-profiling is all about, let\u2019s see how to install it and use it in a Jupyter Notebook or in Google Colab in the following section.", "You can install pandas-profiling very easily using pip package manager with the following command:", "Alternatively, you could install the latest version directly from Github:", "If you are using conda, then you can use the following command to installation", "Google colab comes pre-installed with Pandas-profiling, but unfortunately it comes with an older version of it (v1.4). If you are following this article or the GitHub documentation, then the code will not run on Google Colab unless you install the latest version of the library (v2.6).", "To do that, you need to first uninstall the existing library and install the latest one as follows:", "Now to install, we need to run the pip install command.", "Now that we are done with the prerequisites, let\u2019s get into the fun part of analyzing some data set.", "The data set I will be using for this example is the Titanic data set.", "To generate the report, run the following code in the notebook.", "That\u2019s it. With a single line of code you have generated the a detailed profile report. Now let us see the results by including the report in the notebook.", "This will include the interactive report as HTML iframe in the notebook.", "Save the report as a HTML file using the following code:", "Or obtain the data as JSON using:", "Now that we know how to generate reports using pandas-profiling, let\u2019s look at the result.", "Pandas_profiling creates a very descriptive overview of the predictor variables, by calculating the total missing cells, duplicate rows, number of distinct values, missing values, zeros for the predictor variables. It also marks the variables that have high cardinality or have missing values in the warning section, as you can see in the above image.", "Besides all these, it generates detailed analysis for each variable. I will go through some of them in this article, to see the full report with all the codes, find the colab link at the end of the article.", "For the numerical features, besides having detailed statistics like mean, standard deviation, min, max, Interquartile range (IQR) etc. it also plots the histogram, gives the list of common and extreme values.", "Similar to the numerical features, for categorical features it calculates common values, lengths, characters etc.", "One of the most interesting things is the interactions and correlation sections of the report. In the interaction section the pandas_profiling library automatically generates interaction plots for every pair of variables. You can get the interaction plot of any pair by selecting the specific variables from the two headers (Like in this example, I have selected passengerId and Age)", "Correlation is a statistical technique that can show whether and how strongly pairs of variables are related. For example, height and weight are related; taller people tend to be heavier than shorter people. The relationship isn\u2019t perfect. People of the same height vary in weight, and you can easily think of two people you know where the shorter one is heavier than the taller one. Nonetheless, the average weight of people 5'5'\u2019 is less than the average weight of people 5'6'\u2019, and their average weight is less than that of people 5'7'\u2019, etc. Correlation can tell you just how much of the variation in peoples\u2019 weights is related to their heights.", "The main result of a correlation is called the correlation coefficient (or \u201cr\u201d). It ranges from -1.0 to +1.0. The closer r is to +1 or -1, the more closely the two variables are related.", "If r is close to 0, it means there is no relationship between the variables. If r is positive, it means that as one variable gets larger the other gets larger. If r is negative it means that as one gets larger, the other gets smaller (often called an \u201cinverse\u201d correlation).", "When it comes to generating correlation matrix for all the numerical features, the pandas_profiling library gives us all the popular options to choose from including Pearson\u2019s r, Spearman\u2019s \u03c1 etc.", "Now that, we know the advantages of using pandas_profiling, it is also useful to note the disadvantage that this library has.", "The main disadvantage of pandas profiling is its use with large data sets. With the increase in the size of the data the time to generate the report also increases a lot.", "One way to solve this problem is to generate the profile report for a part of the data set. But while doing this, it is very important to make sure that the data is randomly sampled so that it is representative of all the data we have. We can do this by:", "Alternatively, if you are insistent on getting the report on the whole data set, you can do that by using the minimal mode. In the minimal mode a simplified report will be generated with less information than the full one but it can be generated relatively quickly for a large data set. The code for the same is given below:", "Now that you know what is pandas-profiling and how to use it, I hope it will save you a ton of time which you can use for more advanced analysis specific to the problem in hand.", "If you want to get the full report with working code, you can take a look at the following notebook.
