I did my graduation in Statistics and Mathematics, followed with a certification course in Machine Learning. Machine Learning seemed fun. It consisted of playing with data, making suitable models, trying to get the highest accuracy after deploying countless suitable algorithms. The thing about Machine Learning that really turned me on was its applications. Just imagine, predicting the future based on the past behavior, making data-driven strategies that would save millions of dollars for any business, saving lives by predicting if a cell in a human body might turn malign, discovering new resources and technologies that improve the standard of living for people around the globe and many more! I had a glimpse of an idea of what this technology was capable of doing. We are talking about paradigm-shifting technology here.", "With my limited skill and a passionate entrepreneurial spirit, I left my first job on the eve of my 22nd birthday and started exploring more about this industry. I started my own analytics firm shortly, naming it Enka (not to be confused with Turkish construction company). I was alone in this, no official partner or colleague to work with. Fortunately, I got my first client immediately, one of my relatives who is into sanitary pad manufacturing business. It was a startup and a pretty advanced one for the industry. My uncle and his team, from the very inception focused on creating a data-infrastructure to improve business efficiencies and by the time he became my first client, a large database had been created. I took over the project with limitless enthusiasm. As I am writing this article, a few months have passed and I am nearing the end of my project. I learnt some valuable lessons along the way which I would like to share with the readers:", "The most important thing for any service providing business is to understand the problem-statement, that is, the problem that the client is facing, the problem that the client wants to solve. That is the first step of any project. However, it easier said than done. Most of the times, the problems that the client faces are very generic and non-quantifiable. For example, say, the generic problem statement is, measuring the productivity of the sales team employed by the organization. That satisfies most, but when it comes to putting some substance to it, the analyst might wonder what is the Key Performance Indicator (KPI) for the problem statement. How can one say if the sales team is productive? What is the benchmark for productivity?", "There is a plethora of data with millions of observations and multiple columns. It will be easy to get lost if the objective is not clear. That is why, it is very important to have a well-defined problem statement, which is only possible if there is a more profound understanding between the client and the analyst. It is the job of the analyst to ask questions that helps him derive meaningful answers from the data.", "Read about the industry the client belongs to", "There are two types of analytics firms. One that specializes in a particular industry, the other that handles multiple industries. My firm belongs to the latter. It is not quite possible to have a knowledge of every industry one is going to serve as a data analyst/scientist. However, knowledge helps. Having a knowledge about an industry helps analyst to put context to the findings. Things start to make more sense and errors can easily be identified. Depending on the problem statement, the data analyst/scientist gets an intuitive idea of what the data might present and what could be the underlying reason for it. More importantly, it also helps one to differentiate between correlation and causation, if a relationship is found to be statistically significant between variables. In my opinion, this is the fun part about data analytics. You get to learn about different industries in this journey.", "Stay in touch with the client while performing the analysis", "Numerous times, there is a communication gap between the analyst and the client. This is a bigger problem than it sounds. At times, the industries which the client belongs to are such that it changes rapidly. If the analyst fails to understand these changes, the results can be misleading. One way to counter the issue is to be in constant touch with the client. The analysis can thus be tailored to the client needs as and when required. Also, the client is assumed to be an expert in her field. Her expertise, combined with the analyst\u2019s skills produce a more meaningful result. Keeping the client involved early on will also help not get off the track, as the intentions and objectives will often be discussed.", "Be a good Data Analyst, then a good Data Scientist", "Data Science appears to be a more appealing job than Data Analysis. However, the latter is a stepping stone to be a good Data Scientist. If you are not a good Data Analyst, you can never be a good Data Scientist. When I started into this field, I made a big mistake of directly jumping into Data Science, without focusing much Data Analysis. I learnt the importance of Data Analysis the hard way. A model will never perform efficiently if the input data is garbage. Also, Data Analysis gives hidden insights into the data. Descriptive and Diagnostic Analytics can be used to identify patterns in the data which then further complements model-building (Predictive and Prescriptive Analytics). Data Analysis also helps the analyst to understand the data, get an intuition about the data which further helps the analyst in the more advanced stages of analytics.", "Communicate results in a precise and effective way", "One of the major challenges I faced in my first project was communicating the results. The findings and all the efforts will go in vain if the results are not understood by the client. It thus becomes necessary to dedicate much thought and effort to this final section. Graphs should be used as much as possible as they can be understood in one go. Often the client will not have time to read through a 10-page report. Hence, the findings should be as precise as possible, with necessary context and self-explanatory graphs. It should be structured in form of a story. While making graphs, it is important to use appropriate color palettes. Using colors not appealing to the eye can have a negative impact on the report. Secondly, the graphs should not be too messy. It should be simplistic and easily conveys the findings. Its easier said than done. Therefore, this section should not be taken lightly.", "These were a few of the many things I learnt in my first project as a Data Analyst. It was a brilliant experience, full of challenges and learning. I learnt something almost everyday. It was frustrating at times but eventually I found a solution after a few minutes or hours of brainstorming.", "Your home for data science.
