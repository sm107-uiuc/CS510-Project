Business Intelligence as a Data Scientist \u2014 Part 1 in the series touched on the similarities between the two professions. I firmly believe that Data Science and Business Intelligence are intrinsically related \u2014 I will again discuss the fine print between both professions and follow on with an example. As ever, the code for this is hosted on my Github, and you can get me on LinkedIn.", "For the discussion section of this post, I wanted to talk about the broader definitions and difference between Business Intelligence and Data Science. Both jobs involve a similar workflow:", "Let\u2019s do a brief, one sentence of each step:", "1. Import your data \u2014 this might be from a Data Warehouse, Lake, text file, JSON, all of the above \u2014 whatever source you are working with", "2. Tidy your data \u2014 again this depends on the context of what you are doing, but you are likely going to filter out some irrelevant stuff, do something with missing data, clean up some messy data points \u2014 it\u2019s well documented that this step and the next steps are where you will spend most of your time", "3. Visualise, Model, Transform \u2014 it\u2019s not possible to explain this in one sentence, but we can try! These steps involve a washing machine of visualisation and exploratory data analysis, selecting a model for your task, transforming your data to fit the required format of this model (see one-hot encoding, feature engineering, tokenisation), visualisation of features and model performance", "4. Infer the results of the model \u2014 our model says 96%, what is this number? Is it accuracy, is accuracy the correct metric for this problem? Do we need to worry about overfitting, or sampling error? Is the baseline 98% and therefore our model is garbage?", "5. If we are lucky enough to get this far, what do we need to do to productionise the model? Either:", "a. Promote the model to live and start creating real predictions automatically (there is a whole other workflow after this step ensuring your model stays relevant, do you want automatic retraining etc.)", "b. Communicate the findings of the model \u2014 I often find people are interested in why the model thinks the way that it does \u2014 see feature importance, decoding the black box. Finding out the significant factors in a prediction can be more useful than the prediction itself sometimes \u2014 I have seen businesses change their processes in ways like not sending out invoices to clients on Tuesday afternoons because that\u2019s when a client does some strange internal activity and our invoice gets lost in filing. This outcome came directly from a model built to predict payment reliability in a streaming environment, and never made it to live because the decision tree\u2019s were more interesting than predicting invoices on the fly", "I\u2019ll admit \u2014 the above workflow is a Data Science workflow, taken from a highly reputable Data Science source (the RStudio Github page) \u2014 obviously those guys know what they are talking about! However \u2014 let\u2019s consider the workflow of a Business Intelligence Analyst, tasked with creating a KPI dashboard for their Finance department:", "1. Query some Finance data from the Data Warehouse \u2014 the Import and Tidy steps have been done for us in the Data Warehouse ETL", "2. Do any transformations/filtering/column imputations on the data so it fits the necessary format/shape for our Finance dashboard", "3. Visualise the output \u2014 does our dashboard show what we want it to show?", "4. QA the visualisation to make sure the figures in the output match up to validated sources (infer the output?) \u2014 it\u2019s no good if the total revenue shown in our dashboard is different to values shown elsewhere in the business", "5. Communicate the work to business users. At this point, one of two things will happen:", "a. The business users ask for changes to the work you have done, in which case, repeat steps 2 through 5", "b. The business users are happy with the work, in which case, the next steps are to automate the dashboard and promote to the Live environment", "Does my highly summarised 5-step Business Intelligence workflow seem similar to my highly summarised 5-step Data Science workflow pictured above? I have been a bit biased to fit my own narrative, and there are a couple of steps missed out \u2014 although you could argue this for the DS workflow as well \u2014 but it seems to me the two flows are not massively dissimilar. We can even create a diagram:", "Not a million miles apart in my opinion. A key step omitted from both workflows, is that both workflows start and end with a business user. In each case there is a user who is asking a business question of the analytics teams. After the analytics team has worked their magic, we are expecting the output to change the way that the business behaves \u2014 this might be not sending out invoices on Tuesdays, or it could be a Finance dashboard showing the revenue this client has brought in for this year to date.", "This is a massively, massively broad overview of two workflows. The types of data a Data Scientist and a Business Intelligence Analyst will work with are hugely different, and therefore the Query, Import and Tidy steps on the left-hand side are totally unlike from a technical perspective. As well as this, the end products of both workflows are very different \u2014 BI deals with exact, historic figures \u2014 for example, the revenue for our company last month was \u00a350,000. DS deals with non-absolutes and predictions, for example the predicted revenue for our company next month will be \u00a355,000, within a 95% confidence interval, somewhere between \u00a352,250 and \u00a357,750. Technical aspects aside, a high-level overview of the two workflows shows what I consider to be a similarity in delivering an end-to-end product.", "Anyway \u2014 on to the coding part of the post. Part 1 of Business Intelligence as a Data Scientist spoke about the importance of branding. In summary \u2014 business users are used to seeing their reporting in a certain way, and it is absolutely your job to match your work to the corporate standards. Previously we built a Shiny app \u2014 this time we are going to create a ggplot2 package to automate the standardisation of published graphics. This is not a new idea \u2014 we are going to borrow heavily from the recently-published cookbook of standardisation by the BBC News data team. Their package is called bbplot \u2014 ours is named snareplot, after my fictional company Snare Industries. On reflection, I definitely should have called my package plantpot \u2014 bit late now though!", "Snareplot uses all the same theme elements from Part 1. The colour schemes were generated using colormind.io, and the package can be downloaded from my Github \u2014 you can install this using devtools.", "Snareplot uses 4 functions to switch up the default ggplot2 formatting. These functions are theme_snare(), scale_colour_snare(), scale_fill_snare(), and finalise_plot().", "Snareplot works by layering over an already built ggplot2 graphic. Let\u2019s apply theme_snare() to scatter_plot.", "There\u2019s a few things going on here \u2014 let\u2019s step into the function in the theme_snare.R file. Essentially we are setting a font (via the extrafont package), applying theme_bw() from ggplot2, and removing most elements from the theme. This can of course be customised however you like \u2014 I personally like a minimal theme with very little on it.", "Next, we will have a look at colours.", "The next two functions overwrite the color and fill arguments in ggplot. This takes us from the above plot, to this:", "Scale_colour_snare() and scale_fill_snare() both work by applying a colour palette to the plot. These are simple functions, but the colours have been chosen according to our Snare Industries branding, as discussed in Part 1. The important part here is the colours themselves \u2014 the functions simply save the user from remembering which html values to enter into scale_colour_manual().", "The fourth function in the snareplot package is finalise_plot(). This function takes two arguments \u2014 it looks for a ggplot2 object to be \u201cfinalised\u201d, and it asks the user whether or not to draw a background.", "Quite easy to see what this final function does! When the package is installed and this function is called, the image file in the /data/ repository is layered underneath the plot. This image muddies up the plot sometimes, so there is an option to render the plot without this image by setting draw_background = FALSE. The function also sets the Snare Industries Data Science watermark on the bottom left \u2014 this is set to brand the plot so we know that wherever it ends up around the business, it came from the Snare Industries Data Science team.", "Everything in Snareplot can be changed however you wish \u2014 I strongly recommend researching colour schemes and fonts for your organisation and using these in any ggplot2 graphics you create. This will create a brand identity for your team and ultimately help engage non-technical users in the business. Part 1 talks about this a lot \u2014 branding is an often neglected skill in the Data Scientist toolbox.", "That\u2019s it for part 2! As ever, all code is hosted on my Github, and you can follow me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
