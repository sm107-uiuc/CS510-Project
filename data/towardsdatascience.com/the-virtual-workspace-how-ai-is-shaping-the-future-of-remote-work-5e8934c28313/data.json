In the end, we are humans and so there is a lot to understand from looking at the other person\u2019s face. That is how we get to trust and feel for each other.", "So step one shall be to have everyone on camera that is focused on their faces, definitely not a low-quality video stream that shows a group of people from a bad angle.", "The challenge here is the reliability of our internet speeds which can sometimes be a blocker, also the head pose, the background, and the lightning can be a challenge.", "Many of us have heard about the virtual background feature that zoom has released that smoothly replace your background with a virtual one thanks to deep learning.", "But the real innovation comes from Nvidia that tackled the last three problems by using GANs. Rather than sending the whole bulky video stream, it just sends data about the key facial points (eyes, nose, mouse). Thanks to GANs, and given this small amount of info, the receiver can easily re-construct the same exact live video of the face with much higher quality while consuming a lot less bandwidth. And additionally, the newly produced video will easily be adjusted to give the perfect pose that ensures natural eye contact between the participants.", "For the longest time, people have been excited about creating a virtual world. A computer-simulated environment where everyone can have their own avatar and simultaneously and independently explore the virtual world, participate in its activities, and communicate with others. And while most of the virtual world environments have been created for entertainment, social, and education purposes like SecondLife, there is still a nice opportunity to leverage and fit this to our need for a virtual workspace where everyone can get to meet and interact with others.", "A Virtual reality workspace can even push us to leave the desk and move around while being fully immersed in a VR-based world. Facebook has already developed Horizon as a VR gaming environment but who said that we can\u2019t borrow the same ideas for work?", "In my opinion, very soon, we could start seeing a virtual workspace where we remote workers can have life-like digital avatars that represent our emotions, interactions, and facial expressions in a way that has never been expressed before.", "Part of this is already a reality! Samsung NEON, a project that aims to build an artificial human avatars that look and act exactly like the original characters it simulates was shown recently in CES 2020.", "And the other part is already being used. Once I got these thoughts I was curious to see if anyone worked on a similar solution and I was blessed and surprised to find that VirBELA, a work-oriented virtual environment based on the same gaming engine that powers \u201cFortnite\u201d has already hosted a conference event with more than 200 people!", "Additionally, companies started using RecRoom, the famous virtual world game for having some meetings, virtual outings and team events.", "In a virtual world, in addition to having more engagement in meetings, trainings and close collaboration, you will be able to have the same office routines you used to have whether you want to go to the pantry and have some small talk over lunch, or just some random chat over coffee.", "This way we will be able to move the office to the cloud! And rather than choosing between the office or home, we will basically bring all the features of the office to our homes.", "Personally, I\u2019m super excited to see how AI and VR will enable us to balance more between work and life. And how this era could drastically change the perception of work and productivity forever!", "Find me on Twitter @_ahmdkamal_, to get interesting updates about #AI and #tech.", "Do you know you can give up to 50 \ud83d\udc4f to this post \ud83d\ude09 ?!", "Clapping lets other people see it & encourages me to publish more high-quality content on medium!", "Your home for data science.
