In recent years it has exploded in popularity in a field widely known as Natural Language Processing (NLP). Translation, speech recognition, boots, and many other tools and applications are part of our lives and somehow utilizes some kind of algorithm or model related to NLP. Chances are that if you are working on a software project you might need to use tools to deal with NLP. Learning the basic theory and how to use traditional libraries can take time, so we present here a straightforward approach for analyzing audio files using services offered by AWS.", "The goal of this article is to present two AWS NLP tools, Amazon Transcribe, and Amazon Comprehend using Python and boto3. We are going to download some historical speeches from Youtube using Youtube-dl, transcribe it to text and perform sentiment analysis. We also are going to compare the audio transcription with the original transcription to evaluate the similarity and consistency of the model used by Amazon Transcribe.", "We will be using five historical speeches downloaded from Youtube to illustrate the potential of the aforementioned tools. You can find the history and the original transcription of the speeches on this great article published on the Art of Manliness by Brett & Kate McKay. The selected speeches are the following:", "In July the 4th of 1940 Winston Churchill went to the House of Commons to deliver one of the most courageous and important speeches in history. Europe was being rapidly conquered by the German army and France has already fallen into Hitler\u2019s control, and the British army had to retreat from the battle of Dunkirk. With this speech, Churchill invokes the British people to fight the Nazi menace discarding any chance of surrender, becoming the point of inflection in the history of World War II.", "Former US president Ronald Reagan showed the world his sense of leadership and freedom when by the Brandeburg Gate in June the 12th of 1987, side by side with the Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachov, he calls for an end to Cold War.", "Minister Martin Luther King Jr. was the main leader of the Civil Rights movement that happened in the 50's and 60's in the US. During the March on Washington in 1963, he delivered his famous \u201cI have a dream\u201d speech claiming for peace and respect between whites and blacks.", "Few Americans in history have come close to General Douglas MacArthur in terms of military life achievements. Having fought in three wars, he embodied the figure of duty and honor for a military leader. His final speech at West Point Academy is an ode to patriotism and respect to soldiers that have died in the name of freedom.", "Former US President John F. Kennedy was one of the greatest speakers in modern history and during an event in May the 25th of 1961 in Houston he communicated the nation and the world the goal for America and the humanity to go to the moon. Few times in our history projects have impacted so much science and modern society as the space race and moon landing.", "To follow this tutorial you need the following:", "A) Python3 with the following libraries installed: boto3, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, spacy, and wmd.", "B) An active account on AWS;", "C) AWS command-line interface (awscli) installed and configured;", "To increase readability and comprehension of this article I decided to show only the most important blocks of code of the analysis, but you can find all the details on the Jupyter notebook on my GitHub repository, including the code for doing the plots.", "To download the audio files from Youtube, we are going to use a command-line tool called Youtube-DL. After installing it, you can simply type the commands described below on the terminal with the URL of any Youtube video to download it. Youtube-DL was developed in Python and is in active development by the community on GitHub.", "Boto3 is the Python SDK developed by AWS for users to access its services. It calls AWS API and has two types of service access: Client and Resources. Client is a low-level service access and the response is in JSON format (Python dictionary). Resources is a high-level service access structured in an object-oriented way. You can basically use any of two types of service access independent of the task you need to perform on AWS, but in general, Resource can be used with fewer lines of code. For more information about boto3 please checkout Ralu Bolovan great article. We are going to do all of our analysis using Python on a Jupyter notebook and boto3 is going to be essential for the workflow.", "In order to convert our audio to a text, we are going to use Amazon Transcribe, an AWS service that offers automatic speech recognition for audio files located on an S3 bucket. It supports 9 different languages and a few variations: US English, British English, Australian English, French, Canadian French, US Spanish, ES Spanish, Italian, Brazilian Portuguese, German, Korean, Hindi, Indian-accented English, and Modern Standard Arabic. Amazon transcribe accepts files in 4 formats (mp3, mp4, wav, and flac) and has the capability of identifying multiple speakers on the audio, returning a respective transcription for each on one. If you have an audio file on an S3 bucket you can simply use its URL to create a transcription job on the AWS Transcribe console. But as we are doing our analysis in Python, we are going to use boto3 to call the AWS API to invoke the Transcribe job.", "Amazon Comprehend is the service found on the AWS ML/AI suite that offers a wide variety of functions for you to get insights from your text, like sentiment analysis, tokenization and identification of entities and classification of documents. We are going to use the tool for sentiment analysis on our transcriptions to try to capture the global message found on each of the speeches cited above.", "Spacy is an NLP library for Python that offers a great set of models already trained for 9 different languages. It was built on top of Cython and integrates easily with other Machine and Deep Learning libraries like TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn and Gensim, so it is really efficient and easy to use. Spacy is widely used by different companies and projects and has an increasing number of users worldwide.", "The first step in our analysis is to download the audio files from the five speeches mentioned in the introduction from Youtube. To organize our analysis and make it reproducible we are going to create a Pandas Dataframe to store the data generated during the analysis.", "To start, we created a dictionary with the name of each speaker as key and the respective Youtube URLs video as value (1). Next, we iterated over the values and executed youtube-dl command using os.system to download each file to our local folder (2). On the steps (3) we create the Dataframe from the dictionary and a new column with the name of each downloaded file (4).", "Now that we have the audio files for the analysis, we just need to upload it to an S3 bucket to make the transcription to text. On step (5) we used boto3 to create a new S3 bucket and uploaded the audio files to it (6). In order to start the automatic speech recognition, we need the path to each file located on the new S3 bucket. So by using the S3 path convention we defined the path for each file and save it to our Dataframe (7). On step (8), we create a function called start_transcription to call AWS API using boto3, and invoked it iteratively for each speech (9). We also defined on the function start_transcription to output the results as a JSON file on our S3 bucket.", "When the Amazon Transcribe jobs are done, you can access the results by reading the JSON file that was saved on the S3 bucket (10). In order to evaluate the quality of the transcription generated by Amazon Transcribe, we are going to use the original texts stored on the JSON file (11). The original transcripts were copied from the link provided on the Art of Manliness article, and new line characters were removed. Some parts of the original text were removed to match exactly the content of the audio, as some were not the complete speech. Before doing any text comparison we are going to remove the stop words, punctuations, pronouns and perform lemmatization on tokens (12). To establish the similarity between the texts we are going to use spaCy method for semantic similarity (13). It\u2019s not a literal comparison of texts, as it is based on Word2vec, meaning we are comparing the percentage of each word over the whole sentence/text.", "The results for word vector similarity are plotted in Figure 7. We can see that based on this metric we can say that Amazon Transcribe is doing a good job transcribing the audio to text, as all the transcription were more than 99% similar to the original one.", "As word vectors similarity is based on the representation of each word on text, it can give us a false perception that two texts are alike. In order to have a better metric on the text difference, we are going to use Word Movers Distance to compare the original transcriptions to the one generated using Amazon Transcribe. To estimate this distance we need the library wmd that can be integrated with spaCy (14). For more information on estimating text similarities, please take a look at Adrien Sieg great article.", "As we can see in Figure 8, there are some transcriptions that show a larger distance between the original and the audio transcription, with Churchill\u2019s and MacArthur\u2019s speeches being the most evident.", "In order to compare the structure of the original transcripts to the ones generated by Amazon Transcribe, we are going to use a spaCy visualizer for entity recognition called displacy (15).", "Displacy offers visual identification of words and their respective class, making it easier to compare the structure of your text (Figure 9).", "By looking at the visualizations created with displacy, we spotted a few inconsistencies especially on the audio transcriptions from Churchill\u2019s and MacArthur\u2019s speeches. It seems that the quality of the audio and the diction of the speaker have an impact on the quality of the transcription. When we listen to Reagan\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s speech, we can notice that the quality of the audio is much higher and the words and more clear, so the WMD is smaller between the original and the automatic transcription, meaning Amazon Transcribe model could show a better performance.", "On the last part of our analysis we are going to use Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis of the speeches. As mentioned before, AWS offers a pre-trained model that you can use to return the percentage of 4 different sentiments: positive, negative, mixed or neutral. To perform the sentiment analysis we simply need to provide the text as a string and the language. One limitation imposed by Amazon Comprehend is the size of the text that can be analyzed to 5000 bytes (which translates as a string containing 5000 characters). As we are dealing with texts transcripts that are larger than this limit, we created the start_comprehend_job function that split the input text into smaller chunks and calls the sentiment analysis using boto3 for each independent part. The results are then aggregated and returned as a dictionary (16). So we used this function on the audio transcription for each speaker and saved on our Dataframe for further analysis (17).", "Figures 10 (bar plot) and 11 (radar plot) show the results for the sentiment analysis for each selected speech. It seems that neutral sentences are the most prevalent in all speeches, followed by positive, mixed and negative. Churchill\u2019s speech seems to be the one with the highest negative percentage, and Kennedy\u2019s the most positive.", "AWS offers a set of ML/AI tools that can be easily accessed and integrated using boto3 for API call.", "Amazon Transcribe seems to be consistent when the audio quality is good, like with Reagan\u2019s and Kennedy\u2019s speeches, but tend to perform not as well when audio is not clear, like in the case of Churchill\u2019s speech.", "Amazon Comprehend offers an easy way to extract sentiment from text, and it would be great to see its results against other NLP tools and other models.", "Your home for data science.
