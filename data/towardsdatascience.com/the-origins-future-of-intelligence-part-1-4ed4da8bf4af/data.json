I.e., In there future, can there still be a line that logically separates what we possess and what our robotic counterparts are given? Those kinds of questions seem to be as challenging as agreeing on the very definition of life itself; i.e., at what point does life get injected into what is seemingly just conglomerations of inanimate subatomic particles?", "The problem, though, is that we don\u2019t have a clear understanding of our own intelligence. There are theories, but many have not withstood the test of time, and currently accepted ones may be debunked in the future as well with emergence of newer evidence. What can be done, though, is to examine the bodies of existing evidence and see what that implies for our future.", "I am writing series of articles that will explore human intelligence, and the series is separated into many parts. The first chapter takes a look at different theories on how intelligence works and our current approaches to measuring it. Subsequent chapters will look at the different ways that intelligence came about, and also how future intelligence (both natural and artificial) can transcend our current intelligence capacity.", "There\u2019s much debate about the emergence of human intelligence. While one could dismiss the gift as a simple evolutionary tool, akin to how fish have gills and birds have wings, our gift is different. Not only has it been a tool for survival, but also one that has given our otherwise weak species dominance over the planet. It\u2019d be like if one day a snail pieced together the Infinity Gauntlet, and no one even questions how the snail could have done it.", "Add in a cup of Darwinism, a teaspoon of Hollywood Sci-Fi, and maybe a sprinkle of Pokemon for taste, and you get a very slanted view of the influence of evolution on intelligence. Evolution is a game of chance, for the purpose of survival, but is often portrayed similarly to watching a baby turn into a smart adult. Often, though, evolution doesn\u2019t require you to become smarter, just more adapted. Intelligence might be mixed into the equation, but it is not a necessity.", "Take, for example, the rat. We can all agree that rats are an inferior to humans when it comes to intelligence (at least as we understand it). Around 80 million years ago, the lineage between humans and rats split from a common ancestor. Scientists estimate that, since that split, rats have evolved at a rate three times faster than humans, a metric derived from the diversity of the rat genome compared to that of the human. Despite the rat\u2019s superior evolutionary speed, humans still possess superior intellect.", "That being said, the adaptations emerging from evolution vary by species depending on the variables that impact the species\u2019 survival. For humans, that variable may very well be intelligence, while for birds it might be more efficient wings. In other words, an individual species\u2019 intelligence may be enhanced through evolution, but evolution as a broad umbrella across all organisms does not necessarily produce an enhancement in intelligence.", "Over the past century, scientists have studied human intelligence through the lens of a variety of hypotheses. Regardless of the approach, though, one thing has been certain: the human benchmark. If humans weren\u2019t at the top of the list, then the analysis was most certainly flawed. This measurement has aided in weeding out some prior popular theories, especially as a direct correlation to brain metrics.", "We humans are fond of comparing the sizes of our body parts. While most of those size comparisons fall short compared to many other species, the brain has been one that we could proudly display as a testament to human achievement. With such an impressive brain it is no wonder why the idea that sheer brain size determined intelligence floated around as an acceptable natural law for a while. That is, until other contenders entered the arena \u2014 notably, the sperm whale.", "No, the sperm whale is not called a sperm whale because it looks like a top-heavy sperm cell. Sperm is comically short for spermaceti, which is a liquid found inside the sperm[aceti] whale\u2019s head. It was a really valuable liquid for quite some time, because it was used in oil lamps, candles, lubricants, etc.", "But enough about its comical name, let\u2019s talk about the relevance \u2014 the sperm whale has the largest brain on the planet. But sperm whales are not (at least to current human understanding) smarter than humans. So what was that giant brain doing if it wasn\u2019t trying to make the next breakthrough in quantum physics? As obvious as it may sound, bigger animals just need bigger brains to manage normal daily functions. In scientific terms, it\u2019s called allometric scaling.", "Allometric scaling only explains why bigger organisms need bigger brains, it doesn\u2019t claim that a bigger brain results in greater intelligence. Either the assumption of brain-size-to-intelligence correlation was wrong, or there was a missing piece that must be added to the consideration in order to validate it. That missing piece was the brain-to-body ratio.", "The brain-to-body ratio metric as a measurement of intelligence has been floating around as mainstream truth more recently, similar to the myth that humans only use 10% of their brain (popularized by really awesome movies like Limitless and Lucy). But much like the 10% brain rumor, the brain-to-body ratio metric is also a flawed myth (that was once taken as truth).", "This brain-to-body ratio is scientifically referred to as the encephalization (in-seh-full-I-zay-shun) quotient (EQ for short). Despite what may seem to be an intimidating name for those not fluent in Latin, the idea is simple and derives from allometric scaling (the correlation between body and brain size discussed in the previous myth). Allometric scaling tells us what a brain size should be depending on what a species\u2019 body size is.", "The EQ takes it a step further \u2014 e.g., what happens when the brain is larger than the size we expected it to be from allometric scaling. From the EQ, we expect that the larger the brain is in comparison to what is expected from allometric sizing, the more intelligent the species is.", "Not to brag, but my encephalization quotient is huge.", "Well, so is yours. Humans have the largest EQ of all similarly sized mammals: 7.4\u20137.8. Read that as: human brains are 7.4\u20137 .8x larger than what we expect a similarly sized mammal to have. The EQ hypothesis is seemingly validated by the fact that humans rank at the top.", "But things start to fall apart in the middle. For example, a 2007 study of 25 primates concluded that orangutans are the most intelligent primate besides humans \u2014 more intelligent than chimpanzees and gorillas. Orangutans are the only primates that can communicate about the past. By EQ, Orangutans (1.9 EQ) rank above chimpanzees (1.7 EQ) and gorillas (1.5 EQ). On the other hand, they fall short when compared to the EQs of capuchin monkeys (4.8 EQ) and squirrel monkeys (2.8 EQ).", "So far, attempts to correlate sheer brain size with intelligence (whether by size or by ratio) have not been successful. Experiments have turned to other theories, and we have now stumbled across one that seems to fit pretty well: it\u2019s not about the brain size, it\u2019s about what\u2019s inside.", "The powercells of the brain are the neurons. So maybe it\u2019s as simple as counting the number of neurons, rather than looking at the overall size of the brain. Across all my research so far in trying to understand intelligence, I\u2019ve come across many impressive researchers, but a psychologist named Suzana Herculano-Houzel stood out by far due to her unique techniques to linking brain composition and intelligence: making brain soup.", "With a mix of substances (the brain being the main ingredient), Suzana would turn intact brains into mush and use special chemicals to change the color of the nuclei of the neurons. Then she would have to count the amount of color-changed nuclei, which determines the amount of neurons in the brain (since all neurons have one nucleus). Of course, with the billions of neurons in the brain, I would assume she counted a subsegment of the entire solution and extrapolated (correct me if I\u2019m wrong, Suzana!).", "By the neuron-count logic, humans should have the most neurons out of all animals if we are truly the champions of intelligence. Unfortunately, after making elephant brain soup, Suzana counted that African elephant brains had 3x as many neurons as human brains. By that count, humans were knocked out as a contender.", "But after taking a deeper look, other more significant results started emerging: only 2% of all those neurons (or 5.6 billion) were located in the cerebral cortex, which is responsible for more advanced thinking. By comparison, humans had approximately 16 billion neurons in the same location. While the African elephant had 3x more neurons overall, humans had almost 3x as many neurons where it mattered for intelligence.", "Now, the correlation between brain and intelligence is focused not on the size of the brain itself, but the contents of it. New research looks at the number of cortical neurons (neurons in the cerebral cortex) and the interneuronal distance. Another fancy term, interneuronal distance is just the distance between neurons. Much like in a computer, physical distance between neurons determines how fast information can be sent from one place to another \u2014 after all, information can only travel so fast, so the further it has to travel, the longer it takes to reach its destination. Apart from across species, this research has been applied to human-only studies to confirm that smarter humans have larger neurons and also faster electrical signals that transmit message between those neurons.", "The area of intelligence research is expanding very rapidly, and is at an exciting point in time. With the emergence of AI, intelligence research is becoming more important than ever, as those findings can be applied to create better neural networks and algorithms. Leading institutions like MIT are combining AI development and neural research with partners like SenseTime and IBM.", "In this part, we have explored how intelligence works (at least, how we understand it as of now). In my next part, I will explore exactly where it comes from in the first place. While evolution has served to enhance human intelligence, the origin event is still quite an exciting mystery.", "Your home for data science.
