This time, it means the end of the company as we know it. The stores will be liquidated. But the company will live on: Payless Holdings was not so much a company that ran shoe stores but a license holding company whose portfolio includes Sperry, Stride Rite, and AirWalk. If you enjoy boat shoes, skate shoes, or are a child \u2014 your brands will continue.", "But why did Payless own so many brands? Payless, the discount shoe chain known for Velcro, has not been itself since 2012 when it was acquired by Blum Capital, Golden Gate Capital, and Wolverine World Wide. These private equity firms purchase retailers with debt and then attempt to use them to pay back those charges from the purchase. If the name Golden Gate Capital is familiar it is the private equity firm behind such disasters as the Toys R Us and Claire\u2019s bankruptcies. If you like tables, Ben Ungelsbee has a fine one of retail companies taken over by private equity.", "You might be asking, what is a leveraged buyout? This is when a company buys another company with debt and transfers the debt from acquisition to the acquired company. Let\u2019s say that a hedge fund thinks that Pizza Hut has some minor business problem that they can fix, they could functionally take out a loan, buy Pizza Hut, and then transfer that loan to Pizza Hut.", "If a company has more cash than it has outstanding stock, a raider could buy a company with a loan and immediately repay that loan. This is the core activity of old-fashioned corporate raiders. Now this magical situation is quite rare, so often companies have no intention of quickly paying back the loan, instead they are going to make such a transformation in the acquired company that it could simply pay back its own purchase price. Which gets to a really important point: how often do you ever actually find this magical company that you can buy for free? How many companies can actually survive the LBO process?", "It is rare, and there are very few.", "But this doesn\u2019t stop people from trying: after all, these alternative investments are one of the best ways to get truly rich. So we hallucinate that a successful chain of shoe stores could be purchased with credit. It is fairly straight forward that this is a really bad idea.", "How do people talk about it?", "The surface financial news story is straight froward: Payless ShoeSource is bankrupt. On a deeper level, we often use an idea called frame analysis to look for broader systems of description. Frames are the collections of metaphors, topics, and styles that make a story make sense. One particular frame you are likely familiar with is that of the \u201chorse race\u201d in politics. The story relies on the use of a recent public opinion poll to tell us something about how the race between two candidates is going. Does the result of a single poll really tell us that much? No. This is why approaches in aggregation like those of Sam Wang or Nate Silver are popular as well, they provide a deeper analysis of the horse race. What the story of the individual poll has, and why it continues, is that it could be an indicator of a shift in the race. Where the aggregated model might tell you more definitively who is winning, the quick poll story might tell you that a horse is now ahead by a nose.", "In order for the horse race frame to make sense, you must accept a certain logic behind public opinion polls, that the two candidates are relatively equal, and that the news events discussed as proximate to the poll were in fact connected. There is quite a bit of connective tissue here. Frames are present in other areas as well, almost every new study in nutrition could be positioned as a change worthy of coverage.", "In this analysis, I am supposing that the topic labels presented by MALLET can be used to infer traits of the frame of a topic. The results of such a method include a list of document topic probabilities, and the relationships between those topics. The total corpus, as I did not include duplicates, was 270 paragraphs of text. My preferred way of thinking about these relationships is the classic dendrogram.", "This method in machine learning would attempt to assign each paragraph a topic. An important caveat here, and why we will turn to human judgement, is that the system can\u2019t read for deeper meanings. At the same time, this combination of machine and human reading helps to preclude the human reader from hallucinating topics and clusters.", "The raw topic outputs can be difficult to read and depend on some interpretative work. My general procedure is to check the automatically produced topics for key terms or proper names. Then after I have some sense of what the category was about, I check the highest probability documents for the kinds of arguments made in those texts.", "At this point, I establish a key with a description of what kinds of tokens were detected as being in association. The assignments will consist of my semantic judgment based on my reading of the key words extracted by MALLET as well as a close reading of the highest probability texts (paragraphs) in each topic:", "Before we continue, it is important to get some sense of how much of the dataset has been assigned to a particular topic. Topic 7, the details of the collapse is by far the most heavily assigned topic. This makes sense to be a major hook in the construction of journalism \u2014 this is where the action is. Topics 6 and 4 also stand above the rest, which makes additional sense. What is important to understand is that the discussion of debt, is not well centralized into the primary stack of the story \u2014 we know that most details are structured around category seven.", "This relationship can tell us something about the kind of stories we are looking at as well. One cluster is the story of the industry being saddled with debt, attached to key details about liquidation, and the sort of salacious lead. The other cluster includes all the parts one might expect in a more complete and complex business story, with the deepest inside baseball down through several layers, including the general condition of the stock market, Canada, but above special problems, like retail hiring and real estate.", "The only two paragraphs that discuss the role of Golden Gate and partners in the demise of Payless are assigned mutually to topics 7 and 2. Topic 2 is of particular interest as it is where the story is really theorized. Given the ubiquity of topic 7, I will continue the analysis along the lines of the richer secondary assignment to topic 2. Consider these two paragraphs from topic 2:", "Valley Morning Star: The company, founded in 1956 on the premise of delivering discount shoes in a self-serve setting, was taken private in 2012 by Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital Partners and succumbed to the serious debt problems incurred by that move.", "Bloomberg: Payless was founded in 1956 with the goal of selling affordable shoes in a self-service setting and says it\u2019s the largest specialty footwear chain in the Western Hemisphere. The company struggled to manage debt taken on in a 2012 leveraged buyout by Golden Gate Capital and Blum Capital Partners, filing for bankruptcy protection in April 2017.", "These are the two paragraphs in the entire corpus where Golden Gate capital appear. These are the only times when a journalist actually attributed the cause of the debt to an actor, rather than treating it as a parent concept to the story of the collapse itself. I find this to be just wild: we know that debt is what caused the companies to fail, but we are left to insert any number of explanations (the children of topic 2) to explain where that debt came from.", "It becomes clear that there are very few stories near the peak of topic 2. This can be further seen in the analysis of the density of the topics:", "Low densities don\u2019t mean that something is unimportant, but that the story is likely evenly distributed or that most paragraphs are highly unlikely to be in that paragraph. Topic one for instance is a speciality story, those paragraphs assigned to it really are about Canada. It is also fairly clear that certain publications and topics are more closely associated with a particular day or author. Restricted topics like 2 or 5 can point at particularly specialized stories. In the case of topic 5, the stories that really focus on the stock market generally are a specific and distinct subset. The topic modeler can effectively point at frames. When combined with other semantic methods, it becomes possible to extract frames and relate those frames as families for further analysis.", "For the most part, this study reveals a paint-by-numbers approach to retail reporting. If a firm goes bankrupt note that it failed because of debt, and that this likely caused a dramatic scene, which will include liquidation. One take away from this brief study would be that a topic model can provide an easy frame for the automatic production of new news stories.", "The immediate reason why these stores have failed is that they don\u2019t have the sales to compensate for the destruction imposed on them by their financial designs. In the context of retail, this may seem like a reasonable adjustment to the economy as a whole \u2014 the US simply had too much floor space for retail. At the same time, this didn\u2019t need to happen. The world would be better with Toys R Us and Payless, these were viable businesses.", "Debt in this discourse has an ontological quality, it is just something that kind of is a property of retail firms. It appeared from nowhere and must be countered. This is different from the representation of educational, consumer, or mortgage debt which are seemingly the result of individuals making irresponsible decisions, despite excellent evidence that institutional choices to facilitate house flipping caused the Great Recession, or that predatory for-profit institutions not your local state-U are the sources of much educational debt. We do a really bad job talking about the reasons why debt exists, we do a really good job shaming people about it.", "Corporations seem to be legal persons, but somehow they have less accountability than regular folks. Among the corporations there are also variations: private equity firms somehow enjoy considerably more leeway than regular companies. Only two intrepid reporters even spoke the name of Golden Gate in their reports.", "Payless collapsed because it was taken private in a leveraged buyout. They did not fail because of their inventory system, a lack of skilled shoe sales people, DSW, Famous Footware, or the internet. The analysis in these articles includes a powerful non-sequitur where \u201cdebt\u201d somehow simply appears which then allows other factors to do-in a business. In this framing, the actors who take on the debt are not merely blameless but invisible. Who is allowed access to the pools of cash needed to do these purchases? How do you apply to do something like this? Why does the practice continue despite being a financial weapon of mass destruction? Can I get a pile of money like this?", "An important place to start changing the reporting: why can\u2019t we discuss who accumulated debt as a key element of our reporting on retail bankruptcies? What we don\u2019t need is one more story of signs going up, liquidation sales starting Saturday, and debt appearing out of nowhere.", "Your home for data science.
