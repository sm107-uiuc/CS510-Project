At the time, Madison didn\u2019t have a meetup where techies would go to work in individual projects. Instead, they were structured more like lunch-and-learn events. One (or two) presenters would speak for 20\u201340min on a topic. The topics and the presenters were advertised ahead of time. There was also time for question and answers. Generally, I learned quite a lot from these bite-sized educational sessions and I miss those sessions.", "Then, I moved to Washington, DC (made that move in July 2018). In this area, there are at least three weekly code and coffee meetups. Northern Virginia (NOVA) has one, DC has one, and Alexandria has one. These communities aren\u2019t uncommon across the globe.", "This weekend I went to NOVA\u2019s which was hosted at the really cool offices of CustomInk.com. I also went to DC\u2019s but got there to find out it was canceled due to our snow. I tweeted a fair bit about going to these Code & Coffee Meetups. A fellow techie Dr. Liz Gross asked me if I was coding all weekend? I replied:", "To get the most out of Code & Coffee it is important to network. Everyone does this differently and there is no right or wrong way to do it. For me, I do my best to connect via LinkedIn or Twitter with the folks I meet and chat with.", "Thinking back to graduate school we had these \u201cwriting groups.\u201d The best writing groups were weekly and included a core group that would commit to being there each week. The best writing groups started with a short discussion where everyone shares what they want to work on for the day and what their goals are. Then everyone gets to work. Likewise, the Code & Coffee events start out with introductions where everyone shares what they do for a living, what they\u2019re working on that day, what they might want help with (if anything), and what they can help others with (if anything).", "I don\u2019t ask for or need help every time I go to a Code & Coffee. But, when I do need or want help I know I can find it there. I\u2019ve never been let down by the quality of that help.", "I\u2019ve been asked for help a few times since going to Code & Coffee. Sometimes I feel like I have something to contribute, other times I\u2019m stumped. But, the opportunity to share in someone else\u2019s struggle is usually a welcome distraction from my own struggles. It is a reminder that everyone starts someplace. I\u2019m not sure I can think of another experience that is as profoundly both humbling and inspirational.", "My guilty secret is that sometimes I don\u2019t work on a project that involves coding. Or maybe I\u2019ll work on a project that once did involve coding, or eventually will involve coding, but at that moment doesn\u2019t require coding. This means I might be reading up on methods, I might be sketching conceptual frameworks, or I might be attending Udemy/Lynda/Udacity (or similar) class. I might even just be using the time to catch up on email. Bottom line, it is a protected window of time that I can devote to being productive.", "I recommend Code & Coffee for anyone interested in an opportunity to meet other techie folks, in getting help with a techie project, in helping others with a techie project, or in having protected time to make progress on whatever personal projects that have been cooking in your mind.", "Send me your thoughts and ideas. You can write just to say hey. And if you really need to tell me how I got it wrong I look forward to chatting soon.
