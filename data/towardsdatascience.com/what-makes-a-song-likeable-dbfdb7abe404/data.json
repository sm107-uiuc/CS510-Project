Some people, like Jack Fleming in his opinion column, fall on the objectivity side of the argument saying \u201cUsing subjectivity in music analysis tends to trivialize it.\u201d He goes on to say that like other art forms, we need to have a basis of judgement for music as well. In the article Objectivity vs. Subjectivity in Music: The Ultimate Guide and Solution, the author, \u201cCarcinogeneticist\u201d tries to give a balanced view saying both arguments have their merits and demerits. He puts forth a theory that, \u201cThe truth is that objectivity and subjectivity are interrelated and possibly exist on a spectrum\u201d. Subjectivity is nearly impossible to analyze. But if subjectivity is removed from the equation, all artistic merit can be rationally dissected.", "But I wanted to analyze another aspect of a song \u2014 the popularity. Irrespective of the quality of the song or the talent involved in composing and playing it, it is nearly impossible to know what makes a song popular. As a musician, I have always been curious about what really makes a song likeable to the masses. To find the answer, I decided to use Data Visualization to find patterns and trends in the list of Top Tracks of 2017, curated by Spotify.", "Spotify is one of the leading music streaming apps of today with more than 83 million paid subscribers as of June 2018. They compile a yearly list of Top Tracks based on the number of times the songs were streamed by users.", "For every track on their platform, Spotify provides data for thirteen Audio Features.The Spotify Web API developer guide defines them as follows:", "I found that the data I needed from Spotify was already available as a dataset on Kaggle as \u201cTop Spotify Tracks of 2017\u201d by Nadin Tamer. I checked the data and found that it was already sanitized and had no validation errors. It lacked a field for the rank of the song, which I added.", "Out of the above-mentioned parameters, Mode is a binary value of either 1 or 0 denoting the modality of the track (Major or minor), and Key is an absolute integer value denoting the scale of the song (C =0, C# = 1, etc.) Hence, I left these 2 parameters out for and created a scatterplot matrix with the remaining 11 parameters.", "I created the scatterplot matrix with two main intentions :", "A few observations from the scatterplot are as follows:", "From the definitions of the parameters in the API guide, Tempo and loudness seem to be low-level parameters which are used to calculate other higher level parameters like valence, energy, and danceability. Hence I will discount tempo and loudness from the next steps for the sake of reducing similar parameters. I also dropped the duration parameter since most tracks pretty much seem to be around the 200s or 3:20 minute mark.", "Now that I was left with just six parameters, I sketched out a few ways to explore how to make sense of the data such as density plots or just plotting variations in each parameter against rank. But none of these would result in an appealing visualization that would convey the information to the audience in an engaging manner.", "While I was looking for ways to represent multiple parameters, I remembered Radar Charts!", "They were simple enough to understand, and one could get an idea of all six parameters at a glance. It was just what I needed!", "I initially implemented it on Tableau but it looked quite boring. Visual appeal was an important aspect of my project. So, as I scoured the web for ways to not only implement a radar chart, but to do it in a beautiful manner, I chanced upon Nadieh Bremer\u2019s blog Visual Cinnamon and her article about her redesign of D3\u2019s radar chart and I knew this was it! The implementation details of her redesign, under the MIT license, can be found at http://bl.ocks.org/nbremer/21746a9668ffdf6d8242.", "The blog post was from 2015 and hence the code was for a much older version of D3.js(v3). I have dabbled in Javascript before but was completely new to D3 so it took a bit of wrangling to update APIs and get the code to work on v5. I also had to spend some time formatting the data.", "I set it up to show one song at a time from Rank 1 to 100. Time for the first look..", "Now that the chart worked exactly the way I wanted it to, it was time to use it to elicit some insights. To do this, I decided to see what would happen if I overlapped multiple songs to find trends in the parameters. To prevent overcrowding, I started with only the top 10 ranked songs first.", "You can already start seeing patterns emerging among the top 10 songs:", "P.S. Medium only supports images hence the gifs. To see the actual interactive visualization please click here.", "To expand on this I also created a way to see groups of 10 from Rank 1 to 100:", "Want to make a hit song? To increase your odds, make it a high energy, electronic, dance number! Keep it on a simple 4/4 time signature, no need to complicate things. Try to keep the duration of the song around the optimal 3:20 minute mark. Make sure it\u2019s recorded in a studio and not live, have vocals in your song but don\u2019t make it too \u2018speechy\u2019, and wouldn\u2019t hurt to make it high valence i.e. happy, cheerful, and/or euphoric.", "You can view the final interactive visualization here.", "A big, big thank you to Karthik Badam for all the guidance and support, and to Nadieh Bremer for her wonderfully insightful and inspiring work with D3.js.
