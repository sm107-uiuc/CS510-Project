Thence, we use a short representation referred to as \u201ctags\u201d to represent the categories.", "As earlier mentioned, the process of assigning a specific tag to a word in our corpus is referred to as part-of-speech tagging (POS tagging for short) since the POS tags are used to describe the lexical terms that we have within our text.", "Part-of-speech tags describe the characteristic structure of lexical terms within a sentence or text, therefore, we can use them for making assumptions about semantics. Other applications of POS tagging include:", "When we perform POS tagging, it\u2019s often the case that our tagger will encounter words that were not within the vocabulary that was used. Consequently, augmenting your dataset to include unknown word tokens will aid the tagger in selecting appropriate tags for those words.", "Taking the example text we used in Figure 1, \u201cWhy not tell someone?\u201d, imaging the sentence is truncated to \u201cWhy not tell \u2026 \u201d and we want to determine whether the following word in the sentence is a noun, verb, adverb, or some other part-of-speech.", "Now, if you are familiar with English, you\u2019d instantly identify the verb and assume that it is more likely the word is followed by a noun rather than another verb. Therefore, the idea as shown in this example is that the POS tag that is assigned to the next word is dependent on the POS tag of the previous word.", "By associating numbers with each arrow direction, of which imply the likelihood of the next word given the current word, we can say there is a higher likelihood the next word in our sentence would be a noun since it has a higher likelihood than the next word being a verb if we are currently on a verb. The image in Figure 3, is a great example of how a Markov Model works on a very small scale.", "Given this example, we may now describe markov models as \u201ca stochastic model used to model randomly changing systems. It is assumed that future states depend only on the current state, not on the events that occurred before it (that is, it assumes the Markov property).\u201d (Source: Wikipedia). Therefore to get the probability of the next event, it needs only the states of the current event.", "We can depict a markov chain as directed graph:", "The lines with arrows are an indication of the direction hence the name \u201cdirected graph\u201d, and the circles may be regarded as the states of the model \u2014 a state is simply the condition of the present moment.", "We could use this Markov model to perform POS. Considering we view a sentence as a sequence of words, we can represent the sequence as a graph where we use the POS tags as the events that occur which would be illustrated by the stats of our model graph.", "For example, q1 in Figure 4 would become NN indicating a noun, q2 would be VB which is short for verb, and q3 would be O signifying all other tags that are not NN or VB. Like in Figure 3, the directed lines would be given a transition probability that define the probability of going from one state to the next.", "A more compact way to store the transition and state probabilities is using a table, better known as a \u201ctransition matrix\u201d.", "Notice this model only tells us the transition probability of one state to the next when we know the previous word. Hence, this model does not show us what to do when there is no previous word. To handle this case, we add what is known as the \u201cinitial state\u201d.", "You may now be wondering, how did we populate the transition matrix? Great Question. I will use 3 sentences for our corpus. The first is \u201c<s> in a station of the metro\u201d, \u201c<s> the apparition of these faces in the crowd\u201d, \u201c<s> petals on a wet, black bough.\u201d (Note these are the same sentences used in the course). Next, we will break down how to populate the matrix into steps:", "1. Count occurrences of tag pairs in the training dataset", "At the end of step one, our table would look something like this\u2026", "2. Calculate the probability of using the counts", "Appling the formula in Figure 10 to the table in Figure 9, our new table would look as follows\u2026", "You may notice that there are many 0\u2019s in our transition matrix which would result in our model being incapable of generalizing to other text that may contain verbs. To overcome this problem, we add smoothing.", "Adding smoothing requires we slightly we adjust the formula from Figure 10 by adding a small value, epsilon, to each of the counts in the numerator, and add N * epsilon to the denominator, such that the row sum still adds up to 1.", "Note: In a real world example, applying smoothing to the initial probabilities (the first row) as this would allow for a sentence to possibly start with any POS tag.", "Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process with unobservable (\u201chidden\u201d) states (Source: Wikipedia). In our case, the unobservable states are the POS tags of a word.", "If we rewind back to our Markov Model in Figure 5, we see that the model has states for part of speech such as VB for verb and NN for a noun. We may now think of these as hidden states since they are not directly observable from the corpus. Though a human may be capable of deciphering what POS applies to a specific word, a machine only sees the text, hence making it observable, and is unaware of whether that word POS tag is noun, verb, or something else which in-turn means they are unobservable.", "Both the Markov Model and Hidden Markov model have transition probabilities that describe the transition from one hidden state to the next, however, the Hidden Markov Model also has something known as emission probabilities.", "The emission probabilities describe the transitions from the hidden states in the model \u2014 remember the hidden states are the POS tags \u2014 to the observable states \u2014 remember the observable states are the words.", "In Figure 14 we see that for the hidden VB state we have observable states. The emission probability from the hidden states VB to the observable eat is 0.5 hence there is a 50% chance that the model would output this word when the current hidden state is VB.", "We can also represent the emission probabilities as a table\u2026", "Similar to the transition probability matrix, the row values must sum to 1. Also, the reason all of our POS tags emission probabilities are more than 0 since words can have a different POS tag depending on the context.", "To populate the emission matrix, we\u2019d follow a procedure very similar to the way we\u2019d populate the transition matrix. We\u2019d first count how often a word is tagged with a specific tag.", "Since the process is so similar to calculating the transition matrix, I will instead provide you with the formula with smoothing applied to see how it would be calculated.", "You now know what a POS tag is and its different applications, as well as Markov Models, Hidden Markov Models, and transition and emission matrices and how to populate them with smoothing applied.", "Thank you for reading to the end, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn\u2026", "Your home for data science.
