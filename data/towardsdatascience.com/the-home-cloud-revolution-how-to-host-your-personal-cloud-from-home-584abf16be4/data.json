Yes, I know it is not a shock to read, but that\u2019s true. Well, yes, pretty much every big company tracks you, but you probably don\u2019t know how much Google is active on the web. Quoting this article from Duck Duck Go:", "Princeton\u2019s WebTAP privacy project recently found that Google\u2019s trackers are installed on 75% of the top million Internet websites.", "I\u2019ve been gradually shifting away from Google\u2019s ecosystem, and while it\u2019s almost impossible to not use any of Google\u2019s many apps, in this article I\u2019ll show you how to get rid of one of Google\u2019s most popular services: Google Drive.", "Be aware that this article will show you how to host a cloud application at home, and it won\u2019t be exactly cheap. The approximate cost of this setup when buying from OEM is \u20ac130 or $159, but obviously, you can cut down the prices by buying from third parties.", "A little warning here: hosting a cloud yourself is not as safe as having someone host it. It\u2019s riskier as any accident such as a power outage or overload could fry your devices and you\u2019d basically lose all your files. If you\u2019re afraid of this, use a UPS and a RAID Backup over multiple drives.", "Also, you will need a public static IP for your network, so if you intend to follow along and install Nextcloud, contact your ISP to request it.", "Nextcloud is a cloud platform that you can self-host. Self-hosting is what allows you to regain control of your data, the documents, pictures, and everything else that you will upload won\u2019t be uploaded to Google\u2019s or Microsoft\u2019s servers, but to your personal server.", "Also, it is an open-source project, which means that every single line of code that it relies on can be and is checked from the community. When the source code is available, you can literally read everything that happens to your files. No more not knowing what happens to your data.", "You can find more information on the official website.", "The most important tool that we\u2019ll find throughout these guides is the Raspberry Pi, in our case in the iteration 4B 2GB that you can buy from raspberrypi.org. The website does not allow you to buy the board from OEM but instead redirects you towards its partnered shops available in your country.", "You must use a dedicated RaspberryPi 4B for this project to avoid overheating. My Raspberry Pi 3 easily got to 158 degrees Fahrenheit or 70 degrees celsius just from running Nextcloud and a few other web projects.", "The second piece of hardware we\u2019ll need is a case for the Raspberry Pi. The case that I recommend is the PiCase 40, which should be available in the common market starting from mid-September 2020, once it leaves Kickstarter. You can use any compatible case, or even don\u2019t use any at all, but this particular piece from Cooler Master should ensure that your device doesn\u2019t overheat too often.", "We\u2019ll have to flash the system to a microSD storage, so we need to buy one. I\u2019d recommend a reliable SD such as the Samsung EVO 32GB that you can find on Samsung\u2019s website, but really any 16GB+ memory will do, we\u2019ll only use it for the OS and Nextcloud\u2019s database.", "If you have a laptop that can read SD Cards you\u2019re lucky, but if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll need to buy a MicroSD to USB adapter. You can find it both online and in most electronics stores.", "To store the data, I recommend using a USB Drive, Hard Drive or SSD. What I think that suits best is the up to 5TBs Seagate Basic that you can buy from Walmart or most online electronics stores.", "Lastly, you\u2019ll need a 5V 3A power supply with a USB Type-C connector. If you\u2019re unsure of what or where to buy, this is the official power supply from the Raspberry Foundation.", "You\u2019ll also need an ethernet cable, but since we\u2019re talking about networking I should not even be mentioning that.", "If you\u2019re a power user or you\u2019ve already worked on a Raspberry Pi you can flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite and skip this section.", "If you\u2019re a normal user and you\u2019ve never touched a Raspberry Pi, you\u2019re up for a great journey!", "Now first things first you\u2019ll need to insert the Raspberry Pi into your case. If you\u2019ve bought the PiCase 40 you can watch this video to mount the board into the case, though it should be pretty straightforward.", "To flash the OS to the MicroSD you have to connect it to the PC either directly if you can or via the adaptor, and then download the Raspberry Pi Imager. If you\u2019re on Linux you can install it via this command:", "Open the imager, choose the SD and install not Ubuntu but Raspberry Pi OS Lite via Raspberry Pi OS (Other)\u2014 we could also install Ubuntu and use snap to install Nextcloud or directly install the system image of NextCloudPi, but in this guide, we\u2019ll be using Raspberry Pi OS.", "To use the Raspberry Pi you can either connect via ssh or use it directly connecting it to a USB keyboard and an HDMI monitor. I\u2019ll use SSH, therefore, you can skip the next step if you will connect it directly.", "Once the flash is finished use your file manager to navigate to the SD Card and create a file in the root directory called ssh \u2014 not ssh.txt, just ssh, if you\u2019re on Windows you can use the top bar to enable the extensions via the menu View > File extensions.", "Eject the card and then insert it into the card slot on the board. Good, our Raspberry Pi is now ready to be booted up. Plug it into the wall mount and connect it to your router.", "Now, this is a bit tricky, you\u2019ll need to enter your router\u2019s page to check out the IP Address of the raspberry pi. Unfortunately, I cannot provide better details as every manufacturer has different landing pages. What I can do is tell you that usually, the IP of the router is 192.168.x.1, 192.168.x.254, where x can be either 0 or 1. You can easily find if you must set 0 or 1 via the terminal of your computer, running the command", "if you\u2019re on Linux and looking at your computer\u2019s IP.", "Similar steps can be taken if you\u2019re running Mac OS, as Mac OS is based on Unix just like Linux.", "Now that the Raspberry Pi is setup we need to connect to it via the command line using SSH. Usually, both Windows and Mac come with an SSH client, so just boot up your terminal and run:", "where pi is the default user of the Raspberry Pi and ip_address must be replaced with the IP of your Raspberry. The default password of the pi account is raspberry, though I advise you to change it once logged in with the command", "Now to install Nextcloud you simply need to run the command:", "and if for some reason you don\u2019t have curl automatically installed, just run", "For the next step, navigate to HTTP://rpi-ip-address, where rpi-ip-address is the IP of your Raspberry Pi, and save the passwords that will be given to you. The default user is ncp, so you don\u2019t need to save it as it\u2019s not randomized. Click on \u201cactivate\u201d and a new page will be opened in your browser prompting you for a username and a password. Set ncp as username and the password you\u2019ve saved as password.", "Now the fun begins, you\u2019re entering Nextcloud\u2019s portal, and you will be asked to start the setup wizard:", "Follow the simplified wizard and when asked whether you want to be able to access Nextcloud from outside your house, click on yes.", "If you\u2019re not sure of how to port-forward an application, tell Nextcloud to try and do it for you. It will use the UPnP standard to try and set up the port forwarding automatically. However, we will also cover how to port-forward an application later.", "The next step is a bit tricky. Now, to make your server available from outside your house you might want to set up a domain, which means that instead of using 2.210.123.43 to enter your server, you will simply use something like thisismynextcloudserver.com. Now you don\u2019t really need a .com, any domain will do. You can use Namecheap to buy really cheap .me domains (I got mine at something around $2).", "If you don\u2019t want to buy a domain you can use services like the ones that will be recommended to you by Nextcloud, which basically create a subdomain for each account, so you\u2019d probably have something similar to yourname.freedns.com.", "I recommend you buy a domain yourself which is what I\u2019ll be showing you in this guide. Select Skip and finish your setup.", "Now currently our web server is running on HTTP, which means that the data exchanged between the device and the server is not encrypted. You don\u2019t want your data to be online unencrypted, so let\u2019s install a certificate. For this, you\u2019ll need to buy a domain.", "Go to whatsymip.org and save somewhere your IP, we\u2019ll need it later.", "Create an account on namecheap.com or really any other domain name provider that you trust and buy your domain.", "Then, if you\u2019ve used namecheap, go to your domains and click on manage at the right of your domain to reveal the advanced information tab. Now click on advanced dns \u2014 or simply navigate to ap.www.namecheap.com/Domains/DomainControlPanel/yourdomain/advancedns \u2014 and add an A Record with Host @ and value your IP. Then add a CNAME record with host www and value yourdomain.", "In the end, your configuration should include these two records:", "What we\u2019re doing is telling the domain that when visited it should point towards your IP from both yourdomain and www.yourdomain.", "Then go back to your terminal and install certbot:", "In this step we\u2019ll retrieve the certificates that will be used to encrypt the connection, so run:", "This is how you should configure it:", "Finally, go back to HTTP://rpi-ip-address:1443 into the control panel and add yourdomain and www.yourdomain to the section nc-trusted-domains section.", "First, we need to format the USB to btrfs, but don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s not hard. Connect the drive to the raspberry pi and unplug every other drive. Then run:", "and navigate to tools > nc-format-USB:", "Follow the on-screen procedure to format the USB Drive and then press exit to go back to the main page. It\u2019s important that you remember the name of the drive after this step or leave the default name.", "Now navigate to system > nc-automount, follow the setup procedure and when on this screen, replace no with yes:", "Finally, navigate to config > nc-datadir and change the data directory to /media/yourdevicename or, if you\u2019ve used the default name /media/MyCloudDrive.", "Now we are pretty much finished. We only need to set up the port forwarding. For this, you need to go back to your modem\u2019s page like in the first steps and find a section called Port Forwarding or Port Mapping. Port mapping is basically mapping your modem to make certain ports available outside of your network, so that when you go to yourip:port, the service will be available across the internet. In the new port mapping you\u2019ll have to add a TCP exception towards your raspberry pi\u2019s IP along with the port 443 both as internal and external port. Do the same for port 80.", "Good, we are basically done. Test that everything is working by heading to yourdomain. You should be greeted with a similar page:", "This means that you are now ready to use nextcloud. You can login with the username ncp using the password you\u2019ve saved earlier.", "As you can see, you can now access all your files across the internet safely. You can also download the app for android and iOS and setup a photo backup as you would do in google photos.", "Your home for data science.
