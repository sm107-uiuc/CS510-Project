It portrayed how there is a distinct chasm between the rich and the poor, the lucky and the unlucky, and how mental illness can distort a person\u2019s morality and value system.", "So, movies are more than just an activity for enjoyment and amusement, it plays an imperative role in shaping our view on the world and communal consciousness.", "In short, movies educate people and spread ideas in ways a paperback book early does today.", "One reason for the effectiveness of movies is also the stark difference between movies and books, which is visualization. A visual content displays content that quickly registers to our visual stimulus as compared to a book, which explains why people spend hours on YouTube instead of reading a book. Moreover, movies help generate concrete graphics that help people hold on to the idea for a longer time. Evidently, movies are the perfect medium to learn about an idea or to dive into a topic with your head first.", "Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Data Science are popular terms in this era. And knowing what it is and its value in the coming years is more crucial than ever.", "Although Hollywood movies tend to exaggerate for dramatic effects, such as the Terminator movie, where killer robots from SKYNET turn sentient and start destroying humans, there is still some truth in these movies. There are experts in the field today who fear a super-intelligent AI who will outsmart us and eventually decide to wipe us off the face of the Earth.", "On the other side of the spectrum, AI is depicted as a miracle invention, the intelligent machine that can perform analytical tasks such as simulations and predictions much better than humans. In the movies, you see AI as a helper to humans, assisting us in all kinds of tasks, from being a sidekick on space adventures to a lover.", "If you\u2019re interested in AI, Machine Learning and Data Science, check out the list of movies (in no particular order) below and watch them.", "I write articles on Data Science and AI. If you want to be notified when I post, subscribe to my medium newsletter now!", "If you\u2019re not a medium member, consider subscribing today for only just $5. You\u2019ll be supporting me directly and you\u2019ll get access to tons of great writing on medium!", "Blade Runner is a classic dystopian movie where bio-engineered replicas of humans powered by AI live amongst real humans and the only distinction between them is they only live for 4 years. The sequel for this film, Blade Runner 2049 is also a great film that dives even deeper into the topic of AI and its future.", "Westworld is a movie about how AI can be used to entertain us and allow us to live out our fantasies. It reminds us of the fine line where technology and ethics collide and makes us question ourselves.", "HAL 9000, a supercomputer on a spacecraft heading to Jupiter is in charge of most operations, which leads to terrifying events when it glitches and decides to destroy the world. As HAL kills off the crew one by one, we are reminded of the dangers of letting AI take control of our world and be mindful of the consequences.", "Moon is similar to 2001: Space Odessy, as this movie has its own HAL 9000, named GERTY. GERTY is a computer and companion of Sam Bell, a lone astronaut on the face of the Moon. As his term on the Moon comes to an end, he faces an accident and meets his younger self. The movie\u2019s minimalistic quality in addition to the philosophical and thought-provoking scenes makes it one of the best sci-fi films out there.", "The Matrix the quintessential dystopia where humanity\u2019s fear of superintelligent AI becomes a reality. In \u201cThe Matrix\u201d, a simulation of reality created by AI to keep us subdued, Neo meets Morpheus, which sets him free from the simulation and starts a new chapter in his life where he battles the intelligent begins in the form of secret agents and discovers his true identity. The Matrix gives us a glimpse of the grim future of the dark side of AI as well as a few life lessons to ponder upon.", "The famous droid duo in Star Wars \u2014 The beloved C3-PO and his fellow droid friend R2D2 \u2014 are both sentient AI droids that have human-like personalities and are capable of emotions. The interesting thing is that they are treated as pets, or even slaves. This is akin to a relationship between a dog and a man, except the dog can speak and express its opinions. This take on Artificial Intelligence by Star Wars makes us think about how they will be embedded into the fabric of our society and how society will treat AI in the future either as helpers, pets, friends or not trust them at all.", "The AI star of the movie is Lieutenant Commander Data, a sentient, self-aware android who serves as a senior officer aboard the USS Enterprise. This AI-powered super brain is also equipped with an emotion chip that simulates human emotions. This makes Data a human-like droid that can feel like us, but with a sophisticated brain that can calculate risks better than any human.", "The Terminator is one of the most popular movies when it comes to portraying the bleak future of a world where AI suddenly turns evil and starts killing everyone. It illustrates the possibility of AI becoming an existential threat. In this film, Skynet, an AI system that sparks a nuclear holocaust sends back a cyborg assassin (The Terminator) to prevent the birth of John Connor who will spark a rebel group that fights against Skynet. This movie serves as a reminder to create an AI that is safe and to think twice about creating an AI that can wipe us out.", "Robocop is said to be a movie that truly unmasks the ethics of AI. This is because Robocop is an amalgamation of AI and human, which proves the fact that morality and ethics cannot be artificial or automated. Our underlying humanity still needs to be a part of the equation or consequences will follow. This relates to the dangers of weaponizing AI in the military (lethal autonomous weapon systems) and why regulations of AI use must be set in place to prevent misuse of AI.", "WALL-E is the epitome of Artificial Narrow Intelligence that we see today, though not as sophisticated as the ones in the movie (WALL-E being capable of emotions such as loneliness and love). Narrow AI is an intelligent system that is very good at doing a specific thing. We see that in our everyday life today, such as self-driving cars and voice assistants. In this movie, WALL-E cleans garbage, EVE looks for life and Auto pilots the ship. WALL-E is one of the rare sci-fi films out there that shows the bright side of AI and the good it can bring to the world.", "Ava is an AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) created by Caleb Smith, a genius programmer. AGI is an AI that possesses substantially greater skills and knowledge than a human being. Ava can converse just as well as we do and even manipulate the emotions of others. This film raises ethical concerns on treating and experimentation of self-aware robots such as Ava, which leads to a dark ending.", "Set in a tyrannical future, the police force is now mechanized with autonomous droids that patrol the streets and handles the lawbreakers. One of the droids is stolen and given an upgrade from ANI to AGI, meaning it becomes sentient. This droid, Chappie with his newfound emotion, battles with the corruption in society and is labeled as a threat to mankind an order. This brings up the issue of ethics as well, and how AGI can learn by itself by exploring its surroundings, just like Chappie does in the film.", "VIKI (Virtual Interactive Kinetic Intelligence) is a supercomputer turned evil that uses data collected from around the world and its computational powers control robots all over the world. In this world, robots are everywhere and they are given laws embedded into their system that ensure the safety of society. But with VIKI, those laws no longer hold the robots back, and it's up to a technophobic cop and a good robot stop VIKI from ending the world. This film brings about the harrowing possibility of AI taking over the world and how even laws set in place to control them can backfire.", "Interstellar takes a completely different approach to present AI in a sci-fi film. Instead of making it the antagonist such as HAL 9000 or The Terminator, the pair of quadrilateral robots named TARS and CASE which surprisingly takes on a form that has no resemblance to the popular human-like form as seen in Star Wars and Star Trek. This design of TARS and CASE represent the design that puts function above humanness, and it represents the many possibilities of complex designs in robotics and AI.", "\u201cHer\u201d is about a man falling in love with an artificially intelligent OS. We see virtual assistants today in our smartphones, but the technology is not as sophisticated as \u201cSamantha\u201d the smart OS in \u201cHer\u201d. Voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant are only able to do simple tasks such as setting an alarm or texting a friend, but Samantha is an impressive conversationalist with an amazing command of language, common sense, emotion and is able to handle complex tasks such as filtering emails and downloading millions of books in a split of a second. A highly advanced operating system like her is able to learn through experiences and evolve, something that is not achievable with the level of technology we have today. This film gives a glimpse of how voice assistants will be like in the future and how we can even fall in love with them.", "\u201cMoneyball\u201d shows the amazing power of predictive analytics and its capabilities in the real world. In this film, data analytics and the \u201cMoneyball theory\u201d was used to pick the best team of undervalued players under a minimal budget. Through the power of data mining on players, as well as two significant data points (slugging percentage and on-base percentage), a champion baseball team was formed. This film shows the importance of data in decision making and choosing the right statistics in predictive modeling. But more importantly, is the courage to make decisions based on analytics, and believing in the data to make a change.", "\u201cMargin Call\u201d demonstrates the impacts of erroneous predictive modeling trickles down to everyone in society. Evidently, technology does not live in a bubble and a tiny mistake can lead to terrible consequences. This film centers on the 2008 financial crisis, where risk analysts and financial analysts working in banks discover that their risk model is leading the firm to a financial catastrophe. This film teaches about the dangers of greed and how crucial it is to failproof every side of a predictive model to prevent catastrophes from happening.", "\u201cMinority Report\u201d displays data science at its best. In this film, a team of humans with psychic abilities or \u201cData scientists\u201d called PreCogs is able to predict future crimes by analyzing massive amounts of data. With this analysis, the visual data is transferred to the PreCrime, a police unit that is sent to prevent the crime. This brings up the idea of how data can be used to do great things in the real world, like preventing disasters and saving millions of lives.", "Alan Turing, the creator of the well-known \u201cTuring Test\u201d and father of modern computer science is featured in this movie. Set in WWII, Alan Turing is the legendary mathematician who cracks the enigma. The enigma is a strategic code that the Nazis use to encode their messages, and Turing decided to build a computer that is able to perform complex permutations faster than any human being could. With this computer, Turing paved the way for creating machines as well as enforcing the field of cryptography and cybersecurity. Moreover, an important lesson in the film is the importance of creativity and novelty when solving an \u201cenigma\u201d as well as the understanding of communication and human behavior which are key components to solving any problem.", "\u201cA Beautiful Mind\u201d features John Nash, a Nobel laureate in economics. He is famous for his contributions to the game theory or a.k.a the economic theory, which resulted in breakthroughs in the field of economics. His work has been utilized heavily in computer science. In this film, see how game theory is slowly being unraveled and discover its significance, not just the mathematical world, but in everyday life.", "Just an extra one for the irony, \u201c21\u201d is a true story about 6 students from MIT heads to Las Vegas to count cards using secret codes, hand signals, and a sharp eye. This movie shows the power of predictive analysis and teaches the viewers how data-based decisions can be profitable for any business.", "I hope that through these amazing sci-fi films, you are able to be fully engrossed into a world where AI becomes a friend, a lover, a killer, a soldier, a slave, and discover the power of mathematics and algorithms and its ability to achieve amazing things like stopping a war and winning big in a casino.", "Artificial Intelligence is truly the greatest invention of humanity. As seen in the movies, AI will either be the death of us, or an augmentation of our human cognitive and physical abilities, allowing us to do incredible things.", "AI will be everywhere in the near future, and the first step towards learning about it is to bust the myths around AI.", "One of the most important myth is that AI will become conscience and turn evil, killing every human in its path, even though that is unnerving, the real worry is that AI will have goals which are not aligned with ours. When that happens, there won\u2019t be much we can do to stop them.", "Another big myth is that Super AI is coming soon and we should all be worried now. The truth is, no one, not even the most intelligent experts in the field right now knows when Super AI will be achieved. It could be decades, centuries, or even never.", "The movies always portray AI as an intimidating robot figure that shoots lasers and is indestructible. However, an AI won\u2019t need a body to do its worst, all it needs is a place on the internet, and all hell can break loose.", "I hope you found this article useful and that you got an amazing \u201cMovies to watch list\u201d! Stay safe at home and all the best.", "To end, here is a quote about AGI by Elon Musk", "\u201cI\u2019m increasingly inclined to think that there should be some regulatory oversight, maybe at the national and international level, just to make sure that we don\u2019t do something very foolish. I mean with artificial intelligence we\u2019re summoning the demon.\u201d \u2014 Elon Musk warned at MIT\u2019s AeroAstro Centennial Symposium", "If you want to be updated with my latest articles follow me on Medium.", "Your home for data science.
