This preprocessing step is becoming crucial as the number of features and data set sizes increase. In this post, we will present the unique automatic process we developed at TapReason for evaluating the effectiveness of different feature selection algorithms for a specific dataset. In the first and second sections, we explain the motivation for performing feature selection and review common feature selection methods (FSM). The third section describes the method we used in our research and its results. In the fourth section, we present the TapReason algorithm for evaluating and selecting feature selection algorithms.", "In machine learning and pattern recognition, a feature is an individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon being observed. Collecting and processing data can be an expensive and time-consuming process. Therefore, choosing informative, discriminating and independent features is a crucial step for effective algorithms.", "In the age of information that we live in, data set sizes had become increasingly larger in both the number of instances and the number of features available. It has become quite common to see datasets with tens of thousands of features or more, in many different domains. Furthermore, in many cases, algorithm developers increase the number of available features by using a process called feature generation. Feature generation is the process of creating new features from one or multiple existing features, for potential use in the statistical analysis. Usually, the feature generation process transforms the representation of the existing features into a new more complex representation which should help the algorithms to perform more effectively. This process increases significantly the number of features especially if it is done automatically. The problem with ending up with so many features is that some algorithms behave badly in multiple dimensions and in some, it might lead to overfitting.", "With high-dimensional data, typically many features are irrelevant or redundant for a given learning task, having harmful consequences in terms of performance or computational cost (\u201cThe curse of dimensionality\u201d). Feature selection is an effective way for reducing dimensionality, removing irrelevant data, increasing learning accuracy, and improving result comprehensibility [1].", "Since some prediction models (PM) work better with specific feature selection methods we need to carefully select the FSM to best fit the PM. In TapReason the AI algorithm selects automatically the prediction model. Thus, we need to find a feature selection algorithm that will efficiently support all the PM we use. In addition, we also raise the question of how do we measure the efficiency of the feature selection? how do we know we are getting better at selecting features? And how can we use accumulated knowledge to improve the FS algorithm?", "Many feature selection methods have been proposed and studied for machine learning applications. They can be divided into four broad categories: the Embedded, Wrapper, Filter, and Hybrid approaches [1].", "Filter methods are preprocessing methods, independent of the learning algorithms, with good generality. They attempt to assess the merits of features from the data, ignoring the effects of the selected feature subset on the performance of the learning algorithm [1]. Their computational complexity is low, but the accuracy of the learning algorithms is not guaranteed to be improved. For example, some methods are ranking the features according to variance, correlation, univariate feature selection (selection based on univariate statistical tests such as chi2 test, F-value), ranking through compression techniques, like PCA, or by computing correlation with the output (e.g. Gram-Schmidt, mutual information).", "Wrapper methods are methods that assess subsets of variables according to their usefulness to a given predictor. These methods use the predictive accuracy of a predetermined learning algorithm to determine the goodness of the selected subsets. The two main disadvantages of these methods are :", "For example, there are stepwise methods proposed in linear regression analysis such as AIC, BIC, and MSE for Artificial Neural Network.", "The embedded methods incorporate feature selection as a part of the training process and are usually specific to a given learning algorithm, and therefore may be more efficient than the first two categories. Traditional machine learning algorithms like decision trees or artificial neural networks are examples of embedded approaches.", "Hybrid methods were proposed to combine the best properties of filters and wrappers. First, a filter method is used to reduce the feature dimension space, which will be considered by the subsequent wrapper. Then, a wrapper is employed to find the best candidate subset. Hybrid methods usually achieve high accuracy that is characteristic to wrappers and high-efficiency characteristic to filters [2]. In TapReason we are using hybrid methods filters and embedded in various combinations to automatically find the feature selection method best for the problem at hand.", "For the process of investigating the reaction of the prediction method to the feature selection method, we selected nine FSM and nine prediction methods (PM) and calculated the mean squared log error of the prediction. In Table 1 you can see the mean squared log error for different PM with dependence of the FSM. The color scales for each column separately from green (best) to red (worst). According to table 1, the FSM using low variance is the worst FSM for most of the PM. Na\u00efve Bayes, according to table 1 is the worst PM. All nonzero FSM is a combination of all the features that were selected by at least one FSM. All 5 nonzero FSM is a combination of all the features that were selected by at least five FSMs.", "There are several ways to analyze the results shown in table 1 for evaluating the different Feature Selection Methods. For example:", "Each of the above methods pointed to different optimal FSM. Therefore we introduced the fourth method:", "4. Minimum \ud835\udee5 \u2014 described in feature selection algorithm. This method showed the most promising results.", "In table 2, we show the \ud835\udee5 between the mean squared log error and the minimum mean squared log error of the PM. Analyzing the resulting table using the average of the FSM rows X 1000, yields a minimum at LSV: L1. As you can see each column has one FSM with zero which is the minimum mean squared log error of the PM. The FSM\u2019s, LassoCV, and all 5 nonzero have three of the minimum mean squared log error of the PM (FSM.Min) but none of them have the minimum average \ud835\udee5. The FSM LSV: L1 has the minimum average \ud835\udee5.", "According to this analysis the Lasso Regression FSM is selected since it has the best mean squared log error for LSV: L1, out of all the PMs. The result of 0.0384782765 is relatively close to the absolute minimum (Absolute.Min) optimum of 0.03735447816. But further investigation uncovers PM with relatively bad results tend to skew the selection process towards the algorithms that performed best for them. Thus, we\u2019ve decided to counter this effect by adjusting the weight of the PMs according to their distance from the absolute minimum (Absolute.Min). The distance is calculated according to the following equation:", "FSM.Min- The minimum mean squared log error of the FSM.", "Absolute.Min- The minimum mean squared log error at the table FSM/PM.", "PM.Min- The minimum mean squared log error of the prediction method.", "PM- The minimum mean squared log error.", "In table 3 we can see that for this example the final results do not change. But now FSMs with higher FSM.Min have less influence (weight) on the average and therefore, on the FSM selected. This way we give a chance to all of the FSMs but not in a way that can bias the results by large \ud835\udee5 from the Minimum.", "At TapReason, we use dozens of different FSMs in search for the optimal algorithm per problem. These FSMs include a wide variety of filters, embedded methods as well as ensembled FSMs that are constructed based on past performance. The feature selection method is updated offline on a regular basis per client per problem. The algorithm implemented is as follows:", "As result, the previous methods are rarely selected.", "We know that certain prediction methods work better with certain feature selection methods. Since in the presented process the FSM is selected first, the PM preference is not expressed in the process. Thus, we can collect the information of the best FSM for each PM and use it after the PM is selected.", "Your home for data science.
