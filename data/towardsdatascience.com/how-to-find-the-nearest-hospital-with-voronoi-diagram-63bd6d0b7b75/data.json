This sounds like an easy task. After all, you just need to find the shortest distance among all the hospitals in the US right?", "The obvious solution might not be the optimal solution. To search a hospital every time a user requests for the nearest hospital would be time-consuming, not to mention the situation when there are thousands of users using the app at the same time. So what is the solution?", "We could establish the region like above in advance with the dots are the hospitals. Whenever a patient needs a hospital, we just need to know which region they are at and take them to the region that is associated with that hospital. For example, if a patient is in the pink region, we are 100% sure the closest hospital is the dot within that region.", "What makes this method so great? We just compute the diagram once in advance. When a request for the hospital is received, a hospital will be spotted instantly. It sounds like this implementation worths trying!", "The diagram above is a Voronoi diagram. A Voronoi diagram is a partition of a plane into regions close to each of a given set of objects. To create the Voronoi diagram, we first need to grab some of its characteristics.", "In the diagram above, the distance of point (1,8) to the border is equal is the distance of point (9,4) to the border. The same rule applies with point (9,4) to (9,0). The border between 2 points is the bisector line, which is a line that cuts another line segment into equal parts.", "I choose to create the Voronoi diagram with an incremental algorithm. Since there is no Python source code for this implementation out there, I determine to implement this algorithm from scratch.", "To make this algorithm works, the data structure we need is a double connected edge list. A double connected edge list is a list that is split into half-edge, each pointing in a different direction. This difference in direction will be useful to identify which face the edge related to.", "It would be difficult and computationally expensive to compute the Voronoi diagram for every point at once. Instead, we will start with a small problem. Provided we already have the Voronoi diagram, how can we create a Voronoi diagram for an additional point? Update one point at a time will definitely be an easier task then update multiple points at once.", "Start with an empty double connected edge list", "Then draw the bisector between 2 points. Notice that the distance between each point to the bisector is equal.", "When the third point comes in:", "And this should give us an updated Voronoi diagram with 3 points!", "If we have the fourth point, the same strategy is applied.", "After more than one month of trying to understand the algorithm, implementing, and debugging, I finally make this to work. This is a Github repo of my implementation.", "To try this out, clone the repo and go to the directory", "Open a Jupyter Notebook or a .py file within that directory and run", "And you should see something like this", "The first parameter for plotVoronoi is the list of points (which is a list of tuples). The other parameters are optional and are the boundary for the Voronoi diagram (xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax).", "To see how the algorithm updates the Voronoid diagram, runs", "Of course, we still need to apply this diagram to the hospital data. Since my code still needs to be improved to handle every case, I could not make this work over 7581 data points. So I picked 4 data points from the latitudes of 4 different hospitals in the US to see how it looks like", "The code to create the map and the Voronoi diagram could be found here. As you can see, the map is split into 4 different regions with one hospital in each region. If a patient needs to find a hospital, we just need to find which region the patient belongs to and direct the patient to the closest hospital!", "Congratulation! You have just learned a technique to maximize your finding on the map with a Voronoi diagram. It has been an adventure to implement this algorithm but I felt rewarding to see this works. There are still errors I need to fix to cover every case and make this work on the map. Another task is also to figure out how to search with the Voronoi diagram. I am still working on this and would really appreciate if you have any feedback or ideas.", "Fork this repo if you want to try out this algorithm or use it for your project.", "I like to write about basic data science concepts and play with different algorithms and data science tools. You could connect with me on LinkedIn and Twitter.", "Star this repo if you want to check out the codes for all of the articles I have written.
