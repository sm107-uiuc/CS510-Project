They must adapt and innovate or risk being left behind.", "The application of computer vision in retail is set to fundamentally change the shopping experience for customers and retailers. In this blog I will be making a computer vision based multi class object classification model for retail products. This project has been inspired from the famous Amazon Go store. I hope you enjoy this article and find it insightful.", "Amazon describes Amazon Go as a new kind of store with no checkout required. That means when you shop at Amazon Go, you\u2019ll never have to wait in line. The store works with an Amazon Go application \u2014 you enter Amazon Go, take the products you want and thanks to the app just leave again. It works by using the same types of technologies found in self-driving cars, such as computer vision, sensor fusion and deep learning. This technology can detect when products are taken or returned to the shelves and keeps track of them in your virtual cart. When you leave the store with your goods, your Amazon account is charged and you are sent a receipt.", "Here is the video in case you want to check it out.", "I have used Freiburg Groceries Dataset for this project. It consists of 5000 256x256 RGB images of 25 food classes. The paper can be found here and the dataset here.", "The complete image classification pipeline can be formalized as follows:", "Without much ado, let\u2019s get started with the code. The complete project on github can be found here.", "I started with loading all the libraries and dependencies.", "Next I made a function to plot loss and accuracy which we will get after training the model.", "Also I made a couple of functions to return the label of a particular image and load the dataset.", "I continued with making separate classes for each and every product and called the function to load all the images for every class.", "Next I converted the images to categorical format before finally normalizing the images. Also I split the dataset into 2 parts \u2014 training set with 80% of data and testing set with 20%.", "Since the dataset size was quite small, I used data augmentation strategies like rotation, zooming and flipping. This almost doubled the size of dataset.", "Let\u2019s display some sample examples from each category.", "So far so good. Now comes the interesting part of the project. Let\u2019s make the deep learning model.", "I have used Transfer Learning using pre trained VGG weights. On top of it I used a average pooling layer to reduce the variance of the learned weights from the previous layers. Also I used 30% dropouts to reduce over-fitting. Finally I used a dense layer with 25 neurons for representing the 25 classes of grocery products in our dataset. I have used softmax as the actvation function as it is a multi class classification problem.", "I continued with defining some callbacks using keras. I used model checkpoint to save weights if validation accuracy increases. Also I used early stopping criterion if validation loss is beginning to plateau. The other 2 callbacks are for visualizing the results in tensorboard and for saving the logs in csv files.", "Next I defined the 2 optimizers. First one being a stochastic gradient descent with a learning rate of 0.0001 and momentum value of 0.99. The second one was Adam with a slightly larger learning rate of 0.001.", "On comparing the two, I found that Adam was giving much better results. Also I have used categorical cross-entropy as the loss function for our model. I trained the model for 50 iterations with a batch size of 128 which I figured out to be the optimal one for this problem.", "The model is able to reach a validation accuracy of 60% which is quite good considering the number of classes(25) with 100\u2013200 images in each category. Feel free to use different architectures or play with the hyper-parameters for better results.", "As one can notice there are quite a few wrongly classified samples predicted by our model. But still I feel this should be a good starting point for further work in this domain.", "Although this project is far from complete but it is remarkable to see the success of deep learning in such varied real world problems. Automatic object classification can be of great help to a food and groceries retailer in order to reduce human effort in the inventory management process of its warehouse and retail outlets. Also the friction-less store experience is being considered as the future of shopping.", "The corresponding source code can be found here.", "If you want to keep updated with my latest articles and projects follow me on Medium.
