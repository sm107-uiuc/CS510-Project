But they\u2019re also usually filled with rules that can get in the way of finding the pet that\u2019s just right for you. For example:", "Of course, these shelters are great. And these rules are for the dogs\u2019 and visitors\u2019 health and safety. But they weren\u2019t what I was hoping for to meet my future fur baby.", "When, I arrived at Muttville, I found what I was looking for:", "I sat myself down on one of the dog beds and waited to see which dogs came to me. I wanted a dog who was curious and cuddly. I wanted a dog who played nicely with the other dogs. Most of all, I didn\u2019t want to pick a dog. I wanted a dog to pick me.", "This was what I imagined when I thought about going to a shelter to find a dog to adopt.", "I visited Muttville several times over the span of a year before I was ready to take one home with me. During this time, I fell in love with Muttville.", "Muttville\u2019s mission is to find homes for senior dogs. The founder knew that shelters have a much easier time finding homes for younger dogs. They\u2019re still cute in the conventional way, owners may have an easier time training them and they\u2019re less likely to have health problems. Muttville only takes in older dogs. They provide reimbursement to new pet owners for medical expenses related to the dog\u2019s age. For example, my dog needed dental surgery when I first got her and Muttville covered the full cost of the surgery.", "The point of this blog post is not to advertise the shelter, so the last thing I\u2019ll say is that their social media is adorable. While I was OOooing and Aaahhing at their adorable dogs, their staff sold me on the idea of getting an older dog.", "Some benefits of adopting an older dog:", "As a first time dog owner with a busy schedule, it appealed to me to have a calmer dog who I did not need my undivided attention at all times.", "After many, many trips to Muttville, I met 8-year-old Ruth (at the time, she went by Cricket) and I began a new chapter in my life.", "I was given her medical records and information as part of my adoption paperwork. I could barely be bothered to glance at it all because I was a first time dog owner and I couldn\u2019t have been more excited about bringing Ruth home with me.", "Ruth and I started getting to know each other better. As I covered my Instagram with photos of her, her camera shy disappeared. I quickly saw that though I was told to expect her to be calm and detached, she is actually energetic and clingy.", "The more I learned who she was, the more I began to ask the question \u2014 Is this dog really 8-years-old??", "And then I\u2019d ask the follow up \u2014 what was her life like before I met her?", "The records I was given were pretty sparse. I had information about the vaccines she\u2019d received at the shelter and the vaccines she\u2019d need boosters for in the coming weeks. I was told that she had dental disease that would require surgery soon. Other than that, all I knew was:", "I\u2019ve developed theories about Ruth\u2019s life before me based on her personality, her likes/dislikes, and her reactions to walks through certain areas of San Francisco.", "But in reality, I have no idea who she was. The stories I create to fit all the pieces together are just that \u2014 stories.", "Stories are hard to evaluate. But as a data scientist, a question as simple as \u201cHow old is my dog?\u201d seems pretty easy to answer. Where is the regression model I can plug all her traits in to and get her age as an output?", "As I grapple with the juxtaposition of her puppy-like personality and her geriatric medical records, I just keep falling down the Google Rabbit Hole trying to find the answer to this question.", "With puppies, the proportions of features (and objective adorableness) are a clear sign that a dog is very young. Looking at how the baby teeth/adult teeth of that pup are growing in can provide an age estimate +/- a few weeks according to some vets.", "You\u2019ll notice in the graphic above that the older a dog gets, the less precisely that dog\u2019s age can be estimated. Without information about the type of dental care a dog had throughout its life, these lines get a lot fuzzier. A vet once told me that she\u2019d guess my dog was between 4 and 10 years old \u2014 not a very satisfying confidence interval.", "Other hints of a dog\u2019s age include:", "The list of vague indicators I found went on: Loss of Mobility, Pain, Loss of Cognitive Function\u00b3, even Amount of Tail Wagging\u2026", "Estimating the age of a dog is an art, not a science.", "I will start with the short answer again: a lot! According to PetMD,", "A geriatric Chihuahua might be 18 years of age and a geriatric Great Dane might be seven.", "Not only does breed play a role, but the size of a dog within that breed does too. For example, a 6 lb Yorkie will age more slowly than a 12 lb Yorkie. However, there is even plenty of disagreement about how different breeds of dogs and different sizes of dogs age.", "It is understandable that subjective traits aren\u2019t in a dataset somewhere. However, there is one objective trait that seems like it could provide some insight.", "Where is the dataset of number of teeth pulled from a dog along with the dog\u2019s weight, breed and age?", "All over the world, there are veterinarians doing dental work on dogs. Many individual offices likely have this information for all the dogs they treat.", "This is where we get to the challenge of data collection as a whole. It is unfortunately expensive, even when all of the data has already been recorded somewhere. Not every office is recording the data in the same way. Maybe it\u2019s all kept in one file but it\u2019s much more likely it\u2019s stored in the files for each individual dog. I don\u2019t expect that these offices have a reason to make this data queriable. They may not even have it in a computer.", "I do not possess the background in data collection to guess how many human hours it would take to reach out to every veterinarian for the data, follow up until the data is gathered and then sort that data such that it\u2019s all stored in the same manner, but I am confident that it would take a lot of time and it would be an expensive endeavor to get a sufficient sample size from each breed, and enough data to interpret the impact of weight within the breed.", "Data collection is often very difficult. As data scientists get better and better at creating programs to automate analysis of data, we can forget that before the Artificial Intelligence is done by a computer, many, many humans are behind the scenes recording, gathering and cleaning that data.", "In the case of predicting a dog\u2019s age, is the cost of gathering all this data worth the return of maybe predicting a dog\u2019s age better? All this data could be collected only to find that the very rough estimates currently available are as accurate as predictions get. Meanwhile, knowing a dog\u2019s age after a certain point makes little difference in how you care for that dog. Being able to answer this question really only serves the purpose of satisfying human owner curiosity.", "There is also a question of the ethics of creating a predictive model of this sort. If a dog has a harder time getting adopted the older it gets, creating a model like this may have a negative effect on a dog\u2019s ability to be adopted. Perhaps the question is not if this data is worth collecting, but if it should be collected.", "The best advice I found if you\u2019re still curious about your dog\u2019s age is to take close up photos of relevant features once a year or so\u00b3. This won\u2019t tell you your dog\u2019s age, but it will tell you how quickly your dog is aging and give you an idea what to keep the closest eye on.", "Your home for data science.
