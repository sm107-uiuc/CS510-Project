A probability distribution may be either discrete or continuous. A discrete distribution is one in which the data can only take on certain values, while a continuous distribution is one in which data can take on any value within a specified range (which may be infinite).", "There are a variety of discrete probability distributions. The usage of discrete probability distributions depends on the properties of your data. For example, use the:", "The binomial distribution is probably the most widely known of all discrete distribution. It is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes. One typical example of using binomial distribution is flipping coins. A coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails, and each outcome has the same probability of 1/2. Let\u2019s take a look at when the Binomial Distribution can be used!", "Q: A warehouse ships ten printing machines, four of which are defective to a company.

Both the hypergeometric distribution and the binomial distribution describe the number of times an event occurs in a fixed number of trials. The probability remains the same for every trial for the binomial distribution. In contrast, in the hypergeometric distribution, each trial changes the probability for each subsequent trial because there is no replacement.", "Q: Let\u2019s change the previous problem a little bit. If we now sample without replacement, what\u2019s the probability that the company accepts the shipment?", "We know that the total number of printing machines N is 10, and the number of machines chosen at random to be tested n is 5. Let\u2019s define N1 as non-defective, and N2 defective, so N1 =6 and N2= 10- N1 =4. For the company to accept the shipment, we can\u2019t have any defective machine. The number of ways to choose all non-defective machine is 6C5, and the number of ways to select 0 defective machine is 4C0.", "Poisson distribution helps us to predict the probability of a specific event occurs within a time interval.", "Notice that the Poisson is a limiting form of the Binomial Distribution.

If Diane takes a 10-mins shower, what\u2019s the probability that the phone rings during that time?", "Given that two calls per 60 mins, we first calculate the number of calls we expect per 10 mins, \u03bb=2 * 10 / 60 = 1/3. Now we want to calculate the probability of getting at least one call during this 10 mins, so essentially we want to compute P(X\u22651), which can be written as 1 \u2014 P(X=0).", "The geometric distribution represents the probability that a specified number of trials will take place before the first success occurs.
