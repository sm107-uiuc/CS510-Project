The premise was simple enough: what is a DUC and how can one identify it in a company\u2019s inventory of wells? Our presentation was time limited, so I thought it would be valuable to go through, in more detail, our working methodology and analysis of this uniquely Canadian problem.", "In the US, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes a monthly list of predicted DUCs. In Canada however, there is no such information, not even by province.", "We went with the strict definition of drilled but uncompleted well, which is a well that has not registered or recorded a completion activity yet. There was a minimum time period we required between rig release and the completion activity because sometimes there might be delays in construction or completion, and we wouldn\u2019t qualify that as a DUC since it was never intended to be one to begin with.", "My group and I had to set some criteria for how we classified and treated DUCs. Here\u2019s the breakdown of what we used:", "\u201cThe metric uses a fixed ratio of estimated total production from new wells divided by the region\u2019s monthly rig count, lagged by two months.\u201d", "There can be multiple wells that are drilled at the same time or over long stretches of time at a common surface location. When there are multiple wells (or more often known as multi-well pads) drilled at the same time, a typical rig will stay on the site until everything is complete. In another scenario, a producer might want to drill another well at the same surface location years down the road How do we capture this? For our analysis, we grouped wells together by a common surface location. I went a bit further when we were looking into this by grouping wells with common surface location and by common license date (by month, year). Doing this allows us to roughly estimate which group of wells were drilled and completed at the same time. However, there can be errors like when a producer decides to license 3 wells but drills 2, or if they add an additional well to their license the next day after.", "While the strict criteria of a DUC was a lag time of two or more months between rig release and completion, we felt this did not cover all types of well activities. We designated wells that \u201clooked and acted\u201d like a DUC by two additional criteria:", "So what\u2019s so special about DUC+ wells and why did our group care? The main idea of exploring these particular wells was because true DUCs have not had the capital money spent on the completion of a well nor on the facility that\u2019s built around them to allow for production. However, with DUC+, either capital has already been spent on completions or capital has been spent on both completion and the above-ground facilities and piping. If we can use some sort of rule of thumb for capital costs based on where the well is at in its lifespan, then we could in theory (and in a very crude way), estimate the value of those assets or liabilities.", "The second reason is that because they act in the same way as a true DUC, in which they are not actively producing, it gives us an opportunity to evaluate how much surplus production a company can have in theory if they are short on capital to drill new wells.", "We found around 1400\u20131500 cumulative DUCs over the span of 5 years in about a dataset that had roughly 10,000 unique wells. This means at some point in their timeline, 15% of wells were a DUC, which from my point of view, isn\u2019t an outrageous number. You can see that there is a rough correlation between oil price and the number of DUCs being held by producers. What is very important to note that the graph starts at 0, but also ends at 0 cumulative DUCs. We have no information if there were an inventory of DUCs before. We also know the dataset doesn\u2019t constitute all of the producers, and we are limited to data published after 2015.", "What is different than the Canadian DUCs that we observed was that the overall accumulation of DUCs down in the US was positive rather than net zero. What we are observing, albeit with limited data, is that Canadian producers operate very differently than their US counterparts when it comes to when they tap into their DUC inventory.", "If we broke down true DUCs, DUCs+, and other well pattern types, this is the type of rough distribution we could estimate:", "Here is the rough definitions of what I meant by the above legend:", "One topic that wasn\u2019t discussed in great detail was whether or not there was so financial/economic reason why certain wells would be designated as DUCs and others not. What we can see in the figure below, is that it depends on which formation you look at. For Montney, Viking, and Cardium, non-DUCs produce more than DUCs, whereas it is the opposite for the Duvernay wells. When you look at the overall average of DUCs versus non-DUCs production, the aggregate is similar to that of the Duvernay formation. In short, the inconsistencies do not give a clear answer why one well would be chosen as a DUC over another if we were to solely focus on potential production alone.", "One of the key metrics that investors, banks, and interested parties can obtain from the knowledge of DUC counts is the proven assets of a given company. However, we didn\u2019t look at the DUC production decline curve (for each formation) more closely. A typical well production decline curves looks as follows:", "There are two great possibilities that we could have extended our analysis as a value added item in the datathon:", "We found that Baytex Energy had over 200 DUCs during the 5 year period, while the next producer, ARC Resources, had half as many around 100. Shell, coming in at 10th, had only around ~30. Without further details, we were unable to answer the question of why and what explains how DUCs are determined and what factors influence their numbers.", "One of the major hurdles we encountered during the very end of the datathon was to try and incorporate financials of the companies that had the most DUCs.As we collated the data from TSX, we began to realize that this was probably not feasible (at least with the time limit that we had). Consider that Baytex Energy was predicted to have the most DUCs in Canada at 200+. For simplicity\u2019s sake, its annual income statement from 2015\u20132019 hovered around $1.1\u20131.8 billion CAD.", "Now consider Royal Dutch Shell which had a revenue that is 300 times that of Baytex. Also note that there is no way to quickly figure out the portion of revenue that is specific to Shell Canada rather than Royal Dutch Shell as a whole. We predicted Shell to have around 30 DUCs, so obviously there are significant more factors at play than what we had time for.", "I want to note that we tried to comb through the finances of all the public companies that were represented in the dataset, and go through their assets and liabilities. As described above, this did not work in our favour and we had to abandon a good 5\u201310 hours of work. This did not represent time lost or a failure in my opinion. We were able to conclude that it would not possible to derive any meaningful conclusions from the information gathered, and we were able to also exclude this in order to get our primary messages across.", "It has been quite the rollercoaster ride for oil and gas majors for 2020. If we did a quick analysis and review some of the major mergers and acquisitions within the oil industry (at least in the Canadian context), would these in any way affect their overall predicted inventory of DUCs?", "From the 5 case studies, the DUCs would have little affect on any merger and acquisition decisions when looking back.", "One of the most important items that I always find we miss is the focus on the public as a stakeholder. The environmental and regulatory processes in Alberta and Canada are always under scrutiny. Below is an example article that focuses on the issue of orphaned and abandoned wells in Alberta.", "The economic climate has been particularly brutal in 2020. It gives us pause on the impact of possible bankruptcies in the oil and gas sector. Even the pioneer in shale hydraulic fracturing giant, Chesapeake Energy, could not escape this fate back in June 2020 (albeit there was poor management prior and high debt loading). Having a clear picture on DUCs, DUCs+, and number of wells can give us an idea of what the current landscape looks like. It can help regulators like the BC Oil and Gas Commission (OGC) and the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) better prepare should a bankruptcy occur.", "This is hugely important as one would remember the Redwater Energy case. After Redwater Energy, a publicly traded oil and gas entity, went into bankruptcy, the AER took its trustee to the Supreme Court on appeal that it had to pay for its environmental liabilities first before its creditors. In the landmark Supreme Court ruling, it writes", "Although GTL remains fully protected from personal liability by federal law, it cannot walk away from the environmental liabilities of the bankrupt estate by invoking s. 14.06(4) . On a proper application of the Abitibi test, the Redwater estate must comply with ongoing environmental obligations that are not claims provable in bankruptcy.", "Perhaps of interest in the future is an exploration of Alberta Orphan Well map to see if we can gain any insight through the power of data science. This would be an increasingly bigger takeaway than purely financials alone.", "In no particular order, I want to thank my colleagues Lahcene K, Dapo A, Tony A, Chris L, Adam E, and Qian G.", "Chemical engineer and data science enthusiast. I am interested in the intersection of both. I am also exploring data science in the world of political analysis."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
