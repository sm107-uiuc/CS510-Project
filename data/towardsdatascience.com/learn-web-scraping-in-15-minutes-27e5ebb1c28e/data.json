Although web scraping can be done manually, in most cases, automated tools are preferred when scraping web data as they can be less costly and work at a faster rate.", "The simplest way is to check the robots.txt file of the website. You can find this file by appending \u201c/robots.txt\u201d to the URL that you want to scrape. It is usually at the website domain /robots.txt. If all the bots indicated by \u2018user-agent: *\u2019 are blocked/disallowed in the robots.txt file, then you\u2019re not allowed to scrape. For this article, I am scraping the Flipkart website. So, to see the \u201crobots.txt\u201d file, the URL is www.flipkart.com/robots.txt.", "BeautifulSoup: BeautifulSoup is a Python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files. It works with your favourite parser to provide idiomatic ways of navigating, searching, and modifying the parse tree.", "Pandas: Pandas is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy to use open-source data analysis and manipulation tool, built on top of the Python programming language.", "It is an incredible tool for pulling out information from a webpage. You can use it to extract tables, lists, paragraphs and you can also put filters to extract information from web pages. For more info, you can refer to the BeautifulSoup documentation", "First, we import the BeautifulSoup and the requests library and these are very important libraries for web scraping.", "requests: requests, is one of the packages in Python that made the language interesting. requests is based on Python\u2019s urllib2 module.", "To get the contents of the specified URL, submit a request using the requests library. This is the URL of the Flipkart website containing laptops.", "This is the Flipkart website comprising of different laptops. This page contains the details of 24 laptops. So now looking at this, we try to extract the different features of the laptops such as the description of the laptop (model name along with the specification of the laptop), Processor (Intel/AMD, i3/i5/i7/Ryzen3Ryzen5/Ryzen7), RAM (4/8/16 GB), Operating System (Windows/Mac), Disk Drive Storage (SSD/HDD,256/512/1TB storage), Display (13.3/14/15.6 inches), Warranty(Onsite/Limited Hardware/International), Rating(4.1\u20135), Price (Rupees).", "Here we need to specify the content variable and the parser, which is the HTML parser. So now soup is a variable of the BeautifulSoup object of our parsed HTML. soup.prettify() displays the entire code of the webpage.", "When you click on the \u201cInspect\u201d tab, you will see a \u201cBrowser Inspector Box\u201d open. We observe that the class name of the descriptions is \u2018_3wU53n\u2019 so we use the find method to extract the descriptions of the laptops.", "Extracting the descriptions from the website using the find method-grabbing the div tag which has the class name \u2018 _3wU53n\u2019. This returns all the div tags with the class name of \u2018 _3wU53n\u2019. As class is a special keyword in python, we have to use the class_ keyword and pass the arguments here.", "Create an empty list to store the descriptions of all the laptops. We can even access the child tags with dot access. So now iterate through all the tags and then use the .text method to extract only the text content from the tags. In every iteration append the text to the descriptions list. So after iterating through all the tags, the descriptions list will have the text content of all the laptops (which is the description of the laptop-model name along with specifications).", "Similarly, we apply the same approach to extract all the other features.", "We observe that the various specifications are under the same div and the class names are the same for all those 5 features (Processor, RAM, Disk Drive, Display, Warranty).", "All the features are inside the \u2018li\u2019 tag and the class name is the same for all which is \u2018tVe95H\u2019 so we need to apply some technique to extract the distinct features.", "The .text method is used to extract the text information from the tags so this gives us the values of Processor, RAM, Disk Drive, Display, Warranty. So in the same way, we apply this approach to the remaining features as well.", "In the same manner, we extract the price of each laptop and add all the prices to the prices list.", "Here we are getting the length of the ratings to be 37. But what\u2019s the reason behind it?", "We observe that the class name for the recommended laptops is also the same as the featured laptops, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s extracting the ratings of recommended laptops as well.This is leading to an increase in the number of ratings. It has to be 24 but now it's 37!", "Last but not the least, merge all the features into a single data frame and store the data in the required format!", "Saving the dataset to a CSV file", "Now we get the whole dataset into a CSV file.", "To verify it again, we read the downloaded CSV file in Jupyter Notebook.", "As this is a dynamic website, the content keeps on changing!", "You can always refer to my GitHub Repository for the entire code.", "Connect with me on LinkedIn here", "\u201cFor every $20 you spend on web analytics tools, you should spend $80 on the brains to make sense of the data.\u201d \u2014 Jeff Sauer", "I hope you found the article insightful.
