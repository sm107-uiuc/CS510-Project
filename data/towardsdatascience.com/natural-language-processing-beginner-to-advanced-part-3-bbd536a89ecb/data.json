For example, spelling mistakes that happen by mistake as well as by choice (informal words such as \u2018lol\u2019, \u2018u\u2019, \u2018gud\u2019 etc.). Also, the problem of spelling variations of a word that occurs due to different pronunciations (e.g. Mumbai, Bombay).", "The two methods that we talked about in the last part \u2014 stemming and lemmatization \u2014 are both parts of a technique called canonicalization. Basically, canonicalization means reducing a word to its base form.", "There are scenarios where we can not canonicalize a word just by using stemming and lemmatization. Thus, we will need another technique to canonicalize the words correctly. For example, if the word \u2018allowing\u2019 is misspelled as \u2018alowing\u2019, then we will have a redundant token as \u2018alow\u2019 after stemming the misspelled word, and lemmatization wouldn\u2019t even work as it only works on correct dictionary spelling.", "The same problem is with the pronunciation of same words in different patois. For example, the word \u2018humour\u2019 used in British English, is spelled as \u2018humor\u2019 in American English. Both are correct spellings, but they will give two different base forms, after stemming, when used in the form \u2018humouring\u2019 and \u2018humoring\u2019.", "There are some words that have different pronunciation in different languages. As a result, they are ultimately written differently. For example a common Indian surname like \u2018Srivastava\u2019 is also spelled as \u2018Shrivastava\u2019, \u2018Shrivastav\u2019, or \u2018Srivastav\u2019. Therefore, we must reduce all forms of a particular word to one single and common word.", "To attain this, we will get to know about a technique is called phonetic hashing. The phonetic hashing method combines the same phonemes (smallest unit of sound) into one bucket and gives them the same hash code for all the variations. So, the words \u2018color\u2019 and \u2018colour\u2019 have the same code.", "Phonetic hashing is a technique used to canocalize words that have different variants but same phonetic characteristics, that is, the same pronunciation.", "Now, Soundexes are algorithms that can be used to calculate the hash code of a given word. Phonetic Hashing uses these Soundex algorithms. The algorithms differ from language to language. American Soundex is the most popular Soundex algorithm and we will be using that. Also, it doesn\u2019t matter which language the input word comes from \u2014 as long as the words sound similar, they will get the same hash code.", "Phonetic hashing is a four-character code. So, let us calculate the hash code(also known as Soundex) of the word \u2018Chennai\u2019 by applying the following steps:-", "After encoding the code becomes C55.", "4. If two or more letters with the same number are adjacent in the original name (before step 1), only retain the first letter; also two letters with the same number separated by \u2018h\u2019 or \u2018w\u2019 are coded as a single number, whereas such letters separated by a vowel are coded twice. This rule also applies to the first letter. Now, we have two 5\u2019s, so we will merge them into one and get C5.", "5. If there are too few letters in our word that we can\u2019t assign three numbers, append with zeros until there are three numbers. If we have four or more numbers, retain only the first three. Since we have one letter and only one number, we will append two zeroes at the end of the encoding to make it a four-character code. Hence, we get C500 as the final code for \u2018Chennai\u2019.", "Thus, we see that the Soundex code for city names like \u2018Bengaluru\u2019 and \u2018Bangalore\u2019 is the same, B524, which is what we were aiming for.", "So, we saw how to deal with different pronunciations of a particular word. Next, let us see how to deal with misspellings.", "Simply put, an edit distance is the minimum number of edits required to convert one string to another, that is, given string to the target string.", "Now, you must be wondering what is an edit. So, the possible edits are as follows:-", "The most common edit distance algorithm is the Levenshtein edit distance which you can learn about, in detail, here. There is another edit option that you can do called the \u2018transpose operation\u2019, where you can swap the two adjacent characters of a given string. But, this operation is only available in the Damerau-Levenshtein edit distance.", "A spelling corrector is a widely used application. If you have the autocorrect feature enabled on your phone, the incorrect spellings get replaced by the correct ones. Another example is when you use a search engine such as Google to search for anything and mistype a word, it suggests the correct word. Spell correction is an important part of lexical processing. In many applications, spell correction forms an initial preprocessing layer.", "We saw how to calculate the edit distance between two words. Now, we will use the concept of edit distance to make a spelling corrector. We will now see how to make the famous Norvig spell corrector.", "We need a large corpus of text with proper spelling. This corpus of text will also serve as a dictionary search for our spell corrector. Here, the large corpus of text \u2018big.txt\u2019 is nothing but a book. It\u2019s the book \u2018The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\u2019 present in text format at Project Gutenberg\u2019s website.", "There are five main functions that we will use to find the correct spelling of a word and they are as follows:", "2. edits_two(): function creates a list of all the possible words that are two edits away from the input word. Most of these words will also be garbage.", "3. known(): function filters out the valid English word from a list of given words. It uses the frequency distribution as a dictionary that was created using the seed document. If the words created using edits_one() and edits_two() are not in the dictionary, they\u2019re discarded.", "4. possible_corrections(): This function takes the input word and uses the above three functions to return the correct spelling for a given input word. First, it checks for the spelling of the input word and if the spelling is correct, that is, if the word is present in the dictionary, it returns no spelling suggestions since it is already a correct dictionary word.", "If the spelling is incorrect, it searches for every dictionary words that are one edit away from the input word and returns a list of them. If there are no dictionary words that are an edit away from the given word, then it searches for all dictionary words which are two edits away and returns a list of them. If there are no words that are two edits away, the input word is returned back, this means that there are no alternatives that the spell corrector could find.", "5. prob(): The prob() function will create a probability associated with each of the suggested correct spellings and return the one with the highest probability, or we can say, it takes the suggested correct spellings and returns the one that is most frequent among the input words in our text corpus.", "This is exactly why we need a large text corpus instead of a dictionary. A dictionary only contains a list of all correct English words. But, a text corpus not only contains all the correct words but it could also be used to create a frequency distribution of all these words.", "Now, we\u2019re almost done building the spell corrector. We just need to put all the pieces of the code together and wrap them up in a new function that uses all the functions created till now.", "Voila! We have successfully created a simple yet very effective spelling corrector. We can now use it to correct spellings on any given text corpus.", "That\u2019s it form part 3 folks. We have covered the whole of lexical processing in part 2 and part 3. Now, we will move onto the next major part of NLP \u2014 Syntactic Processing. Cheers!", "Your home for data science.
