Speed is not the most important, learning is.", "Data science is multi-disciplinary. There is a lot more to data science than just firing up Jupyter Notebooks. You learn Mathematics, Statistics, Economics, Marketing, Business, Data Structures, Algorithms and heck, even Customer Psychology. On top of Jupyter Notebook, you also have to be familiar with version control systems, databases, DevOps and different programming languages. The list never ends.", "With the COVID-19 lockdown situation, I am saving 3 hours of travelling time to and from my workplace every day. I figured that with that amount of time, why not make full use of it?", "Online courses. No, not Netflix. Online courses.", "You will be surprised at the amount of knowledge you can acquire from online courses on top of your university/workplace. With a smorgasbord of online courses and so little time, how do we master this field?! In this article, I will provide 5 tips on how to complete a large number of online courses even with very little time. And if you were wondering, no, the title is not an exaggeration. It is possible to complete 6 weeks of courses in 6 days.", "Motivation is important. If you are not motivated, the rest of the article is not going to be of any help. Find out what motivates you.", "Do you want to learn more? Do you want to build your very own product/solution? Do you want to be hired by FAANG? Do you want to be promoted to Chief Data Scientist? Do you want to impress your female/male friends? Do you not want to waste that $99 you already spent on your course?", "Your source of motivation might not be healthy but\u2026 whatever works right? It does not matter what motivates you. What matters is that you are motivated and you WANT to do this. If you do not help yourself, no one can.", "Why is motivation so important? Motivation drives you to be consistent. It drives you to stick to your schedule. It drives you to click on your courses, bit by bit, till you complete it.", "Do some research before you embark on this journey. Do not simply click on a course because you heard that 90% of the people get employed after completing that course. If you are already a master of Python, there is no point learning \u201cIntroduction to Python\u201d.", "Firstly, find out who you are. Do you want to be a Data Analyst or a Data Engineer or a Data Scientist? (Yes, there are all different).", "After you decided on which path you are more interested in, find out what kind of technology do you want to learn. If you have a dream company, do not be afraid to approach them to find out their job scopes and the kind of skillsets they are looking out for in an ideal candidate. A simple Google search of \u201cWhat are the top ___ used by ___?\u201d will return you with lots of results.", "In addition, I have provided a list of useful resources at the end of this article. Do check it out!", "Tip: Try to select courses with hands-on exercises. If not, try to select courses with quizzes. Do your best to avoid courses that only contain videos.", "Be consistent. Quick question, which is better:", "Everybody has a different learning style. Some of us must learn something every day while some of us must take long breaks. It does not matter as long as it suits your learning style, you are motivated and you and consistent.", "I suggest that you look through your course syllabus and try out one lesson. Gauge how much time you need to complete a lesson, calculate how much time you need to complete the whole course, and squeeze the plan into your schedule according to your deadline (if you have a deadline).", "Lastly, plan your schedule. Use a hardcopy planner, use Samsung Notes, use Apple Calendar or write it down on a piece of toilet paper. I myself use Microsoft sticky notes. It is not the best but it is what I am most used to. The feeling of striking something off your schedule is just plain satisfying. It keeps me going, keeps me wanting to delete tasks after tasks.", "Interleaving is an effective study method. It involves switching between different topics in a study session.", "For instance, instead of learning about MongoDB every day for the next 2 weeks, try learning MongoDB and Git over a period of 4 weeks. You can observe in my sticky notes above that I am learning Azure and AWS in the same day.", "And yet again, everyone is different. If this does not work for you, you do not have to follow it. Do what\u2019s best for you!", "In order to make sure that you fully understand what you have learnt, I suggest the following steps (in no order of importance):", "No, online courses are not useless. It is only useless if you rush through the courses just for the certificate and fail to learn anything. Bits and pieces of software/libraries are what that will piece into a final product that you can present to a client. Never stop learning!", "Your home for data science.
