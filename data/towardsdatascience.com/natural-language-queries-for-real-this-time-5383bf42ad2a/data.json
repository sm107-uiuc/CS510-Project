FactEngine is an initiative to change the way people perceive of databases and database queries altogether.", "That might seem like a bold initiative, but the database industry has been in a rut for some time and only lately are people demanding more and getting it.", "Since the early 1990s, I can remember people experimenting with natural language queries as a means to make databases more accessible to the average person. In those days Structured Query Language, or SQL, was all the rage and the relational databases they operated over had already taken a stronghold on the industry.", "The main problem with relational databases is that SQL is verbose to write and time consuming to reverse engineer. That is, if you have an SQL query that you did not write, trying to work out what it says is sometimes very difficult.", "For instance, the query above in SQL looks like the following:", "I know right? What does that say?", "So for a long time, people have been looking to find ways to query databases in natural language so as to make their lives easier.", "Part of the advent of so-called Graph Databases was to have query languages that more naturally accommodated the predicates between entities that were being spoken of. This, focusing more towards natural language. For example, if a person is friends with other people in our database we might write a graph query that looks like *:", "I know right? What\u2019s with all the dots and dashes, CAPITAL LETTERS, colons.", "The beauty of FactEngine is that with the underlying language architecture (controlled natural language) it does not matter whether you operate over a graph database or a relational database.", "In an earlier post, I explained why any relational database can be considered a graph database, and that all databases are multi-model bar thinking different. Which in layman\u2019s terms, means that any database can be queried in a natural language, albeit controlled. Any database can also be queried as a graph database.", "The reason is the main two types of database, graph and relational, are at their conceptual core have a homomorphism approaching isomorphism. This means in layman\u2019s terms, that they can be conceptually be thought of as being the same.", "But let us get back to natural language queries and controlled natural language.", "As the name suggests, a controlled natural language, is natural language syntax that has some measure of control as to what you can say and how you can say it. A sufficiently elegant controlled natural language will look just like vanilla natural language, because at its core it is, of course, natural language.", "The FactEngine controlled natural language works because it too is has a degree of homomorphism with other languages.", "That is to say\u2026you should not have to worry about whether you operate over a relational database or a dedicated graph database\u2026all you need know is that all databases can be considered a type of graph database. That way, you can use one language over any database.", "Natural language queries have previously had a reputation as being snake oil.", "The reason for this is that most attempts at natural language queries (NLQs) rely on some form of inference to map natural language to a query language and database structure, rather than a purely algorithmic approach that will always guarantee the desired result.", "The inference engines generally used for NLQs rely on disambiguating natural language sentences in much the same way the human mind disambiguates complex, and sometimes ambiguous, sentences. In that regard NLQ inference engines suffer the same potential to misinterpret a natural language query in the same way people get things wrong.", "Indeed, if you imagine an artificial general intelligence (AGI) as smart as any person alive, then your artificial intelligence offers no better chance of disambiguation as that person. This is a problem for querying databases where you want exact answers to well structured queries.", "Controlled natural language offers the solution, at least until an AGI can ask questions to disambiguate an ambiguous sentence and resolve a query on its own. Simply though, even if an AGI does that\u2026what does the AGI resolve the query too? The answer has to be a structured query of some sort, that may as well have been a controlled natural language query in the first place.", "So to get to where FactEngine is today, FactEngine needed a basis architecture that allows for the construction of controlled natural language queries.", "My previous company, Viev, worked towards that goal for 11 years in the development of the Boston conceptual modelling tool which helps users develop data models containing natural language constructs and using Object-Role Modeling as the basis of model development.", "But FactEngine also needed a reason for being. Beyond the obvious advantage of natural language conceptual queries, it was the state of the extant technology on the market that drove development forward.", "Graph queries are a jump from SQL in terms of ease of reading, and to get to a point where natural language queries make today\u2019s graph query languages look primitive by comparison, we needed a leap in disruptive technology at another level again.", "The primary impetus for FactEngine came when the author first saw the query language for the database Grakn. A typical Grakn query looks like the following:", "I know right? What does that say?", "This is touted by Grakn as a \u201chigh level query language\u201d. Enough said\u2026the same query in FactEngine looks like this:", "That is, Grakn set the challenge by decrying other languages as primitive, and so the challenge was accepted to make it clear what a high level query language looks like.", "Controlled natural language queries provide the same utility as comparable SQL and graph queries, and it is the utility of having software actually help you write the query in the first place which is a real benefit.", "The following is a snapshot of software helping a person write a natural language query in FactEngine:", "Ease of writing queries has become topical in an artificial intelligence era. People are expecting more from their databases and accompanying query languages. People do not expect to be information technology experts to get results from a database. Providing natural language queries allows customer facing applications place the tools to query databases directly into the customers hands, rather than having to pass the job onto more technical staff.", "Indeed, if you look at extant SQL and graph database technology, it is almost as if it is designed to make life difficult and restrict access to technically minded people. This wastes time and resources. The democratisation of data and technology is all about expanding the market of technology by making it easier for everyday people to use.", "Another benefit is that natural languages are very easy to read by a person. Once written, natural language queries can be easily shared with other people who will immediately know what the query is designed to do upon reading it.", "Extant query languages such as SQL and current graph query languages (other than FactEngine Knowledge Language) come from an era when everything was too hard. The thinking is that it\u2019s too hard to consider of a \u2018 \u2018 (space) character as a character, so we\u2019ll go with MATCH (p1:person)-[:FRIEND-WITH]-(p2:person) instead of WHICH Person is friends with WHICH Person 2. Or, it\u2019s too hard to get a computer to assign its own differentiated variables for entities, so we end up with $p3 isa person; $p2 != $p3; instead of Person 3 IS NOT Person 2.", "While keeping things difficult and not getting a computer to do the work for you may keep technocrats in a job, it isn\u2019t exactly helpful or customer focused. It also makes mockery of perceived state of the art and perceived elegance.", "Getting the computer to do the hard work for you also takes time, and so rushing a product to market leaves customers with solutions that lack finesse.", "So, FactEngine rides on 13 years research and development into Object-Role Modeling software and over 30 years extant research into Object-Role Modeling and Fact-Based Modelling overall.", "Fact Based Modelling takes a view that natural language, including spaces and phrases, is all part of the database conceptual modelling problem.", "A typical Object-Role Model looks like the following:", "Software for Object-Role Modeling (ORM) is difficult to write, and that\u2019s why you don\u2019t see much ORM software on the market. The same can be said for Fact Based Modelling (FBM).", "But once you have a suitable ORM/FBM software, remarkable things are possible. It is, for instance, easy to visualise your model as an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a relational database, or a Property Graph Schema (PGS) for a graph database. For instance:", "So to technicalities, you need a suitable metamodel of Fact Based Modelling to start with and then you are good to go. There is much more involved, but this much is proprietary.", "Enough to say that your customers should not have to worry about whether they operate over a graph database or a relational database, all they need care about is being able to write queries simply and easily over that database.", "FactEngine is a new breed of commercial database query language technology. For straight-forward 1:1 mappings to SQL, the technology is reasonably mature and advancing. Graph query languages, such as Neo4j have SQL O/JDBC drivers, so proof of concept over SQL and graph databases is a fait accompli.", "Where is the rest of the world at? Well\u2026we know that one, that\u2019s why FactEngine was born ;)", "Thank you for reading. As time permits I will write more on natural language queries, fact-based and object-role based modelling, conceptual modelling and graph databases.", "Update March 2023: Now using Large Language Models to convert natural language to FEQL (FactEngine Query Language) to SQL/Cypher: What is Schema-Aware Semantic Search? | by Victor Morgante | Feb, 2023 | Medium", "Your home for data science.
