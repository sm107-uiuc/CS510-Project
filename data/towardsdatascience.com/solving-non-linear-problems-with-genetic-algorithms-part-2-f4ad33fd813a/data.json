So, if X1 is varying between 30 and 50, we should create individuals with the same characteristics.", "However, it is quite likely that the optimum value(s) of X1 belongs to a smaller range.", "For example, consider that X1 corresponds to a temperature and that it contributes best to the target between 35\u00b0 and 42\u00b0. The exact and optimum temperature will be ultimately defined by other production parameters and/or constraints (flow rate, viscosity, etc.).", "If we choose the original observed universe, 15 possible X1 values would be:", "Whereas the smartest choice would be:", "So we will build an algorithm which, at each new generation, will progressively narrow the range explored for each feature and keep the number of individuals generated stable. Thus, we will maximize the likelihood of obtaining individuals with the best characteristics.", "As we did in the first article, we will create a regression example with 10 features and train a Random Forest without fine-tuning any hyper-parameters:", "The following function will create a new generation according to the characteristics inherited from the previous one (min-max range of each feature) and some potential constraints:", "The function here-below will select the individuals who are the closest from the target:", "Then, we create the whole process with a defined number of generations (here 5000 but we could also stop the process after n iterations without any improvement on individuals)", "Each generation will be composed of 100 individuals; only 10 of them will transmit their characteristics to the next one.", "Every time an improvement is discovered (= one solution is getting closer from the target), we will highlight it.", "The output of this process is:", "To understand the difference with the model described in the first article, let\u2019s compare their performance (the first column corresponds to the number of individuals created):", "We can clearly see that this new method is capable of reaching a smaller distance from the target than the previous one with fewer individuals involved!", "Are you keen to explore other methods to reach an optimum solution?", "Your home for data science.
