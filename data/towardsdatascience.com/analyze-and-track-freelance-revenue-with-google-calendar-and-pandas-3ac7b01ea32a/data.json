When I started in 2016, I manually entered all private classes in a simple Google Sheets document. The goal was to track hours worked, revenue earned and to analyze the trends and insights of my new career.", "The spreadsheet required manual entry of classes; the date, length, student name and revenue earned. It took about 5 minutes to manually update the document and I enjoyed the weekly ritual of reviewing my schedule, reflecting on the classes given and revenue earned. However, it started to become a bit tedious to remember to do it every week and after a few years and multiple income sources, the spreadsheet ballooned into an unstable beast of excessive tabs, pivot tables and various sources of raw data. It was time to automate a solution.", "My life and work schedules are run by Google Calendar \u2014 this includes all of my private classes, bike/photography tours, academy work, governmental positions, translation gigs, and random freelance jobs. Every \u2018unit\u2019 of paid work is in the calendar; I simply needed to figure out a way to directly access the Google Calendar data and rebuild my spreadsheet into a sustainable analyzing machine. In my previous corporate life, I worked exclusively in the world of Pandas Notebooks (Python framework for analyzing data) \u2014 therefore it was a natural solution to leverage those tools to access my class schedule from Google Calendar and utilize Pandas to process and analyze the revenue data.", "I stumbled upon a fantastic article that solved my exact issue. Using the Google Calendar API, I could easily pull in my calendar events (using a specific \u201cEnglish Classes\u201d Calendar) and convert it into a form that could be easily analyzed. I\u2019d recommend checking out the blog post to get a step by step walkthrough of how to set up the Google Calendar API using your account and create an OAuth client ID.", "The next step is to execute the code which will generate a URL that will require a google login and authorization to give the application access to our calendar events. An authorization code will be generated which we need to paste back into our Pandas notebook. Note: \u2018your_calendar_id\u2019 is the specific calendar I want to look at (Google gives the options to create several calendars).", "(All code below also available on GitHub repo).", "Ok, now that we have the link between Google Calendar and Pandas \u2014 the next step is to properly pull in the data and convert it into a usable form.", "We can access the events directly using the \u201cservice.events().list().execute()\u201d call as seen in the code below \u2014 it\u2019s helpful to consult the Calendar API documentation in order to customize to our needs.", "I decided to filter on the date from when I started entering freelance work in the calendar until one year in the future (in order to properly track booked hours vs. worked hours).", "We now have a nice list of dictionaries, each one representing a specific calendar event, corresponding to a specific freelance event and containing important data such as start/end time and description of the event.", "Let\u2019s iterate through our list of dictionaries in order to parse out useful information and convert to a tidy list of dictionaries that feeds nicely into a Pandas Dataframe. I decided to grab the start/end date, duration of the event and do a bit of logic to see if the event is merely booked or has been completed/paid. The result is saved to a pandas Dataframe, ready to be further processed and analyzed.", "The resulting Dataframe looks like this:", "Let\u2019s work some Pandas magic to bring in price, location and a few other data points in order to properly start analyzing the data.", "The resulting Dataframe gives me the same exact information as my manual spreadsheet; the data entry portion of our spreadsheet has been automated! The result of our hard work:", "The fun begins! We\u2019ll massage the data to get some general insights.", "Clearly, there are some seasonal trends here as we see a large dip in earnings during summer months. Let\u2019s pull in more historical data to see if the trends hold up.", "We\u2019re seeing some severe seasonality with revenue trends. There are large dips in revenue during the summer months \u2014 no one wants to learn English when it\u2019s nice out!", "Let\u2019s look at this another way: each year as a line and the x-axis is simply month \u2014 this will help us visualize the trajectory of each year as the months go on.", "These charts show overall revenue, but lack any information about the source of revenue (private classes, governmental work, bike tours, translation, etc). Let\u2019s tweak the code to show \u2018client_type\u2019 so we can better understand where the revenue is coming from.", "The result shows a nice diversification of revenue:", "We should look towards the future, what kind of bookings do we have for future income? (Everything defined as \u2018PAID\u2019 is considered completed/paid work and everything that is \u2018BOOKED\u2019 is a future commitment to work and be paid.", "We\u2019re seeing a severe decrease in revenue for 2020! Time to get those bookings up.", "How was I doing at the same point in time this month 1 year ago? 2 years ago? Here\u2019s a nifty chart which looks at the month to date revenue (for the current month) cut by year. The idea is to see how I\u2019m currently pacing in revenue vs. previous years.", "These are some of the basic charts and graphs I use to get insight into my revenue activity. The possibilities are endless; anyone reading this can easily customize their code to fit their needs.", "The automated solution has proven to be a much more robust, automated and effective solution at giving me insight into my earnings. Pandas is a fantastic resource to quickly and powerfully manipulate/visualize data. I encourage anyone who does revenue tracking in spreadsheets (and uses Google Calendar) to start utilizing Pandas to achieve the same result. Here are some helpful resources to get a Pandas notebook up and running:", "Your home for data science.
