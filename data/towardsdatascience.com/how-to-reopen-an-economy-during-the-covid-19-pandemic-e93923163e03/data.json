Summers off from school were a blast \u2014 I could spend entire days with groups of friends, cooling down in the shops and beaches on Las Olas Boulevard.", "Unfortunately for Floridians this year, lockdowns on bars and beaches have made this summer less exciting, and growing pressure has pushed Florida politicians to reopen a little too soon. On June 5th, Governor Ron DeSantis started Phase 2 of his step-by-step reopening plan that was supposed to mitigate the threat of the virus. Exactly three weeks later, Florida announced they will re-close bars amid the increased spread of COVID-19, which is still growing at an alarming rate. Last week hit a high of 63,552 new cases, over 8 times higher than the week ending June 6th!", "Last weekend while my brother and I were enjoying a socially distant hangout with locally brewed Carolina IPA\u2019s, a Florida grapefruit and 90% dark chocolate on the porch, we argued about whether increased case volumes is a result of a real spread in the virus or an isolated impact of increased testing.", "We agreed there probably would be some uptick, but since testing availability has continually been ramping up, the true death rate has remained elusive. The next morning I did some research on John Hopkins data dashboard and found a strange phenomenon \u2014 the positive test rate has increased to 20%, nearly four times as much as May lows!", "For some context here, the positive test rate has steadily hovered around 5\u201310% during the initial shutdowns. In this initial stage, tests were only administered to highly probable cases due to testing shortages, which resulted in a fairly high positive test rate around 11%. In isolation, making testing more accessible to the masses should have continued to push the positive test rate down, but clearly there are other variables at play.", "Most of the positive test results are being driven by people under the age of 50, the low-risk group of people that is more likely to still be traveling on airplanes, dining in indoor restaurants and socializing at bars, maybe even without a face covering. The death rate of this population was 0.25% for new cases in May, so it makes sense that they are returning to life as normal so confidently.", "Unfortunately, low-risk populations don\u2019t live in a vacuum, and the more vulnerable populations are also getting infected at alarming rates. Since Memorial Day weekend, new weekly infections have increased among those in the ages of 50\u201370 by 11.5x and ages 71+ by 7.9x!", "As we have seen since March, death rates have had an inverse relationship with case volumes. The more tests administered and cases identified, the lower the death rate. This sounds like good news, but it is not clear that either the virus is getting weaker or we are getting better at treating it. What is more likely is a shift in the underlying data.", "The decline in the observed death rate is actually misleading because of specific changes in behavior driven by more stringent social distancing standards, increased caution among immunocompromised individuals, and increased case detection have all contributed to this decline.", "However, the decline in death rates in the past is NOT an indicator that they will continue to decline in the future. There are ongoing changes in behavior that can skew the infected population yet again: many different venues in Florida were re-opened and are still open, fatigue with social isolation and positive signals may cause some to lift precautions, new weekly cases are at an all-time high, and the positive test rate is nearly twice as much as April highs. Not to mention, if a surge in severe cases fills up hospitals too quickly, limited healthcare capacity could make patient outcomes worse.", "All this to say, the virus is still very dangerous. And in order to make predictions on the death toll based on today\u2019s case volumes, I have grounded two major assumptions: future death rates and death lag time.", "Since April, the observed death rate has more than halved in populations over 60 and has virtually remained flat for populations under 50. However, as mentioned above, ongoing changes in the underlying demographics of new cases may drive death rates up as equally as it may drive them down.", "In the end, only time will tell and I won\u2019t attempt to make a sophisticated prediction here. For my baseline expectations in this analysis, I have chosen to assume a death rate equal to the average death rate for each age group in the first 3 weeks of June.", "Assumption #2: Reported death lag time", "Though an increase in case volumes foreshadows a looming crisis, it isn\u2019t a real crisis until hospitals are overwhelmed and Italy-style mass burials are taking place. Grounding this variable is crucial in predicting when Florida will truly feel the consequences from today\u2019s higher case volumes.", "On average, infected patients succumb approximately 14 days after onset of symptoms and aren\u2019t reported until another 7 days after their death. There is a ton of variability in these metrics too (e.g. some deaths have been reported as long as 21 days after death), but for simplicity I have assumed a fixed total lag time of 21 days for all new cases.", "Using the assumptions grounded above, the forecast of the severity and timing of COVID-19 related deaths in Florida looks grim. In the week ending August 1st, my model is forecasting 880 weekly deaths, or approximately 4 per 100k population.", "For comparison, in Italy\u2019s worst week a total of 5,691 people died, or about 9 per 100k population. However, cases are still increasing despite the state being two weeks into its re-closures. On Sunday, Florida hit a new record number of cases of 15,300, 66% higher than the prior 7-day average. Hopefully this is an anomaly, but if its not, Florida could find itself in a real crisis sooner than it bargained for.", "There are two incredibly polarized opinions on whether governments around the world should keep the economy open to protect GDP or enforce lockdowns to minimize the human death toll.", "Many focus on the direct economic costs of the lockdowns, because they are easier to quantify. But it is also important to measure the human costs of the virus. But how do you measure the value of any singe person\u2019s life? And how do you compare that to lost GDP of a lockdown? Believe it or not, governments already have a price on your head, and I\u2019ll adopt existing frameworks to measure the optimal path forward.", "Total US GDP decreased by 4.8% (annualized) in the first quarter of 2020. Since the economy was running smoothly in the first two months of the quarter, it is estimated that the lockdown in March was the sole driver of this decrease. Extrapolating these metrics to Florida, I have assumed the economic cost to remain in a full lockdown each month to be equal to 5% of its annual GDP, or approximately $47.5 billion.", "Would you be willing to sacrifice your life for the sake of the economy?", "I didn\u2019t think so. The Environmental Protection Agency leverages the Value of a Statistical Life framework to measure each human life at $10 million. This measure is grounded on people\u2019s average willingness to accept hazard pay for the risk associated with particular jobs. This value is fixed for all people, irrespective of gender, age, ethnicity, etc. and the methodology has long been used to determine if the costs of a particular regulation is worth the estimated lives it can save. Due to its relevance to the COVID-19 dilemma, it makes sense to adopt this framework to assess the total economic impact of opening up.", "At this point in time, there are practically three difference scenarios Florida can take in determining how it should proceed:", "Scenario A - Restart the \u201cnormal\u201d economy: Florida started on this path. But since it lasted only 3 weeks before lockdowns resumed, this scenario has been proven itself impractical. However, I have included it in my analysis to quantify the total costs this would incur if Florida were to power through.", "Scenario B - Transition to a \u201clow-touch\u201d economy: This is the current state of Florida after re-closing bars and some indoor venues, but it has yet to be proven as a viable solution. There isn\u2019t data on this yet, but this scenario will assume the lost economic cost is half that of a full lockdown and case volumes fall to a midpoint between between May lows and current highs.", "Scenario C - Re-instate April/May lockdowns: This option is extremely scary for the economy, especially given there is uncertainty on when it will be safe to reopen again. The vaccine is starting to look like the best way out of this pandemic, but it could take another 6-18 months to be developed and distributed, not to mention a recent survey suggests only 50% of Americans will take the vaccine.", "Based on these assumptions, the economically optimal solution would be to transition to a low-touch economy for the month of August (see table below). A low-touch economy would yield the lowest sum of human and GDP costs of $57.56B. The least desirable outcome would be to restart the economy as normal, as this scenario would yield a total $111.28B in human costs alone.", "The difference in total costs between these two scenarios is shocking, and commands that the order of priorities is to reduce the threat of the virus first, and restart the economy second.", "As someone in the low-risk category, I understand how frustrating it can be to lose a job or be prohibited from grabbing a drink with friends by my own government with little to no risk on my well-being. But it is important to take a step back and look at the economy holistically. Rushing back to a \u201cnormal\u201d economy would allow younger people to keep their livelihoods, whereas limiting economic activity would allow older people to keep their lives. The difference in the weight of these two consequences is reflected in the table above. We\u2019re going to have to be patient here, because this health crisis won\u2019t be solved until at least 70% of the population develops antibodies either through a vaccine or quarantining through an infection. Florida has already proved that starting up the economic engine too early can have deadly consequences, forcing them to already hit the breaks and go into reverse. If there were to be a lesson here for other states who are watching, it is to proceed with caution.", "For those interested in the analysis, feel free to review my code on GitHub.", "Curator of compelling data stories that lean into action.
