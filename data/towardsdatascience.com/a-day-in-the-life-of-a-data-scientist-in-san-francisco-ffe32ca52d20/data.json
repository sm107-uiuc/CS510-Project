The way they like to work reflects those differences.", "Previously I worked for two years as a data scientist at a Silicon Valley healthcare startup. For this post I will focus particularly on that experience to give you an idea of what it is like to be a data scientist in San Francisco. During that time, I was working as a healthcare data scientist. The company was working with a large health insurance claims dataset (billions of rows of data) to help people make more informed healthcare decisions. The data science team were creating datasets to be utilised for user-facing products on our website.", "I hope that aspiring data scientists will find this story useful to give them a better idea of what a data scientist actually does. Throughout the story, I will also highlight many of the skills that I think are important to be a successful data scientist at a startup company.", "There are some days that stand out as a data scientist:", "Yet, there are many days in between those that follow a similar pattern, at least they do for me.", "These are days when I am in the middle of a project, or possibly a few projects, that I need to keep working on. Often there will be meetings dotted throughout the day to confer with project stakeholders and other members of the data science team.", "I am a morning person, so I would normally get up at around 7am. I would shower and get dressed and leave the house by about 7:30am.", "When I lived in San Francisco I had an apartment just around the corner from Giants Stadium in Mission Bay. I really liked that area because it was right near the water. It was much cleaner than the downtown area of San Francisco and smelled much less like urine. The office was in the Financial District not too far from the Ferry Building. So I liked to walk to work most days.", "When I arrived at the office it was usually about 8:30am. There were generally a couple of other people already there but I was almost always the first person in from the data science team. Most of my teammates were not early risers, but I am more productive in the mornings.", "The company allowed us to have flexible work hours, as long as we attended any meetings that we were needed for. Many of my colleagues would get into the office around 10am and work later to complete their work. I liked that we were trusted to get our tasks done in the way that worked best for us.", "The first thing I would usually do when I switched on my computer is check on any code I had left running overnight. We had a cluster of machines that we were able to use for our data science work that we shared. Many of us would wait to run computationally intensive jobs until nighttime. That way we would not make our more experimental code run slowly during the day.", "It was my usual practice to have two or three projects on the go at the same time. That way I could multitask and not get bogged down while waiting for code to run. The amount of time we had to wait for our analyses to complete ranged from minutes to days, but was most commonly in the order of hours. If I had instead worked linearly, I would have had to spend a lot of my time twiddling my thumbs and waiting.", "If my overnight jobs had produced a result I would usually eyeball it to see if it looked reasonable. After that I would go and make myself a cup of tea and grab some breakfast from the healthy snacks available in the office. I have never been a coffee drinker, much to the disgust of many of my coworkers \ud83d\ude06", "Generally, by that time a few more people from other teams would have arrived and I often enjoyed chatting with them about their projects while they made their morning coffees. These sort of informal catchups were really helpful for keeping abreast of the progress of other teams and what projects they were actively working on.", "I would then have my brekky and tea at my desk while I checked if there was any new Slack or email messages that were urgent for me to get started working on or respond too. If there was nothing pressing I would open up my work for the day ready to get started.", "By the time I had finished all of my morning rituals it was normally time for standup. Standup meetings are part of the Agile framework. For us they involved short daily meetings where the data science team would stand in a circle and tell the group what we were working on the day before, what we planned to work on that day and if we had any blockers.", "Sometimes our standup meetings would be combined with the other engineering teams, particularly when we were all working together to complete a project. For example, when we were about to release a new data product that would be a feature on the website, we would need close coordination with the product engineering and data engineering teams in order to make it happen smoothly and without delays.", "After the stand up meeting I would usually have a block of time available where I would really get stuck into whatever I was working on at the time. I found that if I didn\u2019t block out chunks of time in my day, that people would schedule meetings with me throughout. This was not conducive to me getting my work done, as I sometimes found that I needed a decent chunk of time to get my head into the right flow to make progress on particularly challenging tasks.", "I would also often put on my noise cancelling headphones during that time. Headphones can send a message to people around you that you are concentrating and do not want to be interrupted. It may seem a little bit rude, but I found it very helpful so that people know when it is ok to interrupt you and when you would prefer that they didn\u2019t. Even if it is more of a subconscious message. The office we worked in was open plan, with pods of desks for each team so it was easy to get distracted by conversations if you were not careful.", "Since I am a morning person, I would always plan to tackle my most challenging work during this block of time. I always felt like I got the majority of my work done before lunchtime and that after that I was much less efficient. So I wanted to make the most of the time when my brain was working its best.", "During this time I was mostly writing code. A large percentage of my time was spent getting my data into the format required to run my more complicated analyses. Actually building the models and interrogating them took up some of my time, but by far the most time consuming part of my job was getting the data ready.", "We were lucky that we had excellent data engineers who had an efficient ETL pipeline for our data. They did the work of maintaining that pipeline. However, the data sets that we had contained billions of rows so finding the subset we needed and manipulating it so that algorithms would run, was still a time consuming job.", "So when people say that the majority of a data scientist\u2019s time is spent data cleaning, I found that to be true. Even though our data set was relatively clean already because of the mammoth efforts of our data engineers, there was invariably some specific aspect that would need to be modified. For example, I would often need to collapse multiple diagnosis columns into one and then for each unique value create a new binary variable.", "In our office we had crank desks that allowed us to either sit and stand. Generally I would try to make the effort to stand in the morning while I had the most energy and my legs were not yet tired. I found this practice extremely beneficial for my back and neck. Ergonomic work stations are extremely important for anyone who is working on a computer for large blocks of time. You can have a much longer career as a data scientist if you take care of your body while you are working.", "One of my favourite times of the day was always lunch time. We had lovely catered meals that the whole company would share. We would sit at long tables and eat together. Some of the best and most interesting conversations I have ever had came out of those lunch times.", "Many of my colleagues came from a diverse range of backgrounds outside of tech and software engineering. I found it extremely interesting to hear what they were up to outside of work and what they had done in their past careers. Some of my colleagues had even started a tech magazine in their spare time. It was a rewarding experience to work with such interesting people.", "We would talk about all sorts of topics at lunch time. I can remember one particularly interesting conversation about undiscovered peoples. We were all so engaged in the conversation that we decided to put on a documentary about it for the whole company to watch on our big meeting screen.", "Lunch time was a good time to give my brain a little break from thinking about my work. I would often actually have really good ideas about how to solve problems when I was not actively thinking about them. So I am really glad that it was not our practice to eat at our desks and continue working through lunch.", "Once a week we would have a presentation from someone at the company or a guest speaker during lunch. People would present what they had been working on or an idea that they had related to the work we were doing. I think this was a great practice as it exposed me to different technologies and techniques that other teams were using that I would never have known about otherwise.", "It was also good practice for when we had to present our work at conferences. I think it is always a good idea to test out a presentation on a friendly audience first.", "I would try my best to schedule the majority of my meetings for straight after lunch. That way I got a second large chunk of time in the day to work on my projects.", "We tried to keep meetings to a minimum, but meeting creep is a real thing. However sometimes they are necessary to keep everyone on the same page, especially when a project is being run across several teams. The number of meetings did sometimes start to build up. Some examples of the types of meetings I would have are:", "During these meetings, I often needed to communicate my analysis methodology or results to various stakeholders. I think this is a really important skill for any data scientist. Advocating for your project, whilst acknowledging limitations and accurately conveying your findings is difficult to do well. Yet this can be the difference between a project being a success or a failure.", "Whenever possible, I would conduct my meetings as a walk and talk. I found it invigorating to get out of the office and get my blood pumping out in the fresh air. I also think that people can be more open when there is no fear of being overheard.", "We were fortunate to have many lovely areas to walk near our office location in the financial district. There was a park nearby where sometimes we would go and hold our meetings out in the sunshine. Or a little further was the Ferry Building where there was often markets and buskers. It was so nice to be able to enjoy the lovely sights and sounds of San Francisco.", "In the course of my day, I would frequently have the task of interviewing prospective data science team hires. I had less of a say over when interviews were scheduled since they had to be coordinated with multiple other team members.", "I liked interviewing. It was very important to me, that we all have a say in who we would be working with on the data science team. Even if we did not hire the candidate, I would usually find interviews a very positive experience. I enjoyed meeting new people and hearing about the projects that they had worked on in the past.", "Wherever possible I would provide feedback to the candidates. I know that I found that invaluable when I was interviewing for my first data science position.", "It was very interesting being on interview panels. During my time at the company we hired the full range of data scientists in terms of seniority. We hired very early career data analysts and also hired a new head of the data science team. I certainly paid close attention when hiring my future boss. I was very fortunate to be exposed to a lot of different ways of thinking about data science as a career.", "Similar to the morning, I would do my best to get a big block of uninterrupted time in the afternoon. Throughout the afternoon I would often migrate around the office to work on the couches, or in a meeting room or even in the lunch area.", "I sometimes found that I would have less interruptions if I was not at my desk. the change of scenery also sometimes gave me new inspiration to solve whatever problems I was working on.", "Close to knock off time I would often get quite frustrated with my work, particularly if it was giving me trouble that day. Sometimes I would chat to my colleagues before I left to debrief and decompress. This was an important part of my work process. It was an informal way to get feedback and perhaps a suggestion of a different way to look at a problem that I may not have thought of.", "Data science has always been a very collaborative process for me even though for most of the actual work you are doing it solo. Even though we would generally have separate projects for different team members, I always felt like the whole data science team made contributions to every project we completed. Even if it was just though acting as a sounding board or providing constructive criticism.", "At around 5:30pm I would knock off for the day and perhaps go and get a drink with friends after work. I was generally one of the first people to leave for the day, as I was also one of the first to arrive. I never felt any worry about leaving earlier than others as we were always encouraged to have work life balance.", "It was so nice to work for a startup that really valued the people that worked there and did not chew them up and spit them out. I have heard many horrible stories about other tech companies using their employees in that way and feel very grateful that was not my experience.", "I hope that you have found this story informative and it has given you a better idea of the different types of things that might be involved in a data science job. Like I said, my experience is by no means universal, but it could give you insight into some of the responsibilities of a data scientist beyond doing data analysis and designing data projects.", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
