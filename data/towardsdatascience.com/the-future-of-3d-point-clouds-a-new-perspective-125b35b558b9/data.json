I first discovered their existence 10 years ago, and since then, I have been tweaking my practices through the evolution of Reality Capture to always get sharper datasets. But I still remember my first surveys with terrestrial laser scanners, and quickly getting these amazing (and still amazing) 3D point clouds.", "But then\u2026 the dream is confronted to reality. How does one effectively consider these entities? At that time, the processing \u2014 read manual overloaded repetitive digitization \u2014 was composed of several heavily manual steps such as filtering, registration, cleaning, segmenting, classifying, meshing, digitizing \u2026 It evolved for some parts (mainly registration, filtering and meshing) but the main bottleneck that I had back then is still unresolved : why do we bother changing the nature of the data (E.g. point cloud to vector) per application ?", "Is there not a more efficient workflow ?", "Let me bring you on a research journey to materialize thoughts in solutions.", "Back in 2015, after 2 years as a 3D Laser scanning engineer, I decided to dedicate myself to teaching & research to try and solve this issue. I jumped into Academia and started investigating the current state of developments, looking for bricks that eventually need some mortar. Well, at that time, I quickly realized that no working attempt addressed the root of the problem. And that my endeavor would need a bit more than some hours.", "\u201cwhen we open our eyes on a familiar scene, we form an immediate impression of recognizable objects, organized coherently in a spatial framework\u201d.", "In 1980, Treisman defines in simple terms the complex mechanism behind our human sight-perception. For non-impaired human-being, it is often the primary source of information which our cognitive decision system can use to act on. This is extendable using our brain which quickly adapts to new surroundings and only uses the most important material captured though our eyes. In fact, the brain receives just three \u201cimages\u201d every second, which are sorted and combined with prior knowledge to create the reality that we experience.", "This mechanism is exceptionally fast and efficient allowing to brake when we see a red light, or simply to read this article and understand the spatial organization of words. Even more impressive, our vision can be adapted for an \u201corientation attention\u201d \u2014 energy saving mode where the brain does not develop a full understanding of the surroundings \u2014 or a \u201cdiscover attention\u201d \u2014 which runs slower as the brain collects data from our memory to obtain a full understanding of the scene.", "With today\u2019s computational power and high level of dematerialization, virtually replicating such a process is not only very attractive but seems feasible. While the operation is genuinely hard to mimic, studying how we interact with our environment permits to better grasp the boundaries and usable mechanisms.", "It first translates into the use of sensors that can capture key inputs usable by a computer.", "We then aim at a procedure based on gathered data and accessible information repositories to produce a \u201csemantic representation\u201d: a depiction of a scene integrating concepts and their meaning. In such a scenario, a spatial sensor plays the role of our eyes to obtain a digital spatial asset further refined into a semantic representation using available knowledge.", "This availability is often a first complication. Our online cognitive perception uses our memory and is structured to access needed evidence in a very short time. Mirroring this stage using a computer is extremely complex and aiming for a solution as generalist as possible is an important challenge.", "The second bottleneck when trying to virtualize a cognitive decision system is the creation of a semantic representation as in the figure below. Gathering and attaching domain knowledge to underlying spatial data is linked to colossal integration and mining complications regarding data types, sources or representations.", "The main challenge revolves around the specificity of the data collected by the sensor(s). Single raster images or video streams are great when depth cues are not necessary, but emulating our 3D visual cognition demands a richer data basis. Reality Capture devices permit to obtain such an exhaustive 3D spatial information primarily as a point cloud: a {X, Y, Z} (+ attributes) spatial ensemble which digitally represents the recorded environment w.r.t the sensor strengths and limitations. The landscape of these instruments and acquisition methodologies is mature enough to allow digital replicas of the real world ranging from the object scale to the country scale as illustrated below.", "The acquisition of these so-called point clouds has become easier, faster and is even accessible from very low-cost solutions. All these hardware evolution were unfortunately not followed by their software counterpart, which are heavily impacted by the 5 V\u2019s of Big Data problematics as illustrated below.", "Connecting numerous sensors/approaches creates heterogeneous point cloud datasets (Variety) and participate in the constitution of massive data repositories (Volume). In turn, it reduces the processing efficiency (Velocity) and creates new needs to turn huge amounts of point data into trustworthy (Veracity) and actionable information (Value).", "Point cloud acquisition and processing workflows are usually application-dependent following a classic progression from data gathering to deliverable creation. While the collection step may be specific to the sensor at hands, point-cloud-as-a-deliverable upsurges, becoming one de-facto choice for many industries. This task-oriented scenario mainly considers these as a spatial reference \u2014 which is used by experts to create other deliverables \u2014 thus being a project\u2019s closest link to reality. It brings accurate real-world information which could allow decision-making based on digital-reality instead of interpreted or not up-to-date information.", "Moreover, the procedures to convert point clouds in application-specific deliverables are very costly in time/manual intervention. It is getting ever more complicated for the human expertise to handle adequately the large and complex volumes of information, often contradictory disseminated among different actors/supports of one project. Thus, it is key for a sustainable system that big point cloud data translates into more efficient processes opening a new generation of services that help decision-making and information extraction.", "We need to find ways for massive automation and structuration to avoid task-specific manual processing and non-sustainable collaboration.", "As humans, we thrive on massive collaboration. Our greatest achievements are often building on a efficient exchange of information, services and more. Point clouds are often very large depending on how much data is collected \u2014 usually in the realms of Gigabytes, if not Terabytes \u2014 and are usually destined to be archived as a reusable support to create new type of data and products. This can lead to a dead-end with exponential storage needs, incompatibility between outputs, loss of information and complicated collaboration.", "These practices also show limited to no attempt to generalize a framework which could in turn play as a common ground for further interoperability and generalization. This lack is counterproductive and could lead in term to a chaotic data repartition among actors and worsen the dependency to several outsourced service each aiming an application independently. This emphasize a strong need to study interoperable scenarios in which one point cloud could be used by many users from different domains, each having a different need.", "This will in turn introduce new constraints at the acquisition level to define the needed exhaustivity of the 3D representation for use with reasoning engines. Of course, this serialize additional challenges for interconnecting processes and insuring a compatibility with the different sources, volumes and other data-driven parameters.", "In this continuum, the reflexion to go from a human-centered process to an autonomous workflow orient research to develop automation and AI to speed-up inference processes. This is crucial to the development of point clouds in 3D capture workflows, where objects need to be identified.", "Robotics research has made a leap forward providing autonomous 3D recording systems, where we obtain a 3D point cloud of environments with no human intervention. Of course, following this idea to develop autonomous surveying means demand that the data can be used for decision-making. The collected point cloud without context does not permit to take a valid decision, and the knowledge of experts is needed to extract the necessary information and to creates a viable data support for decision-making. Automating this process for fully autonomous cognitive decision systems is very tempting but poses many challenges mainly link to Knowledge Extraction, Knowledge Integration and Knowledge Representation from point cloud. Therefore, point cloud structuration must be specifically designed to allow the computer to use it as a base for information extraction, using reasoning and agent-based systems.", "And this is were I want to get to: we need intelligence within our virtual datasets ! This, in order to avoid brain work and manual processes, but also for the sake of interoperability. There are many applications that will use point clouds differently, but extracting deliverables per application doesn\u2019t seem to be the most efficient (and eco-friendly in terms of storage footprint). However, if experts knowledge is formalized and integrated within point clouds, you can only guess how centralized and efficient an infrastructure becomes !", "So yes, point clouds are huge; yes we need specific \u201ctricks\u201d to store them and process them, but so were videos back some decades ago ! What does this imply in your specific industry? That you will soon be able to work with a \u201cbrain representation\u201d of the 3D captured environment for you to query as you deem. But of course, the big landscape in 3D sensors make the recognition process a wide research exploration field! Exciting!", "These thoughts are based on the award-winning thesis \u201cThe Smart Point Cloud\u201d [1], that holds the more technical details about a working solution to these problematic. But of course, as it is often the case with long research works, you come out of it with more questions that you had in the beginning.", "What an exciting decade we are experiencing. We are in a fascinating era where the usage of machine learning gives tremendous possibilities to solving challenges that were considered Science Fiction 10 years ago.", "Florent Poux has been at the forefront of automation in Reality Capture for more than 10 years. He holds an award-winning PhD in Sciences, and is recognized as an outstanding researcher through the ISPRS Jack Dangermond 2019 BP award. He bridges high-level research & knowledge transmission as an adjunct professor in 3D Geodata (University of Liege), a mentor in Data Sciences & Machine Learning (OpenClassrooms) as well as a 3D consultant.", "During his young academic and scientific career, he has given dozens of tech talks, served on the scientific & program committee of several international conferences and assisted as an editor & reviewer for leading international GIS and Automation journals.", "His activities aim at transmitting knowledge and solving automation problematics, through various form of communication and developments.
