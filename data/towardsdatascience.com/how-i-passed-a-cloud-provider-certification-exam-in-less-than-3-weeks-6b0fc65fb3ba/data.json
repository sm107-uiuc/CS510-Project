Having scored a respectable number, I decided to dig in and do some hardcore studying for another week before deciding whether to sit the actual exam. One week later, I scheduled my exam for the 8th of January. If I passed, that would mean that in just under three weeks I had gone from relative newbie to achieving one of the two Professional tier certifications AWS offers.", "As you can tell from the title, I did indeed pass the exam, and in looking back my success was at least in part due to a number of deliberate strategies that I\u2019d like to share. Most, if not all, of these are generally applicable, in that they could just as easily be used to achieve other certifications, whether in the AWS ecosystem or others.", "A note of caution: if you\u2019re looking for quick and easy tips, this is not where you will find them. This exam was one of the hardest tests I\u2019ve taken since college (and let me tell you, even in that context it\u2019s right up there with the likes of Organic Chemistry, that famously difficult entry barrier for medical students). There are no shortcuts here; if you want to achieve what I did, in the time I did, you\u2019ll need to work incredibly hard to do so. In keeping with the Certification Agreement, I\u2019m also obviously not going to share specific details about the exam itself.", "Without further ado, here are my tips.", "Most people consider the following good ways of studying:", "In fact, these are among the worst possible ways you can study, assuming your goal is to actually retain the knowledge you are attempting to learn.", "In a study published in 2009, scientists Aimee Callender and Mark McDaniel showed that reading (including repeated review) resulted in little or no benefit in improving performance on later tests of the reviewed information.", "In the book Make It Stick: The Science of Successful Learning, the authors (one of whom was a contributor to the above study) show how, in fact, un-prompted recall (i.e. trying to remember how to answer a question without using multiple choice questions) is actually one of the most effective ways of learning and retaining new information.", "Yes, that\u2019s right: the good old flashcard is actually way more effective than reviewing your notes and highlights. To that end, one of the ways I studied for the exam was using the free online tool Quizlet, which allows you to create decks of flashcards and use various ways to review them (hint: the \u201cLearn\u201d mode was probably the best method I found). Feel free to use my deck if you like; it certainly served me well.", "Perhaps counter-intuitively, a good way to know if you\u2019re using an effective study method is whether you are finding the process difficult. In the same book, the authors note how making errors throughout the process of learning is actually a good sign, because it\u2019s only through repeatedly making these mistakes and practicing recalling the information that it will be properly encoded into your memory. My experience bore this out, in that as recently as the day before my exam I was getting some fairly dismal scores on practice tests; despite this fact, I passed the exam with a wide margin. The point is this: if you\u2019re finding the process hard, and making mistakes, don\u2019t take that as a sign that you\u2019re not making progress.", "Speaking of practice tests, they should absolutely be a part of your studying. Personally, I used WhizLabs, which proved adequate for my needs. I would also recommend taking AWS\u2019s own practice exam (if you pass a previous certification, as I did with the AWS Solutions Architect Associate, you might even get a code for a complementary one), which while quite short will give you a very good representation of the way the actual test questions are worded.", "While a primary source for my studying was the AWS documentation, I made use of two outside courses to help get me through all the content. The reason being is that, at least in my case, the AWS documentation, while very comprehensive, was a bit overwhelming due to its size. I often found myself going down rabbit holes that may not have proven useful in the pursuit of passing the exam in the minimal time I had. Just to note, none of these are affiliate links and I have no skin in recommending them, other than I think they will most certainly accelerate your progress in preparing for an exam.", "The first is the ever-popular ACloudGuru, which gave a good overview of the various topics involved with the exam, which helped me to know which areas to focus on. While it lacked the intricate detail you need to pass the exam, the instructor is explicit about that in the introduction.", "The second outside source I used was Stephane Maarek\u2019s AWS DevOps Engineer Professional course on Udemy. By comparison (and on its own truly) this was extremely detailed. Know that if you do purchase it, to fully complete it will require a great deal of time, albeit well spent time.", "The point here is this: leveraging high quality third party content can be an excellent means to make the most of a limited amount of time, which if you\u2019re trying to pass the exam in short order, is critical.", "Understanding how to practically implement common scenarios using AWS technologies is a very important piece of preparing for the exam. The DevOps Engineer Professional certification is meant, at least from my experience, to prepare you for getting down in the trenches and accomplishing actual work, as opposed to other certifications that seem more geared towards overall design and architecture. As a result, practicing actual use of the various technologies involved is an excellent way to prepare, but don\u2019t go overboard. With so many options out there, it\u2019s easy, especially if you\u2019re a builder at heart like I am, to spend an inordinate amount of time creating, when in reality you should focus equally on pure memorization of facts.", "Two great ways to get a good amount of hands on experience are:", "Let\u2019s get really practical: no one likely cares what you scored on the exam; if you passed then you get to display the badge and claim the associated bragging rights, whether you scored a barely passing mark or absolutely crushed it. Because of this, especially on short timelines, you have to be disciplined about not spending excess time on areas where you already have adequate enough knowledge to pass that portion of the exam.", "Here\u2019s an example from my experience. I happen to really love all things serverless and containers, so I really enjoyed learning about AWS Lambda and Elastic Container Service, both of which are on the exam. As a result, it would have been really easy for me to spend more time digging in to those areas, but at the expense of other, less interesting but equally important areas of study, such as EC2 Auto Scaling.", "This is where things like flash cards and practice tests are very useful, because they help you measure the areas that you are weak in, and therefore need to focus on. If you\u2019re consistently answering questions on a particular subject area well enough to get past that portion, don\u2019t spend more time on those areas. The exam covers a very wide range of topics, and it\u2019s better to have enough knowledge in all the areas.", "I\u2019ve been asked several times if, outside of the obvious benefits of greater employment options and credibility, the effort spent to pass the exam was worth it. My answer there is an overwhelming yes! There\u2019s no doubt whatsoever that my studies have given me a great deal of practically applicable knowledge, some of which I\u2019ve already put to good use in my daily work as a DevOps Engineer working in the AWS platform.", "While it was undoubtedly a stressful experience (after I passed, I told my boss that my brain hurt, and I meant it), it was also a great way to quickly assimilate a broad range of knowledge around how best to follow DevOps practices within the AWS platform. If you\u2019re willing to put in the effort up front (and get support from your boss and spouse), there\u2019s absolutely no reason you can\u2019t do the same thing.", "Your home for data science.
