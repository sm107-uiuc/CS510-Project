You grab your data and you decide to graph it so you can show others your findings. You click \u2018graph\u2019 and\u2026\u2026", "Ya looks kinda boring. What we want is something a little more fun and dynamic. Something like\u2026 this:", "Yes! Now that looks awesome! So let\u2019s see how we can do quickly get this animation going.", "Okay here\u2019s what you\u2019ll need to get started:", "So, let\u2019s just do a few things to make our graph look better. We can start by making the text a bit larger and let\u2019s change the graph style while we\u2019re at it.", "Now for the style, I don\u2019t want the y-axis and instead, I just want the total numeric value at the top of each bar in our graph. We can do it in excel pretty easily,", "Next just make the font size larger and change the font to whatever tickles your fancy. Remove any background lines (you can just select and delete them). And maybe make the bar wider. After I was done editing my graph looked like this.", "Don\u2019t worry about the text being too light right now, later on, I\u2019ll be adding a darker background color to make things pop more.", "Experiment, and play with the kind of design you want to have, feel free to be as creative as you want.", "Create a new project in Adobe Illustrator and set the size to 1920 by 1080. Then simply copy-paste the graph you just made from Excel into Illustrator.", "The image will copy in as a vector image meaning you can resize it without having to worry about quality loss. Resize your image until it fits the way you want it to on your canvas. See below for reference on how it\u2019s been sized.", "If you open the \u2018Layers\u2019 panel (you can click f7 or Window -> Layers to open it up) you should see \u2018Layer 1\u2019. If we open it up, we should see a Layer called \u2018<Clip Group>\u2019 with all the bars that we need.", "Right now they\u2019re all stuck together.", "1. Select that \u2018<Clip group>\u2019 -> Right-click on the bar -> Select \u2018Release Clipping Mask\u2019. That will create a \u2018Compound Path\u2019 Layer.", "2. Select this layer and again right-click on the bar and select \u2018Release Compound Path\u2019. Now we have all the bars separated.", "Create five new layers (one for each bar) and drag each bar layer into the new layer. Rename the new bar layers to make it easier to use in After Effects later.", "Create one more layer called \u2018Values\u2019 and just move all the numeric bar values into that layer. Make sure not to move any of the Year values, we just want the bar values there.", "Now we\u2019re basically done. The last thing we\u2019ll need to do is remove any sub-layers in Layer 1 that we don\u2019t need.", "An easy way to do this is to click on the little \u2018eye\u2019 icon next to the layer. If something disappears from Illustrator then we want to keep that. If it looks like nothing disappeared then we can remove it. The point of this is to delete the white background so we can add on our own later in After Effects. If you want to keep the white background feel free to move on to the next step.", "Once that\u2019s done rename \u2018Layer 1\u2019 to \u2018Axis\u2019 so it\u2019s easier to identify in After Effects.", "Create a new After Effects project and set the size to 1920 by 1080. My duration was set to 5 seconds but you can set it 3 seconds if you want to. Next, we need to import the Illustrator file that we just created. We can do this by double-clicking the Project Panel and selecting our AI file.", "Make sure that Import Kind is set to Composition and Footage Dimension is set to Layer Size. We can then just click on the new composition that after-effects automatically created for us and start working on it. You should also see all our layers in the Composition Panel.", "Each layer has an anchor point. These anchor points are the points at which the effects we apply take place. We\u2019ll need to move these anchor points to the bottom of each bar so that the animation starts from that point.", "Once we have our anchors set at the correct position we can start animating. This part is really simple.", "In the Composition Panel: Bar Layer (ex: Bar 1) > Transform > Scale.", "The bounce animation makes it so that when our bar reaches the top it will overshoot and then go back down. This makes the animation look a lot smoother and more lively.", "To do this click on the stopwatch icon next to Scale while holding down the ALT key. A text area will open on the timeline. Copy-paste the following there.", "Congratulations! The hard part is over, now we just need to do some copy-pasting and fix up a few things. You should now have something that looks like this:", "If you close the dropdown menu for the component we were just working on and select it again you can type the letter \u2018U\u2019 on your keyboard to just view properties you\u2019ve changed.", "Having all the properties open for all the bars we just animated. We see that the animation for each bar takes place at the same time. To fix this we just need to shift the keyframe animation for each bar to start when the last one animation ended.", "\u2018Bar 5\u2019 for me was my first bar on the graph and \u2018Bar 1\u2019 was my last. So for me, I just need to shift them like shown below but you may need to shift them differently.", "The values being there at the beginning of the animation is pretty weird. Instead, a better look would be for them to appear near the end of the animation.", "If you liked this consider reading some more cool stuff like How to Handle Missing Data in Python", "Or How salmon can use a magical force to return home!", "Your home for data science.
