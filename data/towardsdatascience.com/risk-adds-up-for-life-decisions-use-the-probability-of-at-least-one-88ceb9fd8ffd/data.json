It\u2019s also true, though, that a series of smaller, everyday decisions can be just as important \u2014 if not more important \u2014 in determining one\u2019s outcomes.", "Essentially, it\u2019s not because the smaller daily decisions have more inherent risk, but because they can be more frequent; the chance of an undesired outcome eventually happening for a repeated event actually increases due to an accumulation of risk.", "Let\u2019s say that you consider the number 4 unlucky. If you roll a six-sided die six times, what is the chance that you will roll at least one 4?", "The answer is D), the percentage probably intuitively making sense. The more chances you get, it feels like the chances are higher. It\u2019s more the equation that goes into the answer that makes it interesting.", "First of all, in A) we intuitively can feel that it\u2019s certainly possible \u2014 some would say unlucky \u2014 to never roll a 4.", "B) is incorrect; rather, it\u2019s calculating the chance that you roll a 4 six times in a row (you get six chances, and each time you have one-sixth of a chance). Needless to say, it\u2019s pretty unlikely, and in the 0.00214% chance it does happen, perhaps you should consider that the universe may be trying to tell you something.", "C) is also wrong, but perhaps your mind first went there. It\u2019s understandable; each roll of the die carries a 1/6th chance, so maybe the overall chance is 1/6. The thing is that a 1/6th chance only applies with one roll of the die; with six, you\u2019re getting multiple chances to get an undesired roll of a 4.", "D), or 66.51%, is the correct answer, and it may not be intuitive how to get to that number.", "For starters, it\u2019s helpful to think in terms of the chances of not rolling a 4; thinking this way, you have a 5 out of 6 chance of a positive outcome and rolling a different number.", "When modeling these, take this general equation that determines the probability of at lease one event happening:", "The probability of none of the specific outcome in our case is the aforementioned (5/6)\u2076 or about 0.33489. Thus, we have:", "We then get an end result of 0.665, which when you multiply it by 100 to get a percentage, is approximately 66.5%.", "So while the chance of rolling a 4 in just one roll was about 1/6, it gets higher and higher with every roll.", "While it may seem obvious that more chances of something awry happening with more chances, it actually is quite surprising how quickly the risk accumulates given numerous events.", "Let\u2019s say a ride on your bicycle carries a mere 0.5% chance of a severe injury from another vehicle\u2014 that\u2019s a made-up number, so please don\u2019t treat that as an actual statistic \u2014 for every bike ride. With those odds, you figure, it\u2019s actually very safe to ride your bike, and so you don\u2019t mind riding your bike to and from work.", "There are around 252 trading days \u2014 or business days, holidays excluded \u2014 in a year, and let\u2019s say you really work hard and only take two days of paid time off (I don\u2019t really recommend that, by the way), so you work 250 days this year. You also decide to commute via bike from your home to work and from work back to your home, so that\u2019s 250 * 2 = 500 bike rides.", "Using the above probability of at least one equation, we thus can come up with the following calculation to model the chances of you getting a severe injury:", "Multiply the end result to get a percentage, and we have a 22.125% chance of a severe bike injury from another vehicle in your work year!", "This is certainly more jarring than the 0.05% chance of a single ride, and this shows that an accumulation of risk \u2014 you are making the ride 500 times, after all \u2014 actually can significantly increase the overall chance; you don\u2019t want this outcome of a serious injury, of course, to happen even once during your entire year.", "In other words, if you were told you had a 22.125% chance for the year of getting into an accident with a car while riding your bike, you may consider your decision differently than just considering a simple 0.05% risk.", "For making your day-to-day repeating life decisions where you want to avoid a negative outcome to happen at all, you can use this line of thinking \u2014 and this empirical statistical formula \u2014 to see what level of risk is really worth taking", "The choice, as they say, is yours.", "Your home for data science.
