And that\u2019s because of its low barrier to entry with rich libraries such as fpp2. Python is still popular in some fields of time series, but still a long way to go for a fpp2 equivalent in the forecasting arena.", "First, it requires more and more practitioners interested in doing data science in Python. For beginners, the most important is ensuring a low barrier to entry.", "The purpose of this article is to talk about the utilities of Python pandasto set up your environment for data analysis. It is an effort to show how learning only few commands can kick-off to more advanced modeling.", "pandas is a powerful, flexible and accessible data mining library in Python. It was originally developed at a financial management company. Anyone familiar with the finance sector knows a lot of its data science is actually time series analysis.", "In fact, the name Pandas came from panel data, which is a special type of time series data used in econometrics. If you are interested in econometrics and its applications in data science check this out:", "Data scientists spend a bulk of their time (some would say 80%) in wrangling and preparing data for analysis. Since pandas was designed specifically to meet this part of the analytics pipeline, if you know how it works and how to make the best use of it for data prep, the rest is easy.", "So here is an analytics pipeline to making data analysis-ready \u2014 from basic analytics to advanced modeling.", "The first order of business is installing the pandas library of course.", "Now, you can import data from a variety of sources. It could be a file from your computer, text from the web or by querying a SQL database.", "Data also comes in a variety of formats such as csv, excel, json etc.", "So knowing where to import from and which format it is will determine what commands to use. Here\u2019s a couple of examples.", "After importing data you want to check out a few things such as the data structure, number of rows and columns, unique values, NaN values etc.", "Having missing values in a dataset should come as no surprise. First, you need to check if there are missing values:", "Now, once you have identified that there are missing values, a few things you could do \u2014 drop the missing value rows, drop an entire column, substitute values \u2014 all depending on your analytical/modeling needs. Here are some basic commands:", "I wrote an entire article about dealing with missing values if you\u2019d like to check out:", "By column operations I mean one of several things \u2014 selecting columns, dropping columns, renaming, adding new ones, sorting etc. In advanced analytics you might want to create a new column, calculated based on existing columns (e.g. creating an \u201cage\u201d based on existing \u201cdate_of_birth\u201d column).", "Once you have taken care of the columns, next up rows. You need to work with rows for a number of reasons, most notably filtering or slicing data. In addition, you might want to add new observations in your dataframe or remove some existing ones. Below are some commands you\u2019d need to filter data:", "Time series is a different kind of object, not like any dataframe. Raw data is usually not formatted for time series analysis, so pandas library treats them like a normal dataframe where the time dimension is stored as strings rather than a datetime object. So you need to transform the ordinary dataframe to a time series object.", "For more about time series data preparation here is an article about it:", "Everyone starts their data science journey from different starting points. However, the level of understanding and time it takes to reach the goal differ significantly because everyone takes a different learning path. Using Python for learning the fundamentals of data wrangling shouldn\u2019t be hard if someone follows a logical learning process. In this article, I outlined that logical order \u2014 data imports, inspection, missing values, column operations, rows operations \u2014 with some most frequently used commands.
