In this study, I worked with a team of researchers to apply curriculum learning to improve the accuracy of a deep learning model for classifying colorectal cancer images. The full paper can be found here, and it is going to be published and presented at the 2021 Winter Conference on Applications of Computer Vision (WACV).", "The Motivation. Curriculum learning is an elegant idea inspired by human learning that proposes that deep learning models should be trained on examples in a specified order based on difficulty (typically easy examples and then hard examples), as opposed to random sampling. Most importantly, successfully applying curriculum learning requires that a range of easy and hard examples exists and that there is a way to categorize examples as easy or hard.", "We contend that histopathology image classification is a naturally-suitable task for curriculum learning based on the following observations:", "The Dataset. The dataset is made of colorectal cancer images from the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center \u2014 it has been split into a training set of 2,175 images and a testing set of 977 images. Each of these images were labeled as either a hyper-plastic polyp (HP) or a sessile serrated adenoma (SSA) by seven practicing board-certified pathologists, which allows for varying levels of annotator agreement.", "Proposed curriculum learning methodology. We propose a curriculum learning framework that leverages annotator agreement to rank images by difficulty. Specifically, we partition images into four discrete levels of difficulty: very easy (7/7 agreement among annotators), easy (6/7 agreement among annotators), hard (5/7 agreement among annotators), and very hard (4/7 agreement among annotators). We then train our network on progressively harder images in four stages:", "Stage 1: Very easy images onlyStage 2: Very easy + easy imagesStage 3: Very easy + easy + hard imagesStage 4: Very easy + easy + hard + very hard images", "At each stage, images from previous stages are included to prevent catastrophic forgetting. See the first figure in this article for a visual model of the proposed methodology.", "Baselines. We compare this proposed schematic with multiple baselines. The primary baseline is vanilla training where all training images are labeled by majority vote. We also compare with a model trained using an anti-curriculum scheme, which reverses the training schedule (i.e., first trains on hard images and then trains on progressively-easier images). Additionally, we analyzed a four-stage model using a difficulty measure where a pathologist directly scored the difficulty of each image on a scale from 1 to 4. Moreover, we tested a control curriculum with the same training scheme as our proposed method, except images in each stage were selected randomly.", "Significance. For more context on the significance of the improvement that our curriculum learning method brings to model performance, we compare the performance of our models with that of pathologists. The predictions of each model are framed as the annotations of an additional pathologist and are compared with the annotations of actual pathologists in terms of Cohen\u2019s Kappa, a common measure of inter-annotator agreement. We evaluate each model at difference confidence thresholds. Our curriculum learning model outperforms the pathologist average for multiple thresholds and the baseline model for all thresholds.", "Implications on the field. Most prior work in medical image analysis uses majority voting or senior annotator resolution to determine labels, only retaining a single label for each image. Our method instead leverages annotation agreement for curriculum learning, and we believe that this methodology is worth exploring for medical imaging tasks given the high cost of data annotation and the importance of accuracy towards patient outcomes.", "Summary. We have presented a simple yet effective curriculum learning framework which leverages easily-obtained annotator agreement data. We hope to have provided a well-motivated argument for the more intentional application of curriculum learning in new tasks such as medical image analysis.", "Your home for data science.
