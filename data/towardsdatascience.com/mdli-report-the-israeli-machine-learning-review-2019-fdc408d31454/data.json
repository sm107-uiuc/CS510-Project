The survey, aimed at data scientists and adjacent roles, gauges professionals\u2019 work conditions, commonly faced challenges, popular developer tools, and more. An impressive 569 respondents participated in this year\u2019s survey (compared with last year\u2019s 225 respondents), representing a diverse group of professionals in the field. In this report, we will discuss survey results and provide you with an in-depth analysis of these results, done by Omri Goldstein. The survey consists of two parts: One about personal and professional information, with the other holding more information on vocational and technical matters.", "One of the survey\u2019s central topics is average salaries, which are measured against respondents\u2019 experience and education level. This year, our survey has been answered by no less than 402 people holding full-time jobs \u2014 allowing for a fair representation of the field today.", "74.1% of 569 respondents identified themselves as men and 25.3% women. This is a significant improvement compared to last year\u2019s female representation. However, this figure seems to be the result of our efforts to reach more female participants, rather than from having a larger number of women in the field. Furthermore, the average age of survey respondents is 32.7, with 50% of them between the ages of 29 to 35:", "There is no difference in age distribution among men and women, although other variables related to age paint an interesting picture. In Tel Aviv the median age is 30, while in the Central District the median age is 33 as can be viewed below:", "Tel Aviv is the most represented city, both as a home base and for work purposes. Tel Aviv draws almost half of respondents living in the Central District for employment, along with a quarter of respondents living in Haifa, a third of those in Jerusalem, and a bit less than half of those coming from the Southern District. Tel Aviv is also the only city which is more often mentioned as a city that respondents work in, rather than one they live in.", "In terms of employers, we looked at different kinds of organizations \u2014 from corporations to the army. As anticipated, our youngest respondents work for the IDF(Israel Defense Forces). On average, the oldest respondents work for the government with a median age of 36, and the median age of respondents working for startups is just 32:", "The most common job titles are Data Scientist, Researcher or Scientist, Deep Learning Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Software Developer, Algorithm Developer, Analyst, and CTO. This result isn\u2019t surprising as the survey is geared towards data scientists in the broad sense, but these results also don\u2019t reflect the high-tech industry as a whole. Meanwhile, the most common degrees held by survey respondents are in Computer Science (including Electrical Engineering, Software Engineering, and Bioinformatics), Engineering and Exact Sciences (Mathematics, Physics, Statistics, and other engineering subjects), Life Sciences (Chemistry, Biology, and Brain Science), and Economics. In terms of degree subjects, it is noteworthy that there is a direct link between degree subjects and job positions:", "Computer Science graduates can really be found across all job positions, while most Exact Science, Engineering, and Life Science graduates have the role of Data Scientist. Additionally, software engineers are most often Computer Science graduates, data analysts mostly come from Exact Sciences, and other positions are shared by Life Science and Economics graduates.", "If we visualize the job position, education level, and academic specialization of every respondent into a 2D map with the help of MCA (the categorical sister program of PCA), it allows us to discover the following we can find the following relationships between variables:", "You can see the formation of several clusters. On the bottom left, there is a link between Economics graduates and Data Analyst roles, although quite a lot of Economics graduates are also data scientists. In the center, you can see the link between STEM graduates and the Data Scientist role. On the left side, respondents with a bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science are linked with the Software Engineer and Deep Learning Engineer roles. On the upper right-hand side, in a smaller cluster, you can find doctoral degree holders who are hired as researchers. In the center, there is another slight connection between CTOs, algorithm developers, and machine learning engineers whose education level is similar, yet they have different academic specializations. Due to the variety among this population, their job titles also tend to be varied.", "The recruiting industry has changed in the past few years, which is quite apparent in our survey results. Recruiting companies like Woo and Gloat have changed the way job seekers look for work, although it seems like most respondents do not use these companies\u2019 services at scale. LinkedIn is still the most popular website for recruitment, with more than 400 respondents saying they use LinkedIn. The next most popular strategy is to look for jobs through friends and family. Lastly, respondents also use our community job board, and less than half of the respondents use recruitment agencies.", "The highest salaries belong to those whose position is Researcher or Scientist, with an average salary of 36,000 NIS ($10,224) per month. Right after them come those with the title of CTO or Machine Learning Engineer, with an average salary of 35,000 NIS ($ 9,940) per month. Analysts, on the other hand, boast an average salary of 19,000 NIS ($5,396) per month.", "One factor which heavily influences salary is education level. Similar to last year\u2019s survey results, the most common education level is a master\u2019s degree (51% of respondents), followed by a bachelor\u2019s degree (33%), and doctoral degree (12%). It is also apparent that salaries grow as education levels increase \u2014 with bachelor\u2019s degree holders earning 27,000 NIS ($7,668) on average, master\u2019s degree holders earning 31,000 NIS ($8,830) on average, and doctoral degree holders earning a whopping 38,000 NIS ($10,792) on average. This trend is especially interesting in the following scenario: While the average salary for master\u2019s degree holders is similar for men and women, the wage gap between male and female doctorate holders is astonishing \u2014 with men earning 41,000 NIS ($11,644) on average and women just 27,000 NIS ($7,668) on average in comparison.", "Part of this wage gap seems to stem from the fact that about half of the women hold a doctoral degree in Biology, Chemistry or Brain Science, and not in Computer Science or Engineering. Meanwhile, men with a doctoral degree are specialists in Computer Science or Engineering 82% of the time:", "This brings us to the next subject, which is salary ranges based on academic specialization. The most common specialization, paired with huge wage gaps, is Computer Science \u2014 represented by more than 56% of the survey\u2019s respondents. Another 28% specialize in Engineering, Physics, Mathematics or Statistics, with the rest divided between Life Sciences, Economics, and Social Sciences. Out of these specializations, computer scientists earn the highest salaries, with an average salary of 33,000 NIS per month (&9,372). They are followed by those graduated in Engineering, with an average salary of 28,000 NIS ($7,952) per month. Economics graduates are the next in line, with an average salary of 25,000 NIS ($7,100) per month. As an additional observation, it is also worth noting that, counter to Computer Science and Engineering graduates who don\u2019t hold doctoral degrees as frequently, almost all graduates in Life Sciences have a doctoral degree.", "Another factor which influences salary is, of course, age. Expectedly so, salaries increase with age and experience. This is the case for both men and women, although wage gaps are still prominent \u2014 especially among some of the most senior position holders at work.", "When looking at the numbers, a reason for the wide range in salaries (aside from education level or years of work experience) is that 14 of our respondents work for the IDF. This lowers the average salary for respondents with an age bracket in their twenties. Another reason for the wide range in salaries is that the highest salaries are mostly found in corporations and startups (dubbed the \u201chigh-tech\u201d industry). Meanwhile, salaries on the \u2018lower\u2019 end can be found in government, finance, universities, and so forth. Note that some of the highest salaries peek at multinational corporations, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook, and the like:", "If we take into account the company size of the multinationals, then it is understandable (although speculative) why salaries at such companies might also be the highest. However, salaries can still fluctuate among employees within the company, regardless of increased company size. This is especially the case for companies employing more than 10,000 workers, with 25% of survey respondents earning more than 46,000 NIS ($13,064) per month:", "Notice that when presenting salary distributions as a function of one variable, it is possible to generate misleading results. For example, the average salary of Life Sciences graduates is as high as the salary of Engineering graduates, despite Life Science graduates holding more doctoral degrees than engineers. We have also seen that the average salary of all respondents in their twenties tends to go down, because of a set of respondents working for the IDF. It is difficult to completely neutralize the various correlations between variables, and if we manage to do so it may prove to be extra challenging to attribute certain causes to these correlations.", "An inseparable part of the data scientist\u2019s work routine is the data he or she works with, and the way he or she obtain that data. As such, we dedicated a significant portion of the survey to questions revolving around data. 62.7% of respondents say they collect their data independently without the use of additional data sources. In comparison, 26.8% collect data from data aggregators, while 17.8% collect data from Google searches, and 15.4% collect data from databases run by universities or non-profit organizations. The remaining respondents collect data from GitHub or government websites.", "When looking deeper, we found fascinating results with regard to the types of data used: 46.3% of respondents work with relational data, while 43.7% work with visual data (i.e., images). In third place is textual data which is used by 39.3% of respondents, followed by sensor data used by 27.3% of respondents. The last places are held by video data, only used by 19.8% of respondents, and audio data used by just 8.8% of respondents.", "After understanding which types of data are popular and how they are collected, it is time to go further and gain insight into what our survey respondents do with their data. Our next step is to address the methodologies used and techniques applied in everyday data science. In this case, too, the results are extremely varied with many respondents applying very different kinds of techniques. At the top are Neural Networks used by 67.9% of respondents, followed by 51% of respondents using CNN and Logistic Regression. 45.8% of respondents use Random Forests and 36.6% use Decision Trees. Then, 31.7% use Ensemble Methods, 30.1% use SVM, and 29.5% use RNN. At the bottom of the list are GANs used by 15.9% of respondents.", "Now comes the question which libraries our survey respondents use to perform all said techniques. TensorFlow is the most used library, voted for by 50.6% of respondents. The second is Keras used by 46.6% of respondents, and third is PyTorch with 40.5%. In fourth place is Gensim used by a mere 7.6% of respondents, and in the last place is Matlab used by 7.3%.", "We end with the following question: What are the greatest challenges or biggest roadblocks faced by workers when practicing data science? Unsurprisingly, and similar to last year\u2019s survey results, the main problem for 60.7% of respondents is that of \u201cdirty data\u201d which is harmful to the flow and output of their work.", "The second problem is that of inaccessibility or unavailability of data, as indicated by 35.1% of respondents. Based on these answers, the key issue of data science today is that of the data itself \u2014 specifically, how to collect high-quality data. The final problem is that of talent shortage in the field, mentioned by 29.3% of respondents. The talent shortage in data and information science is a well-known problem, and the absence of manpower in this field prevents many companies from accelerating their development.", "The following problems touch upon aspects that aren\u2019t necessarily technical in nature. 24.7% of respondents say a non-technical issue they face is receiving unclear questions that are difficult to find answers for, while 17.6% indicate having a lack of domain experts, from whom they can seek advice. Finally, 15.6% of respondents mention the difficulty of defining the role of Data Scientist and what working in data science means.", "All in all, this year\u2019s survey results do not show a drastic change in comparison to last year\u2019s. The average salary tends to increase as more demand is present in the field, and it seems like this trend will continue into the future. Despite the high entry barriers, I believe we will see more people trying to integrate into the field and take their first steps in Machine Learning. We might even see more people entering the field from non-classical entry points, e.g., different work paths and other academic specializations (a pattern that is already becoming prominent). On the other hand, we may also see traditional companies or veteran startups entering the field by examining how they can best implement data science for the benefit of their business.", "Another important point, which was also raised last year, is that a majority of employers in the field focus on the Central District (\u201cGush Dan\u201d) and, more specifically, Tel Aviv. I am prone to think that most of the talent pools are concentrated in those areas. Regardless, we are seeing more Machine Learning communities emerging in Jerusalem and Haifa so that it is possible for next year\u2019s survey results to tell a different story in this regard.", "A final change to potentially witness next year is that TensorFlow\u2019s dominance could decline in favor of PyTorch, which is growing in popularity. It is perhaps too early to tell who will lead the ranks and whether the community in Israel will confirm this, but we can be relatively certain in claiming that PyTorch\u2019s presence will grow substantially in the coming year.", "Your home for data science.
