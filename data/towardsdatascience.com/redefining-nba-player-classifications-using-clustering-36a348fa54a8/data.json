The NBA has now come to a time where Point Guards grab 10 plus rebounds and Centers shoot effectively from the 3 Point line, where 7 feet tall players are skilled at being the primary ball handler while players below 6 feet 6 get minutes as Centers. Players have begun expanding their skill sets to assert dominance all over the court. These players can no longer be defined by which position they play in. Yet, in this \u2018Position-less Era\u2019 of basketball, teams still limit themselves to bracketing players into traditional positions, constraining them to roles meant for players of the past. This article aims to provide a new way to define players into certain brackets using Unsupervised Learning methods.", "All Data used is sourced from NBA.com and consists of various recorded in-game player statistics from the 2018\u20132019 NBA Season. A total 530 data points were collected with 336 features, which includes Player Data, General Statistics, Advanced Statistics, Defensive Statistics, Hustle Statistics, Play Style Statistics and Passing Statistics. Players who played less than 12 minutes/game and less than 10 games were dropped, which reduced the number of data points to 388.", "The curse of dimensionality can be a daunting thing. It not only makes a model harder to interpret, but can also lead to overfitting. It is reasonable to assume not all features give valuable information about the data, while some give similar information given by another feature. The dataset here has 336 features, surely not all are relevant to this project.", "Feature Selection/Dimension Reduction is an important step in any Data Science pipeline. Here Pearson Correlation and Variance Inflation Factor were used to reduce the number of features from 336 to 87.", "Principal Component Analysis is another popular dimension reduction method, one that manages to retain all information without throwing away any features. Feature Selection already reduced 336 features to 87 and throwing away more features could be detrimental to the model. The use of PCA strikes a perfect balance between retaining all information and simplifying the model. Here PCA was conducted using the Sci-Kit Learn library. The following table shows the variance explained by each Principal Component.", "PC1, PC2 and PC3 combined explain nearly half of the total variation created by the data. Having around 60% of variance explained by the data is a good cutoff point and perfect balance between model complexity and interpretability. The first 6 Principal Components successfully explain around 61% of variance created by the data. Subsequent components have negligible impact as variance explained by these features are less.", "Principal Components are interpreted by using their eigenvalues. A feature having high positive eigenvalue means the component has a high positive association with the feature.

Classifying players as per their position is an outdated system and should have no place in the modern game. But, if not positions, what should be used to classify players who play similarly?
