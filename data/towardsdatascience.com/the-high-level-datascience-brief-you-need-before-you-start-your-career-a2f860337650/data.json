I did not understand what exactly data science is till I did it as a part of my project. I am writing this article to help anyone who wants to know what actually data science is and why is it trending so much these days, and get a taste of it before diving deeper into the field.", "Humans are analytical and before making a decision such as learning a new thing or starting a new career, we have a lot of questions, next 5 minutes will help you in making that decision.", "Data science is the analytics of a very big amount of data which gives prediction and actionable insights given by some metrics. You can think of it as weather forecast, if it rains you have to wear a rain coat, or carry an umbrella. It usually doesn\u2019t have to do with anything in the past, but learning from the past data, so the business can have an actionable insight.", "Data science isn\u2019t new though, the term is on the rise. It isn\u2019t new because scientists have been using data to have better findings from years now. Why the term is on the rise and the field is trending a lot? Because our capacity to store data has significantly increased. It is speculated that total data stored in the world has increased from 0.8 ZB in 2008\u201309 to 30ZB in 2020 and going to be more than 120ZB by 2025. And hence businesses are keen to understand their data to take data driven decisions.", "According to a report, in 2022, the job requirements for data science and analytics is projected to boom to by 364,000 openings to 2,720,000", "A very good data scientist will require skills ranging from being a domain expertise, mathematician, developer, good soft skills, scientific method, data engineering, statistics, visualization, advanced computing and so on. But finding all the qualities in a single person is quite rare, and hence big companies are hiring such people to share the resources.", "But what we actually need to be a data scientist is:1. The foremost is passion for data2. Relate problems to analytics3. Care about engineering solutions4. Exhibit curiosity5. Communicate well with the team", "The steps for any data science project on a high level seems somewhat like this, and follow a similar pattern.", "The data can be acquired through APIs, databases (SQL or NoSQL), RSS Feeds, live data from sensors, spread sheets. We have different mediums to store and retrieve data and these are few of them. Before starting with the process, we get the data from one of such mediums which is available. The raw dataset is imported into the analytics platform.", "1. Understanding the nature of the data, preliminary analysis (customer\u2019s/client\u2019s need, feasibility, economic analysis), finding correlations(within the data), general trends and outliers(any rare event, or exception in data, to be ruled out to have better analytics).", "2. Describing the data \u2014 This involves measuring the data not restricted to, a. Mean and Median of the columns.  b. Mode \u2014 which is the value that occurs the most.  c. Range \u2014 how the data is spread.", "3. Visualizing the data \u2014 The data is visualized through a bunch of visuals such as, Heat maps, Histogram \u2014 Distribution of data, Boxplots, Line Graphs, Scatter Plots. This gives insights of the data before we actually start working on it. It provides us with information which might be missed through non visual processes.", "This process involves cleaning of the data, real world data is usually inconsistent, duplicate, invalid. We usually clean the data by,", "80% of data scientists\u2019 time is spent on finding, cleaning and organizing data", "Involves building a model. Data is input to the model and an analysis technique is decided. What the model generates is the output. We have different techniques and models depending upon the requirement.", "ModellingTo predict something useful from the dataset, we need to use Machine Learning algorithms. This is where machine learning comes as a sub division of data science.", "The Machine learning models are trained by the training data provided, which is the data we acquired, which is then used to predict data. This process of training of data and getting predicted values from the model is called practicing Machine learning.", "The steps are as follow:1. Select Technique \u2014 Of the given techniques, we can select which suits our requirement from the data.2. Build Model \u2014 We can use existing pre defined models, or customize them.3. Validate Model \u2014 Validation of the model, whether the model is giving the right output.", "Validation can be done for the 1. Classification and Regression \u2014 By comparing predicted value vs correct value.2. Clustering \u2014 Verify whether the groups assigned are useful for our business.3. Association Analysis \u2014 Takes longer as it has to be investigated by actually looking at the data and verify the relations between different entities.", "We can also repeat the analysis, build the model again, if we are not satisfied with the results. This is decided after looking at the result and is done till we have a minimum level of accuracy.", "This is usually a decision what to present, what part of the analysis to be shown, and deciding best value to the business. Finding and reporting what are the main values, main result of the whole process. What question is our findings and analysis answering? Think of the business questions which are getting answered by such analysis.", "All findings must be reported so the next steps can be decided. This can also result in scrapping the project if no scope of usefulness is visible from the project.", "Note \u2014 It is always better to show the analysis without any modification and alteration to make the clients happy. The credibility is lost if wrong actions are taken based on the data that appeared to be right but was actually wrong.", "The whole process of data science is done to get some actionable insights for the business or the product. Hence this step is the final one, where it is decided what actions to be taken after the analysis.", "Usually the business decides the action from the insights after the suggestions from the data team.", "Now that you have an idea what to be expected in the field of data science, and what the industry expects from a data scientist, and the what are the processes involved, you can make a better judgement as to picking the data science as your career.", "If you liked the article and learnt something, do follow me on twitter and medium to read more of such stuff.
