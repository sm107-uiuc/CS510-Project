Fueled by a series of great draft picks, the San Antonio Spurs went on to make the playoffs for a record-tying 22 seasons while winning five championships in the process. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Sacramento Kings are currently riding a 14-year playoff drought \u2014 the second longest in NBA history. Unsurprisingly, this analysis ranks them among the teams least successful at drafting.", "In this analysis, I have created a metric that scores each draft pick by comparing them against the players taken after them (the full methodology is available at the end). After applying this over the last 10 years (the drafts from 2010 to 2019), we can now measure which teams have been successful in their drafting and what teams have not.", "The results of this analysis also empirically validate the vital link between drafting success and winning. The relationship between team drafting scores and winning is strong and statistically significant \u2014 an increase of 0.1 in team draft score is associated with 3.7 more regular season wins in the last NBA season. Of the fourteen teams with an above average draft score, ten of them made the playoffs last year. Among the bottom five teams, none made the playoffs.", "Over the past ten years, the Toronto Raptors have been the best drafting team by a wide margin. This has contributed to seven straight post-season appearances, capped with an NBA Championship in 2019. Meanwhile, Cleveland ranked as the worst drafting team.", "A couple of the result are fairly surprising. While Golden State and San Antonio are both considered to be strong drafters, this analysis ranks them as below average. In reality, most of their home-run draft picks occurred more than ten years ago (outside of this analysis). Their drafting in more recent years has been less impressive.", "Looking at individual draft picks, draft scores center around zero\u2014 an approximately average draft selection.", "The very best draft picks have a score of 4.0+ while worst-performing picks have scores below -2.0. About one-quarter of all draft picks had a score close to zero\u2014 largely due to late draft picks that had low expectations and correspondingly low-impact performance.", "We can also see all 600 picks with their actual performance plotted against their comparison.", "A couple of outliers are noted in this chart. First, despite the relatively low expectations of a 30th overall pick, Jimmy Butler went on to become one of the most impactful players in the NBA. Conversely, Thomas Robinson enormously under-performed as a 5th overall pick.", "Somewhat surprisingly, the best draft pick was actually a first overall selection (Karl-Anthony Towns). However, two out of the five best draft selections also came in the second round.", "Since second round picks typically have much lower expectations, they can achieve high scores with performance less impressive than a typical top pick. In other words, pulling an All-Star out of the second round is usually rewarded much more than out of the top-5 picks.", "The worst draft picks are usually among the top draft picks \u2014 none of them came in the second round (where expectations are typically much lower).", "It should be noted that some of the worst selections likely aren\u2019t as bad as they look. Samanic and Garland have each only played one season in the NBA \u2014 not nearly enough to get a good view of a young player. There is a good chance their scores will trend more towards the middle of the pack as time passes.", "Available here is a full dashboard where you can view where you can view and explore the full dataset (by team or player) for yourself.", "All data was collected from Basketball Reference. Some adjustments were made around which teams draft picks were attributed to. While a player is officially listed under the team that drafted them, if they were traded on draft night or any time before the beginning of the next season, I attributed the draft pick to be under the team that they were traded to. Any trades after that point did not affect attribution.", "The central idea behind this analysis is relatively simple. When judging teams drafting success, draft picks should be measured against the alternatives that were available in that draft position during that year. A team that drafted fifth overall shouldn\u2019t be penalized because the team drafted fourth overall scored a great prospect \u2014 that player wasn\u2019t available at fifth overall. Additionally, it doesn\u2019t matter if a first overall pick performs weakly relative to the typically high expectations of a top draft pick \u2014 it only matters if better alternatives were on the table that year.", "Therefore, this analysis will compare draft picks against the players that were taken after them. If those players performed better, then this indicates that better options were readily available. If those players performed worse, this means that the team made the best of what they had. To measure performance, I will use Win Shares.", "To assign weights to the players drafted after, I use a basic exponential function:", "Where E represents the expected Win Shares at draft position d, alpha represents the smoothing factor, and W represents the actual Win Shares achieved at draft position d + 1 (the player taken directly after them). To initialize the function the 60th overall pick is assigned an Expected value of zero.", "This equation does require one arbitrary choice: the alpha value (which must be between zero and one). A greater alpha places more emphasis on players drafted directly after while a lower value smooths the weighted average more evenly over a larger number of players.", "For example, an alpha of 1.0 would place 100% of the weight of the player drafted next. Under an alpha of 0.4, the following weights would be assigned to the subsequent draft positions:", "The further away a player is drafted, the less weight is assigned to them since they were less likely to be seriously considered as an alternative at that draft position.", "I choose an alpha of 0.4 for first round draft picks and an alpha of 0.2 for second round draft picks, recognizing the much greater disagreement in later draft positions.", "Using this weighted average of players taken after them, each draft pick now has an expected value for comparison. By subtracting the expected value from the actual performance of each player, we arrive at the number of Win Shares by which that player either exceeded or fell short of their comparison (the net rating). Examples of the actual and expected performance of several players from recent drafts are visualized below.", "Note that high draft selections (Irving and Davis were both 1st overall picks) have relatively high expectations, while Isaiah Thomas (drafted last overall) was expected to produce zero Win Shares.", "While this number allows comparison to other draft picks within that draft year, it doesn\u2019t allow comparison between draft years since older draft years have had more time to accumulate Win Shares than more recent ones. To normalize scores from all draft years, we can use z-scoring by dividing this number by the standard deviation of the net rating in that year to arrive at the draft score.", "The average of all player draft scores for each team forms the team draft score.", "Your home for data science.
