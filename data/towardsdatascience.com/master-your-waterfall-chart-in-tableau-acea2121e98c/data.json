Click on the measure and choose Quick Table Calculation and Running Total", "3. And here comes the trick. Choose Gantt Bar as marks (have you ever used GANTT in Tableau? Really?) and as \u201cGantt size\u201d use a new calculated field: the same measure but with the opposite sign", "4. Add the Grand total to the right", "Sometimes you need to group components and show subtotals.", "Following the example in the first part of this tutorial, we have the 5 most important components of the Net Banking Income of a commercial bank:", "In a common reclassification of the Income Statement in the banking sector, the first two are grouped together and the total effect is called \u201cNet Interest Income\u201d while the other three are usually grouped together in what is called \u201cNon-Interest Income\u201d.", "Add the new grouped dimension in the columns (before Component). You even create a Hierarchy.", "Another useful thing you want to add to your chart is conditional formatting to distinguish between positive and negative effects. That\u2019s an easy one. Just add a calculated field with the sign of the measure and add it to \u201ccolor\u201d.", "Sometimes there are two dimensions in which you want to split components into: maybe you want to divide every bar in two or more colors without creating another component in the x-axis.", "For this chart, I would like to use another dataset and it\u2019s about another important topic in banking: liquidity.", "The role of banks in the economic system is to intermediate between who has an excess of liquidity and wants to get money for it (investors) and who needs liquidity for his business (borrowers). Banks themself need liquidity and need to optimize the size of it (holding liquidity could be a cost with respect to more lucrative investments).", "A typical source of liquidity comes from customer checking accounts or from issuing bonds. But banks can also retrieve liquidity lending for a short time some assets they have (typically bonds or loans but also equity). This could be done with market counterparties (other banks through Repurchasing Agreement, REPO) or Central Banks.", "In this context, it is useful to keep track of the status of your assets (already encumbered or available) to avoid lending the same asset twice and the potential source of your liquidity (Market or Central Bank). There are therefore two dimensions and one measure (liquidity countervalue of your assets).", "Let\u2019s see how to do it in this database. You see that Type could assume two values: Total Assets or Encumbered Assets. Since Available Assets could be calculated as the difference between Total and Encumbered, let\u2019s try to get a \u201cbuild-down\u201d chart.", "The first steps are the same as before (keep in mind to sort the Type to have Total Assets before Encumbered Assets).", "Then try to put the Source in Color. You\u2019ll see that the results you\u2019ll obtain are not what you expected: The Total Asset change from 90 to 60. Also, the Available Assets are less than we expected.", "This depends on the fact that the Running Sum is obtained grouping by Type Now that you use also another level of details (Source) you see the Market and Central Bank overlapping in the same bar. So we need to \u201cEdit Table Calculation\u201d, choose to compute using \u201cSpecific Dimensions\u201d and add Source.", "Another detail that could be useful is the labels. Add Measure on the labels and you get something like this.", "It only shows the top label: the default is not show the overlapping label. You need to choose \u201calways show\u201d and center vertical.", "Waterfall charts are a wonderful way of representing the components of a measure often used in Business Analytics.", "Using Tableau \u201cGANTT\u201d you can easily obtain a perfect Waterfall in just a few clicks and with what you learned in this tutorial you can go beyond the usual capabilities of the most common tools used in business analytics.", "Your home for data science.
