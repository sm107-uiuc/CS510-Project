We combine the partial candidate from the short-term and long-term memories and set it as the candidate.", "And now we can proceed to the output gate.", "After that, we can gather o_t as the output gate of the LSTM cell and then multiply it per the tanh of the candidate (long-term memory) which was already update with the proper operation.

You may want to see it on our repo and test it with our LSTM text-sentiment analysis notebook which we made ready for testing and comparing with torch LSTM built-in layer.", "We can take as a conclusion that, despite being kind of a Deep Learning tabus, if done in steps and with clean and good coding, it is actually easy to perform it\u2019s operations into a clean, easy to use nn.Module .
