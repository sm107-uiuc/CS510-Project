Unfortunately, this results in an AI/ML lifecycle that is encumbered by the same bureaucratic processes, manual activities and handoffs that burden regular application delivery lifecycle.", "This may be tolerable for corporate applications where delays and longer delivery cycles may have nominal impact. However, this is unacceptable for the next generation of AI/ML enabled applications which demand speed, agility, and responsiveness. Clearly, corporate IT governance must be reengineered to accommodate the needs of AI/ML.", "The objective of AI/ML Governance is to ensure that evidence is provided that demonstrates that a model and its delivery process can generate results that are reproducible, traceable, and verifiable.", "Clearly this is beneficial in a number of ways: First, in some industries traceability is mandated. Consider banking, where we have deep experience, as an example where regulatory oversight is significant and imposes controls on the AI/ML delivery process. Model risk management, for example, imposes strict requirements for analytic processes so that AI/ML models work as expected. In the US this is addressed through regulations such as SR 11\u20137 and in Canada with Enterprise-wide Model Risk Management Guideline (E-23).", "However, many other industries from health care and biotech to government security have similar regulatory needs. AI/ML governance drives the capabilities required to address this need for model traceability.", "Second, customers and corporations are now demanding that models deliver verifiable outcomes that are ethical and un-biased. Unfortunately, AI/ML model outcomes are driven by the data put into them and the unknown biases of the people creating them, which may lead to implicit decisions based upon race, ethnicity, gender or political biases.", "Identifying, understanding, verifying, and providing evidence of outcomes is a core principle of AI/ML governance and must become a core determinant of AI/ML model effectiveness.", "And lastly, corporations are recognizing that rapidly delivering results requires a reproducible AI/ML DEVOPS process. Today data scientists follow a process that in many ways mirrors a traditional scientific process in that they use an intensely iterative and experimental process.", "However, corporations relying on traditional scientific methods have, after decades of practice, a proven and reproducible process of proving outcomes and bring products to market. Data scientists, on the other hand, do not have as mature a process. AI/ML governance provides the impetus and mechanisms to create reproducible and repeatable model outcomes.", "Simply put, it makes practical sense to make AI/ML governance a required discipline.", "The foundation to modern AI/ML governance is the ability to capture AI/ML model metrics and meta-data across the entire model lifecycle. Starting with the basics, all model source code and versions must be captured using source code control tool (for example, GitHub or GitLab) allowing data scientists to collaborate to quickly develop models but to also allow key model artifacts to be retained.", "To address reproducibility, training data must be migrated into read-only archives and the association must be captured between a model\u2019s source code and the data that was used to train it.", "To address traceability, original source system data and the data engineering scripts that were used to transform and enrich the data must be archived, thereby providing visibility to all changes to data across the delivery lifecycle.", "And to address verifiability, all training outputs, logs, and related artifacts must be archived thereby providing evidence that a model is demonstrated to work according to specifications.", "A properly instrumented AI/OPS (DEVOPS for AI/ML) process can capture the require metrics and meta-data. Even now, tools and capabilities are available from major cloud providers, traditional DEVOPS vendors, as well as newer AI/OPS start-ups which can be stitched together to capture many of the required metrics and meta-data.", "While metrics and meta-data capture is quite feasible today, a mature AI/ML environment may contain hundreds of models and associated training assets \u2014 the practical question is how to surface this information in an easily consumable format.", "A portal or dashboard \u2014 an \u201cAI/ML Marketplace\u201d \u2014 provides the mechanism to visualize models and associated training data and related life cycle artifacts and acts as the viewport into modern AI/ML governance. An AI/ML Marketplace should offer core model management capabilities including: searching for models, identifying a model\u2019s related training and verification data, understanding data lineage used in creating training and validation data, viewing meta-data and metrics for models, measuring model performance and effectiveness, and perhaps even gaining insights into data scientist productivity.", "Unfortunately, there is no single vendor that offers this capability in an integrated fashion. Today, corporations may need to provide additional instrumentation to their AI/OPS tools integrate critical metrics and meta-data and may also need to build key user interface elements for the AI/ML Marketplace portal/dashboard.", "However, it is expected that this is a short-term gap and innovative vendors and start-ups will shortly offer more integrated products and sophisticated user interfaces.", "There are usually a few metrics that are strictly governed for model promotion at each phase in a model\u2019s lifecycle, and these metrics can usually be gathered from the foundational meta-data discussed earlier.", "The AI/ML Marketplace services two purposes: First, it provides a dashboard that allows data scientists and operational staff to view the state of these metrics and make model promotion and governance decisions.", "Second, it provides a way to implement \u201cself-service\u201d governance by allowing single-click certification of models once metrics and supporting evidence have been captured. Once certified, the model meta-data and related artifacts are archived for future auditability.", "With AI/ML model metrics and meta-data capture, coupled with single-click certification via a flexible AI/ML Marketplace, modern AI/ML governance is now transformed from a lengthy bureaucratic process to an agile and rapid activity.", "By addressing modern AI/ML governance practices, data scientists will experience productivity that exceeds those of their competitors. And by adopting these techniques, data scientists\u2019 work will become easier, simpler, much more automated, and ultimately more productive. But perhaps most important, this productivity will be achieved knowing that AI/ML capabilities are deployed in a safe, certifiable, and verifiable manner.", "Authors: Eric Broda, John Miller, SVDS Group, Mike Lamble, ModelWorks", "Your home for data science.
