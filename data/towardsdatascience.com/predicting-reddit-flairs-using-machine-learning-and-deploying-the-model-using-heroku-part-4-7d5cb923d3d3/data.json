You have completed all the previous parts and they were really heavy. Congratulations on making it this far. You have collected your own data, modelled it, made predictions on it and you have also deployed the model using a web-application in Parts 1, 2 and 3. After all that hard work, I think your model deserves to be seen by the whole world. Heroku will help you with just that.", "Heroku is a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud. You can easily go from an idea to getting the applications own URL without worrying about the infrastructure details. Basically, you get a website for your application without a lot of hassle. Let\u2019s get started.", "This is a step by step tutorial and I will walk you through it all. From setting up an account to deploying the application. So, follow along.", "The first step is to set up a Heroku account which will let you access their infrastructure and GUI. Using the Heroku client online is also an easy and interactive way to deploy an application but we\u2019re programmers so we will be using the terminal because it\u2019s more flexible and let\u2019s be honest, way cooler!", "You can set up your account by going to this link. After you have filled in all the personal details, set up your primary development language as Python. Don\u2019t worry, this not restrictive in nature and you will be able to deploy applications in other languages and frameworks as well later. Once, you have filled these details, you\u2019ll get an email to set your password.", "The Heroku Command Line Interface (CLI) makes it easy to create and manage your Heroku apps directly from the terminal. It\u2019s an essential part of using Heroku.", "Note:- The Heroku CLI requires Git, the popular version control system. So, if you don\u2019t have git installed, do that first. I used Heroku on my Linux Terminal. If you\u2019re using MacOS then the commands will be almost similar. For Windows, you\u2019ll have to download and install the application which will seamlessly integrate with your PowerShell. Similarly, it will integrate with your Linux or Mac shells. Make sure that your PowerShell is running with administrator access.", "Once the shell is open, we need to authenticate Heroku.", "This will redirect you to a new browser window where you can log in and add your details if required.", "This is a very crucial task because the Heroku CLI picks up changes from either GitHub or a local git repository. If you have already created an initialized a git repository, you can skip this part and directly start from", "Step 1: Move into the project directory. My directory is names as reddit-flair-predictor and is saved on my Dekstop.", "Step 2: Create a new repository on GitHub. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.", "Step 3: Initialize the local directory as a Git repository.", "Step 4: Add the files in your new local repository and make your first commit to the repository.", "Step 5: At the top of your GitHub repository\u2019s Quick Setup page, click to copy the remote repository URL. Once, copied add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed.", "Step 6: Push the changes to GitHub", "In Part 3, I have already discussed some of the merits and demerits of using virtual environments and I won\u2019t be touching upon it now. You can read about virtual environment setup here. If you decide to use virtual environments then it is recommended that you also install this file which contains the list of dependencies for the project.", "One new library that you will require for this project is Gunicorn. It is a Python Web Server Gateway Interface HTTP server, broadly compatible with various web frameworks, simply implemented, light on server resources, and fairly speedy.", "The next step is creating a Procfile. Heroku apps include a Procfile that specifies the commands that are executed by the app on startup. Please note that the Procfile is always a simple text file that is named Procfile without a file extension. For example, Procfile.txt is not valid. The Procfile contains the following line of code.", "The first step is to set up your buildpack. Buildpacks are responsible for transforming deployed code into a slug, which can then be executed on a dyno. Buildpacks are composed of a set of scripts, and depending on the programming language, the scripts will retrieve dependencies, output generated assets or compiled code, and more.", "There is a chance that this might lead to an error. In that case, you can set the buildpack during app creation.", "Once the buildpack is set, we can create our app with the app name reddit-flair-app. There is a chance that the name might not be available so you will have to tweak it around, however you like.", "You can also set buildpacks during the creation of the app if it didn\u2019t work before.", "Once the creation command runs, you will be able to see 2 URLs. The first URL shows the link where the app will be available while the second URL is the remote git repository URL; by default, the heroku create command automatically adds a git remote named \u201cheroku\u201d pointing at this URL. This is a git endpoint where we can push our code as well.", "When you click on the link, you will see this window. This means that the app was successfully created and a placeholder app is showing.", "We need to push our code from our local git repository to the heroku repository for it to show the web-app. To confirm that you\u2019re pushing to the correct repo, run this command.", "If it shows the following then it means that your remote is set up correctly which means that the code will be pushed to the heroku repo.", "If it doesn\u2019t show this then you can change the remote using this command.", "Finally, push the code to the Heroku repository for it to show online and wait for a while.", "The last step is to allot a dyno to your application. Dynos are the building blocks that power any Heroku app and in laymen terms act as the servers for your application.", "You can either click on your URL or you can open your application from the CLI.", "Since free dynos are limited, you can also shut down your application.", "This brings me to the end of this tutorial series. It\u2019s really great if you stuck till the end and if this was a good learning experience for because it was surely a good experience for me.", "Your home for data science.
