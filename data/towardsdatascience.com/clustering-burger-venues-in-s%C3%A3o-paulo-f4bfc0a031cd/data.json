It has a plethora of venues and restaurants with specialties from all around the world. In special, there is one type of restaurant category that is remarkably popular in the city: burger joints. S\u00e3o Paulo has approximately 600 burger joints in total and some neighborhoods have more than one per block.", "As a part of my final project for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate, I decided to bring together data science and my immense appreciation for hamburgers to learn a little bit about the burger joints in S\u00e3o Paulo, the city where I currently live.", "The objective here is to provide insights for people that want to open up a burger venue, or already has a venue and wants to draw some new information about the market or just for someone curious about how data can change our perspective on absolutely any subject.", "All of this project was made using Python language and Jupyter notebooks. The detailed code is in this Jupyter notebook link. For the time being, I am only going to post some code snippets for the essential parts.", "The vision I had for this project was to retrieve data from the burger venues in S\u00e3o Paulo, create clusters of venues based on their characteristics, categorize them and draw insights about each cluster.", "To achieve this objective, this study was divided into 4 parts:", "The first step into data acquisition is to use the geopy library to retrieve the neighborhoods in S\u00e3o Paulo so later we can find out the burger joints of each neighborhood.", "Geopy is a library that makes it easy for Python developers to locate the coordinates of addresses, cities, countries, and landmarks across the globe using third-party geocoders and other data sources.", "Using geopy is really simple, its just a matter of writing down the name of the neighborhood and it will return a latitude and longitude of that location. Here is a snippet of code that retrieves all the latitude and longitude values of each neighborhood using an excel file that has all the neighborhood names:", "With this info, we can use each location to retrieve each venue within a radius of 900 meters from each neighborhood. This radius was selected because a larger radius would only cause overlap of venues and create more duplicates in the data set. The code below shows how to call the API to retrieve all the venues, their location, name and id:", "Note that to reproduce the code above, you will need a foursquare developer account: http://developer.foursquare.com/.", "Now we can use a folium map to take a look at the burger venues in S\u00e3o Paulo", "The image above depicts just how large is the burger joint market in S\u00e3o Paulo. In some regions, this could actually be a saturated market, for example in the Itaim Bibi Neighborhood, we have more than 30 burger joints (just counting the ones that are registered in Foursquare).", "Now, the idea here is to gather information that will help us get insights about these venues.", "To get this information, we will need to make another call to the Foursquare API, but this time we will need to use another endpoint since we need information for each specific venue. The url to make the calls is https://api.foursquare.com/v2/venues/$VENUE_ID&client_id&client_secret&version. This will return the most of the information we need in a json format.", "After making the calls for each venue id we will have the reviews, the price and the rating for each venue, leaving us with only the neighborhood meter squared price left to retrieve. This information I had to obtain manually in a real estate site specialized in the S\u00e3o Paulo region (http://proprietariodireto.com.br). Now, we are left with a data frame that looks like the one below:", "Now that we have all the information we need, it's time to move on to the data preprocessing and finally create our clusters.", "Before we start making a whole bunch of cluster and start drawing conclusions, we need to ask ourselves: What type of data do we have? Which clustering algorithm is the best choice? How are we going to prepare the data? How are we going to evaluate the clustering results?", "What type of data do we have?", "Let's recall that we are interested in 3 features to feed our clustering algorithm: price of the venue (scale from 1\u20134, price per meter squared in Reais (R$) and the rating (scale from 1\u201310).The problem with 2 of those features are that they are ordinal data. This makes it very difficult for some unsupervised algorithm to produce relevant results. For example, k-means uses euclidian distance to calculate dissimilarities between elements in a cluster. This means that this task for categorical data is impossible because we can't determine how category A is distant from category B, because they are non continuous data. On the other hand, there are clustering algorithms such as k-modes, that specializes in clustering pure categorical data. But with ordinal data its a special case because our information is divided into categories but have a certain order. This leaves us with an important decision: should we treat our data as continuous, or should we treat our data as mixed data, where some will be continuous and some will be categorical?There are pros and cons for both decisions and this will ultimately affect the clustering algorithm of choice.", "Which clustering algorithm is the best choice?", "Treating the data as purely continuous would assume that the distance between one category and another are the same as if they were continuous data, which sometimes is not true. By treating them as mixed data, we would basically loose the ordering information of the ordinal data and treat them as purely categorical. For this approach (mixed data) we would need to use the k-prototypes algorithm, which I explain at the end of this post. Since we need the order of the information for both of our categorical data, we will treat them as continuous and use the k-means algorithm to cluster them.", "How are we going to prepare the data?", "Before proceeding to the following steps, its important to check for null values in the features and for duplicate ids and drop the rows where either case are true. Then, we need to standardize the data so no feature has a higher weight than another during the clustering process. To do this we will use the sklearn's StandarScaler. This will standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.", "Now we are ready to cluster our venues:", "This plot generated in this code snippet will be useful in the next step.", "How are we going to evaluate the clustering results?", "The method used to evaluate clustering accuracy is going to be the elbow method. Actually, we are going to minimize the distance between each data point in all clusters to their respective centroids. This will give us the optimal number of clusters for our specific case. To use the elbow method, we plot the graph with the inertia value using different number of clusters:", "By looking at the figure above, we can conclude that 4 clusters would be our optimal choice for this case.", "Using 4 clusters and running the algorithm again we obtain the following distribution of points within the 3 features of our cluster (this graph was generated using plotly):", "With these 3 visualizations, we can start to get a feeling about how the algorithm clustered the venues. Before we move on, lets create a folium map to visualize the venues separated by cluster in the S\u00e3o Paulo map:", "The red cluster is cluster 0, the purple cluster is cluster 1, cluster 2 is color coded in blue and cluster 3 is shown in beige.", "After assigning each venue to separate data frames for each cluster, we can start analyzing each cluster and start getting insights from the generated results.", "Ok, we have the clusters, but what do they tell us? To answer this question, we need to go through 2 steps:", "Let's start with the first step by plotting the features in each cluster. Starting with the mean price of the venues of each cluster:", "The graph above shows cluster 0 and 2 being the most expensive, having entrees ranging from 10\u201320 USD. If we assume a linear relationship between price rating and real price, Cluster 0 is on average, approximately 17% more expensive than cluster 2 which are the second most expensive venues.", "This draws a clear divide between cluster 0 and 2 and cluster 1 and 3. Cluster 0 and 2 are the most expensive venues and clusters 1 and 3 are the cheapest venues, with special attention to cluster 3, which is less than half of the average price of cluster 0. This means that the average price of the entrees of the venues of cluster 3 are less than 10 dollars.", "Now, moving on to the mean real estate price of each cluster:", "This graph shows that the one of the main clustering features that separated cluster 2 from the rest was real estate price. Its average price is 75% higher than the second most expensive neighborhood cluster, which is cluster 0.", "With this in mind, it is expected that the people that attend cluster 2 venues have more purchasing power when compared to other clusters.", "Finally, we have the venue rating:", "Almost all of the clusters had no relevant percentage difference on rating, all of them ranging from 7.6 to 8.1 on average. It\u2019s assumable that the venues of these clusters are pretty satisfied customers.", "On the other hand, we observe another clear division between clusters on cluster 1. It\u2019s average rating was 5.86, 23% less than the second lowest rated cluster.", "Apparently, each cluster had its characteristics but now its time to go over something more qualitative that will bring some insights not only about the venues, but from the customers of those venues themselves.", "Word clouds are very aesthetic tools that can help us retrieve text information based on the frequency of a word in a certain text. Words clouds will produce an image where the most common words will appear bigger.", "Using the reviews of the customers, we can generate a word cloud of each customer and try to identify characteristics about the venue, about the customer, find explanations to the values we got in the features and also discover what are the aspects of the venues of each cluster that get the most attention out of the customers.", "Since this project is dealing with a country that speaks Portuguese, it will be hard for someone that doesn\u2019t understand the language to retain information from the word cloud as a whole. For this reason, the key points generated in this word cloud will be explained and properly translated.", "To create the word clouds, we generate lists of words from the reviews of each cluster and for each list of words from the 4 clusters we will create a word cloud:", "After plotting each word cloud we get:", "From a visual inspection, we can see the words that are more common in each cluster. Although this can already bring us some insights, lets get the top 10 words from each cluster. I have already translated the words in order to make this part more accessible for people that don't speak the language.", "From this section, we can identify some similarities between the information we gathered in the previous steps while analyzing the clusters quantitatively.", "First lets take a look at everything they have in common within their top ranked words, these could be the must-haves for someone looking to open a burger joint. All of them have the word \u2018atendimento\u2019 which means \u2018service\u2019 in Portuguese. So first key takeaway from this information is that no matter your customer segment, price, or location, you have to have a good service, this word is within the top 3 words in all clusters. Another word that appeared in all clusters is \u2018maionese\u2019 which you would probably guess as being mayonnaise.", "Now, taking a look at the differences between clusters, we can see that all of them but cluster 2 have the word \u2018pre\u00e7o\u2019,which means \u2018price\u2019 in Portuguese. This means that cluster 2 probably doesn\u2019t show too much interest in evaluating price as a defining category when visiting a burger joint. This makes sense based on the price per meter squared because cluster 2 was categorized as having the richest customers. Another interesting fact is that cluster 2 refers to the word vegetarian (\u2018vegetariano\u2019 in Portuguese) and brie (as for the cheese), showing that they are also very demanding in terms of options.", "Another interesting point to observe is that fries make a double appearance in cluster 3. This happened because the word 'batata' and 'fritas' both mean french fries in this context, so fries actually had a large impact on this cluster. Cluster 3 also shows one word that did not explicitly appear in any other top 10 words from the other clusters, which is the word 'options'. This may suggest that although they don't demand fancy condiments such as brie cheese or vegetarian options, they also value a venue that have different combinations or sizes using the traditional condiments.", "Now that we have taken some insights about what the customers talk about the most, we can combine what we observed from the quantitative analysis and the top words to draw some conclusions about each cluster:", "High priced venues, on neighborhoods that are average priced and have high ratings. The customers talk about the price, service and another feature that was not present in any other category which is beer. This shows us that the people that attend these high priced venues don\u2019t have as much purchasing power as cluster 2 but when they choose to spend, money, it is probably on leisure time (hence beer on top words) and they value this type of experience (hence higher ratings).", "Average priced (compared to others), low priced neighborhoods and low ratings. This cluster is highlighted by dissatisfaction not only in the ratings but in the top words where price and expensive are among the top 10. This could be explained by the fact that people within this cluster don\u2019t have much purchasing power and when they try to spend a little bit more on average priced venues, they usually don\u2019t reach their expectations. Points that a cluster 1 venue should look out for are probably cost benefit related, giving people expectations that are not really met.", "High priced venues and neighborhood locations and high ratings. This cluster is defined by high standards and differentiation. An explanation for the lower rating in comparison to clusters 0 and 3 is that people that have higher purchasing power and attend high priced venues elevate their expectations, hence, they will have less mercy when submitting a rating. Based on the top words, we can see that the customers of these venues pay attention to differentiated condiments and options. A point that cluster 2 venues should look out for is to place a priority on uniqueness within their venue\u2019s menu, with less regards for pricing.", "Low priced venues in low priced neighborhoods with high ratings. This cluster is about having lower prices and getting what you paid for. One aspect that was not discussed but is a word that appears on the 15th place on the word cloud is cost-benefit. This already shows us that the customers are getting what they are looking for: good price for a good meal. The price frequency on the cluster 3 word cloud was greater than all the others and from there the top words highlight the basic aspects of a burger joint which is fries, meat, mayo and lots of options. The key take-away for cluster 3 venues is: keep it simple and cheap.", "This closes up the study on burger joints in S\u00e3o Paulo. Although there are tons of data that could make this study more reliable statistically and probably a supervised algorithm would be a good choice if we could label the venues beforehand, it is an interesting high level analysis of the burger joint market in S\u00e3o Paulo. I really recommend that you check out the Jupyter notebook that I have for this project if you are interested into the code behind all of this and also check out the appendix bellow for a quick overview for the results I got using k-prototypes algorithm instead of the k-means.", "Feel free to suggest edits or additions to the knowledge shared here. I hope this post served as an inspiration for people starting out in data science and for people that are simply interested into drawing different insights from data that otherwise would be impossible to observe with the naked eye.", "The k-prototypes algorithm is basically a k-means and k-modes binded together. The k-means will use euclidean distance to calculate dissimilarity between intracluster elements and k-modes will calculate the distance based on the mode of the features in each individual to calculate the dissimilarity between categorical features. This is a really useful method when dealing with mixed data.", "The dissimilarity function of the k-prototypes can be represented by: S+\u03b3P, where S is the dissimilarity of the numeric attributes and P is the dissimilarities between the categorical attributes. Gamma (\u03b3) is the weight that the categorical attributes will have in our clustering algorithm. Of course this is an over simplification of the algorithm so make sure to check out the article published by Zhexue Huang included in the bibliography at the end of this section.", "I'll be using this python implementation for the algorithm: https://github.com/nicodv/kmodes", "For this section, we will assume that the price tiers are categorical and the rest are continuous. To compare the meter squared price to the rating (our continuous variables), we need to scale them:", "Now, we can run the k-prototypes on the data and use the elbow technique again to find the best number of clusters:", "Ok, so 2 clusters will be the choice for this one. Let's run the algorithm again and plot the S\u00e3o Paulo map with the clusters.", "Clearly the algorithm divided between high priced venues, high priced neighborhoods and high ratings on cluster 1 in comparison to cluster 0. Let's see if the customer reviews reflect what we observed above:", "Interestingly we can observe that the words in cluster 1 was really similar to the words we had in cluster 2 using the k-means algorithm. Cluster 0, on the other hand ended up being a mixture of all the other clusters that we had in the previous section.", "As a result, the k-prototypes gave us a binary perspective upon the burger venues which might not necessarily be true or false in terms of the best way to categorize them in reality, but it brings us less insights about the venues than the k-means for this study in particular.", "In conclusion to this post this was just a demonstration on how a selected algorithm might change the way you get results using an unsupervised algorithm. There are many factors that can influence our results using the k-prototypes in particular. One of the factors is the gamma multiplier that sets the weight on the categorical variables which we used the default value of 0.5 for this demonstration. If we start increasing gamma, the algorithm will try to separate the clusters even more based on venue price, which may give us distorted results.", "The choice of unsupervised algorithms and how to use them are, therefore, subject to our own bias and our own conception of what might be true and not necessarily something that holds true and can be verified. This is an important takeaway because although they can be used in our favor, by showing patterns where we can't clearly see, unsupervised algorithms can also be very misleading.", "- A Melhor Plataforma Para a Venda e Compra Direta. proprietariodireto.com.br/.", "Your home for data science.
