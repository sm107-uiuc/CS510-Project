I developed a liking towards this field while picking up Python through online videos and courses about a year and a half ago. In an attempt to enhance my understanding in the field, I decided to join the Data Science Immersive bootcamp offered by General Assembly. Through the programme, we were tasked with several projects that serve to offer us \u2018hands-on\u2019 experiences. As a tribute to my 12 week data science journey, I would love to share my final and perhaps the most notable of them all \u2014 my capstone project. The project centres on using image data and computer vision to build an age classification algorithm using images of people\u2019s faces.", "Why should you read this particular article? \u2014 Chances are that a quick internet search would yield tons of articles, videos, GitHub links and research papers on how to build an age classifier. So where does my article land in a pool of similar content? Why should you continue reading this particular article? Well, here\u2019s why...", "That said, if you happen to be an expert in this field, or if you just have some better ideas on ways to accomplish certain things in this project, be sure to let me know as well.", "So, if I was lucky enough to hold your interest this far down, let\u2019s push on a little further and get right down to business.", "For this project, I decided to use Google Colab instead of Jupyter Notebooks on my personal machine. The primary reason for this was to utilize the free GPUs offered by Google to train my deep learning models. That being said, it may also be possible to complete this project using a traditional CPU, just that it may take slightly longer. For those of you who are new to Google Colab, you can read a bit about it here.", "TL;DR here is a summary of the accuracy scores for all the different approaches.", "The source code and the datasets used in this project can be found at the links given below. Please refer to the included README.txt file for instructions on how to copy the notebooks into your own Google Drive before running the code in the notebooks.", "Throughout the article, I have provided references to the different source code notebooks that contain the relevant code for the sections below. I hope this makes it easier for you to understand this project.", "If you are already curious about trying out the final product of this project (like the GIF at the beginning of this article), either try it out offline by downloading the Jupyter notebook (along with the trained models) as a ZIP file from here, or try it out online in this Google Colab notebook. Do take note that age detection on live webcam video only works in the Jupyter notebook, and does not work in the Google Colab notebook. You can still perform age detection on your uploaded photos and videos in the Google Colab notebook.", "There are a lot of datasets of facial images with age labels that are readily available on the internet. Some of the famous ones include IMDB-WIKI dataset, Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset and All-Age-Faces dataset. For this project, I decided to use the facial-age dataset and the UTKFace dataset (UTKFace Cropped is another source for this). Both datasets provide images that have already been cleaned and labelled properly, allowing me to skip the most time-consuming data cleaning stage of the workflow. Let\u2019s take a look at both these datasets in more detail.", "Refer to notebook 1_EDA_dataset_prep.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "facial-age dataset contains 9,778 RGB images of faces in PNG format of size 200x200 pixels each. The images are separated into folders and the folder names correspond to the age labels of images inside those folders. The distribution and range of ages within the dataset are shown in the barplot below.", "UTKFace dataset contains 23,708 RGB images of faces in JPG format of size 200x200 pixels each. The labels of images are embedded in the file names, formatted like [age]_[gender]_[race]_[date&time].jpg. The distribution and range of ages within the dataset are shown in the barplot below.", "Since both datasets already provided clean frontal images of faces (one face per image) standardized to 200x200 pixels size, I decided to merge the two datasets together for this project and convert all 33,486 images to a standard JPG format. The distribution of images after combining the two datasets is shown in the barplot below.", "After combining the two datasets, the next step was to divide the different age labels into classes of age-ranges. As this project is not specifically aimed at solving any particular data science problem, the choice of division of age-ranges into classes was quite flexible. However, it was still necessary to identify a few constraints to this process in the context of this project, as follows:", "Caveat \u2014 The constraints identified above imply that in this project, I used the amount of data available as a driving factor in defining the nature of my classification problem. This may not be an ideal approach in a real-world data science problem. In reality, the ideal approach would be to first establish the classes for the model according to the data science problem at hand, and then gather a sufficient amount of data for each class so as to appropriately solve the data science problem. However, given the amateur nature of this project and my limited access to readily available facial image data for age classification, I believe this approach was justified in this scenario.", "After some trial-and-error, I decided to divide the images into the following 11 classes of age-ranges, ensuring that the classes were as balanced as possible.", "All the images were labelled with these new class labels before proceeding to the next step.", "Before performing any form of classification or feature extraction on the images, it was necessary to split the combined dataset into training and testing datasets. I used the sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split method to split the dataset into 70% training data (23,440 images) and 30% testing data (10,046 images).", "Refer to notebook 2_dataset_prep_ML_feature_extraction.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "There are a variety of techniques available out there that deal with feature extraction from images for classification modelling (for instance, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), energy and entropy of filtered images, mean pixel values of channels, etc.). As a beginner, I did find all these methods slightly complicated to understand and implement in code.", "In order to extract features from the facial images for my project, I decided to apply a few different filters on some images from my dataset and visually try to spot any significant differences between them. The image below shows the results of this test. I strongly suggest watching this video and other videos in this series to gain a better understanding on how to apply filters and process images for machine learning.", "Refer to notebook 2_dataset_prep_ML_feature_extraction.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "The faces in the above plot increase in age as we move from left to right (1\u201390 years old). As each filter is applied to the images, we can see how different features in the faces are highlighted and whether or not they would be useful in differentiating between faces of different ages.", "From the plot above, I was able to conclude that Canny Edges may be the most useful filter for feature extraction in this case \u2014 as we move from younger to older faces, the density of Canny Edges in the images seem to increase.", "Now that the filter of choice was identified, the next step was to convert the filtered images into scalars so as to be able to feed them into a machine learning classifier. To do this, I decided to breakdown each 200x200 pixels image into sections of 10x10 pixels each, as illustrated below. For each of the 400 resulting sections, I then calculated the mean and standard deviation of the pixel values. This resulted in 800 unique scalar values for each image, which I then tabulated into a dataframe to be used as features in a machine learning classifier.", "The above feature extraction process was repeated for all images in both train and test datasets. These features were then used in two different classifier algorithms, sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier and sklearn.svm.SVC. Both the models were optimized for accuracy by passing multiple combinations of hyperparameters through sklearn.model_selection.GridSearchCV. The table below shows the summary of the obtained results.", "Refer to notebook 3_ML_classification_modelling.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "Evidently, the models are severely over-fitting and not generalizing well on the unseen testing data (basically memorizing the training data). The two normalized confusion matrices below also show this clearly \u2014 even though the accuracy values are somewhat high for the younger age-ranges (of 1\u20132, 3\u20139, 10\u201320 and 21\u201325) and for the older age ranges (of 66\u2013116), there is a presence of significant misclassification for the middle age-ranges of 26\u201365.", "There are, of course, a multitude of methods that could be utilized to improve the above accuracy scores and reduce the degree of over-fit in the models. For instance, better differentiating features could be extracted from the images using some other more complicated techniques, or other classifiers could be utilized to see whether they perform better in this case.", "In order to prepare the dataset of images to be passed into the neural network, I first tried converting the images into a Pandas Dataframe, with individual pixel values as columns and the images as rows. However, as all the pixel values had to be of type float (scaled down from 0\u2013255 integers to 0\u20131 floats), this resulted in a huge and heavy dataframe (33,486 rows X 40,000 columns). Loading this dataframe into the memory just before training the neural network led to constant \u201cOut of Memory\u201d errors (in spite of using the GPU and 25GB High-RAM runtime types available in Google Colab Pro).", "In order to avoid these errors, I had to adopt another approach which involved creating dataset pipelines using TensorFlow\u2019s in-built .Dataset API. This approach significantly reduced the RAM consumption, because the images are only loaded into the memory in much smaller batch sizes as and when they are needed by the neural network (instead of the entire dataset being held in the memory as in the previous approach). More detailed explanations about this approach can be found in this article.", "After correctly importing the datasets, the next step was to build a basic Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that performed with reasonable accuracy on the given data and with the given number of total parameters. The idea was to get an initial benchmark on the model\u2019s performance, and then incrementally try different techniques to see whether they improve the performance from that point or not. After some back-and-forth experimentation with the CNN architecture, I decided to fix the following architecture to begin with.", "Refer to notebook 4_deep_learning_CNN_modelling.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "I decided to use tf.keras.callbacks.EarlyStopping as a callback while training the CNN model to monitor the validation loss so as to avoid over-fitting and stop the model from training for further epochs if the validation loss started to increase continuously. The images were also converted from RGB coloured to grayscale before fitting into this model. After fitting the model for 30 epochs, the following loss and accuracy scores were obtained.", "The model performance was not that great, but was a good starting point with only slight over-fitting. The normalized confusion matrix also showed that, similar to the traditional ML approach above, even though the accuracy values are somewhat high for the younger age-ranges (of 1\u20132, 3\u20139, 10\u201320 and 21\u201325) and for the older age ranges (of 66\u2013116), there is a presence of significant misclassification for the middle age-ranges of 26\u201365. This may be attributed to the fact that people\u2019s facial appearances (in general) do not change as much during these middle age ranges as they do during the younger and older age ranges. In any case, the next step in this process was to improve the model\u2019s performance using a few different techniques.", "The following two strategies were tried first to improve the model\u2019s performance:", "Refer to notebook 4_5_training_data_augmentation.ipynb for the relevant code for data augmentation of training dataset.", "The same CNN model architecture as above was used to fit the model on RGB coloured images and the augmented training dataset, and the following results were observed:", "The accuracy scores in the table above highlighted two key findings:", "Looking at the evaluations of all the CNN models built above, it was clear that the accuracy scores were not very high (~45% at best). This is, in fact, rather expected, since guessing someone\u2019s age is purely based on appearance, and thus very subjective. Even we as humans struggle with this problem all the time. There are a lot of factors that play a role in how someone looks at their age, such as genetics, living conditions and lifestyle choices (healthy diet, amount of exercise, smoking habit, etc.).", "As we have seen above, even with data augmentation, the accuracy score did not improve significantly. The primary issue was still the fact that there was a presence of significant misclassification for the middle age-ranges of 26\u201365. So, to avoid this problem, I decided to re-distribute the age-ranges into classes again. This time, however, instead of just looking at the available number of images per age-range, I also decided to take into account the human intuition factor (likely age groups that we, as humans, would classify a person into) and the accuracy scores for the individual classes shown in the confusion matrix above.", "Caveat \u2014 The approach detailed above implies that in this project, I manipulated the data science problem itself to better fit the solution I was trying to propose. This may obviously not be an ideal approach in majority of the data science problems in the real-world. However, as mentioned at the beginning, since this project is not specifically aimed at solving a data science problem, the choice of division of age-ranges into classes was quite flexible. Given the fact that there are no major consequences to re-distributing the classes of age-ranges for age detection, I believe this approach was justified in this scenario.", "The age-ranges were re-distributed into the following 7 classes.", "Refer to notebook 4_deep_learning_CNN_modelling.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "The same CNN model architecture as above was used again to fit the model on the training dataset, and the following results were observed:", "The accuracy scores showed a similar degree of over-fit as the first CNN model fit on grayscale images (which is expected), but the accuracy scores themselves were significantly higher. The normalized confusion matrix below also showed that we may have addressed the problem of misclassification for the middle age-ranges of 26\u201365 (at least to some extent if not completely).", "Now that I had explored a few techniques of manipulating the dataset to improve the preformance of the CNN models, I decided to optimize the CNN model architecture itself to enhance the overall performance. The idea here was to design multiple models of different architectures and compare their performances in terms of loss and accuracy values. I decided to use tf.keras.callbacks.TensorBoard as a callback while training the multiple CNN models so as to be able to compare their performances in interactive (and definitely more intuitive) plots. I strongly suggest watching this series of videos to gain a better understanding on how to optimize neural networks using TensorBoard.", "Refer to notebook 4_deep_learning_CNN_modelling.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "Based on the optimization results, after comparing 18 different CNN models with varying architectures of different numbers of Conv2D and Dense layers, the final CNN architecture that was chosen is as shown below.", "So, after understanding the effects of all of the above techniques on the model performance, the final CNN model could now be defined and trained:", "Refer to notebook 5_deep_learning_final_CNN_model.ipynb for the relevant code for this section.", "I decided to use tf.keras.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint as a callback while training the final CNN model so as to be able to save the model as it continues training and improving in performance over 60 epochs. The model peaked in performance at epoch 54 of 60, with loss and accuracy values as follows.", "The accuracy scores improved significantly, although with a slight degree of over-fit, which may still be acceptable. The plot below shows the changes in loss and accuracy scores as the CNN model trained over 60 epochs. The normalized confusion matrix below also shows a significant reduction in the misclassification for the middle age-ranges of 26\u201365.", "As with any data science workflow, the deep learning approach presented above does have its own limitations as well. For instance, the datasets used in this project only had about 33,000 images when combined together. The CNN model could have been trained with a much larger dataset with more variation in the images so as to get even better results. Another approach to this project could be to use transfer learning (using the weights from a pre-trained neural network) instead of creating and training a neural network from scratch.", "Using the traditional machine learning approach in this scenario, though possible, did not yield models with very high accuracy scores. Furthermore, this approach requires a significant amount of domain knowledge and image data processing expertise for substantial features to be extracted from the images for use in the classification models.", "The deep learning and neural networks approach, on the other hand, does not require any significant domain knowledge and image processing expertise, as it does not require any image features to be extracted manually. This approach also yielded much better performing models with higher accuracy scores. Thus, this comparison between the two approaches in this project highlighted the true power and possibilities of deep learning with neural networks, and provided me (and hopefully you too) with a better understanding behind their increasing popularity in the recent years.", "So there you have it! I hope you enjoyed reading about my first adventure with computer vision, and I hope it gave you a better understanding of how to tackle a project of such a nature. Do let me know if you have any questions or any suggestions on how I could have approached this in a better way.", "Also, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
