I explain when and why to use logistic regression, key mathematical theory, and how to interpret model output and coefficient estimates for stakeholders.", "Logistic regression is a transformation of the linear regression model that allows us to probabilistically model binary variables. It is also known as a generalized linear model that uses a logit-link.", "When you want to model binary data: Logistic regression is a go-to model for this use case. It models the probability that an observation takes on one of those two values. (Note: The model only predicts a probability, not class. Your choice of decision threshold depends on use case.)", "When you want class probability predictions: Rather than class predictions alone, as in SVMs. This lets you gauge the confidence of your model in its predictions, and to play around with class decision thresholds.", "When you want an interpretable model: Logistic regression is an ideal candidate model when you need to be able to explain the impact of each predictor. A predictor\u2019s coefficients quantify the impact of each feature on your model\u2019s predictions via the odds ratio.", "When the decision boundary is smooth and linear: Logistic regression draws a smooth, linear decision boundary between two classes. Thus if your classes are linearly separable (you can separate points in n-dimensional space using n - 1 dimensions), logistic regression will perform very well. You can also test for linear separability using a linear support vector machine.", "We use logistic regression because linear regression is not appropriate for modeling binary outcomes. Here are two reasons why:", "This is why logistic regression was developed.", "Let z be any continuous value whose domain is (-\u221e, \u221e). If you plug z into the sigmoid function like", "a nice property of the output is that it is always within 0 and 1.", "Here are some properties of \u03b8(z):", "2. When z is very large, \u03b8 is approximately 1", "3. When z is very small/negative, \u03b8 is approximately 0", "We can use the sigmoid function to convert a continuous, unbounded output z to a decimal number \u03b8 \u2208 (0,1), which is advantageous for representing probabilities.", "To go from a linear regression to a logistic regression, you can substitute the OLS output", "This function reinterprets the OLS output as a probability. The formula above represents the output of a logistic regression model.", "We\u2019ll play around with the equation above by isolating out the y term. With some basic algebra we go from", "We can make a substitution in the definition of the y term from above, giving the following:", "By exponentiating both sides of this equation, we also get the following equation", "The odds ratio specifies is defined as the probability of success as compared to the probability of failure. It is another way to represent probability, and is key to the interpretation of logistic regression coefficients.", "An odds ratio of 1 means that the probability of success is equal to probability of failure. An odds ratio of 2 means that the probability of success is twice the probability of failure. An odds ratio of .5 means that the probability of failure is twice the probability of success.", "The logit is also known as the log of odds. It maps probabilities from (0, 1) to continuous values (-\u221e, \u221e). By doing this, it creates a link between independent variables and the Bernoulli distribution.", "Two key observations on these terms", "Point (2) follows from the algebra below:", "Say we want to increase x_i by 1:", "Then the odds of success increase by a factor of exp(\u03b2_i).", "To reiterate, in logistic regression, a one-unit change in x_i\u200b leads to an exp(\u03b2_i)\u200b change in the odds. Analogously a one-unit change in x_i\u200b leads to a \u03b2_i\u200b change in y in in linear regression.", "The three components to the GLM are:", "In generalized linear model terms, the Y in logistic regression follows a Binomial distribution. In logistic regression, the link function is a logit function, so", "Here, \u03bc represents the mean of the Binomial random variable with one trial \u2014 which is a Bernoulli distribution. Thus \u03bc is simply the probability of success.", "The random component for logistic regression is a Bernoulli random variable. I highly recommend you check this out for more coverage on the GLM concepts.", "A nice to have here is that your data has a balanced number of classes.", "Thanks for reading.
