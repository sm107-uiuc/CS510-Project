You can find out what the community thinks in a live survey.", "Disclaimer: All opinions are mine, they don\u2019t represent my employer\u2019s. I use \u201calgorithm\u201d, \u201cmodel\u201d, and \u201clibrary\u201d interchangeably.", "During a virtual coffee \u2014 the new way of staying in touch during COVID \u2014 with my youngest cousin, who\u2019s completing his Master in Data Science, Shawn asked: \u201cBetween XGBoost and PyTorch, which one should I learn?\u201d", "In fact, I came across the same question frequently even when I work with clients with many years of industry experience.", "On one hand, XGBoost helped to win most of the Kaggle competitions. On the other hand, PyTorch has been recognized as the go-to library by leading tech and research firms. Both libraries are on par based on their build quality and active community support.", "The answer is obviously \u201clearn both\u201d if you have all the time, resources, and mental energy in the world. Most of us don\u2019t have such luxury. In most cases, I\u2019d recommend: start with XGBoost, then PyTorch.", "Let\u2019s look at it from three simple angles: the supply, the demand, and your situation and aspiration.", "By design, XGboost and PyTorch are effective at solving different types of ML use cases.", "XGBoost is very effective for \u201ctraditional\u201d ML use cases using structure data (e.g. classification or regression with good-old tabular data). PyTorch is built specifically for \u201cinnovative\u201d use cases with unstructured data (e.g. Generative Model using images or Natural Language Processing with text) that requires neural network model architecture. The tutorial page of each library reflects such difference and their intended \u201cpositioning\u201d.", "Given the different strengths in XGBoost and PyTorch, we must pick and choose according to the actual ML use cases.", "In the context of learning, I believe a new skill should provide us with maximum immediate applicability (can I use it immediately and frequently?), which usually leads to more career options.", "The \u201cboring\u201d and simple stuff. Based on the latest Kaggle survey (and my own experience working with teams in the industry), most data scientists spend the majority of their time on solving problems using \u201cbasic\u201d ML solutions, such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, or Gradient Boosting. XGBoost excels at these tasks.", "In other words, if you learn and use XGBoost, you can solve most of the boring problems better and faster. Then, with the time saved, you can work on the innovative stuff with PyTorch (or just get a coffee, spend time with families, other stuff you enjoy) \ud83d\ude42", "According to my survey and general observation, most of us are working at Big Corporates as Unsung Heros\u2014 data scientists who focus on non-research, operational business issues.", "In Big Corporates, the most immediate and viable way to add value and get recognition is to make incremental innovation. Many existing ML applications in Big Corporates are the \u201cboring\u201d, but core to businesses, use cases; they are driven by dated and simple algorithms, such as identifying customer propensity with logistic regression with Sklearn (Kaggle survey and author\u2019s industry experience) or flagging fraud activities with custom rule-based engines according to regulation and domain experience.", "Improving these applications with XGBoost can likely provide the most expected return in investment in the shortest time compared to, say, convincing your boss to incorporate customer sentiment with facial recognition using a fancy PyTorch model.", "In summary, if you love operational issues and want to stay and progress in your current roles, learning XGBoost (and similar algorithms like Light GBM) allows you to achieve immediate results and make you a celebrated hero.", "If you are like many of the people in the survey, who want to become a Super Geek and focus on research-oriented projects, still learn XGBoost to maximize career optionality, but invest in PyTorch now.", "Here is a live community survey to capture the thoughts of more people and de-bias my opinion and experience.", "Like What You Read?
