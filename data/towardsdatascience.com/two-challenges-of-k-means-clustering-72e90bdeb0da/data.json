The similarity of two points is determined by the distance between them. In this post, I will cover two very critical points to keep mind when using k-means clustering. If you are not familiar with k-means clustering, you may want to read a thorough explanation of k-means algorithm first.", "There are two challenges that need to handled wisely in order to get the most out of the k-means clustering algorithm:", "We need to declare the number of clusters before running k-means clustering algorithm. It is not capable of determining the optimum number of clusters. K-means partitions the data set into the number of clusters determined by us beforehand. Finding the optimum number of clusters is also a challenging task for us. We can\u2019t just look at the data set and find out how many partitions we should have.", "K-means clustering tries to minimize distances within clusters. This distances are defined as within cluster sum of distances (WCSS).", "Let\u2019s see how WCSS changes with a different number of clusters. Assume we have the following very simple data set:", "Let\u2019s be non-realistic and have one cluster:", "If we have one cluster, the centroid will be the red square. WCSS is calculated as:", "The sum of squared distances between each data point and the mean (red square). As the number of clusters increases, the average distance between data points and centroids decreases and thus WCSS decreases.", "Let\u2019s see the case with two clusters:", "As you can see the average distance between data points and centroids decreased. Please keep in mind that the number of distances are independent of the number of clusters. No matter how many clusters exist, we will calculate n distances where n is the number of data points. Therefore, we can only focus on the average distance.", "WCSS further decreases with 3 clusters:", "Until have, we have seen WCSS of 1,2 and 3 clusters which are calculated as:", "How much further WCSS keeps decreasing? Well, it will eventually be zero. The highest number of clusters we can have is equal to the number of data points. Although not useful, we can have a separate cluster for each data point. Then the distance between a data point and its centroid becomes zero because the centroid of the data point is itself.", "So why not have a cluster for each data point and make WCSS zero? Because, in that case, we will have a bigger problem which is overfitting. After some point, we will gain just a little in terms of WCSS by increasing the number of clusters. The graph below represents how WCSS changes as the number of clusters increases.", "As you can see, after a certain point, WCSS does not decrease much. We should look for that sharp edge where the slope changed dramatically. That edge marked by red square is our optimum number of clusters.", "If we choose k greater than that point, WCSS still decreases but it is not worth the risk of overfitting.", "K-means is an iterative process. It is built on expectation-maximization algorithm. After the number of clusters is determined, it works by executing the following steps:", "We are now focusing on the first step. Depending on the underlying structure of the data set, different initial centroids may end up forming different clusters. In addition to that, selecting the centroids purely random may increase the running time so it takes more for the algorithm to converge.", "Instead of selecting the initial centroids in a purely random manner, we may want to look for a smart way. That smart way is k-means++.", "K-means++ ensures a smarter way to initialize clusters. As stated on wikipedia,", "k-means++ is an algorithm for choosing the initial values (or \u201cseeds\u201d) for the k-means clustering algorithm.", "The difference between k-means and k-means++ is only selecting the initial centroids. The remaining steps are exactly the same. K-means++ chooses the first centroid uniformly at random from the data points in the dataset. Each following centroid is chosen from the remaining data points with probability proportional to its squared distance from the point\u2019s closest existing centroids.", "Fortunately, k-means++ is implemented in scikit-learn. It is specified by \u201cinit\u201d parameter of sklearn.cluster.KMeans. The default value is k-means++. The other option of init parameter is \u201crandom\u201d which initializes centroids randomly.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
