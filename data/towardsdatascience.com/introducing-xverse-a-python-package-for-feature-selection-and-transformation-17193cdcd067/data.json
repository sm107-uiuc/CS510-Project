Before we talk about the details of the package, let us understand why we need one.", "I came across this image and I felt there is no better way to explain this project. As funny as it sounds, it happens in most of the data science life cycle. 80% of the time spent by Data Scientists lies in dealing with features (X), and therefore the name XuniVerse a.k.a \u201cxverse\u201d.", "In addition, the entire project is based on the works that I published in Medium in 2018. Based on the feedback I got from readers, I wanted to improve the functionalities of the code. Instead of releasing it as an updated functionality, I thought it would be better to release it as a python package. Well, that is how \u201cxverse\u201d is born.", "The articles shown here below are now part of this package.", "\u201cWeight of evidence (WOE) and Information value (IV) are simple, yet powerful techniques to perform variable transformation and selection. These concepts have huge connection with the logistic regression modeling technique. It is widely used in credit scoring to measure the separation of good vs bad customers.\u201d", "\u201cThe idea is to apply a variety of techniques to select variables. When an algorithm picks a variable, we give a vote for the variable. At the end, we calculate the total votes for each variables and then pick the best ones based on votes. This way, we end up picking the best variables with minimum effort in the variable selection process.\u201d", "The dataset used for all the examples shown below is present in the \u201cdata\u201d folder. In addition, you can refer to the Jupyter notebook code \u201cXverse.ipynb\u201d present in this link.", "Monotonic Binning is a data preparation technique widely used in scorecard development. It tries to convert numerical variable to categorical variable by creating bins which have a monotonic relationship with the target. The example given below will demonstrate how it works.", "The feature \u2018balance\u2019 shown above ranges from $-3,313.001 to $71,188. We can all agree that this is a very wide range. If we have to bin this variable based on domain knowledge, then we don\u2019t have to worry about a monotonic relationship. However, when no prior knowledge exists, then it is hard to determine the bin categories. This is an ideal situation where monotonic binning could help.", "It starts with 20 bins (default, which you can change any time) and then reduces bins until it finds a monotonic relationship (either increasing or decreasing) between X variable and target y. If it did not establish a monotonic relationship, then it forces to create bins on X variable using the force_bins option. All this time, it uses spearman correlation to verify if there is a monotonic relationship exists between X and y variable.", "Here X represents the features dataset which is a Pandas dataframe and y is a numpy array of target column. We can also use the precomputed monotonic bins to apply on new datasets as shown below.", "The WOE package is available in the transformer function. The advantages of WOE transformation are", "The formula to calculate WOE and IV is provided below.", "To select features, please use the rule below", "And to transform variable X based on WOE bins calculated before, use the code below.", "Bivariate distributions help us explore relationship between X and y variables. This option is available in \u201cxverse\u201d as well.", "To make bivariate charts, we need the \u201cwoe_df\u201d dataset generated from the WOE option shown above.", "Variable selection is one of the key process in predictive modeling process. It is an art. To put in simple terms, variable selection is like picking a soccer team to win the World cup. You need to have the best player in each position and you don\u2019t want two or many players who plays the same position.", "In python, we have different techniques to select variables. Some of them include Recursive feature elimination, Tree-based selection and L1 based feature selection.", "The idea here is to apply a variety of techniques to select variables. When an algorithm picks a variable, we give a vote for the variable. In the end, we calculate the total votes for each variable and then pick the best ones based on votes. This way, we end up picking the best variables with minimum effort in the variable selection process.", "Now, let\u2019s look at the feature importance using the code below.", "Finally, one important thing about \u201cXverse\u201d is the pipeline functionality. We can add all the steps as part of the pipeline and make our lives much easier.", "Here is a code shown below that shows the pipeline feature.", "Finally, to get the transformation on a new dataset,", "XuniVerse is under active development, if you\u2019d like to be involved, we\u2019d love to have you.
