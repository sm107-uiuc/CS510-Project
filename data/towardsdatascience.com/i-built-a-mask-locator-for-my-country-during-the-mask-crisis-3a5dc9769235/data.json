I hear complaints from my community pharmacist friends regarding the angry customers and they are helpless because they don\u2019t have the stock or the stocks are still in shipping from the manufacturer.", "As a pharmacist and a data science student, I and my friends had decided to do something to help my country people to find their PPE (mask and sanitizer) and my peer's pharmacist and with the collaboration with Malaysia Pharmacist Society, this leads to the creation of https://wheremymask.com, a mask/sanitizer locator that reflects the stock availability of pharmacy in Malaysia.", "Our team is built-up of 4 people, here a brief intro to each of us:", "Mainly Zariman and Imran are responsible for maintaining the server and enhancement of the website while data collection is done by me and Tzi Shan", "By identifying the problems above, we set up a website, https://wheremymask.com which is easy to remember for the public to access and type. The website was set up in 1 day time because I directly converted directly from my portfolio website.", "The first page is an embedded google MyMap which we updated manually by categorizing the availability by color:", "The reason we use google my map is that we learned from the lesson of a Taiwanese engineer that he used almost 3,000 USD using google map API due to large usage. Google MyMap fit into the scenario where it is free and easily updated, one of our achievement is that our use case of Google MyMap is followed by a few organization which needed a geolocation service to their audience during the lockdown.", "A side story is this Google MyMap was a losing innovative project of Tzi Shan in the year 2019 where he used it to record down the location of community pharmacy in Malaysia. It becomes handy in our situation", "The second page is the live update page where the latest update of stock availability is posted live by our team or the pharmacist via our Drupal backend. The card consist of the time posted, pharmacy information such as phone call and address, and the message from the pharmacy such as limitation each person.", "We implemented a voting system for the public similar to Waze to use the power of collaboration to reflect the rightfulness of the data. For example, a high upvote might indicate the stocks are still available and the news is true, a high down vote or increasing down vote might indicate the stocks already finish. This system is powered by a firebase real-time database.", "The tricky part comes after the system implementation, how we search for data to reflect the real-time stock availability? We had implemented multiple source strategies and thanks to some data science knowledge I had learned in my first semester, it makes my life easier to search for the data:", "After we get the data, we will key in into the update form manually and update the map every night. It took us around 1\u20132 hours each day to update the status.", "At first, we just promote the page in the major Facebook group where people are asking for mask location, we just paste the link in the comments and ask people to use it.", "Later, thanks to the Facebook health page \u2014 Public Health Malaysia for promoting it, the traffic gets a boost and we are well known among Malaysians in a short time. After a while, the website is introduced by major media in Malaysia. Below is the statistic of the website for the period of 1st Feb 2020 to 1st April 2020.", "Note: The website is officially retired after the 1st of April because the stocks of mask and sanitizer were replenished. It had served its purpose.", "We pharmacists in Malaysia are the first few who recognize the importance of masks in the COVID case despite the government (and WHO) not recognizing them during the early days of COVID. Despite the lack of support of the government in this initiative, we got lots of support from NGOs and our peers during that period.", "I had learned a few lessons from doing this project, which are:", "I could develop a better website with more features and waiting for more data before I publish the website, but I had chosen to publish and promote it within 1 day of time because I feel that it is an urge to publish it at the time. Bugs and features can be fixed after publication.", "For example, wheremymask.com is converted from my portfolio website, the google MyMap is a product of an innovative project by Tzi Shan. This initiative can\u2019t be done in 1 day without the fundamentals of the previous project.", "We had achieved more than 1 million views in our community pharmacy maps while I still remember that in the competition the judges don\u2019t appreciate this initiative, our number had proven them wrong.", "A piece of knowledge is not valuable when you do not use it, I know wheremymask.com is not the best solution but it is the only thing I can contribute with my knowledge at the time.", "Lastly, I would like to express my gratitude toward my teammate, my friends who supported this initiative by promoting it, giving me data, and even motivate me during the hard time of updating the information, and Esyms Sdn Bhd who support the server hosting fees.", "Note: We do not profit a single cent, we also do not ask for any donations.", "Thank you for reading, your time is much appreciated.", "Your home for data science.
