Oftentimes, they ended with some extremely spot-on model with near-perfect accuracy. I\u2019ll admit, it is very exciting and a great opportunity to understand how these models work, but to use these models in the real world is asking for trouble.", "To understand why these models are so inaccurate in the market, I\u2019ll first explain why and then dive into some LSTM TensorFlow models with Python to further explain my reasoning.", "In order to answer this question, let\u2019s start with the basics. The stock market is essentially a marketplace for investors, driven by supply and demand. However seemingly simple it may sound, there are literally an infinite amount of factors that come into play. This is precisely why almost every source imaginable shows that buy and hold strategies are far more time-efficient and lucrative than trying to time or predict the market.", "Now, with this being said, you can technically create a model that factors in all the known factors that have moved the markets before. However, the vast majority of market factors are literally impossible to know beforehand such as natural disasters, pandemics, and political moves. Oh, and also, the market sometimes acts on pure irrationality so good luck trying to keep up with that.", "But see, even if you were able to successfully predict or time the market with high accuracy, other people would be also able to mimic your strategy which would eventually cause the market to react in such a way that was different than your prediction. That might be a little confusing so I\u2019ll break it down here.", "Let\u2019s say you possess a model that predicts the stock price of XYZ company in the future, so what do you do with the knowledge? You would most probably try to use it to make a large amount of profit, prompting you to create an unlimited amount of buy and sell signals in the actual market. And so would all the others who have access to this model. What is the result of all this trading? It would affect XYZ stock\u2019s price in a fashion in which your model would not be able to predict, whether it happens to skyrocket or tumble; so essentially the paradox here is that by even using the model\u2019s prediction, you are directly influencing the future, making the predictions obsolete in one way or another.", "There are chances that you can predict or rather forecast some trends of the market to get a higher chance of success in the market as this is essentially what market researchers and analysts do but these forecasts are closer to educated guesses than 99% accurate precise predictions. Moreover, the confidence interval of how the market will change in the future is far too wide to even make concise predictions.", "While it is unwise to use such a model in the markets, creating a Machine Learning model is a great way to learn and familiarize yourself with how models work and what they are potentially capable of. Follow along the rest of the article to not only create a neural network to \u201cpredict\u201d TSLA\u2019s prices but to understand where it\u2019s drawbacks are.", "First off, you need to import the dependencies and set the parameters we will need for the rest of the program. We will be using TensorFlow for the LSTM Model and Scikit-Learn to test its accuracy.", "First, we must read in the data from Yahoo Finance using pandas_datareader. Next, in order for the LSTM Model to work, the data must be preprocessed in the right manner. We can use MinMaxScaler from Scikit-Learn and the module NumPy for this. We must also create x_train and y_train lists of data to send to the model in the next section.", "Here, we must build, compile, and train the LSTM Model in order to get the final predictions. Fortunately, TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn make this ridiculously easy for us. After the model is generated, we can test it on the test data to receive our final predictions to see how accurate it is. For this specific model, I set the epochs to 5 but you can change this to see how it affects the model\u2019s output.", "Now here\u2019s the fun part. We successfully used the LSTM Model to \u201cpredict\u201d stock prices and can finally find our accuracy. In this section of the code, we plotted the training data, the test data, and the predictions as well as received a bunch of other metrics such as the accuracy on predicting day-to-day movements, the predicted price for the next trading day, and both the root mean squared error and the testing mean squared error of the model.", "At first look, the model seems incredibly good. It even predicted the unprecedented Great Coronavirus Crash of 2020!", "But then you scroll in further to see the model was simply trailing the close price of the last day as it has decided simply following the close price from yesterday is the \u201cgreatest\u201d way to predict the price of tomorrow.", "You can confirm this if you look back at the statistics we found earlier (I included a screenshot down below). The accuracy of predicting day-to-day movements was 48.19% which is even less than flipping a coin!!", "Moral of the story: predict the stock market as much as you want but just don\u2019t ever use it in real life. Thank you so much for reading and I hope you enjoyed!", "Disclaimer: The material in this article is purely educational and should not be taken as professional investment advice.
