Specifically, there are probably countless campaign possibilities (by combining different prices, products, durations, content, and more) from which Starbucks\u2019 data scientists would have to identify the best-performing ones.", "The purpose of this analysis is to better understand the relationships between user demographics and campaigns to maximize revenue growth. \ud83d\udd0e", "The objective of the analysis is to identify the key relationships between offers and demographic segments. There are a total of 10 offers, as shown below:", "In order to narrow down which promotions are relevant to each segment, we\u2019re performing a heuristical & regressional analysis on the relationships between the 10 promotions and our identified segments.", "The first step to any data analysis is to check the quality of the dataset and pre-process to address issues that may muddle the analysis.", "Based on the data exploration, the biggest oddity was the unusually high volume of users with age indicated \u201c118\u201d. Coincidentally, these were also users who didn\u2019t have indicated income values. My guess is that these are users for whom we have missing data for age & income. Thus, these would only be helpful when considering the effects of \u201cgender\u201d on purchase behavior.", "Since our segmentation will consider age & income (in addition to gender), I shall exclude these users from this analysis. After verifying observing the size & distribution of the dataset, the most appropriate way to segment seems to be by age group and gender. Though technically we could segment things further (e.g. by income, by join date), this will likely be enough to get a decent understanding of the relationships.", "In addition, there were also several data pre-processing steps to ensure the dataset was ready for analysis, including:", "In order to determine the responsiveness to each of the 10 offers for each segment, we need to observe the # of offer completions associated with viewed offers. Specifically, this excludes offer completions associated with offers that weren\u2019t seen by the user (i.e. they were going to spend that much $ anyway).", "For promotional offers (i.e. nothing to \u201ccomplete\u201d), I distinguished by users who \u201cviewed\u201d the offer \u2014 in order to observe the impact of the promotion.", "From the above, there are a few key observations:", "Essentially, the highest response rates seem to be associated with offers delivered through social channels, particularly to female segments.", "As promotion responsiveness is only part of the overall story, we need to better understand the financial implications for each segment. In order to assess the financial metrics, a regression analysis was required.", "From the candidate models considered, the most appropriate one seems to be a 2nd-degree polynomial, due to its relatively high training & testing scores:", "Using the 2nd-degree polynomial regression, I determined the offers with the highest expected spend for each segment:", "Furthermore, I honed in on the top offers for each segment:", "There are a few key takeaways from these results:", "Collectively, this has revealed high-potential offers (#4) that may be underperforming due to its delivery channels and offers & segments to focus on (for A/B testing, etc.).", "This analysis has revealed a handful of key insights that will be very helpful in narrowing down future analyses and overall promotion strategy.", "With the current offer mix, the best promotion strategy seems to be offers 0 & 1 for females with high income (especially \u201cMillenials\u201d and \u201cSilent Generation\u201d), as they have higher true offer completion rates while also having relatively high expected spending.", "However, there are a few outstanding experiments & analyses to be done before settling on a strong promotion strategy.
