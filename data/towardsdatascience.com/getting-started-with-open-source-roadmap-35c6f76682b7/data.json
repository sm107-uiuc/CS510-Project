Another benefit is, if you contribute to open-source often, you will become well known in the community, so, in a sense, you will be a technology influencer.", "Well, anyone!

If you\u2019re willing to put in the time, there are no requirements to start building software.", "The first thing you need to check before you jump into open-source is your basic programming knowledge. This is the foundation you will need to start building projects.

But it is also the most fulfilling step. Once you are comfortable with Git and the programming language you want to use, you contributed using the non-coding contribution to a project. You\u2019re ready for your first code contribution.", "Start with a simple feature or bug, maybe something that is not urgent. Take your time, double-check your code, and test well.
