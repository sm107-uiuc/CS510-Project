Powerful deep machine-learning algorithms increasingly predict what movies we want to watch, which ads we\u2019ll respond to, how eligible we are for a loan, and how likely we are to commit a crime or perform well on the job.\u00b9 AI is also revolutionizing the automation of physical systems such as factories, power plants, and self-driving cars, and the pace of deployment is rapidly increasing. However, the recent fatal failures of auto-pilot systems built by Tesla, Uber, and Boeing highlight the risks associated with relying on opaque and highly complex software in dangerous situations.\u00b2 Mitigating the dangers posed by such systems is an area of active research called resilience engineering, but the rapid adoption of AI, coupled with its notorious lack of algorithmic transparency, makes it difficult for the research to keep pace.", "One of the pioneers of machine-learning, Professor Thomas Dietterich, has spent the last several years investigating how artificial intelligence can be made more robust, especially when it's embedded in a complex socio-technical system where the combination of human and software errors can propagate into untested regimes. Paul Scharre\u2019s recent book, \u201cAn Army of None\u201d, inspired Prof. Dietterich to look deeper into the literature of high-reliability organizations for potential solutions. \u201cIt drove home to me the sense that it\u2019s not enough to make the technology reliable, you need to make the entire human organization that surrounds it reliable also; understanding what that means has been taking up a lot of my time.\u201d Prof. Dietterich spared some of that time to discuss with me his thoughts on AI ethics, AI safety, and his recent article Robust artificial intelligence and robust human organizations.", "The ethical AI community is often split into two groups, with engineers on one side focusing on specific notions of fairness or algorithmic transparency and social scientists on the other who are more interested in the ethical implications for society as a whole. Your recent article seems to fall somewhere in between these groups.", "There\u2019s been an awakening within the AI community to the importance of social science in general. I really trace it to when social media came onto the scene, and people realized that social scientists could use it to study things about people. However, they needed computer scientists\u2019 help to process the immense amount of data coming out of social media, so we started seeing the rise of computational social science. That was the initial opening.", "Then people started thinking of the question of influence and the spread of ideas in social networks, and maximizing influence in social networks for advertising purposes, leading again to more contact with social scientists and economists. Then there was a realization that there could be biases that are causing harm to different sub-communities through the way these systems are working. I just got back from the AIES conference that had their second meeting, and nearly simultaneously there was the FAT* conference, and I think that huge chunks of the field are waking up to the fact that we need to be thinking about the broader socio-technical systems and not just the technical part. It\u2019s manifesting itself in all of these different facets, and I\u2019m pursuing one particular facet because I\u2019m concerned with these high-risk, high-stakes decisions. I\u2019m also involved right now as part of the team that\u2019s putting together this 20-year roadmap for AI research that being coordinated by the CCC (the Computing Community Consortium). We\u2019ve had three workshops, and people are saying that we can do X, Y, and Z, like getting computers to track people in meetings or in buildings and to understand their emotions. Twenty years ago people would have said: \u201cthat\u2019s so cool\u201d. Now everyone is saying, \u201cbut that could be abused so badly\u201d, so we\u2019ve really been sensitized to all the downsides of these things. Now we realize that so many of the technological improvements that we want to see in the next 20 years can have horrible consequences as well as really good ones, so it\u2019s quite sobering.", "Do you feel that regulations are needed to avert these consequences, or can companies effectively self-regulate?", "I\u2019m not an expert on law vs. regulation vs. industry practices, but it seems to me that we are seeing poor use of technology and inappropriate organizational [structures] surrounding the technology. Let\u2019s focus on facial recognition for a moment. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve been following the work of Joy Buolamwini at MIT, but I think she\u2019s been doing very interesting work auditing the quality of these [commercial] face recognition systems. We don\u2019t have any standards on the technical side for what claims a company should make for these systems and how they should make them. For example, I think that all of these corporate systems, if they are going to sell these products, need to give well-calibrated probabilities for the output statements that they\u2019re making. It looks like some of these systems don\u2019t give you a confidence value, and the ones that do don\u2019t tell you what it means. A probability would be well calibrated if, when it said that [there\u2019s] a 90% chance that these two pictures are pictures of the same person, then it would be right 90% of the time when it said that. That would be 90% over some [particular] population. Her [Buolamwini\u2019s] experiments have shown that there are subpopulations where the number would have to be something like 60% because the systems just don\u2019t perform very well on some subpopulations.", "The ACLU did an experiment like that, but it wasn\u2019t clear how they set their thresholds. As I describe in the paper, you would expect in a policing situation where you wanted to catch all of the bad guys, you would have to set the sensitivity of the detection very high and you would get a huge number of false alarms. Indeed, that is what we see on the South Wales policing numbers, and that would be very consistent with my experience in fraud detection or cybersecurity. Here you have a similar problem, where the main challenge is the vast number of false alarms. My point is, even if you are a very knowledgeable user of these tools, and it seems that most police departments don\u2019t qualify as that, even if you have a Ph.D. in machine learning, it\u2019s not obvious how you should set the thresholds on these systems in practice, and what are the best practices on how they should be applied.", "Then you have to do some kind of analysis of the harms that false alarms create. This is where you need to audit the human organization as well as the software. If you are a police department and you have turned it up to 99% and are getting a huge number of false alarms, it\u2019s not just about how many people are getting pulled in due to the false alarms. You can imagine that there are people repeatedly false alarming on these systems, so it\u2019s not a random tax spread evenly across the population. Some fraction of the time you\u2019re randomly selected, but it may also always happen to you! Somehow you\u2019d like to audit these organizations and say: what is your false alarm rate and what harms are resulting from that, how do you reduce those harms, what is an acceptable level, and who is bearing the burden?", "It seems that what you\u2019re proposing would be simple black-box style testing that can be done without infringing on a vendor\u2019s IP?", "You would need to say over what database of images was this collected. It\u2019s not appropriate to market it as a one-size-fits-all application, so you really need to customize it for each application. I\u2019m very skeptical that these things that are currently being marketed are really going to work well in practice for their intended purpose because they are not being customized on a per-application basis. I don\u2019t know if you need regulation, or whether we just need to educate the market. It would seem wise to me on the part of the vendors to get out in front of this issue and do it right.", "Large organizations like Google are beginning to employ professional ethicists to investigate the potential risks of AI; do you have any advice for smaller teams without extensive resources to offset risk?", "I feel like we don\u2019t have the standardized tools for supporting a lot of this now. The R&D community needs to be building tools to support this.", "Some tools exist, such as IBM\u2019s \u201cFairness 360\u201d, but a larger issue is whether someone is looking at the implications of the systems, such as what could possibly go wrong and who it could affect. Those are areas where smaller teams with fewer resources might struggle to gain access to that kind of broader thinking.", "It needs to be part of our standard methodology. Maybe we need to develop some kind of conceptual analytical framework that people can go through, like a checklist, to think about the broader context of the system that they\u2019re marketing. For instance, we can ask the simple question: \u2018what happens with the repeated use of this system?\u2019. The way we typically formulate our problems, we focus on the single step use of it. There is the case of YouTube video recommendations, which in machine-learning we would formulate as a contextual multi-armed bandit problem.\u00b3 Over time, the system will recommend progressively more and more extreme videos, so you can start out searching for halal dishes and end up watching Jihadist recruiting videos! It may not have occurred to the people building the system to look at the iterative effect. So that seems to be something that we should be teaching everyone to think about.", "In your paper, you mention the possibility of AI monitoring the human organization. Does AI currently have the ability to recognize problems in human institutions?", "This is more of a research question. I\u2019ve been involved in trying to survey who is working in this space right now. I would say, right now, there is little ability to monitor the functioning of teams in human organizations. It\u2019s a case where it would be great to monitor for team breakdown, but this could be easily misused by management, so exactly how to do this is unclear to me. One scenario would be to help with team training, or during limited periods of time. David Woods at Ohio State works on how to make teams resilient, and he is doing studies of the dev-ops people that keep the big cloud computing servers up under extreme conditions. I think we need more research in this area, and I\u2019m advocating for the NSF and DoD to invest more in the study of doing teamwork better. This is a natural next step.", "Are we talking about real-time monitoring of human teamwork?", "It\u2019s currently more focused on the training situation. However, you can see where I\u2019m going in terms of worrying about autonomous weapons systems, which is probably the highest risk application we might contemplate for AI. We would want to have tremendous focus on the functioning of teams, and you would want extreme monitoring of those teams because the system is only as reliable as its weakest link. That might not be the software, it might be the human organization.", "[1]: I\u2019m using machine-learning (ML) interchangeably with AI, though ML is only one technique used to realize AI.", "[2]: Note that the Boeing 737 MAX crashes were likely due to a non-redundant sensor failure which confused the autopilot system.", "[3]: See here for a description of the multi-armed bandit problem.", "|
