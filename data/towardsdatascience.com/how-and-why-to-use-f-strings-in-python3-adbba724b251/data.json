Suppose you have some variables, and you want to print them within a statement.", "You can do this in various ways:", "a) Concatenate: A very naive way to do is to simply use + for concatenation within the print function. But that is clumsy. We would need to convert our numeric variables to string and keep care of the spaces while concatenating. And it doesn\u2019t look good as the code readability suffers a little when we use it.", "b) % Format: The second option is to use % formatting. But it also has its problems. For one, it is not readable. You would need to look at the first %s and try to find the corresponding variable in the list at the end. And imagine if you have a long list of variables that you may want to print.", "c) str.format(): Next comes the way that has been used in most Python 3 codes and has become the standard of printing in Python. Using str.format()", "Here we use {} to denote the placeholder of the object in the list. It still has the same problem of readability, but we can also use str.format :", "If this seems a little too repetitive, we can use dictionaries too:", "Since Python 3.6, we have a new formatting option, which makes it even more trivial. We could simply use:", "We just append f at the start of the string and use {} to include our variable name, and we get the required results.", "An added functionality that f string provides is that we can put expressions in the {} brackets. For Example:", "This is quite useful as you can use any sort of expression inside these brackets. The expression can contain dictionaries or functions. A simple example:", "Also, you can use \u2019\u2019\u2019 to use multiline strings.", "An everyday use case while formatting strings is to format floats. You can do that using f string as following", "Until recently, I had been using Python 2 for all my work, and so was not able to check out this new feature.", "But now, as I am shifting to Python 3, f strings has become my go-to syntax to format strings. It is easy to write and read with the ability to incorporate arbitrary expressions as well. In a way, this new function adheres to at least 3 PEP concepts \u2014", "Beautiful is better than ugly, Simple is better than complex and Readability counts.", "If you want to learn more about Python 3, I would like to call out an excellent course on Learn Intermediate level Python from the University of Michigan.
