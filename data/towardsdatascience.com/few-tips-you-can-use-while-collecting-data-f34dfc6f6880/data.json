I will share a summary in a later post. The first day was so frustrating as my codes kept failing or I didn\u2019t get the expected result. The resolution of the issues encountered during my task was due to a couple of small fixes. I will share four with you in the following paragraphs.", "It is important to stay organized while collecting data. That helps find out easily where your mistakes are. Writing one block of code wouldn\u2019t help. I propose two habits to develop: keep the codes commented and write codes on a notebook (I use Jupyter Notebook and barely go to other IDE for coding in Python)Writing comments as you code is a way of keeping track of your deliverables. Imagine getting back to your old scripts 2 years from now and can\u2019t remember what an older you were trying to achieve. Clear comments can be really helpful. Also, we are coding for other data scientists (Remember, Python is a \u2018free\u2019 programming language). By annotating our codes, we make it easy for our peers.The opinions regarding Jupyter Notebook diverge, some data scientist doesn\u2019t like it and prefer using other IDE. Your call. At the end of the day, it will be preferable to review and execute shorter codes than long ones. The main advantage that I found while using Jupyter is the fact that I can have several scripts instead of a whole block. I can print my variables; check the description of my Dataframes or find the length of my list easily. Commenting every small block of codes saves a lot of time while checking for errors or when debugging. Also keeping the scripts that execute a specific task under the same area holds my Jupyter notebook clean and neat.", "Functions are a great way to avoid repetition and be more effective. In my case, once I knew that my functions worked, I was confident to use it at different phases of my data collection process. I didn\u2019t have to write the steps again and stayed away from mistakes. For example, I had to scrape different part of the same website or go to different pages to collect some data. The structure of my data collection in that case didn\u2019t really change. I had to identify the task that I will have to perform several times and use a function to make it easier for me.", "During my first attempt at scraping some data, my scripts failed after a couple of minutes. I lost everything that was scrapped so far as I was only appending a list with the data collected. BIG MISTAKE. Imagine what would be my frustration if it was 2 or 3 hours of data collection gone.", "An easy fix that I had to go through was saving each new set of data as I was getting it. Inside a \u2018for loop\u2019 I was pickling\u2026 Pickle and Json were so useful for that matter. The main advantage with pickle is that you can save anything: list, Pandas Dataframes, dictionaries as a \u2018pickle\u2019 and use the saved items in the initial data types later on. Json format will only require that you go through it later to get the data.", "Let me share one of the scripts that I used in my recent project. To put it into perspective, I was collecting songs features from Spotify. I had an initial combination of songs/artist in a list that I used for the API call. For what additional reasons should I save the songs features as I was getting them? First of all, a combination of songs/artist might not be found on Spotify. That can lead to an error and end the request. Secondly, the request might be timed-out. It became important to save any data collected so far. If I encountered any issue I would know from where to take it.", "One of the best fixes that I had to resort to during my data gathering journey was to handle errors with \u2018Python try\u2026 except\u2019. The idea is to ask Python to evaluate the codes, handle the errors based on some conditions and execute the codes based on the evaluation and the handling of the errors. The three steps of the \u2018try\u2026 excepts\u2019 are realized with :", "Thetry block which tests a block of code for errors; the except block handles the error and the finally block for executing the code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks. When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message. These exceptions can be handled using the \u2018try\u2019 statement.", "How did I use exception during my data collection process? Basically, instead of waiting for the errors to break my codes, I asked Python to catch the errors and continue gathering the data even if the requested song was not found.", "There are different ways to approach similar issues while collecting data with Python. I shared the ones that were relevant and really helpful in my case. Should you have any other tips, feel free to share with me in the comments or connect with me on LinkedIn or Twitter and we can discuss.", "Your home for data science.
