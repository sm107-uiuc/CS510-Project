I WILL SHOOT IF I HAVE TOO!\u201d Every muscle in your heart tenses and your mind is gushed with a wave of adrenaline. Abiding by your own ambiguous \u2014 yet definitively confident \u2014 survival instincts, you drop to the ground. A group of officers surround you, encaging you into an inescapable circle off dangling handcuffs, handguns, tasers, and clubs. As you sit upwards, hands bound by handcuffs, attempting to self-recover, the lead deputy shoves you to the gravel-laced pavement without forethought and roars:", "\u201cSTAY ON THE GROUND! YOU ARE RESISTING AN ARREST!\u201d", "You look into the slanted, empathic eyes of bystanders knowingly avoiding the incident with headphones and cameras equipped in the palm of their hands. Finally, you recognize the array of police body cameras clipped onto the vests of the Chicago P.D. officers and reassure yourself: \u201cOkay, calm down\u2026 There\u2019s objective, definitive, irrefutable evidence that the lack of probable cause and excessive violence was caught on tape.\u201d As your bruised neck, elbows, and wrists lay on the pavement like a twisted ragdoll, you attempt recollecting the origin and story of your situation. You\u2019re a 26-year old black man, immersed in the low-income swaths of Chicago\u2019s inner-city district, sauntering back to your apartment at 6:00 PM only until a pair of police come charging at you with authoritative yells of, \u201cStop and freeze! I will shoot if I have to!\u201d For the previous six years of living and trudging your way through Chicago\u2019s inner-city districts, you\u2019ve heard the same words echoed across degraded alleyways, hidden drug deal hotspots, and sketchy downtown apartments. However, this time they were directed at you.", "Don\u2019t panic when I tell you this \u2014 you\u2019ve been racially profiled. Wait a second\u2026 The swarm of police body cameras and nearby pedestrians Tweeting fragmented clips of the incident in real-time should be enough to liberate you and condemn these officers, right? Unfortunately, hundreds to thousands of cumulative and systemically racial-motivated police brutality incidences have been shoved into the black box process of law enforcement investigation. In other words, the files upon files of videographic evidence that are submitted for review are subjectively enforced by the police department themselves, with a massive pool of cross-interfering biases that obstruct the process of investigation (e.g. local politics/party associations, self-interests of the law enforcement agency, and the individual biases of the lead videographic investigators).", "Although we could argue that objective moral and ethical criteria exist, even in a politically stratified and polarized landscape such as the United States, there are always impeding human biases, conditions, and natures that violate these standards. More importantly, however, the demographic of police brutality victims are oftentimes left with post-trauma, regardless of whether justice, cross-examination, and law enforcement investigation was fulfilled. Although police departments have nationalized and deployed vested body cameras and training efforts for racial profiling and precautionary excess violence, no technologies exist that monitor police brutality incidences in real-time. Further, very little automated or semi-automated tools co-exist with body cameras that can objectively parse and identify the sentiment and bias on corresponding audio recordings.", "The emergence of mobile-scaled, low-memory Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) implementations have paved the way for the semi-supervised and unsupervised extraction of visual-textual meaning from large partitions of data in the previous decade. In other words, the adaptation of both visual algorithms (supervised/semi-supervised CNN models) and language recognition/sequential algorithms (RNNs and LSTM networks) for tasks including real-time audio-speech recognition, human activity recognition, and the semantic extraction of intent and sentiment from strings of text has allowed researchers to deduce and analyze objective and novel patterns in large language and vision datasets with little computing power. Although NLP and Computer Vision research tasks are frequently associated with computational biology, biomedical diagnostics, and an et cetera of corporate applications, deep learning has yet to tap into the biggest monster of them all \u2014 human injustices. According to the 2017 Police Violence Report, in any given or pre-selected year, nearly 4,224 people are killed by police brutality in Brazil, 1147 in the United States, and 11 in Germany. Even more racial and socioeconomic disparities exist on a state-by-state level (which you can research on your own).", "In the United States, police brutality incidents have transpired as racially charged incidences that are devoid of consistent probable cause, frequently climaxing in unresolved cases of excessive violence. Although police body cameras are under the purview of internal investigators, there are negligible frameworks that can objectively analyze speech and video data caught on body cameras. However, the use of real-time deep learning language and vision models could prove critical for the monitoring of police brutality both during and after the given incidents. Whether it\u2019s the use of Deep feed-forward networks (DNNs) to understand and predict the onset of aggressive physical behavior, or the integration of real-time sentiment analysis algorithms to classify violent speech, Deep Learning (DL) could transform how we bring justice to the global crisis of police brutality.", "The rise of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) architectures have provided researchers with a multi-parameterized lens to classify simple visual behavior (e.g. walking, running, opening doors, etc) by using input variables of acceleration and inertial measurements. Ultimately, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are able to conveniently analyze and decompose these measurements in sliced windows to recognize, generalize, and localize actions in the image. The application of CNNs for HAR problems typically exploit open datasets, such as the Otago Exercise Program, to extract and sample features from accelerometer data. The corresponding movement data is interpreted as multi-variate time series data with notably high spatial and temporal resolution. Datasets such as the Otago exercise program and other open access HAR datasets use relatively high-resolution sensor data with respect to time, and CNNs are almost perfectly suitable to segment this data for pattern recognition and identification.", "Although Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have recently gained traction in HAR tasks (due to its temporal nature), CNNs introduce a higher degree of precision and locality when extracting feature samples through its network. CNNs enable translational invariance with respect to the time of occurrence (i.e. time of occurrence of the action or behavior). In other words, translational invariance enables CNNs to pinpoint behavioral classes (e.g. walking, sitting, running, etc) regardless of changes in motion (translation). You can conceptualize invariance rotating, translating, or shifting the written number \u20182\u2019 on paper. Regardless of rotations or changes in position, its identity as the number \u20182\u2019 will remain unchanged. Similarly, temporal data processed through a translationally invariant CNN can continuously classify and distinguish actions across time based on sensor data, regardless of the given action being in motion. Ultimately, this mechanism of translational invariance enables the CNN to effectively map behavior temporally at a precise frame-by-frame rate.", "In the paper, \u201cHuman Action Recognition using 3D Convolutional Neural Networks with 3D Motion Cuboids in Surveillance Videos\u201d, Arunnehru et al., manipulated the KTH video dataset, covering six actions such as humans waving hands, clapping, running, boxing, walking and jogging. These continuous actions were annotated, corresponded, and executed by 25 different humans in four distinct scenarios, including indoor and outdoor settings with varied clothing and scales (i.e. camera magnification and video scale). In contrast to 2D CNNs which only compute feature maps from spatial dimensions, 3D Convolutional Neural Networks can simultaneously capture spatial and temporal dimensions by stacking multiple contiguous/connected frames together. By taking advantage of a temporal component, motions can be classified on video via a 3D CNN. On the other side of the equation, however, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) remain a critical key player in the extraction of features from raw sensory-temporal/sequential data: rather than looking visual information with a temporal dimension, an RNN would be retained on raw sensor datasets, such as the WISDM repository which provides activities including jogging, sitting, standing, and walking (upstairs and downstairs). For pure sensor-based data, RNNs exceed in precision and validation accuracy when using variables such as acceleration and angular velocity on three axes.", "Now for the fun part \u2014 applying 3D CNNs or RNNs to the classification of suspicious behavior in suspected police brutality or seizure/search cases. More specifically, manipulating the potential of 3D CNNs and RNNs to identify borderline aggressive behaviors by measuring and visualizing gestures taken by the police, sudden jerks in acceleration/angular velocity, and general movement in the premises. A combined CNN/RNN model architecture can be engineered and pretrained to detect aggressive law enforcement behavior. Similar to human activity recognition projects such as this that detect suspicious activities, a comparable algorithm could be deployed on city street cameras and police body cameras to objectively identify aggressive behavior from corresponding police.", "Although Computer Vision models are, perhaps, the most notorious deep learning-driven algorithms for real-time detection, feature sampling, and recognition of suspicious and aggressive behavior (on a spatial-visual level), the recent rise of machine learning in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and NLP applications has proven critical when analyzing aggression on a more nuanced dimension\u2014 human language and voice. Typically, massive NLP frameworks and architectures (e.g. Google AI\u2019s BERT language model) have been adapted for the still classification of human text. In other words, researchers typically adapt these language models for supervised/semi-supervised that involve feeding samples of text and waiting for a processed output. However, the application of real-time, autonomous sentiment analysis architectures for both vocal and textual emotion detection has just gained traction in the recent 1\u20132 years. For high-risk cases that involve racial profiling, probable cause violations w/ seizure and search, and derogatory language towards the victim, real-time speech-based models could be essential in objectively decomposing the officer\u2019s intent and escalation into aggressive behavior.", "Ultimately, two distinct methodologies exist in order to contextually extract sentiment and emotion from raw speech data: 1.) Understanding emotion from raw audio waveforms through CNN Spectrogram feature extraction and sampling, and 2.) Combining two models: a speech recognition architecture that transcribes the audio to text followed by an RNN sentiment classification algorithm that performs classification on the resulting text. Perhaps, the most fascinating approach towards vocal sentiment analysis is featured through raw audio waveform analysis with a deep CNN architecture (the first method). By systematically capturing unique voice features known as Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients and feeding the resulting features into a CNN model, we can delineate and distinguish the thresholds of sentiment between a broad dataset of sample voices. Tripathi et al., explore the capacity of deep CNNs to decompose and recognize emotions from speech features/transcriptions in the paper, \u201cDeep Learning-based Emotion Recognition System Using Speech Features and Transcriptions\u201d The paper considers the use of speech transcriptions derived from original audio datasets + the corresponding speech features (Spectrogram and MFCC) which all create the necessary melting pot of features for a Deep Neural Network.", "In any speech-intent/emotional recognition task, Mel-frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) operate has, perhaps, the most significant feature sample fed into a Deep Neural Network. By using extracted MFCC features, we can filter out distortive background noise and localize specific vocal features that matter in the audio recording. MFCCs function the Mel scale, relating perceived frequency/pitch of a pure tone to its actual measured frequency. An MFCC is comprised of 39 features, being minuscule enough that it \u2018forces\u2019 the neural network to learn and distinguish characteristics in speech-audio information. In the corresponding paper, Tripathi et al., implemented the Deep CNN to semantically map high and low-level feature relationships across their vocal datasets to accurately identify emotions.", "In order to precisely extract the full breadth of vocal features from each recording sample, Spectrograms (a full frequency feature profile of the audio waveforms over time) had to be captured from each sample in the dataset (USC\u2019s Interactive Emotional Motion Capture). The paper effectively took the resulting Spectrogram input with a maximum image width of 256 windows. They fixed/trimmed the duration of each audio file to six seconds, covering 75 percent of the associated dataset. Through raw audio inputs alone, their Model 4A attained 73.6% accuracy on the benchmark USC dataset.", "Additionally, in the paper, \u201cReal-Time Speech Emotion and Sentiment Recognition for Interactive Dialogue Systems\u201d by Bertero et al., an interface was established in order to distinguish between emotions such as criticism, defensiveness/anxiety, hostility, loneliness, love, and sadness in real-time. More importantly, they utilized a single-filter CNN, making the framework computationally compact and able to execute real-time inference. By using a more compact CNN model similar to the Tripathi et al., the real-time inference was possible on more nuanced emotions. In the context of rising police brutality incidences, both Tripathi et al., and Bertero et al., demonstrate that raw audio input provides rich feature samples that distinguish low-high level emotional characteristics that may be critical in analyzing an officer\u2019s vocal sentiment. By using real-time emotional recognition systems, audio feed from police body cameras can be fed through an emotion recognition system and relayed to HQ if the officer is verbally abusive.", "Finally, perhaps one of the largest game-changers in the legal landscape\u2019s fight against police brutality is literally developing as we speak \u2014 NLP and topological learning to predict court judgments and outcomes. In the paper, \u201cLegal Judgement Prediction via Topological Learning\u201d Zhong et al., effectively employed a topological learning framework that understands dependencies between subtasks of the court case, including the relevant law articles, facts of the case, etc. Ultimately, Zhong uses the connections between these subtasks to essentially generate a final verdict based on the background and parameters of the case. By using a fact encoder Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), they were able to digest input text (e.g. facts of the case, case background, etc) into a lookup layer, convolution layer, and pooling layer. After validating against real court data, they achieved the following confusion matrix ranging from several month penalties to death penalties/life imprisonment.", "For racial profiling and police brutality court cases, especially in conservative-leaning districts, topological learning could be integrated to discover more objective court orders and outcomes. Although many court judges abide by judicial restrain (i.e. limiting bias and exercise of their own power), human bias runs rampant at a subconscious level. Topological learning frameworks could theoretically remove bias when trained on ethically regulated and prepared datasets.", "With the rapid rise in human-centered visual and textual deep learning frameworks, rampant racial profiling and police brutality incidences could be analyzed more fairly, consulting law enforcement and regional-state courts on the most objective decisionmaking paths towards justice. Whether it\u2019s the implementation of human activity recognition algorithms to identify aggressive police behavior, real-time voice recognition that analyzes verbal abuse, or topological learning systems that judge court outcomes, deep learning could revolutionize how we streamline the process of achieving justice. Although the integration of deep learning presents preliminary promise, biases in preprocessed data exist and will most likely continue to exist. Before tying the knot between deep learning and legal justice systems, algorithms must be ethically scrutinized, or else we\u2019ll end up in a more unjust position than we started.", "Deep Convolutional and LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks for Multimodal Wearable Activity Recognition by Francisco Ordonez and Daniel Roggen", "Learning Discriminative Motion Features THrough Detection (Bertasius et al., 2018)", "Learning to Recognise Actions in Egocentric Video (Bek, 2014)", "Harmonic Networks: Deep Translation and Rotation Equivariance (Worrall et al., 2017)", "Deep Learning-based Emotion Recognition System Using Speech Features and Transcriptions (Tripathi et al., 2019)", "Legal Judgement Prediction via Topological Learning (Zhong et al. 2018)", "Your home for data science.
