Hence, AI is used for enhancing manufacturing efficiency, creating self-driving systems for cars, predicting stock prices, scheduling repairs for industrial goods, and for other useful things that could directly make our lives better.", "However, there is another application of AI algorithms that does not seem to bear any economic benefits but is still researched widely \u2014 AI that plays video games.", "Here, we are not talking about NPCs (in-game non-person characters, bots) that are parts of your journey in a game, although some of them are built with a slight touch of artificial intelligence to make them feel more real. The focus is on actual AI algorithms that play video games like any other independent actor, exactly like a human when they press the buttons on a controller. From here, a question arises \u2014 why do developers and researchers put so much effort in algorithms that do not seem to add value, as they just play games?", "The answer is pretty simple \u2014 AI that plays video games is not created only to play video games (surprisingly). The gaming environment, in this case, acts as a playground for different types of algorithms where they can test and try new things; the results could then be applied in real life or in future pieces of research.", "For instance, this is what the Verge wrote about DeepMind\u2019s AI agents playing Quake III:", "\u201cAs ever with research like this, the aim is not to actually beat humans at video games, but to find new ways of teaching agents to navigate complex environments while pursuing a shared goal. In other words, it\u2019s about teaching collective intelligence \u2014 something that has (despite abundant evidence to the contrary) been integral to humanity\u2019s success as a species. Capture the flag is just a proxy for bigger games to come.\u201d", "The main subset of AI techniques that is tested in video games is machine learning and, more specifically, reinforcement learning. Reinforcement learning is a type of machine learning which implies an agent learns how to behave in an environment by performing actions and getting feedback. In other words, this type of machine learning is similar to the way humans or even dogs learn in their early years:", "An action is taken \u2192 feedback is received (positive or negative) \u2192 conclusion is drawn based on the feedback whether the action was good or bad.", "Similar structures are used in video games. Imagine a computer system that is given a video game and controller. The system does not know what to do, but it has a set of actions it can perform. If it moves forward in a game and does not die, the environment gives some reward to the system (not dead: +1). If the system moves right and dies, it does not receive a reward (dead: 0) or even receives a punishment (dead: -1). From this, a machine understands that moving forward is better than moving right. In the end, the aim of the algorithm is to maximize the reward it receives from its actions.", "Clearly, this is a simplification of what actually happens on the background, but for the purpose of focusing on video games more than on actual algorithms, the example should suffice. For more details, there is a good article that explains the basics of how RL works:", "One of the first successful attempts to implement machine learning in video games was made by the DeepMind Technologies, who created a deep reinforcement learning algorithm that played old Atari 2600 games.", "One of the latest and most interesting advancements, however, was made by the researchers from Open AI, \u201cthe singularity-focused think-tank\u201d co-founded by Elon Musk. The group of researchers applied a so-called \u201ccuriosity-driven\u201d approach, which means they did not explain the algorithm what to do or even what it means to win. Instead, they coded natural \u201ccuriosity\u201d that drove the machine \u201cexplore\u201d things, and the machine just\u2026played the game out of curiosity.", "\u201cThis is not as strange as it sounds. Developmental psychologists talk about intrinsic motivation (i.e., curiosity) as the primary driver in the early stages of development: Babies appear to employ goal-less exploration to learn skills that will be useful later on in life. There are plenty of other examples, from playing Minecraft to visiting your local zoo, where no extrinsic rewards are required.\u201d", "So overall, the general idea of testing different AI algorithms in video games is to collect data and create a knowledge base for real-world applications or for subsequent research.", "One of the first reasons behind the popularity of video games among AI researchers is the tendency of video games to mimic real life in many ways. This idea is not very straightforward when it comes to older games, as they have arcade-style graphics and physics.", "However, digging a bit deeper we can realize that even in such cartoony games like Mario, the very incentives of going forward and performing certain actions is not significantly different from our everyday life. You, as a hero, have a certain goal that you want to achieve, and you perform certain actions to get yourself a bit closer to this goal. If your hero dies in a game, you treat this as negative feedback and change your strategy.", "Make a step toward the main goal \u2192 get feedback \u2192 improve based on feedback \u2192 try again.", "This very feedback loop is even described by authors like Jane McGonigal as a smart strategy to achieve your goals in real life using gameful approach, so it\u2019s only natural that AI algorithms could learn this directly from video games. As ITUNews puts it:", "\u201cVideo games are designed to challenge the human mind by making players focus on elements including overcoming obstacles and following sub-stories. A core idea of game design \u2014 and part of the reason many enjoy playing \u2014 is that players are learning all the time.\u201d", "When it comes to modern video games, the simulation of real life is much more evident. For instance, Grand Theft Auto, which is basically a life simulator with fun elements, has been used by certain researchers to train self-driving cars. Since the traffic rules, roads, and car physics are already coded in the game, it is easier for scientists to test algorithms there than in real life. And because GTA is so realistic, it can be used to generate data that\u2019s \u201cas good as that generated by using real-world imagery.\u201d", "Moreover, video games are safe and fast \u2014 no interaction with real environment is needed to train AI, while virtual environments allow an algorithm to train and develop way faster than in physical space. It is claimed that in the time a robot could perform 10 tasks and get useful feedback in real life, an algorithm could play a game 10,000 times and generate valuable data. For such areas of AI applications as self-driving systems, this feature is especially helpful, since collecting road data is time-consuming, while also people\u2019s lives are at stake when it comes to transportation.", "Furthermore, video games are complex but provide a gradual progression so that the learning process could go naturally. Hence, games tend to start with varying but relatively easy levels and make the journey incrementally harder with each subsequent level. As a result, an AI algorithm can learn to play games the same way humans do \u2014 by trial and error and by improving skills over time.", "\u201cVideo games are a great way of training AI algorithms because they are designed to give human minds gradual progression into harder and harder challenges.\u201d", "Another important point is related to data cleansing. With the real-life observations, most of the derived data should be \u201ccleaned\u201d before using it for machine learning, as such imperfections as the absence of certain values or biased feedback appear in reality. However, it can be expected that since video games are basically created by data points, you do not need to clean the data much before letting a machine to learn from there. This should theoretically reduce the time-related resources needed for a machine learning project.", "Finally, a simple reason to implement AI algorithms in video games is that games are fun. This type of entertainment is associated with high engagement, with some games having millions of loyal fans, which is not as common for other types of activities as it is for games.", "Therefore, people are more likely to be interested in a scientific achievement if it is explained not in math terms but in gaming insights. Creating an algorithm that beats pro eSports players in StarCraft or plays Atari games with extreme efficiency, for instance, draws a significant level of attention and improves media coverage of the research. This makes people more aware of AI and video games in general, which is a win-win situation for all the parties involved.", "Your home for data science.
