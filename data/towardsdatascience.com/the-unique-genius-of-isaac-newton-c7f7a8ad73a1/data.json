His most significant contribution to science was his book Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, where he formulated his famous three laws of motion and his law of gravitation, that dominated science for more than 200 years. In the words of the renowned astrophysicist and Nobel laureate Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar:", "\u201cIt is only when we observe the scale of Newton\u2019s achievement that comparisons, which have sometimes been made with other men of science, appear altogether inappropriate both with respect to Newton and with respect to the others.\u201d", "In mathematics, Newton \u201cdistinctly advance[d] every branch of mathematics then studied,\u201d but two of his most famous discoveries were the generalized binomial expansion and the calculus.", "In the present article, my focus will be on Newton\u2019s early mathematical achievements. I will describe his derivation of the generalized binomial expansion and how he applied it to obtain the power series expansion for the sine function. According to Derek Whiteside, considered the \u201cforemost historian of mathematics of his generation,\u201d this was the first time the power series for the sine (and cosine) appeared in Europe.", "Newton\u2019s mathematical innovations were manifold. But arguably, his starting point was the discovery of the so-called generalized binomial expansion (see Dunham for more details), which first appeared (together with some of Newton\u2019s work on calculus) in a 1676 letter he sent to Gottfried Leibniz. This letter is known as his epistola prior.", "The Binomial Expansion in Newton\u2019s Original NotationIn Newton\u2019s notation, the expansion is expressed as:", "In this expression, A, B, C, D, \u2026 represent the previous terms of the series:", "The example given by Newton in the epistola was:", "The first two terms of the expansion are:", "The third term, which depends on the previous term B, is obtained analogously:", "The process may then be continued ad infinitum. The result is:", "Obtaining the Modern NotationWe can easily write the binomial expansion using our modern notation. We first factor out the P term from the left-hand side of Eq. 1 and substitute A, B, C, D,\u2026 by the corresponding previous terms (see Eq. 2):", "Canceling out the P terms and dividing the coefficients in the numerators by the factors of n in the denominators we get:", "We may rewrite this expression using binomial coefficients. For convenience, we rename m/n as m and apply the properties of factorials to rewrite the coefficients of the expansion as:", "Using the standard notation of binomial coefficients:", "we obtain the binomial expansion in its modern form:", "From previous work by the English mathematician John Wallis and others, Newton knew how to make the binomial expansion for integer exponents:", "An interesting visualization of these coefficients is shown in Fig. 3 below.", "Newton\u2019s goal was to extend the expansions in Eq. 5 to include non-integer values of the exponent m. Following Bressoud, we can arrange the coefficients in a table, including empty rows for expansions with non-integer values of m:", "Newton wanted to fill the empty cells in this table. His reasoning was the following.", "The first and second columns are not difficult to guess. The first contains only ones and the second increases linearly with m.", "Now let us consider the third column. First, we notice that it contains only triangular numbers (see Fig. 6 below), which can be obtained using the simple formula:", "We also notice that the m-th row always contains the (m-1)st triangular number. More concretely, the m=2 row contains the first triangular number, the m=3 row contains the second triangular number and the m=5 row contains the fourth triangular number. Substituting (m-1) in the Eq. 6 we get:", "We can then complete the third column:", "Now, note that, for the first three columns, the values increase polynomially.", "Based on this pattern, Newton inferred that the fourth column should increase as a polynomial of degree three. Since this yet unknown polynomial vanishes when m = 0,1 and 2, it must have the form:", "where the constant a may be obtained, for example, using the seventh row of the table, according to which p(3)=1. Hence:", "We can then fill the empty cells of the fourth column:", "Newton\u2019s procedure is now clear. The dependence on m of the fifth and sixth columns can be quickly obtained:", "and we can finally fill the whole table:", "(where the previously seen formula for binomial coefficients was used). We should note that, quoting Whiteside:", "\u201cThe paradox remains that such Wallisian interpolation procedures, however plausible, are in no way a proof, and that a central tenet of Newton\u2019s mathematical method lacked any sort of rigorous justification . . . Of course, the binomial theorem worked marvelously, and that was enough for the 17th-century mathematician.\u201d", "The derivation of the power series of the sine function \u201ccrowned [Newton\u2019s] virtuoso performance\u201d in his 1669 manuscript \u201cOn Analysis by Equations with an Infinite Number of Terms\u201d.", "All elements needed to understand Newton\u2019s derivation are contained in Fig. 10 below (based on Dunham), which is a plot of the function", "that describes (a quadrant of) a circle with unit radius.", "The arc \u03b1D is equal to z (the circle has radius 1) and from Fig. 10 we obtain:", "The goal is, therefore, to determine x (as a power series on z).", "The triangles DGH and DBT are similar. Since the triangles ABD and DBT are also similar we obtain:", "where the Leibnizian notation was used for its convenience. Using Eq. 8 this expression becomes:", "Newton\u2019s next step was to apply his binomial expansion to the right-hand side:", "Now inverting Eq. 9 to obtain z=z(x)=arcsin x and integrating the binomial expansion above gives:", "Note that the only integral Newton needed to obtain this expression was the definite integral corresponding to the following antiderivative (or indefinite integral):", "In his final step, Newton had to transform (or more precisely, invert) Eq. 10 into an expansion of the sine function (instead of an expansion of arcsine function). For that, he used one of the many tools he had previously developed, namely, his technique of inverting power series.", "The series to be inverted is z(x) in Eq. 10, namely:", "In other words, what Newton was after was x(z), the power series of x in terms of z. Following his strategy, we start by performing the following steps:", "Applying the StrategyMore concretely, let us write the series as:", "(see Dunham). The next step is to keep only the linear term in x:", "To account for all terms dropped, Newton then writes x in terms of a yet unknown series p:", "and substitutes it in Eq. 12:", "Expanding this expression and grouping the power of p, he obtained:", "Newton then drops the terms with powers of p higher than 1 and solves for p:", "Newton keeps only the first term of the numerator and, to account for the dropped terms, introduces a new, undetermined, series q defined as follows:", "To determine q, Newton substitutes this new p into Eq. 16, keeps only the term linear in q and solves for q. This gives an expression for q similar to Eq. 17 (for p). He then, again, keeps only the term with the lowest degree in the numerator to get:", "This procedure can be carried out ad infinitum. Now from Eq. 9, x = sin z, and he finally arrived at the following expression for the sine function:", "This result can be trivially derived today using Taylor\u2019s series. The way Newton did it, however, was completely different. As noted in Dunham, his derivation \u201creminds us that mathematics did not necessarily evolve in the manner of today\u2019s textbooks.
