Coronavirus has long been discovered and what we hear about today, the COVID-19, is just another (in the layman terms) variation of it.", "This article is based on inferences drawn on the data available as of March 23, 2020. I\u2019ll enlist a few data sources, and dashboards. Also, I\u2019ll comment on the information as well as on what you or anyone can do to explore and take the data a step further.", "Namely, there have been three different outbreaks since the year 2000. The first outbreak was of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) in the year 2002 with over 8000 cases from 17 countries. The next outbreak was of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) in 2012 with over 2500 cases across 21 countries. The latest outbreak is obviously COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) which is one of the most dangerous and widely spread Coronavirus. Each day we are witnessing new cases and it has been declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization [1].", "One of the talks that opened my eyes about Coronavirus was recently published by Tedx Talks on their Youtube channel, by the name \u201cCoronavirus is the future\u201d by Alanna Shaikh [2]. Honestly, while the title appears alarming, the content describes how Coronavirus is nothing new.", "Every day we are witnessing a spike in the number of reported Corona cases across the globe. A simple Google search of \u201cCoronavirus\u201d reveals an array of new articles, information sources as well as statistics columns right within the search. If you look around or just check your email, various companies are sending out how they are tackling the pandemic while still ensuring continued uninterrupted services to the customers. It\u2019s really appreciative on the part of several companies and organizations who are educating, disseminating information as well as promoting healthier living practices to curb this pandemic that has locked us in our houses.", "Taking a look at the latest report from World Health Organization (WHO) [3], it shows that China has made a significant recovery while the number of cases in Italy and United States (especially New York) are still on the rise. This does not specifically mean that the there is a sudden jump in the number of confirmed cases (which may very well be the case) but may also point to the fact that many more people are now getting tested as compared to before and thus causing the sudden hike.", "There are several sources of data available right now but some sources I found reliable include:", "This is all well but we have already seen Coronavirus before. If we could access that data, it could provide us with a good starting point in understanding COVID-19 and other such viruses. The best starting point is the World Health Organization that hosts data for SARS based on reports generated on a regular basis [6]. However, the data is available as HTML pages and would have to be retrieved using scraping if needed.", "Today, the easiest way to analyze the current state of Coronavirus across the globe is to find a dashboard that you seem right and stick to it. Individuals, organizations and companies have developed dashboards that reflect the current state of the virus for easy monitoring and information dissemination. Some of the dashboards I came across are:", "After observing several dashboards, I learnt that there are so many ways to portray information to the user. You can select specific countries and do a deep dive or select the whole world as your canvas. The selection of quality data source becomes important in case of healthcare information. Bar plots, geo maps, tables, line plots etc. all can be used based on how you want to show the information. Furthermore, with such a wide reaching user base, the accessibility of such dashboards must also be considered so everyone can access and use them.", "While dashboards with COVID-19 spread are all around us and have been made with great detail, our goal is to take it a step further. As you might imagine, COVID-19 affects our life in numerous ways. Has the traffic reduced significantly? Has this reduced the emission of pollutants? Has trade been stopped completely or essential transactions are still being conducted? Are services like Amazon prime witnessing a boost? And many more\u2026", "Look at your life and see what you\u2019d like to find out. I used to go to the gym regularly to remain active but now that it is closed, and I cannot go out often, I have to work inside the house. I had to order some exercise equipments and so did my friend. This led me to ask the question whether the demand of exercise equipments has increased or not? Are people buying just a skipping rope or a whole rack of weights? Are the suppliers able to fulfill the increasing demands or not? The answers to these questions might not be straightforward and would require some digging but it\u2019ll be something that will be of personal interest to me and might intrigue others too.", "Share your thoughts, ideas and suggestions in the comments below.
