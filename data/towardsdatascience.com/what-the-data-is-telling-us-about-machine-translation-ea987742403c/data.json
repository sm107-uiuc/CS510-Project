We\u2019ll take a brief survey of the current state of the art in machine translation to address that question. We\u2019ll consider how various translation engines perform when translating various types of content and consider the variances that exist to translate foreign languages successfully. We\u2019ll consider historical trends to evaluate the general assumption that machines are rapidly closing the quality gap that once separated them from human linguists. And we\u2019ll look at some recent developments to assess their significance in improving machine translation accuracy and performance.", "2015: The Machine Translation Inflection Point", "Until 5 years ago, machine translation was phrase-based. An algorithm would consider a passage in sequence. The language was translated as we speak. The problem with phrase-based translation approach is that there is no initial knowledge of the context of the passage. And without context, there was an elevated chance of misunderstanding and incorrect translation. It was a bit like the problem of the blind man and the elephant. If one starts feeling trunk and legs and tusk and ear, one might mistake which beast is being touched. Only after combining all the parts can one grasp the whole, the gestalt.", "Starting in 2015, however, the artificial intelligence construct known as neural network began to be applied to machine translation tasks. In this approach, the entire passage to be translated was input and processed by data structures and algorithms for various internal and external connections. In this way, the whole could be understood by verbal and structural connections even before the individual parts, the words and sentences were tackled.", "The Nuances of Neural Machine Translation Techniques", "Without getting into too much detail, neural machine translation used vector representations \u2014 \u201cembeddings\u201d and \u201ccontinuous space representations\u201d for words and internal states of a given passage. The structure is simpler than phrased-based approaches: a single sequence model predicts one word at a time, based on deep learning and representation learning techniques of the entire source sentence.", "At first, this was done using a recurrent neural network (RNN), which bidirectionally encodes and then decodes to predict words in the target language. Later, Convolutional Neural Networks (Convnets) succeeded RNNs after improvements using so-called \u201cattention\u201d-based approaches.", "Neural Machine Translation in Commerce, Community, and Competitions", "By 2016, NMT approaches were winning almost all major awards. Yandex, IBM and PROMT AI-powered translation tools now use neural networks. Google has branded its own approach as GNMT and uses it in Google Translate. Microsoft applies its version in its Translator and in Skype. An Open source NMT (ONMT) has been released by Harvard\u2019s NLP group.", "In recent years, Facebook\u2019s AI group leveraged the unmatched database of the conversations and posts of billions of FB users to beat the competition in several tasks 2019\u2019s Fourth Conference on Machine Translation (known as WMT). The models of Zuckerberg\u2019s social network won first place in several language tasks in news translation, including the most competitive English to German task. For this language direction, its translations were declared \u201csuperhuman\u201d by WMT organizers: human evaluators preferred them over translations done by human linguists.", "Advances of Microsoft\u2019s NMT led to the company in 2018 declaring parity with professional human translations, at least in the difficult Chinese to English category. Still, it\u2019s an open field, especially in less popular languages where regional Baltic upstart Tilde won the WMT 2019 competition for the English-Lithuanian language pair, beating Google, Microsoft, and others.", "Data Science and the Evaluation of Translation Quality", "It is ironic that evaluations of NMT quality to data have been done by human experts comparing the translations of machines to those of humans. These are typically done by subjective scoring. In effect, then, human experts are being asked to take sides against their species. Increasingly, the results suggest that species-loyalty takes a back seat to professional linguistic evaluation.", "Attitude toward data science by human linguists are not by nature favorable, so one is inclined to think that the statistical results may even be skewed in favor of human translations. This article is too short to really get deep into the numbers, but what has emerged as the measurement standard, replacing BLEU, is something called LEPOR. This measurement method compares NMTs to each other and to humans. Comparing performance across 48 language pairs on this scale, the analysis firm INTENTO in a January 2019 study, ranked Google and Amazon as having the best coverage. Upstart DEEPL performed best in a narrow set of languages, and YANDEX did so most cost-effectively.", "Are Machine Language Translators Destined to Best Human Linguists?", "Is the future of translation going to be dominated by neural network-driven AI bots? It would appear so for news, weather, sports, and other highly structured language formats in popular use, also perhaps for governmental, legal and financial reports. It\u2019s possible that this point has been passed already. The areas which still seem far beyond the reach of machines, and data science, remain creative writing: poetry, fiction, and non-fiction. These algorithms have a long way to go, even with the best programming and the processing power of the proverbial million (billion? trillion?) monkeys.", "Even informal conversation translation seems on the way to being dominated by machines, following in the footsteps of Facebook\u2019s processing of the chats, comments, and posts of its users, with or without their knowledge. The real test of the next generation of neural machine translation engines may be in the translation of that new genre of online conversations known as sexting. If machine-translated sexts can arouse evaluators more than human translations, we may really have cause for worry.", "Your home for data science.
