Or how your credit card information is kept private when making online purchases?", "The answer is cryptography. The vast majority of internet sites now use some form of cryptography to ensure the privacy of its users. Even information such as emails from your Gmail account are encrypted as they float around in Google\u2019s data centers.", "Cryptography is the science of transmitting information securely against potential third party adversaries.", "For example, think about \u201cThe Imitation Game.\u201d For those who have seen the movie, you know that it is a story about how Alan Turing creates the first computer to decrypt the German Enigma machine \u2014 a machine that encoded all German communications, so that the Nazis could safely transmit messages by radio. Though these messages were easily intercepted by the Allies, the messages could not be understood because they were all encoded, or encrypted, with some foreign key which changed daily.", "First, the receiver generates 2 public keys n and e, and one private key d by:", "If this was hard to follow, please see the example code on my Github, which walks you through each step of the process, using a package in R called \u2018openssl\u2019. Excerpt seen below:", "Another important aspect of encryption is the ability to sign a message. It allows you to verify senders and avoid sending sensitive information to the wrong users and/or public keys.", "Create a signature M, such that S = M^d mod n, and send S along with your message. Remember that d is your private key.", "The receiver can quickly establish that the signature is valid if M= S^e mod n.", "You\u2019ll notice in the sample code above, I used a function sha256() for a variable m_hash. Hashing is a one-way cryptographic function that allows you to irreversibly transform information into a string of letters and numbers called a hash. Hashing is different from encryption because a hash is meant to be impossible to decrypt, though many have tried, and some have succeeded. When you hear about a password or other security breach, it is usually referring to a cryptographic hack in which hackers have been able to match hashes back to the original text.", "There are various hashing algorithms (MD, SHA1, SHA2, & SHA3), but we will focus on the SHA256 algorithm as it is most common today.", "The SHA256 algorithm first converts text into a string of 256 bits (hence the name) of 0 and 1. An example would be:", "Since these binary hashes are extremely long to display, they are then converted hexadecimal format (a 64 character combination of values 0\u20139 & a-f), with each section of 4 bits representing on character. An example of the hexadecimal representation is:", "A major use of hashing is in password verification. It would be extremely unsafe for your bank to keep a database of passwords, so it maintains a database of hashes, that correspond to your actual password. When log in to your bank online, the system hashes your password, and then checks it against the hash that it has on file for you.", "This system works because hashing algorithms will always produce the same hash for the same password\u2014hashes are not a random combination of characters. Hashing is also the reason that it is important to have complex and unique passwords, because if I compute the hash for \u201cpassword123\u201d, and I match it up to the hash that corresponds to you, then I know your password is \u201cpassword123,\u201d and I can easily hack your bank account online.", "Rainbow tables are databases of hashes to common passwords.", "Take ATM pin codes for example. There are 10,000 combinations of 4-digit ATM pin codes using digits 0\u20139. A rainbow table would provide the hash for each of the 10,000 codes, and a hacker could use this list of hashes to map the hash back to your code, thus decoding your pin number from its hash.", "Relax! Banks and most other organizations understand that hackers want to obtain sensitive information, so they typically provide an extra layer of security through something called a \u201csalt.\u201d", "Salts are extra strings of characters added to a password (or other information) to make it more unique, longer, and more difficult to hack.", "Instead of having a pin = \u201c0000,\u201d adding a salt would change your pin to something like \u201c0000B_of_A_salt,\u201d which would have an entirely different hash. Organizations can creatively use salts to make hacking extremely difficult. In order to use a rainbow table to crack such an algorithm, you would need a rainbow table for each possible salt, adding tremendously to the number of possible combinations of pin numbers.", "Cryptography enables blockchain to verify senders in a network through signatures, as well as ensure that past transactions and records, known as \u201cblocks,\u201d cannot be changed.", "Blockchain also utilizes hashing algorithms to assign a unique hash to each block, allowing you to distinguish between blocks.", "Now that you know all about hashing and encryption, take a look at this short video about how Alan Turing was able to successfully \u201chack\u201d the German Enigma machine, and watch the movie if you haven\u2019t already!", "*Note: For the purposes of this article, I have focused on an asymmetric encryption algorithm called RSA (Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman) Encryption.", "Your home for data science.
