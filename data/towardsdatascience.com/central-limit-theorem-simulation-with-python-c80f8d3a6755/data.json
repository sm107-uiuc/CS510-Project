Yes, it\u2019s the Central Limit Theorem.", "Let\u2019s dive into the most important theorem in data science!", "It is highly impossible to collect the data of the entire population. Instead of doing that we can gather a subset of data from a population and use the statistics of that sample to conclude the population.", "The law of large numbers (LLN) is the theory that states that the mean of the sample distribution approaches to the mean of the population distribution as the size of the sample mean would grow. So, the law of large numbers is intuitively understandable that collecting more data leads to a more representative sample.", "The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is a theory that claims that the distribution of sample means calculated from re-sampling will tend to normal, as the size of the sample increases, regardless of the shape of the population distribution.", "The difference between those two theories is that the law of large numbers states something about a single sample mean whereas the central limit theorem states something about the distribution of the sample means.", "There is a large number of books that quote (around) this value, for example, Hogg and Tanis\u2019 Probability and Statistical Inference (7e) says:", "That is, X is approximately N(\u03bc, \u03c32/n), and Y is approximately N(n\u03bc, n\u03c32), when n is \u201csufficiently large,\u201d where \u03bc and \u03c32 are, respectively, the mean and the variance of the underlying distribution from which the sample arose. Generally, if n is greater than 25 or 30, these approximations will be good.", "Many variables in nature have a distribution that\u2019s very close to the normal curve. Looking at the t-table, you will see that the values \u200b\u200bof t with 30 degrees of freedom are close to the values \u200b\u200bof z. One reason for this is that t-distributions, such as the normal distribution, are symmetric and unimodal. Thus, we can conclude that the distribution of means samples with a sample size of 30 will also be normally distributed.", "If distribution of the population isn\u2019t normal you might need to try sample size far large then 30. The further away the data in population is from being symmetric and unimodal, the more data you\u2019ll need to kick in CLT.", "So, the close your distribution to a normal distribution, fewer samples needed to invoke the CLT. In practice, I never rely on n = 30 and advise you to try a different sampling size.", "3. The standard error of sampling distribution is directly linked to the standard deviation of the original population. Mathematically,", "4. If we increase the samples drawn from the population, the standard deviation of sample means will decrease.", "We have some distribution, data in which isn\u2019t normally distributed, but instead of using this distribution, we would use the distribution of sample means. This allows us kind of to cheat and to say that we can use the normal distribution ubiquitously in statistical inference, although the underlying distributions aren\u2019t normal.", "We will use a Kaggle dataset and Python statistics libraries like Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas.", "For an illustration of the Central Limit Theorem for sampling, we will take the \u201cCoffeeCupsPerDay\u201d column. Let\u2019s plot a histogram of the number of cups of coffee drunk by programmers.", "As we can see the distribution of coffee cups data that programmers drink per day is positively skewed and the mean of data distribution is = 2.89. But we want to analyze data that is approximately normally distributed.", "Theoretically, as the size of each sample increase then the better the sample means will approximate a Gaussian distribution. Let\u2019s draw sufficient samples of different sizes and compute their samples means. We will take sample size=10, 40, 60 and 80 of 300 samples from our distribution. Calculate the arithmetic mean and plot the mean of the sample 300 times.", "So, we played around by taking different sample sizes and increasing them step by step. Then we visualized distributions of samples means with different sample-sized for comparing their shape of distribution and means. Now, we know that we\u2019ll get a very nice bell-shaped curve as the sample sizes increase.", "We can tell from the shape of the distribution with sample size 80 that the distribution is Gaussian. The mean of the sampling distribution is equal to the population\u2019s mean distribution and equal to 2.89.", "We can observe that as the sample size N \u2192 Infinity, the standard deviation of the mean goes to zero. This means that the larger the size of our dataset the smaller standard error.", "Consequently, we can consider the sampling distributions is normal, so we could use these distributions for further analysis.", "Thank you for reading!
