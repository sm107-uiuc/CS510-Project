How do you put some definition around differences in opinion? An objective way to achieve this distinction is using image classification to differentiate between a clean versus a messy room.", "This application can also be extended to cleaning services agencies or Airbnb especially so with more than 10% of its user complaints pertaining to dirty and messy conditions. (see source)", "The process to building my application comprises of 5 stages: 1) Web-scraping 2) Dataset preparation 3)Models Building 4) Model Testing and 5)Front end Flask App.", "There was no dataset of the size I want, so I had to turn to web-scraping (such is life!) with keywords on google_images_download to obtain images from Google.", "For the \u201cClean\u201d category, words like \u201cclean bedroom\u201d, \u201ctidy room\u201d, \u201c hotel room\u201d, \u201cclean and neat\u201d and \u201cdeclutter\u201d were used.", "For the \u201cMessy\u201d category, words used include \u201cclutter\u201d, \u201cmess\u201d and \u201cdisorganized room\u201d.", "I created a third category for fun to cater to the snapshots of excuse notes my kids will leave me to escape their chores.

Going into each category, I eye-balled the pictures, removing i) conflicting pictures, ii) contrasting pictures showing before-and-after, iii) duplicates which won\u2019t help in training, iv) cleaning agents pictures, v) cartoon images, vi) pictures of the words, vii) company logos.", "This dataset spring-cleaning is essential.

(For those with an appetite for technicals, I will elaborate them in italics in this article. You can skip them if your interest is only on the outcome. F1 is the harmonic balance between precision and recall. i) Precision is the ratio of True Positives out of all the predicted positives (comprising of True Positives and False Positives) whereas ii) Recall is the ratio of True Positives out of True Positives and False Negatives.", "Curious to know if this can be improved in a substantial manner, let\u2019s explore Deep Learning using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) which is reputable for working with images.", "The CNN architecture comprises of many layers. Each layer will extract certain features (e.g contrast, shapes, edges, texture) from the training pictures for each class . The trained model is then subsequently applied to unseen pictures which are then classified using the trained feature elements.", "Indeed, the CNN model with the Adam optimizer and early stopping is the best model, beating the XGBoost with a new 0.84 F1 score associated with the trained network. The superiority of the Adam optimizer lies in its adaptive learning rate and favoured due to its relatively less parameters tuning. Below are the codes for my model and classification report for the associated F1 score.", "\u201crestore_best_weight\u201d ensures that the model will retrieve the best weights achieved through the epoch runs.", "Putting the model to the test with 3 unseen pictures, one from each class, here are the results:", "Taking a step further, even if my creative kids were to someday write me a note on a decorated piece of paper or couple a \u201cgift\u201d with their notes, the model can still confidently classify these as excuses.", "Image classification is a subset of image recognition which has widespread use in the security industry (facial recognition), virtual search engine (object finder in stores), healthcare (emotion detection in patients) and gaming and augmented reality. In a way, smartphone cameras have made all these advances possible with multitudes of pictures that can be easily created.
