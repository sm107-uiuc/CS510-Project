As everything becomes defined by data, they are stored in matrices. At the center of the matrix \u2014 through the complexities and complications \u2014 lie the eigenvectors and eigenvalues, providing clarity and revealing the nature of the matrix. Understanding what they are, how to derive them, and their applications are integral to appreciating the beauty of the matrix and, more broadly, the role data and mathematics play in the world.", "Let us consider, first, the two-dimensional vector, which has two elements, each corresponding to one coordinate on the two-dimensional plane. They represent movements from one coordinate to another.", "When one multiplies a vector by a matrix, they are applying a linear transformation. This has the effect of stretching (or squishing) the coordinate system along two vectors. For instance, the matrix [[3, 1], [1, 2]] aligns the x-axis along the vector [3, 1] (the first column) and the y-axis along the vector [1, 2]. Visually, one can tell that the point (0, 1) is actually mapped to (1, 2), and this can be confirmed by multiplying it by the matrix.", "Say we have a vector [-1, -1]. After it is multiplied by the linear transformation matrix, it lands on the point [-4, -3].", "A vector\u2019s span is the line that runs through the vector forever. When a vector undergoes a linear transformation (is multiplied by the matrix), usually it is knocked off of its span.", "However, some types of vectors don\u2019t get knocked off their span. These are the eigenvectors of a matrix. Instead, when the eigenvectors are multiplied by the matrix, the eigenvector is simply scaled by a factor of the eigenvalue, landing somewhere else along their span.", "Because of the nature of the eigenvector, simply scaling a base eigenvector in the same or directly opposite direction will yield yet another eigenvector.", "In three dimensions, the matrix describes a transformation of three axes \u2014 x, y, and z \u2014 corresponding to the three coordinates that represent the transformation each coordinate undergoes. This is why eigenvectors and eigenvalues are only defined for square matrices; a general n by n matrix describes the transformation of n axes, each corresponding to a coordinate with n elements.", "In order to find the eigenvector of a matrix, we first need to find the eigenvalue of it. From the definition of the eigenvalue, we can construct an equality Ax = \u03bbx, where A represents the matrix and \u03bb represents the eigenvalue. This makes sense; multiplying the eigenvector by the transformation matrix x should have the same effect as scaling it by an eigenvalue \u03bb.", "From this relationship, we can move both terms over to the left side. In order to make the expression A - \u03bb valid (A is a matrix and \u03bb is a number), we multiply \u03bb by an identity matrix, which applies no transformation at all.", "As seen above, there are an infinite number of trivial solutions, or solutions that can be achieved simply by scaling an eigenvector by any number. In order to get rid of trivial solutions, we use the determinant.", "The determinant is simply a measure of the factor in which area is stretched by a transformation matrix. Consider, for instance, one standard square on the coordinate plane, with an area of one square unit.", "When the space is stretched by a transformation matrix, the new area is four square units. Because the area increased by a factor of four, the determinant of the matrix is four.", "When the determinant is equal to 0, the area of the square is collapsed to zero, meaning that the two vectors describing the locations of the axes are on the same line. In this case, all of space is warped into one single line (one-dimensional). By setting a requirement in which the determinant must be equal to zero, the space of redundant or trivial solutions can be discarded, making the equation much more solvable.", "Hence, in order for the previously devised equality to be (easily) solvable, it must be true first that the determinant of the matrix must be equal to zero.", "Finding the eigenvalue is then a task of solving a quadratic. For 3+ dimension matrices, a different form of the determinant formula must be used.", "In this case, the eigenvalues of the matrix [[1, 4], [3, 2]] are 5 and -2. This means that when the eigenvectors of the matrix are multiplied by the matrix, their vector length will be stretched by a factor of 5 and -2, respective to each of the eigenvectors. By plugging in the discovered eigenvalues into our originally derived equation, we can find the eigenvectors.", "Eigenvectors and eigenvalues are, indeed, the jewel of the matrix. It embodies the spirit and nature of the matrix \u2014 eigen is the German word for \u2018innate\u2019. Given only the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of any matrix, one can easily completely reconstruct the original matrix. With this special property, eigenvectors are almost completely guaranteed to show up wherever there is a matrix operation.", "Consider, for instance, principal component analysis (PCA), a common unsupervised machine learning technique that seeks to reduce the dimensionality of data whilst retaining key statistical measures like variance and mean. For instance, consider a 100-dimension dataset, which PCA will attempt to downsize into two dimensions. First, the algorithm constructs a covariance matrix, which evaluates (in a sense) how correlated two variables are. The matrix as a whole defines the shape of the data.", "The eigenvectors of the covariance matrix are used to reorient the data among the x and y axes along lines of the greatest variance. In essence, eigenvectors are used as a snapshot of the matrix, which tells the algorithm which areas to amplify and which to deafen. Countless other applications of eigenvectors and eigenvalues, from machine learning to topology, utilize the key feature that eigenvectors provide so much useful information about a matrix \u2014 applied everywhere from finding the line of rotation in a four-dimensional cube to compressing high-dimensional images to Google\u2019s search rank algorithm.", "Perhaps the reason why eigenvectors and eigenvalues are so special is because of its definition \u2014 the vectors whose direction remains unchanged whilst space around them is warped, pointing forever through the complexity at the true beauty of the matrix.", "If you enjoyed, you may also like an introduction to calculus, a field of mathematics that is just as important and fascinating as linear algebra:", "Your home for data science.
