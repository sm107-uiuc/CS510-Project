All the bikes are connected and produce a myriad of data. Most operators provide data focusing on stations/bike availability. However, Trasport for London (TfL) distributes in their open data platform the movement of their bikes (Santander BSS) using the bike ID allowing you to follow what every bike does in the network. \ud83d\ude2e", "This opens new possibilities in how we can analyse the data. For this article, we are going to look at how we can use data mining techniques to understand communities within London\u2019 BSS.", "A community can mean many things. The Cambridge Dictionary defines it as:", "The people living in one particular area or people who are considered as a unit because of their common interests, social group, or nationality", "Within the context of transport systems, this is not too far from what we want to do. Namely, we want to reduce the complexity of a transport network into units or clusters that behave similarly. Here we will cluster stations into groups to get a better understanding of how the system works and be able to make better operational decisions.", "Using R and other tools we are going to simplify the Origin-Destination data available to us from the London Data Store.", "The datasets of our choice have been extracted and copied into our working directory. Our selected period is from June to July 2014 which includes 1.5 million trips. There are a few steps we need to take before we can pass it through our community detection algorithms.", "To load it I used the excellent fread() function from data.table. In addition, we need to remove bike IDs and End Stations that are missing or equal to zero. We remove stations that only exist as destinations (maintenance shops) and weekends which would require a separate analysis.", "There are many community detection algorithms, most of them detect clusters using a measure of modularity. However, in this analysis we will compare this against state of the art community detection algorithm Infomap which improves on modularity based methods relaxing key assumptions:", "These will prove to be very relevant to the accurate detection of transport clusters.", "We will compare the following methodologies:", "All of these can be run within the great igraph library. The latest version of the binaries of Infomap was not implemented at the time of the analysis and we decided to use the binaries directly.", "For running Infomap algorithms as a system command we can use the following. Note it has only been tested on MacOSX but it should work if you have Infomap\u2019s binaries in the right folder. The Infomap community detection is done using version v0.19.3. Instructions on how to run Infomap on your machine can be found here.", "Infomap outperforms modularity based community detection algorithms in finding known physical structures in the London network (such as Canary Wharf and Hyde Park).", "None of these algorithms was given information about the location of the station. But the results on all are remarkably space dependant.", "Given the size of the Central / East community, we suspect there could be hidden communities in it. At the same time, Canary Wharf and Hyde Park seem mostly self-contained.", "A separated visualisation of the Infomap clustering created using Gephi software. It also shows the trips in between the different stations during the study period.", "As an extra bit of analysis, we perform a dynamic community detection using only Infomap. The analysis shows that communities are time-dependent and the communities are driven by space, time and location.", "The lack of trips at night makes it impossible to find patterns which could change if we are to expand the time frame of the data analysed. The commuting patterns in the morning and afternoon peaks can also lead to extreme results where the optimum number of clusters is only one.", "This methodology allows us to gain operational insight into how the network operates. It can help decision-makers to improve the network and logistic operators to optimise their bike movements. We are able to find geographically remote or specialised communities with consistent usage patterns that traditional approaches couldn\u2019t.", "This article is a companion post for the following paper", "You can find the preprint here and some code used to generate the plots and results in here.", "Your home for data science.
