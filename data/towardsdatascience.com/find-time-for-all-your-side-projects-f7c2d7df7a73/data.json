These can be anything from coding projects to household ideas, playing an instrument, writing, reading, working out.", "Any habit that you wish you did regularly but you don\u2019t start because they would take up many hours per week and you don\u2019t have that kind of time.", "If you\u2019re already efficient with your time and don\u2019t have any time left in your week, you don\u2019t need this post. You clearly spend your time as you want and have no time left for side projects, and that\u2019s totally fine.", "But if you have project ideas, tend to procrastinate, sometimes feel like you don\u2019t know where the time went, or in general feel like you could be spending your time better, read on :)", "What are my qualifications to be talking about time management? I\u2019m no productivity expert (because there\u2019s no such thing), but I\u2019ve been managing my time and productivity for years and I\u2019ve found a system that works very well for me and for some people I\u2019ve recommended it to. I\u2019ll make another post about that if there\u2019s interest.", "But one of the struggles I\u2019ve had is finding time for side projects, which ideally I\u2019d spend many hours per week on and of course I don\u2019t have time. So they kept accumulating, until some months ago I decided to try something.", "In my particular case, these were my potential side projects:", "As you can see, this is a lot on top of my already busy schedule with uni, work, and life. Previously, I\u2019d tackle one of them, but they\u2019re very long (the first two especially), reading papers is a never-ending task, things would get in the way and I\u2019d stop. So this is what I thought.", "I can find 1h a week for algorithms, 1h a week for freecodecamp, I can read one paper a week.", "I thought: what\u2019s the minimum time I can spend with any of these tasks so that I can do some small progress and still be satisfied? In my case, usually, 1h is enough for an exercise, or the majority of it. One paper a week is doable. 15mins a day playing the flute is good enough.", "Spending so little time with the algorithm book means I won\u2019t finish it in months, I won\u2019t finish the freecodecamp curriculum in months, same with my paper list, but none of this is urgent. And this way, each week, I\u2019m doing small progress in many different things.", "Allocate the minimum amount of time necessary to make small but meaningful progress in your project.", "Now, how do we do that?", "I\u2019d advise you to write a list of side projects you\u2019d like to start with. Go through them and allocate the minimum time a week you\u2019re comfortable with.", "30min/week writing, 1 exercise/week, 5min/day reading, 5min/day working out, make it so little time that it seems it\u2019s nothing. The more you struggle with it, the less time you put. Surely you can do it for 5 minutes, whatever it is! After that, you can stop and feel accomplished. And who knows, maybe after you start you\u2019ll want to do more.", "I have a file on my computer because I change many things throughout the week, but you can do it in a notebook as well.", "Have a \u2018to do\u2019 list in your file/sheet with clearly defined tasks, either time or content. Each night before bed review it and think: which of these things can I accomplish tomorrow? Will I have a busy day or more relaxed? Where can I find the time? Mark those tasks somehow, and be realistic.", "The following day, make it your mission to do the 5 or 30 mins of those tasks. Before breakfast, during your break, when you feel like you\u2019re procrastinating. Just do them, they don\u2019t take very long.", "At night, whether you managed to do them or not, sit down again and reevaluate. Move the tasks you did to another list like \u2018done\u2019, and mark the tasks you think you can do tomorrow again.", "During the week, you\u2019ll be moving more tasks to the \u2018done\u2019 list. On Sunday evening, maybe you\u2019ll have an empty \u2018to do\u2019 list, or maybe not. Review your week, are you satisfied with it? Did you procrastinate a lot? Could you have done those remaining tasks somehow? Update the \u2018to do\u2019 list for next week, and don\u2019t put too many things.", "Important: there is no failing with this system, you\u2019re on this journey with yourself. If you feel you can\u2019t do more, then you can\u2019t do more. No one is watching, this is just for you. If you don\u2019t finish your list, delete some items. Start small, experiment.", "It\u2019s incredibly satisfying to see an (almost) empty \u2018to do\u2019 list and a packed \u2018done\u2019 list on Sunday. But more importantly, it feels fantastic to be doing some progress with all these projects, however small. Because something is better than nothing.", "I encourage you to try the idea of this method, change it as you wish to make it work for you, and don\u2019t overwork yourself. I started some months ago, some weeks are busier than others but I\u2019m making steady progress and I couldn\u2019t be happier.", "If you want to tell me how you\u2019re doing or chat with me about anything, you can find me on twitter.
