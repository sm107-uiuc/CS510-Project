You can check out the 1st part to have an overview of the retail market in Vietnam, the original problem statement, and data sources used in my analysis.", "In the previous part, I reviewed the stores' footprint from major retail brands in Vietnam across the country and used the clustering technique to find the provinces that should be considered as attractive markets for expansion. As I explored the data earlier, it\u2019s no surprise that the majority of stores are located in Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) \u2014 the biggest markets in the country. Therefore, in this 2nd part, I want to deep dive further into the network of stores from each brand in these two cities.", "For this post, I will mainly discuss my findings for HCMC because of two main reasons: (1) HCM is the bigger market (considering the population, population density and average income per person between the two cities); and (2) Hanoi market was dominated by Vinmart stores and not many brands can compete against Vinmart (among retail stores in Hanoi, not including mom-and-pop shops, Vinmart stores makes up to 77%), while the opposite is true for HCMC.", "When deep-diving into HCMC store networks and location, I followed three steps:", "To explore this aspect, I looked at how stores are located relative to other stores in the same network and to the population density within the city. For example: with Vinmart (a network of both supermarket and convenient stores), I explored different visualizations as follow:", "From left to right, the maps show HCMC population density (people/sq.km, at the district level, the darker color represent higher density) and:", "To view the interactive version of the maps above, please use the link included in the description of each map.", "Looking at the store' clusters of the two brands with the highest stores count in HCMC \u2014 VinMart and BachHoaXanh (BHX), we can see a prominent difference: while VinMart stores are located densely (80% stores) in the city center, BHX stores are more spread out and less focus on the densest areas (District 3, 5, 10 and 11). This difference may reflect the brand strategy regarding its target customers.", "To compare the geographical coverage of the store network from different brands, I used the buffer function in geopandas to obtain the collection of all points within a given distance of each store in the same network.", "For example, two maps above show the collection of all points within a 500-meter distance of each store from Vinmart and BHX \u2014 the two stores network with the highest number of stores in HCMC. No surprise that Vinmart stores are mostly located in the center of the city where higher population density is observed, covering substantially the center area. On the other hand, the BHX stores network leaves a considerable portion of the area in the city center with no stores despite the assumed high population density.", "To further compare the coverage, I looked at the percentage of area in HCMC that is within a given distance (between 100 meters and 1 km) of each store from different brands, using the .intersect and .area function from geopandas.", "As a result, this line chart presents the percentage of area in HCMC that is within a given distance between 100 meters and 1km for store network from VinMart, BHX, CircleK, CoOp (including Coopfood and Coopsmile), Satra and other retail brands in HCMC.", "The higher the number of stores, the higher the coverage observed, as per expectation. However, the only exception is that BHX surpasses VinMart in terms of coverage with a distance of around 600 meters or higher, despite the fact that BHX has 20% fewer stores compared to VinMart. This can be explained by the fact that ~80% of VinMart stores located in the city center districts, while that number is only ~68% for BHX. As a result, with the increase in distance of buffer, VinMart store network\u2019s coverage increases at a slower rate compared to that of BHX.", "For leading retail brands: Using buffer and coverage analysis, companies can identify the geographic gap in their store network and address the gap to further strengthen their store network.", "For example, the figure below addresses the geographic gap in the BHX store network. If BHX desires to strengthen the network by increasing the coverage with a distance of 500-meters, the company can consider some of the highlighted areas included in the figure below for further store opening.", "Are all gaps in the store footprint needed to be closed? It depends on the company strategy and goals in the market.", "For smaller retail brands or new entrants: they can use the same technique to find the gap in their direct competitors\u2019 store footprint, or in the overall stores' footprint of major brands in the market for opportunities.", "Please feel free to share your valuable comments on this analysis.
