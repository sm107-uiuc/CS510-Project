John Hopkins University even has a course on building a data science team [2]! I will share my own personal experience in building a data team in a startup. This article will share what is a data team, when and why startups need this team, how I formed a data team, and finally I will close with recommendations on forming a data team. This article aims to give insight for new startups leaders that have started to think about how should they form a data team.", "Airy, founded in 2015, is a virtual hotel operator in Indonesia [5] (in Bahasa Indonesia). We have invested in technology that may change the accommodation industry. Unfortunately, we have to close down due to the current pandemic situation [6]. However, feel free to browse what we have written in the past about our technologies! [7]", "A data team is a team that has a function to bring values from large and overwhelming data sources. Each team has its own function and by function, a first definition that comes to my mind is given an input transform that input into output [3].", "Large and overwhelming data sources are inputs. As I have mentioned, there are 3 characteristics that need to be fulfilled: large, overwhelming, and various (hence I said data sources), and this characteristic translates directly from the definition of Big Data [4]. The volume of data would typically be large, thus it will need special software architecture to bring down the cost of storing that data. Overwhelming here means that the velocity of the data is so large that it should be handled with care to bring down the latency of processing. Finally, various means of the variety of data formats will add complexity to process the data itself. These factors will require a significant amount of effort, thus forming a team does make sense.", "Bringing value is the output. The data team needs to bring values to the business in the form of descriptive, prescriptive, or predictive analysis. Most of the efforts and value of this team will be spent on descriptive analysis, either in the form of dashboards, reports, or EDA. Prescriptive analysis will need more collaboration from other divisions like marketing, product, design. Predictive analysis will be conducted when both business and team skills have matured.", "I was recently asked, by a former colleague, when should we form a team if we are in the early stage of a startup? It is an interesting question, in my opinion, because nobody even bothers to ask me that simple but challenging question. I came at the relatively early stage of startup straight to the data team, at that time we had a different data team lead so my CTO has envisioned that this company needs a data team.", "I came up with a One Gigabyte Transactions Rule. Some people need to make a quantifiable adjustment on when to form a team, or when to hire a data team lead. One may be wondering why one gigabyte? Isn\u2019t it easily stored in a external flash disk? The beauty of this rule, or should I say guideline, is not the exact boundary line itself, but what the other considerations are. Relating to the input of the data team, we can expand this question to: how fast are we achieving that? And the assumption of various data sources.", "How fast will a company achieve one gigabyte of transactions? Now, this could be hard for business people to transform this into a time estimate. You will need to assume how much size does one transaction will contribute. I would arbitrarily assume that you need at least 10 columns and each column is a string/varchar with 255 lengths for a transaction, resulting in approximately 2.5 kilobytes (1 gigabyte = 1 million kb). That will translate the question into: how fast will a company achieve 400,000 transactions? Now business people can project this value. We can further divide into 2 decision boundaries: is it this year? Or is it not? If that is this year then you might want to consider forming a data team, otherwise, you might want to ask for an opinion from your engineering manager if any.", "When achieving this one gigabyte transactions or 400k transactions, I have also assumed the data sources will vary. Your company probably has multiple products to achieve that number or collecting a lot of other data, such as surveys or user activities data that could be stored in various types of databases.", "I will start with the end. These are some technical roles that I\u2019ve defined along with my leadership in the data team (excluding leadership variation).", "Other companies\u2019 roles will vary, for example, there are Business Intelligence Engineer, Data Engineer, Data Warehouse Engineer, Machine Learning Engineer, Data Ops, etc. From an outsider perspective, you might wonder, why? In my experience, this differentiation phenomenon happened because of the effect of both job markets and the evolution of job descriptions in our tech environment.", "I started with 2 very simple roles: data scientist and software engineer. \u201cData Scientist\u201d title seems to appeal to more talents than \u201cData Analyst\u201d. And when I said \u201ctalents\u201d are not just a number of people, but somewhat people that at least have the motivation to learn more about the \u201ccool\u201d stuff. However, what these people under \u201cData Scientist\u201d role did was", "Then reality hit me: businesses at the early stages don\u2019t really need to implement sophisticated statistics and artificial intelligence solutions unless those are your core business value. Then came the next differentiation: \u201cData Analyst\u201d role. The role\u2019s purpose: maintaining data lakes, making reports, making descriptive dashboards. However, they don\u2019t completely decouple these roles from data scientists, and that is okay.", "At a certain point, I and a technical recruiter had a hard time filtering candidate pools because there are too many variations of background which we didn\u2019t expect. I have checked our job description and candidate requirements, it seemed fine then how to make this filtering more efficient? I hypothesized that the \u201cData Analyst\u201d name is too generic and might even be a homonym, which has multiple interpretations for different people. I decided to benchmark other companies and came out with \u201cBusiness Intelligence Analyst\u201d. Since then, we have managed to populate more relevant candidates into this pool.", "What about software engineers? Why didn\u2019t it evolve? I decided to outsource 80% of the engineering load by architecting third-party solutions. It kept my engineering size to an average of 2 people. Because of this number, I am hesitant to add more roles to split the software engineering role.", "Using the one-gigabyte transaction rule, you can predict your needs to form a data team. Forming too fast might result in a lack of work to be done and could lead to the de-motivation of team members. It might also scramble your tech focuses and budget, as you may know, big data technologies are not cheap and require a significant amount of focus to maintain. Forming too late might result in too many backlogs to be done, you have to remember that finding the best candidate takes your resources, especially for senior and leadership positions.", "Data engineering is the heart of the data team. It provides a foundation and infrastructure to be used for other data roles. If you choose to buy your data infrastructure, you might need an experienced data engineer as your consultant, because the third party choice nowadays is just so many! If you choose to build your own solution using open source services, you definitely need experienced data engineer and an engineering team specialized to maintain that architecture.", "Hiring is an important process for your team. It will determine the success of your team. However, in my experience, attracting talent for the data team is super hard! There are more in the software engineering role, which luckily is possible to transfer their skills to data roles.", "These are my experiences and opinions in building a data team in Airy Indonesia. People will have different experiences and opinions, and I have laid out mine to be learned from. I have been honoured to be given a chance to work and to meet many extraordinary people there. I hope this and my upcoming publications, related to managing a data team, will be useful, especially for startup leaders. I will welcome any constructive comments and discussions.
