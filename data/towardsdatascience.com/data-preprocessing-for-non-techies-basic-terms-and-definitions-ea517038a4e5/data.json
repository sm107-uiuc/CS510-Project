Make sure to follow me, in order to read the next posts more focused on feature engineering, model selection, etc.", "Keep in mind that some of these terms differ depending on the language or platform you are using. But, I hope it gives you a nice overview.", "Data objects: an instance or observation containing a set of characteristics. For example, every person (row) on the table.", "Attributes: characteristics of an object . Also called features, variables, tuples, or dimensions. For example, the marital status (column) per person (row).", "Record: Data that consists of a collection of objects, each of which consists of a fixed set of attributes. For example, the table above. Records aren\u2019t the only type of data set, but the most common, so we will focus on this ones for now.", "Vector: a collection of values for an attribute. For example, \u2018Single, Married, Divorced\u2019 for Marital Status. All values should be the same data type.", "Matrix: in general terms, it is the same as a table but more flexible. The secret is that matrices are all composed of data the same type, and you can apply algebraic functions to them.", "Frame: a frame, can be seen as a \u201csnapshot\u201d of a table. Usually used in R, to reduce the size of the table we are working with, or create a new format. We use data frames, instead of matrices or vectors when columns are of different data types (numeric/character/logical etc.).", "There are four types of data that may be gathered, each one adding more to the next (if gathered correctly). Thus ordinal data is also nominal, and so on. A useful acronym to help remember this is NOIR (French for \u2018black\u2019).", "Interval and ratio data are parametric, used with parametric tools in which distributions are predictable (and often Normal).", "Nominal and ordinal data are non-parametric, and do not assume any particular distribution. They are used with non-parametric tools such as the Histogram.", "Qualitative data commonly summarized using percentages/proportions, while numeric summarized using average/means.", "When the precision provided by decimal (up to 38 digits) is insufficient, use float or real type of values.", "A single-precision floating-point number is a 32-bit approximation of a real number. The number can be zero or can range from -3.402E+38 to -1.175E-37, or from 1.175E-37 to 3.402E+38. The range of n is 1 to 24. IBM DB2 internally represents the single-precision FLOAT data type as the REAL data type.", "If n is not specified the default value is 53.", "Key Takeaway: You can have, for example, a record with an attribute that is qualitative, categorical, ordinal, continuous, with decimal as a value and that you might need to identify it as real to increase precision. Each of these descriptors will determine how you clean, model and test the data.", "If you thought this was useful, please SHARE it with your friends and CLAP BACK.
