Before you charge in, bear in mind that this is geared towards professionals who want to display their competency in topics like distributed model training and scaling to production.", "Students who don\u2019t have practical work experience would be better served by first doing hands-on projects.", "Getting this certificate won\u2019t be easy. In fact, looking at the exam guide, you need very in-depth knowledge in six areas, including highly specialized topics like permission issues, dataset lineage, and data feasibility.", "That\u2019s why Google recommends you have 3+ years of experience with GCloud products. If you do fit that profile, then this certificate is extremely valuable for one simple reason. No one has it yet.", "To remind you of the most basic lesson in economics: As supply increases, demand decreases.", "Intuitively, if there are 1,000 job openings and 600 ML Engineer certificate holders, they\u2019ll have a much easier time landing jobs and getting high salaries than if there were 6,000 or 60,000 certificate holders.", "As beta registration just opened, there are now 0 people with this certificate. However, as Google is a leader in AI, cloud computing, and one of the world\u2019s biggest tech companies, it won\u2019t be long until you see these new certifications all over the place.", "Indeed, the famous AI researcher Andrew Ng has a whopping 4 million learners across his Coursera courses. In the meantime, there are just 17,100 ML Engineers worldwide.", "While it\u2019s great to learn from those courses, and it\u2019s possible that having a certification from them may provide a modest boost in some scenarios, they don\u2019t have nearly the value they did a few years ago.", "So, if you\u2019re looking to get into ML Engineering, it\u2019s best not to hesitate on Google\u2019s new opportunity. If you want a more general data science job, check out this guide:", "Note that Google Cloud is not the most popular cloud platform \u2014 that award goes to AWS, which has a Machine Learning certificate of its own.", "At first glance, career-wise, going with AWS would be the better option. However, if we head to LinkedIn and search for \u201cAWS Certified Machine Learning\u201d (including the quotes), we get almost 2,000 results. Those are only the certified people who (1) have a LinkedIn and (2) bothered to add its exact name to their profile.", "Remember from earlier that there\u2019s only a very limited number of ML Engineering jobs to go around, so to be competitive, you\u2019ll want to find a less-explored niche.", "With 0 current holders, getting the Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer certificate is a \u201cblue ocean\u201d strategy: It\u2019s a wide, open space without competition. Getting a Coursera certificate is on the extreme other end of the spectrum, and is a \u201cred ocean\u201d strategy: There are millions of other sharks in the water. An AWS certificate lies somewhere in the middle.", "At the end of the day, it\u2019s important to remember that certificates aren\u2019t everything. In fact, they shouldn\u2019t even be the core of your application \u2014 they should be supplemental to a strong profile based on practical skills and experience.", "A simple process you can use to spice up your profile is picking a topic you\u2019re interested in, analyzing the associated data, creating insightful visuals and commentary, and sharing it with your network.", "Data science can benefit practically any industry \u2014 whether you\u2019re interested in churn analysis, driving e-commerce sales, or people analytics, pick a topic that suits you and spread your learnings.", "The wrong thing to do is just share certificates on social media.", "Certificates aren\u2019t the end-all-be-all, but the new Google Professional Machine Learning Engineer certificate is a great option for professionals seeking to advance their careers.", "Your home for data science.
