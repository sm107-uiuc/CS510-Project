Because of this, a higher GDP per capita is considered \u2018better\u2019 for the average person. But what exactly does \u2018better\u2019 mean, and does it correlate with happiness? If so, it would seem reasonable to guess that higher GDP per capita countries have happier people. Furthermore, if we took a continent such as Africa, which has many poor countries, its population \u2018should\u2019 be less happy, on average, than rich countries\u2019 populations, right? Well, what does the data tell us?", "What I\u2019ll attempt to do in this article is correlate GDP per capita and happiness in Africa using Python. For this, I\u2019ll use The World Bank Data site and The World Happiness Report \u2014 the latter being an annual survey which attempts to measure happiness in 156 countries throughout the world. Specifically, I\u2019ll use one measure from the report: \u2018Life Ladder\u2019. This measure comes from the question: \u201cConsider a ladder, with the best possible life being a 10, and the worst, a 0. In which step of the ladder are you in this moment of your life?\u201d, and is the mean of the answers in each country.", "Note: I will reference \u2018Life Ladder\u2019 as \u2018happiness\u2019 throughout the article. This is a simplification, happiness itself is obviously impossible to accurately measure.", "First off, let\u2019s import the required libraries: Pandas for data structuring, Matplotlib and Seaborn for graph plotting and statistics, and GeoPandas for geographical map plotting.", "Let\u2019s import and clean it in order to remove any unwanted variables and to organize the ones we want.", ", where life ladder is a DataFrame with countries as rows and \u2018Life Ladder\u2019 as a column, world is a GeoDataFrame with the position of every country in the world, and gdp_2016 is a DataFrame with the GDP per capita \u2014 adjusted by PPP \u2014 in 2016, which is also the year of the happiness data.", "Now, let\u2019s join the DataFrames together and select the data for African countries.", "This it what we have up to this point: a DataFrame with all the African countries, their geographic positions \u2014needed for plotting them geographically \u2014 , their Life Ladder values, and their GDP per capita. All that\u2019s left to do is plot the data!", "First, let\u2019s plot the Life Ladder data. Now, if we simply ask Python to plot the African data, it will give us a color scheme which is \u2018normalized\u2019 for Africa, but it is more interesting to know how happy Africa is in comparison with the rest of the world. Otherwise, we would only know how happy Africans are among other Africans.", "In order to solve this, we need to specify that the minimum and maximum values come from the whole \u2018Life Ladder\u2019 data, and not just from the African data.", "With this piece of code, we have an African map with a color scheme which considers happiness all throughout the world, where the grey countries are the ones with no data. Moreover, the legend also considers this \u2014dark blue are the really happy countries in the world, and light blue; the really unhappy.", "Insight 1: The \u2018happiest\u2019 African country is roughly 60% as happy as the happiest country in the world. Meanwhile, the \u2018unhappiest\u2019 African country is among the unhappiest ones in the world.", "Similarly, we can also plot the GDP per capita.", "Insight 2: Nothing unsual here; The country in Africa with the highest GDP per capita has only around 25\u201330% of the GDP per capita of the highest one in the world.", "If we put both African maps side by side, we can clearly see that GDP per capita and happiness don\u2019t relate in a 1:1 manner in Africa. If that were the case, they would have very similar colors. Instead, despite the GDP per capita map being practically white, the happiness one is much more colorful.", "Insight 3: Despite having around 22% of the average wealth per capita of the rest of the world, African countries have around 74% of the average \u2018happiness\u2019 of the rest of the world.", "Insight 4: Insight 3 does not imply that GDP per capita does not impact happiness! It only means that, as is, African countries are poor, but they aren\u2019t as unhappy as they are poor.", "In order to conclude how GDP per capita impacts happiness marginally, we need to run a regression.", "Insight 6: Because the orange slope is higher than the blue one, this means that, if you are poor, a unit of GDP per capita has a much bigger effect on your happiness than if you are rich! In economic terms, happiness is marginally decreasing in GDP per capita.", "Feel free to message me if you\u2019d like to comment or criticize!
