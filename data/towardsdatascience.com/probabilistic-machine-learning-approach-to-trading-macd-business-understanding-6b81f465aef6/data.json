We decided to go into the crypto market because of its volatility. To maintain our partnership, we need to make consistent profits. We want to use machine learning without forgetting about the business understanding used by traders. Now, the only thing we need to know is HOW (Wow\u2026 I\u2019m definitively using that in my next freestyle competition). Will we accomplish this? Let\u2019s figure it out!", "Quick answer: Yes, that\u2019s my intention. I invite you to spend your next 18 minutes \u2014 according to Medium estimation \u2014 here with me. If you don\u2019t have the time now, just add this link to your notepad, but to make the most from here, I want all your attention. I know I\u2019m asking for a lot, but I assure you that this will worth it. So, Why I\u2019m writing this?:", "First: I\u2019ve seen a lot of trading-related articles with incredible models trained, using impressive algorithms, cool visualizations, and excellent writing style. But what I didn\u2019t find explained in greater detail, is an easy example with the basic to understand how to use them in the real world.", "Second: A vast quantity of these articles can be cataloged in groups like the following: \u201cSet up your strategies with your own trading-bot\u201d and \u201cBest Machine Learning model to predict stock price.\u201d", "The \u201ctrading-bot\u201d type are great to understand logics that can adequately reflect interactions between indicators and observable chart behaviors: Business Understanding. On the other side, machine learning models are great using indicators as variables capturing a wider scene of the market: Data Science Knowledge.", "What I\u2019ve missed, though, it\u2019s a fusion of these concepts. The problem with trading bots is that a simple rigid strategy might not be supported by other indicators. \u201cStock price\u201d type, on the other hand, focuses on indicators, but they lack context, and without that, they are usually useless, or at least less effective.", "As you can see, I will try to give you my sight on how to tackle those problems. In my effort to focus this on the concepts recently exposed, I will leave behind some details of the model training part (like model selection or hyperparameter tunning). The idea tested will be how much we can improve our accuracy if we manage to grab those business concepts and mix them with our data science knowledge. Our agenda:", "First, let\u2019s start by its definition in a trading context.", "Risk management: \u201cis the process used to mitigate or protect your personal trading account from the danger of losing all your account balance.\u201d", "This process involves different decisions, and if you want, it can acquire incredible complexity. That\u2019s beyond of our scope, for now, so we will be focusing on just two of them:", "To transform our bets into calculated movements, we need to evaluate the scenario to understand what our odds are. And because we are not gamblers, we need to define our stop-loss (S/L) and take-profit (T/P) points. Those are the values that we defined to put an end to our trade.", "Imagine a utopian world where COVID-19 is eradicated, and Ethereum reaches 1000 USD$ again. At that point, we decide to buy some. Also, we felt that if the value drops more than 20%, we might be in a dangerous place, so we will sell it if the value goes beyond 800 USD$ (S/L). On the other side, if the value rises more than 25%, we will be gladly selling it, taking our 250 USD$ profit (T/P).", "If we forget about the time variable, on every trade we have just two outcomes, we can win, or we can lose, depending on which price it\u2019s reached first (S/L or T/P). Imagine that we think that we have a 45% chance of winning and 55% of losing. The expected return is calculated as follows.", "You can see that is the sum of the multiplication between the probability of all given cases and the return of them. For our example, the expected return is 2.5 USD$ per trade. This means that if the odds are right, and we repeat this process, for instance, 100 times, we will make an estimated 250 USD$ profit.", "Another essential task is to define the maximum amount that we are willing to lose in just one single trade. This is because if we go for trades that endanger 20% of our money in one movement, and we have the \u2014 totally plausible \u2014 lousy luck of losing our first 3 trades. We would end up with half of our money, tears on our eyes, and our beautiful friendship probably ended.", "To avoid that, because of the difficulty of going back from such a loss and because of how much I appreciate our friendship, I propose to you that we use the typical 1% rule. This means that if we have 1,199 USD$, we are not allowed to lose more than 11.99 USD per trade.", "I\u2019m a risk lover, so I impose you that on every trade, our losing scenario will be the maximum 1% lose defined (That\u2019s for simplicity on our example, I\u2019m not that bad). There\u2019s something important to consider while doing this, independent of our outcome, we need to pay fees. What a painful reality!", "Let\u2019s say we use the best fees on the market for rookie traders. We choose Binance. They have a 0.1% commission for takers and makers. This means that if we buy Ethereum by 1.000 USDT (here is why USDT and not USD), we need to pay 1 USDT fee, just for buying.", "Our S/L and T/P will be -1% and 1%, respectively (remember that it can be any S/L and T/P points that you want to evaluate). If the values reach the 990 we are in the obligation to sell, don\u2019t forget, though, that we need to pay 0.99 USDT for that second transaction. In that scenario, we lose 11.99 USDT, the maximum amount tolerated for our initial capital of 1,199 USD$, which now makes total sense.", "In case the price reaches the T/P point first, we take the 10 USDT profit, and fees for 2.01 USDT, which means that we would make a 7.99 USDT positive balance. Given this scenario, what are the odds for a positive outcome that we need to invest in here? If you quickly answer 60% you possess impressive quick calculation skills, here is the mathematical procedure, given that P(n), is the probability of a negative outcome, P(p) of a positive one and1-P(n)=P(p).", "We need our expected return (1) to be higher or equal than zero. Otherwise, we would be consistently losing money. An important takeaway from this is that if we increase the S/L and T/P percent, we don\u2019t need P(p) to be that high. For example, if we evaluate our last scenario with 3% and -3%, we would have required just 53.3% to take the trade.", "That\u2019s why I envy every person who can create an account on RobinHood. I\u2019m not allowed because I\u2019m \u201cfrom outside the United States.\u201d As you can see, trading without fees leaves you in a much better position. You don\u2019t start losing. But enough of me complaining, let\u2019s go for what brings us here.", "We talked a lot about expected\u00a0return, so we are definitely using that approach, but it\u2019s not the only one. Indeed the most common I\u2019ve seen is using measurements of volatility (clearly explained in here) for an estimation of the risk of the transaction. I\u2019m telling you this because that\u2019s the standard approximation\u200a\u2014\u200awhich won\u2019t be used here to maintain the structure\u200a\u2014\u200abut is a great option too.", "We are both smart but without much experience in the crypto market. So we understand that our guts and the Bollinger Bands\u00ae article we saw once, are not enough for defining the probability associated to our S/L and T/P points. Now our goal is to think which machine learning algorithm is best-suited for this problem.", "We see the problem compose by a positive and a negative outcome. Because of that, we can assert that it\u2019s a standard binary classification problem. Also, we need a classifier capable of giving us the probability of every outcome under certain circumstances. Ideally something like this:", "Why like that? Because we NEED to know the odds to check if the expected return of our trade is positive. It\u2019s not enough for us a simple \u201cis going to go up\u201d signal. This type of model is cataloged as a class-probability estimation. Trading is not about winning all the entries. It\u2019s about probabilities!", "Even though we can discard a lot of options with that classification for different motives (KNN, SVM, all the different autoregressive models, K-Means, among many others), we still have some excellent candidates.", "Some of our options are Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, or different types of Neural Networks. With fewer candidates, the work is less too. Would be amazing to test the results of all of them. As I told you earlier that it\u2019s out of the boundaries defined for this article. But for our example, we will train a Random Forest.", "I want to give you a glimpse of this with an example. The main idea is understanding the insights provided by our experts: TRADERS! If they spend all day doing this, we need to be humble and hear what they have to tell us. This is a key process in this problem, but also in any problem that you are willing to solve. We need that business context.", "Our goal is to do the best possible feature engineering!. And the process of creating our variables needs to be based on business concepts. And only AFTER that, we can apply all the usual transformations, like standardization or normalization (the last part ONLY if that MAKES SENSE!).", "The goal of this section will be comparing the performance of a first naive approach, then the trading-bot approximation, and, in the last breath, try to bring all the parts together. We will assume that we can only take long positions, and because of that, we are only interested in the predictions for positive outcomes.", "PS: I will leave you all of this section code on my github. Despite a few exceptions, the code will be generic to gain fluidity. Besides, some results may change (not dramatically, I tested them) due to the randomness of the sampling.", "We will be retrieving our data from Binance, you can read this blog to create your API-KEY. Here is the documentation of python-binance. We will be using 5-minute intervals of data. Below is the code to gather the data (3 lines for data, I\u2019m I converting into Flash?).", "I made a method that determines what happens first: a 0.5% increase or a 0.5% decrease. The logic is the following: the method looks for the next 100 time periods (for 5-minute data, more than 8 hours) and checks if the price trespass our defined threshold, only the first value reached is considered.", "I just used the close price, because the high and low values could be both above or below our goals at the same time, giving us some troubles. As expected, not in all the cases, there was an outcome, but the percent is not that high, and we can just get rid of that data.", "TA package has a method to construct a lot of useful indicators. The great thing about it is that all the parameters that we need to choose have their own default value. Nevertheless, we can change them if we want.", "Traders are the business understanding, and if we base our model just in technical analysis \u2014 that might be reflecting news \u2014we need to know about indicators!. But as I told you before, these people struggle so hard to contextualize them to define strategies, that they end up gaining intuition about combinations. Our job is to transform that intuition into math!.", "As an example, I want to talk to you about the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator. It is one of the most commons and widely spread between traders. MACD is calculated by subtracting a long-term exponential moving average (EMA) from a short-term EMA. After that, you create a \u201csignal line,\u201d which is an EMA of the MACD. The most used parameters are 26, 12, and 9, respectively.", "Using mplfinance you can achieve visualizations like the ones used by traders. Above, you can see a usual OHLC candlestick on the main panel. In the lower panel, we have two things going on, the volume on the histogram, and the indicators represented with a dotted line (MACD on grey and MACD_signal on cyan).", "You might be confused because the usual representation is to use the difference between the two MACDs to create the histogram. But don\u2019t feel lost! The histogram is the volume. I\u2019m just maximizing the quantity of information in the chart (we don\u2019t need a histogram with the information contained on the lines, don\u2019t we?).", "Ok, cool indicators, cool visualizations, but how to use them? This is the part where we have to try out some strategies. With our data science, knowledge would be enough? Let\u2019s figure it out! The section below is to give you some context of the variables. I separated the indicators in some bins. We can inspect if the values on their own give us a clue of a positive or negative outcome within those ranges.", "It seems to be a higher probability of a positive outcome on the bins on the left side and negative on the right. But nothing appears to be a bullet-proof system. We saw that, and we are positive that we can build something. So we can move forward.", "It\u2019s time to train our first model! Let\u2019s say we think that the outcome only depends on the three measurements that we just saw (obviously don\u2019t), but we can still train our model and see how it goes. First, we will balance the positive and negative outcomes, then, transform our variables using our beloved StandardScaler. The training data will be used until the 1st of February 2020. The remaining will be used to test the results.", "Technical note: \u201cInitial\u201d will be the dataframe with the indicators before February, and \u201cindicator\u201d is the entire dataframe, but with the [120245:] it\u2019s only the test data.", "The vertical numbers represents the real outcome, and the horizontal ones, the prediction. For example, in this case, we predicted 9,505 positive outcomes, and 53.8% of them were predicted correctly. It\u2019s having some little troubles to correctly assign the bad outcomes, but we can forget about that for a while.", "Do you remember all the prelude in which we talked about the expected return? Now it\u2019s time to use that!. We can use predict_proba to take the probability of a positive outcome. The chart below shows the probability of success given a certain P(p), in this case, we know that P(p)>0.5=0.538. The theory says that the higher the predict_proba, the higher our winning odds will be.", "On top of every rectangle, you can see the number of cases where that condition was met. A bigger probability involves fewer cases. But overall, we found what we expected! The bigger the P(p), the bigger the success rate. If we use the strategy to go in every time that P(p)>0.6, we will end up with 131 correct entries of 235!.", "There are different ways to use every indicator, depending on the trader that you talk with. But, there is one topic where there is some consensus. The agreement is that a signal to go in is when the MACD crosses above the signal line and, the last one, is below zero. If you go further, they will also tell you that it\u2019s only an entry signal, if the market is trending in the same direction as the signal.", "There are also multiple ways to check if a market is trending, we will cling to one. Comparing a 200-period EMA with the close price. If the price is above the EMA, we will consider that it is an uptrend. For the same test data, it\u2019s a simple filter on how many cases these three conditions are met.", "To make this a little challenging, I will show you the first 4 days (not more for the GIF size) of our test data. Below you can see two new things. The first is the 200-period EMA dotted red line. The other new thing is that I will mark the entry points, only if they meet all the conditions (in red if the trade has a negative outcome, and in green, if it\u2019s positive).", "This\u200a\u2014\u200anot so good\u200a\u2014\u200a4 days reflects what ends up happening in the whole period. 204 times the conditions were met, 97 with positive outcomes. This is not what we expected, but we don\u2019t have to forget that this is just rigid rules. In the next section, we will go deeper into what was the spirit of this strategy.", "Ok, our approximation had decent results, and the trading-bot not so good ones. But if we want to invest with real fees, those results are not enough. Can we improve that? This is why we are here! Our work is to understand what is happening, maybe if we take a pause to think, our results will boost.", "What was the intuition behind the rules? I heard from some traders that the reason for expecting that the MACD_signal was behind the zero-line, was because they expected a crossover with a higher slope. So maybe if we incorporate a variable that reflects how strong is the MACD going up, we might have some better results.", "This can be achieved by adding as a variable the difference between the indicator versus the most recent periods. To reflect that, we will use a shift method to subtract the actual value versus 1, 3, and 5 periods before. But these concepts could apply for the other 2 components. So we will do that for every variable. This will give us 9 extra variables, their task will be to reflect where this indicators are coming from.", "Also, we can understand that the trend it\u2019s also important, but maybe it is not necessary to use it as a binary variable. Instead, we can calculate it by subtracting the 200-EMA to the close price, and then divide it by the close price to have a percentual difference between them. Let\u2019s see what happens!", "Wou, it seems to be doing better on the adverse outcomes, but for the positive ones, we had just a slightly better performance (53.98% of true positives). Mmhh\u2026 that could be discouraging, but hey! Don\u2019t give up before even looking at the P(p) chart. Maybe brings us good news, who knows?", "I knew it!! This barplot arrives to save the day!. As expected, the success rate went higher on every bar! We can read that this model is a clear improvement compared to the first that we made. Why? Because it can separate better the cases on which the probability of taking the entry, has a better success rate.", "Let\u2019s say that we choose our strategy: buying whenever the P(p)>0.62. Our plan would have been a bomb! We got 188 signals, of which 124 were successful (65.95% of effectiveness). The important thing about this is that we manage to end up with a good strategy, using everything we learned!. Ok, I\u2019m going to relax, too much excitement for today.", "We achieve this, using just one indicator! That\u2019s promising if we think that models can incorporate other essential indicators with different concepts, like volume or volatility. But that fella, that\u2019s an entirely different story.", "I had a great time doing and sharing this with you, I expect that this can be somehow useful for you. If you are glad because it\u2019s over, give me your last minute! I like rituals, and doing a close ceremony with our main takeaways will raise my spirit:", "That\u2019s all I had for you, I know that is about fundamental concepts, but the main goal was that you can understand this even if you didn\u2019t know much about trading. There are also a lot of ways in which real-life systems can make these strategies more robust. Also, there are a lot of decisions I made that can generate debate, and I\u2019m expecting that! I will gladly discuss your different ideas, leave me a response with your thoughts!", "If I feel your warm support I will come back with fresh content!", "Due to the great support you gave me, I came up with a continuation:", "It\u2019s mandatory that you don\u2019t invest or trade using this strategy because the primary purpose of this article was talking about business understanding.
