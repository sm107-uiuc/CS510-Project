Companies have either embraced AI or have moved away from the hype. It\u2019s so incredibly important to spot an opportunity early.", "It\u2019s also really hard to find good content these days and only a few conferences stand out. Some are either far too commercial or either not applicable on any business case. I\u2019ve had the opportunity to visit some conferences in previous years and I often get the question, how do you choose one? Well, I will propose five conferences I\u2019d consider attending this year!", "I promise you that you will have an idea of your next go-to Artificial Intelligence conference after reading this blogpost. Provided that you\u2019re into these kinds of conferences of course.", "Mark this day in your calendar. I\u2019ve been to a dot conference before in 2018 and the setting was just amazing. I would agree that it\u2019s not the largest conference out there. But the speaker lineup is without any doubt incredible.", "The creator of Numpy, SciPy, Conda and so much more, Travis Oliphant, is speaking over there. These Python packages are so popular and he is one of the most fascinating data scientists living today. Alongside him, there are also other really interesting speakers. You should check out the line-up here.", "Combine this line-up with all the good things Paris has to offer. Enjoy without any doubt the best breakfast and follow it up with an awesome conference. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve to say more. to love out there.", "Why not grab the opportunity to visit tourist attractions? For example the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, Montmartre or Arc de Triomphe? I\u2019m pretty confident that\u2019s something you better cross off your bucket list while you\u2019re there.", "The next conference offers you not one, but four days of the conference. The first two days are full of training courses.", "I would not recommend skipping the first two workshop days if you have the chance. I find the \u201cbuilding a secure, scalable and transactional data lake on AWS\u201d an eye-catcher. Or what about \u201cLarge-scale Machine Learning with Spark and scikit-learn\u201d. Too bad you cannot split yourself into two.", "The last two days you can enjoy plenty of sessions and events. On one side I do believe that there could be better conferences based on session content. But on the other side, there are so many different topics to pick from, you\u2019ll surely have two days full of sessions that make this conference worth it.", "One last thing. Maybe it\u2019s cheaper for companies to just get an O\u2019Reilly yearly subscription and giving employees time for studying then attending this main event. Unless you want to get your book signed of course.", "This conference is based on one of the biggest cities in Germany. I was there last year and it was a great conference, with a mixture of good talks, good food and an awesome stay.", "The best thing about this conference is that it\u2019s not all about commercial talks. It has great content is contrary to a lot of other conferences out there. Unfortunately there is still no schedule available for 2020. Most talks are in English, but they offer also a few German talks as well.", "I cannot promise you\u2019ll have a great time without knowing the schedule upfront, but this seems to be a trend these days. People seem to go to conferences and festivals without knowing anything or anyone who will be presenting, so maybe it\u2019s just me. Based on the talks of last year, it surely is an awesome conference.", "Typically London is a very popular location for hosting conferences. They got another very interesting one later in the year. I\u2019ve been to a RE-WORK conference in 2018. It was the best conference I\u2019ve ever been to content-wise.", "Without any doubt, you should attend this event if you get the opportunity. Even after the Brexit, I do believe it\u2019s super easy to travel to London. You could use an Uber, taxi or the metro to do some sightseeing. The Big Ben, the London Eye, Tower Bridge and much more are worth the visit.", "The conference has many different topics: deep learning, AI in retail & advertising, AI assistant and also includes some deep-dive sessions. There are sessions from DeepMind, Facebook, Zalando, Uber and the Nasa. These companies are used to work with lots of data.", "It\u2019s simple if you want to go to London and you want to have two days full of great sessions. Just mark the 19th and 20th September in your calendar.", "Last but not least I\u2019m also including a conference of one of the most beautiful cities of Europe. The historical centre is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Not very often you find a conference in this part of Europe that is worth a visit.", "For me, it might be just a bit too far from where I live. But it has awesome speakers. For example, Fran\u00e7ois Chollet from Google, Ashish Kapoor from Microsoft, Vojta J\u00edna from Apple, Or Herman-Saffar from Dell and others are giving a talk there. It\u2019s quite an impressive schedule. The conference has one very big difference with other conferences, it is organized from Friday until Sunday.", "The talks will be presented in the Rudolfinum. It is a Neo-renaissance building associated with music and art since 1885. It is only used for outstanding purposes. The comfort, acoustics, and design makes it a great venue. Do I need to say more?", "Did you find a conference in these five proposals?", "If the answer is yes, please let me know where you are going. I\u2019ve not decided yet where I would go. Or if I go to any of these conferences this year. I\u2019d love to hear your opinion on what has influenced your choice. You can comment here or contact me directly via LinkedIn or Twitter.", "If you did not find a conference of your taste. I\u2019m very sorry, because I do believe these are the top AI conferences this year. I\u2019ve left out the academic conferences on purpose as well. Please leave a comment below if you think this list is just wrong.", "Your home for data science.
