But near things are more related than distant things\u201d. Waldo Tobler\u2019s (1969) First Law of Geography", "To understand Tobler\u2019s Law above, let\u2019s do a thought experiment.", "Let\u2019s randomly pick a house from a listing website such as Zillow and let\u2019s say the listing price of the house is $400K. Next, say, the house next to it is also listed for sale. Now, if you are to predict the price of the second house and given two options, $450K and $1.2M, which one would you pick?", "If you picked $450K then you already sub-consciously know what a spatial autocorrelation is. It is indeed a correlation between two neighbors in some common features (e.g. house price). \u201cAuto\u201d means self, \u201ccorrelation\u201d means association. So in a more formal way of saying \u2014 autocorrelation is a measure of similarity between nearby observations that describes the degree to which observations of a variable (e.g. population density) are similar to each other at a given spatial scale. Or simply speaking, \u201cthe Moran\u2019s I statistic is the correlation coefficient for the relationship between a variable (like income) and its surrounding values\u201d (source).", "Note that there is a similar concept called temporal autocorrelation, where observations (e.g. height, weight etc.) in one time point is correlated to observation in the previous time point. Such temporal autocorrelation is a useful concept in time series forecasting.", "We can always have a hunch about spatial autocorrelation of some features just by looking on the map. However, there is a formal way to measure it quantitatively, and Moran\u2019s I is one such statistic used for this purpose. It takes values between -1 and +1 (like normal correlation coefficient, r, would) while providing an associated p-value as a test for significance (discussed below). A positive Moran\u2019s I indicates that similar observations are closer to each other, whereas negative values imply dissimilar values are clustered. Values around 0 would indicate that there is no autocorrelation, and instead, observed values are randomly distributed.", "Once Moran\u2019s I is measured for a particular dataset, how can you know if it is significant or not under the null hypothesis that observations are randomly distributed?", "One way to measure the significance is to perform a Monte Carlo test. It is done in three steps: (i) first, observations (e.g. house prices) are randomly distributed in different spatial units (e.g. county polygons, raster cells etc), (ii) then, a Moran\u2019s I is calculated for this random dataset, (iii) and finally, the simulated Moran\u2019s I is compared to the observed Moran\u2019s I. This 3-step process is repeated many many times. After running all the simulations the probability p is calculated as follows:", "(# of simulated Moran\u2019s I greater than observed Moran\u2019s I +1)/(# of simulations ran + 1)", "number of simulated Moran's I that are higher than observed value = 2", "then according to the equation above the probability of null hypothesis being true:", "where p<0.01, therefore, the null hypothesis that the observations (e.g. population, house prices) are randomly distributed in space can be rejected. In other words, the observed autocorrelation of house prices is pretty significant.", "Autocorrelation is a key concept in spatial analysis that has wide ranging industry applications. Some of them are as follows:", "The data I am using for this demo is a median household income dataset at the county/census tract level, retrieved from American Community Survey. To access the data users have to put a request for API key. In my case, it was processed fairly quickly once requested.", "Understanding spatial autocorrelation is an important concept in spatial data analytics \u2014 not only for understanding spatial pattern and variation of data, but also for use in business decisions. It is also a key statistic providing inputs to advanced spatially explicit statistical and machine learning algorithms. In terms of implementation, once you have the data it\u2019s fairly easy to implement. I implemented in R environment but there are some Python libraries (e.g. geopandas) too, however, in my experience R has been more user friendly because of easy access to county/census tract scale datasets using existing packages.", "Your home for data science.
