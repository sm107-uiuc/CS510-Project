But how does it work? What are its building blocks? And, most importantly, \u2026 can we hack together our own version of it? The latter is important because search is inevitably personal: it is all about our focus, preferences, resources at our disposal and even emotions. Plus, it\u2019s really cool!", "In this three part series, I will:", "When we talk about search nowadays we often mean Semantic Search. What is semantic search, you ask? Imagine searching for the word \u201cvirus threat\u201d. A simple lexical search approach will come back with documents containing the words exactly and with in particular order of importance. Additionally documents about \"security threat\" will also be considered relevant as they contain part of the query.", "Semantic search, on the other hand, is also able to pick up on the idea of \u201cdisease\u201d, \u201cinfection\u201d and \u201ccorona\u201d - we have a far wider and potentially more accurate search reflecting the \"meaning\" of what we are looking for instead of sticking to its specific keywords. In this section, I have often sourced ideas from the work by Bast, Hannah; Buchhold, Bj\u00f6rn; Haussmann, Elmar (2016). \u201cSemantic search on text and knowledge bases\u201d. In that text they state:", "Semantic search denotes search with meaning, as distinguished from lexical search where the search engine looks for literal matches of the query words or variants of them, without understanding the overall meaning of the query", "The diagram below shows core components of a search engine of this kind", "We focus on semantic search on text with some additional annotations (such as names, dates, links, etc) as opposed to say search on structured databases. This is essentially the typical web search we use all the time.", "Please note, the article deals with a search that produces lists of relevant documents or individual facts, not additional steps such as ranking based source quality, eg PageRank, results summarisation, etc.", "These can be broken down into:", "These are the different types of transformations the system might need to perform on the original entry before passing it on to the search algorithm. Those could be", "Finally, one or more types of search & ranking approaches may be used. These will either be able to find an answer or return a ranked list of results matching the query. Ranking makes sure that more pertinent results are higher up - those might be results that mention keywords of the search more often than other results or contain relevant information to the query in their title or opening paragraphs. There are:", "Lets quickly have a face-off - keyword vs contextual search. Searching for \u201cvirus thread\u201d, on news headlines, the left set of results are from a keyword approach while the ones on the right are from contextual search. The latter gives us a number of results which are not matching any search term directly like example 5 on the right: \u201cWHO highlights dangers of vector borne diseases\u201d", "However, the technique works similarly from a not-so-natural question \u2018year of first moon landing\u2019", "Finally, slight modifications to the query can break the result and we no longer get an explicit answer, we even land somewhere else completely", "To summarize, any query type can pass through a number of different modifications and be run through any of a number of search mechanisms to produce candidate results. Each of these approaches will express the confidence in their results, however, different confidence scores may not be comparable between different algorithms. At this stage, a further decision algorithm will be able to determine which answers are well suited and \"confident\" enough to be passed on to the user as the final list of answers.", "A functioning search engine can have any or at least one of each of the three steps of the process. We have seen that Google uses most of them under the hood, but what about making our own...", "I actually wanted to hack my own search engine all along.", "The tool of choice is Elasticsearch, primarily because it actually comes out of the box with a lot of search features. At the same time, it is very well supported and gets you a long way in terms of open source features.", "Here is a diagram of what we get out of the box with Elastic for the purposes of this discussion. Note that you should not trust me on this summary completeness as I have a specific objective in mind.", "You will notice that Elastic can handle any query type (even though they will all be handled by default by a keyword search mechanism) and allows for further modifying your queries to fuzzy, wildcard and quite a few others. If the data allows this, one can also apply any number of structured conditions on the results: date of publishing, source, etc.", "In terms of search & ranking, there is a lot of flexibility to keyword search but not much else.", "Overall, this is a very impressive list of out of the box features. As it turns out, with some extra legwork we can even add contextual search. Which is what we will do next...", "We have explored the major building blocks of search, how they work together and the impact on search results. Different types of queries may trigger different search algorithms with a result that is a mixture of approaches. Looking at examples from Google we see that the same user experience (typing into a simple text box) is serviced by a number of techniques.", "In the following articles, we will compare contextual and keyword search side-by-side (Pt 2) and finally in will combine a few different tools to extend the capabilities of Elasticsearch with additional contextual capabilities to build our own semantic search engine (Pt 3).", "I hope you enjoyed reading this, we will be back with more in Pt 2, next week.
