It\u2019s 2020, finally.With the rise in data, Have you mastered the sexiest skill in the 21st century yet ?It\u2019s called \u2014 Machine Learning.", "What\u2019s that ? You haven\u2019t got the time to learn it but you want to master it badly ?You couldn\u2019t find a good write-up on Machine Learning that teaches you how to properly perform and evaluate your model ?", "Fret not, I\u2019m here to solve all your problems \u2014 if I have enough data.", "Today, we will be talking all about Machine Learning.Yes, everyone\u2019s favourite topic, Isn\u2019t it exciting ?", "According to Payscale, a Machine Learning Engineer earns an average salary of $110k per year, excluding performance bonuses.We all know Machine Learning is on the rise, and we know that you need to learn it, now.", "So, what exactly is Machine Learning ? Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI), that introduces the ability in Machines to \u2018Learn\u2019. Think of it as machines being able to develop a pattern in their artificial brain given the data you provide to it.", "Traditionally, we program machines to do something by giving them rules, like an if-else statement. Now, we let the machines discover these rules themselves by providing them the data. Here\u2019s a visualization to help you understand it better.", "Machines are able to discover these rules through the training process, where the machines try different rules and evaluate how well each rule fit our data. After the rule is discovered, we can now say that the machine has built a model based on our data.", "An example of the process would be:", "After the process, the Machine would be able to predict:", "There are multiple forms of Machine Learning. The ones that are mentioned frequently are Supervised, Unsupervised and Reinforcement Learning. The main factor that defines which form of Machine Learning you will be dealing with will be your dataset, or data.", "If you have a set of inputs and outputs, most of the time it will be categorized as supervised machine learning. For simplicity\u2019s sake, we will be discussing only about supervised learning in this article to get you started.", "Supervised Machine Learning deals with 2 main problems, classification and regression.", "If you had paid attention, the example that I showed above was about \u2014", "Pretty Straight Forward. Classification usually has discrete outputs while Regression has continuous outputs.", "First and foremost, we need to know how you will be collecting your data.", "Most of the real world businesses today use Machine Learning to optimize their products/services.", "If you work in one of these organisations, they have set up proper data warehouses that contains most of the data. You can then extract these data by using SQL most of the time. Hence, the very first thing you need is SQL.", "The next thing up on the list is probably Python, with specific libraries.Pandas will be the main library used to manipulate data in Python, so that should be the first library you master.", "After that, we will be visualizing a lot of our data and findings through Plotly in this article. Without it, no one can really understand what are we doing. I have written multiple articles on Plotly, do check them out to refresh your memory.", "Moving on, it is also good to know how to properly explore your data. After getting the dataset, many data practitioners often do not know what to do with it. This situation often results in a poorly optimised machine learning model that we all want to avoid.", "Hence, do help yourself on my article on the basics of data exploration.", "From Plotly to Pandas to Machine Learning. I\u2019ve got you covered.Now that\u2019s out of the way, time to get started.", "As usual, we will be working with Jupyter Notebook.", "We will be working with a telco churn dataset in this article.", "In this phase, we will preprocess our data into a readable format by the machine. Remember, machines don\u2019t actually understand text because they simply take it as input. For example, machines don\u2019t understand the difference between the text \u2018Male\u2019 and \u2018Female\u2019. Hence, we need to properly deal with our categorical and numerical data before we pass them through our training process.", "The most commonly used method to convert categorical data into an understandable input is to create dummy variables for each category present. For example, we had 3 types of contracts in our contract column which are \u2018month to month\u2019, \u2018one year\u2019 and \u2018two year\u2019. The contract column is then converted into 3 columns with a True or False indicator corresponding to each type of contract. Here\u2019s a drawing to help out.", "We can do this easily through the get_dummies function in pandas.", "We can observe that the categorical columns had been dealt with. However, there are also boolean columns which only contain 2 categories, a Yes or No usually. We can encode these values into 1s and 0s using:", "Now that all the categorical and boolean columns are done. We are left with the \u2014", "The preprocessing for numerical columns involves scaling them so that a change in one quantity is equal to another. The machines need to understand that just because some columns like \u2018totalcharges\u2019 have large values, it doesn\u2019t mean that it plays a big part in predicting the outcome. To achieve this, we put all of our numerical columns into a same scale so that none of them are dominated by the other.", "Perfect. Now that our data is perfectly scaled and categorized.We can split them into our train and test set.", "The training set is the data we pass into our training process while the test data is used to evaluate our model.", "Nowadays, data from real life situations often results in an imbalanced number of observations for each potential output. From data exploration, the first thing that we did was find out what was the amount of churn vs non-churn customers. The result was \u2014", "As you can see, the number of non-churn customers is significantly higher than churn. Without getting too much into details, this will present an issue to our model as the machine is getting a lot more information about non-churn customers, and may mistake a churn for a non-churn. Hence, this will reduce the accuracy specifically on predicting churn customers.", "In other words, our model will be good at predicting if a customer will stay but will perform poorly when predicting if a customer will churn. Depending on business requirements, this obviously contradicts to what we are trying to achieve. We want to predict churn customers as accurately as possible, in order to catch all of them and perform additional business actions to convince them to stay. For example, sending a discount code if we know a customer is about to churn.", "That being said, we can somewhat minimize the impact of this issue by over-sampling. Over-sampling are methods that artificially increase the number of observations of a certain class in the dataset. Usually, we prefer to balance the number of observations of each class, meaning we should have 50% churn observations and 50% non-churn observations.", "The method that we will be using is SMOTE, which stands for Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique. Without getting into too much details, SMOTE artificially creates new observations which are not just copies of existing minority cases. Instead, the algorithm creates new observations by involving vectors, random numbers and the nearest neighbours of each sample. For us, the main take-away is that more observations of churn customers are now created, fairly.", "Here\u2019s an additional read up on the SMOTE algorithm for understanding purposes.", "Now, we have 2 train sets and 2 test sets. One of those is the original data and the other had SMOTE applied to it. We will compare their performance later.", "Now that we have a balanced set of data. How do we know which features to include and to exclude ?", "We shouldn\u2019t just assume all the features play an important role in predicting the outcome. Some of them may or may not be insignificant. We can clearly observe this in a correlation graph.", "We can observe from the correlation heatmap that different features have different impacts on the churn. The result of an excessive number of features is noise, which reduces the performance of our model.Hence, how do we determine which features matter? \u2014 Feature Selection", "Feature Selection is one of the core techniques in Machine Learning that will increase the performance, improve training time and improve simplicity of your model. There are multiple feature selection algorithms, the one we will be using today is called \u2014 Recursive Feature Elimination.", "Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) fits a model and eliminates the weakest feature until the specified number of features is achieved. Here\u2019s a detailed explanation for it:", "As previously noted, recursive feature elimination (RFE, Guyon et al. (2002)) is basically a backward selection of the predictors. This technique begins by building a model on the entire set of predictors and computing an importance score for each predictor. The least important predictor(s) are then removed, the model is re-built, and importance scores are computed again. In practice, the analyst specifies the number of predictor subsets to evaluate as well as each subset\u2019s size. Therefore, the subset size is a tuning parameter for RFE. The subset size that optimizes the performance criteria is used to select the predictors based on the importance rankings. The optimal subset is then used to train the final model.[4]", "In this block of code, we have chosen the 10 best features to be included in our logistic regression model. We can then plot the ranking done by RFE.", "This table shows the features chosen by RFE, as well as their individual ranking so that you can somewhat weigh how important a certain feature is.We can now separate our datasets.", "At this stage, we have 2 train sets and 2 test sets where all features are recursively eliminated. One of those is the original data and the other had SMOTE applied to it.", "Now comes the actual stage where we train our model. There are multiple algorithms used to train classification problems. We aren\u2019t able to tell which algorithm best fit our data, hence we usually train with multiple algorithms and compare their performances based on carefully selected criteria. Today, we will only be focusing on Logistic Regression and how well it fits our data.", "Logistic Regression is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms to predict binary classes, in this case churn and not churn. It works by attaching an output probability between 0 and 1 based on the Sigmoid Function to each input. Based on the threshold which is 0.5 by default, anything higher than that will be categorized as 1 (churn) and anything below that as 0 (not churn).", "For example, if our threshold was 0.5, and our predicted probability of a set of features was 0.7, we would classify this observation as churn in our case.", "Having understanding that, let\u2019s train our data.", "That\u2019s pretty much it, our model is trained. As you can see, training a model is not as complicated as you think.Most of the time, it\u2019s getting the data to a \u2018nice\u2019 format to be trained, as well as evaluating your model which is the time-consuming part.", "We have 2 models. One trained with the SMOTE dataset and one with the original dataset. We can start to produce predictions using these models but we want to first evaluate how accurate are these models exactly. In order to evaluate models, we need to consider a few criteria.", "For classification, the few common metrics we use to evaluate models are", "Let me explain what each of these mean.", "Before touching recall and precision, we need to understand what are False Positives, False Negatives and their counterparts.", "This can be better explained by the diagram on the left, imagine the full diagram is our dataset, and the circle is our model\u2019s prediction. The left of the diagram are actual positive values (1) and the right of the diagram are actual negative values (0).", "Looking at the circle on the left side, all the points in the circle were predicted positive by our model while all the points outside the circle were predicted negative by our model. We also know that all the points outside the circle, on the left of the diagram are positives. Hence, it is incorrectly predicted, indicating a False Negative. All the points in the circle, left of the diagram are correctly predicted, indicating a True Positive.", "Vice Versa applies to the right side of the diagram.", "Precision and recall provides a deeper understanding to our model. Precision is defined as the percentage of your results which are relevant,Recall is defined as the percentage of relevant results correctly classified.", "Without going into too much details, precision here in our model means the percentage of predicted churn customers that were correctly classified.", "Recall measures as the percentage of actual churn customers that were correctly classified.", "In many cases, we can either prioritise precision or recall depending on the problem you are trying to solve. In our case, we definitely want to prioritise predicting actual churn customers as accurate as possible so that we can persuade them to stay.", "In general cases, there is a metric which harmonizes the precision and recall metric, which is the F1 Score. The general aim is to maximize the F1 score to make your model better.", "After tweaking multiple variables to maximize our precision, recall and F1 Score, we can also tweak the threshold of our model.", "For example, the threshold by default is 0.5 where any output probability above that will be classified as 1. We can change the threshold to a lower/higher value to further increase our preferable metric.", "To visualize such a change, we can plot the effect for each threshold on the false and true positive rates. The curve will look something like this.", "Again, without getting into too much details, the better your model is, the more the curve (blue) will hug the upper left corner of the plot. Conversely, a model that does a poor job at classifying will converge towards the straight line (red), which does no better than random guessing.", "Using the ROC curve, we can properly determine if a model is better than the other. We can also choose our classification threshold based on if we should maximize the True Positive Rate, or minimize False Positive Rate. In our case, we should aim to maximize True Positive Rate. As a result, this will also increase our recall metric.", "Accuracy is really the most basic metric to measure the performance of your model. It basically is the percentage of outputs that were predicted correctly against your test set.", "Hence, we should really consider recall, accuracy and F1 Score as our important metrics for this particular model.", "From our model that was trained on our original dataset, the accuracy was quite high overall which was 81%. However, we can see that all of the metrics for class 1 which represents churned customers were rather low.", "Due to the imbalanced number of observations, we get a rather high weighted average since there were a lot more of class 0 observations compared to class 1. This is a sign of a red flag as our priority is to be able to predict class 1s accurately.", "From the ROC curve, we see that the AUC is 73%, which can be compared to other models later.", "The threshold plot is also useful for us to determine our threshold. As we know, we are trying to maximize recall while not sacrificing too much of other metrics. The threshold plot assist us in exactly doing that. It looks like a threshold of anywhere near 0.3 will allow us to maximize recall while keeping other metrics intact.", "That\u2019s what we understood about our first model so far, let\u2019s evaluate the model that was trained by the SMOTE dataset.", "Right away, you can observe that all the metrics for class 1 (churned customers) has significantly increased. The downside is there is a slight decrease in overall accuracy.", "As a professional data scientist, you should recommend this model against the first one any time of the day. Since the priority is to accurately predict churn customers, you must understand that this model does it significantly better than the previous one even if the overall accuracy had decreased slightly. This is what separates a true data scientist against mediocre ones.", "From the ROC curve, we observe that the AUC is around 78% which is ~5% higher than our previous model. This suggests that our SMOTE model is better than the previous one.", "The threshold plot also signifies the superiority in performance for our current model. Notice how we are able to tweak our threshold higher here to obtain a relatively high recall , precision and accuracy.", "Note that we want to avoid setting too low of a threshold, otherwise we will end up with an excessive amount of false positives. Looks like we have a clear winner here.", "Overall, we had trained 2 models using logistic regression with 2 different datasets, 1 with SMOTE sampling and 1 without. The SMOTE model performs significantly better in predicting churn customers based on several criteria. You can now use this model to predict future churn customers.", "Well Done, I know this is a long one, but it was worth it.Machine Learning is a complicated process, and there are many factors in determining the performance of your model, hence your skillset.", "In this article, you had learnt:", "These techniques are just the beginning of Machine Learning, we have much more to cover.", "We are not done yet with our data journey. With the lack of talent in the data industry, educating yourself with proper knowledge in Machine Learning will give you an edge in landing that data role.
