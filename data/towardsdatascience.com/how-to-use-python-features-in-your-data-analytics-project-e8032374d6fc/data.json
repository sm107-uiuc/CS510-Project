On-premises, companies mostly use propriety software for advanced analytics, BI and reporting. However, this tooling may not be the most logical choice in a cloud environment. Reasons can be 1) lack of integration with cloud provider, 2) lack of big data support or 3) lack of support for new use cases such as machine learning and deep learning.", "Python is a general-purpose programming language and is widely used for data analytics. Almost all cloud data platforms offer Python support and often new features become available in Python first. In this, Python can be seen as the Swiss Army knife of data analytics.", "In this tutorial, two projects are created that take into account important features of Python. Projects are described as follows:", "Therefore, the following steps are executed:", "It is a standalone tutorial in which the focus is to learn the different aspects of Python. The focus is less to \u201cdeep dive\u201d in the separate aspects. In case you more interested in deep learning, see here or in devops for AI, refer to my previous blogs, here and with focus on security, see here.", "The following resources need to be created:", "In this part, a sample Python project with three classes. Using these classes, football player\u2019s data is registered. The following steps are executed:", "Log in to your Windows Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM). On the desktop, an overview of icons of preinstalled components can be found. Click on Jupyter short cut to start a Jupyter session.", "Subsequently, open the Jupyter command line session that can be found in the taskbar. Copy the URL and open this in a Firefox session.", "Then download the following notebook to the desktop of your DSVM:", "Finally, select to upload the notebook in your jupyter session. Then click on the run button in the menu to run code in a cell. The most important parts of the notebook are also discussed in the remaining of the chapter.", "This part of the tutorial is inspired by the following tutorial by Theophano Mitsa. In this part, three classes are created to keep track of football players\u2019 data. A snippet of the first class Player can be found below:", "The following can be seen in this class:", "Subsequently, class FirstTeamPlayer can be found below:", "The following can be seen in this class:", "Finally, a snippet of the training class can be found below:", "The following can be seen in this class:", "An example how the three classes are instantiated and are used can be found in the final snippet below:", "NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. In this tutorial it will be used to do matrix analytics. Notice that attribute _rawData is already encapsulated in the Player class as a NumPy array. NumPy is often used with Matplotlib to visualize data. In the snippet below, the data is taken from player class and then some matrix operations are done, from basic to more advanced. Full example can be found in the github project.", "Pandas is the package for high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools in Python. Under the hood, pandas uses NumPy for its array structure. In this tutorial it will be used to calculate some basic statistics. In the snippet below, the data is taken from player class and then some statistics operations are done. Full example can be found in the github project.", "Finally, the data will be written to a SQL database. In this tutorial, the MSSQL database is used that is part of the DSVM. Look for the Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) icon that can be found in taskbar and start a new session. Log in using Windows Authentication, see also below.", "Look for \u201cNew Query\u201d in the menu and start a new query session. Then execute the following script:", "Finally, the data can be written to and read from the database. Pandas dataframes will be used for this, see also the snippet below.", "In the previous chapter, all code was run on a single machine. In case more data is generated or more advanced calculations need to be done (e.g. deep learning), the only possibility is to take a heavier machine an thus to scale up to execute the code. That is, compute cannot be distributed to other VMs.", "Spark is an analytics framework that can distribute compute to other VMs and thus can scale out by adding more VMs to do work. This is most of times more efficient than having a \u201csupercomputer\u201d doing all the work. Python can be used in Spark and is often referred to as PySpark. In this tutorial, Azure Databricks will be used that is an Apache Spark-based analytics platform optimized for the Azure. In this, the following steps are executed.", "Start your Azure Databricks workspace and go to Cluster. Create a new cluster with the following settings:", "Subsequenly, select Workspace, right-click and then select import. In the radio button, select to import the following notebook using URL:", "Select the notebook you imported in 4b and attach the notebook to the cluster you created in 4a. Make sure that the cluster is running and otherwise start it. Walk through the notebook cell by cell by using shortcut SHIFT+ENTER.", "Finally, if you want to keep track of the model, create an HTTP endpoint of the model and/or create a DevOps pipeline of the project, see my advanced DevOps for AI tutorial here, and with focus on security, see here.", "In this project, a machine learning model is created that predicts the income class of a person using features as age, hours of week working, education. In this, the following steps are executed:", "Notice that pyspark.ml libraries are used to build the model. It is also possible to run scikit-learn libraries in Azure Databricks, however, then work would only be done be the driver (master) node and the compute is not distributed. See below a snippet of what pyspark packages are used.", "In this tutorial, two Python projects were created as follows:", "A lot of companies consider what tooling to use in the cloud for data analytics.
