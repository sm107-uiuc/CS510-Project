And among product leaders that if you bundle that code into a product, people will buy it. But in my experience, this is often not the case.", "I recently launched an open-domain question answering product for medium sized businesses. It uses transformer networks to answer basic customer questions from website content, saving time for sales and support associates.", "On the surface this seems great \u2014 time is money, right? And if your customers get their questions answered faster then aren\u2019t they happier customers? While some of the potential partners we talked to confirmed this hypothesis, for many medium-size companies, answering a volume of customer questions wasn\u2019t really a problem.", "These companies had more than enough staff to provide customized responses for sales or support, and these human responses were often better than those provided by current AI technology. Below, I\u2019ll go more in depth on specific challenges encountered automating sales and support.", "On the sales side, many companies use tools like Drift as a first means of interacting with potential customers who want to talk. These are essentially scripted forms which gather a visitor\u2019s email and intent and route them to the correct part of the sales funnel. The fundamental problem with this solution is that it must be manually curated and updated, and doesn\u2019t allow visitors to explore topics outside of this very limited flow, even if there\u2019s publicly available content on the site about those topics. Some companies even retain a full-time employee just to keep them up to date.", "From the perspective of an engineer this current product seems ripe for disruption with AI \u2014 but what about from the perspective of a sales or marketing VP who will ultimately buy it? In my experience, this VP friend of ours will have two critical issues with a switch to AI:", "A move away from a deterministic system with keyword mappings and predefined rules to a probabilistic machine-learning-based system implies a fundamental shift in thinking about technology that many are not ready for. The power of allowing for algorithms to pull in sources outside of just what you give them and generate novel answers has the natural drawback of not being able to provide a guarantee about what those answers will be. While a vast majority (95%+) of the responses may be good for the best ML systems, this may not be enough for our marketing VP friend.", "The second issue of losing personal touch is more self-explanatory. Closing deals and selling software (especially B2B) is almost entirely about developing relationships, something AI may never be capable of.", "People are eager for jobs in the current market, so why shouldn\u2019t our marketing VP hire them to sell software. Odds are they\u2019d do better than current AI, especially if you can get them on the phone. This breaks down if the volume of incoming queries is too great for your team to field, but this is a good problem to have (if they are qualified leads) and means you probably have enough money to hire more sales associates anyways.", "Additionally, certain industries such as HR software require human intervention at an early stage to verify leads for compliance and to avoid fraud. AI can achieve this in many cases, but even greater trust is required, further hindering adoption.", "AI technologies to automate support flows are much better researched and more established than AI for sales. However, they still face some of the same issues with adoption. First, let\u2019s look at the 3 main types of support questions we could try to automate: easy, hard and action required.", "Let\u2019s define easy questions as something the average person could find on Google or lookup on a website pretty easily. Everything else is a long-tailed \u201chard\u201d question that may require synthesis of multiple sources and/or knowledge that isn\u2019t available to the customer. Finally, let's distinguish support requests where there is action required on behalf of the support rep from those which merely require a response.", "Easy questions are answerable with high accuracy by adopting transformer-based ranking and question-answering technology like Google has started doing recently with the answer boxes at the top of search results or in their socratic app. These results are pulled from both structured data sources (e.g. \u201chow old is obama?\u201d) and unstructured data (anything where the answer is part of a paragraph in text form).", "The challenge then is converting a business\u2019s information to a knowledge base as Google has done with the internet. Scale and cost of infrastructure may become an issue since some of the algorithms require very large models that require expensive GPUs or TPUs to run.", "Hard questions require reasoning about information from multiple sources to synthesize an answer. They may also require knowledge about that specific customer or knowledge gained through experience of doing a job.", "Here are some examples from the technical support domain:", "\u201cI get java/ spark out of memory on a aws VM with 8gb ram and 2 vCPUs when I run this command:\u2026\u201d", "When it comes to technical support questions such as these, looking up similar issues on stack overflow and Google is currently the best approach, and no AI I am aware of is better (although the TechQA dataset from IBM could change that).", "Similarly, we might imagine hard support questions for a bank: \u201cwhat is the withdrawal limit for my account?\u201d In order to answer this question, an AI agent must look up a customer\u2019s account type and then access the withdrawal limit. If this is a common enough issue, a custom tool could be build using something like dialogflow to answer this or many other questions. But this solution scales poorly since each bank must hire developers to build their own custom agent, and it only seems to make sense for large companies.", "Finally, there are support requests that not only require a response, but also an action item on behalf of the support agent. For example, a support agent at an airline might get asked \u201ccan you cancel my flight reservation.\u201d This could be achieved with a custom tool as described above, but with the additional hurdle of authenticating requests to prevent abuse.", "I think yes to support, and no to sales. In theory, almost all support questions could be answered by a sufficiently advanced AI. Sales, on the other hand, is more about building relationships than answering questions about a product or service. This is something which I am doubtful if AI will ever provide.", "Furthermore, what\u2019s the point of removing sales positions. A world without sales teams would be a world in which people bought less, which would be a step back economically. Whereas a world without the need for support teams would be a world where things worked as they should.", "Your home for data science.
