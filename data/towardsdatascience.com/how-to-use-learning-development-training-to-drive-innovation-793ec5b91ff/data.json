Practicing training professionals have identified some key L&D strategies that can help bring a culture of innovation through the doors of your office.", "The complex realities of operating a business in today\u2019s globalized market often means facing fierce worldwide competition and constantly refreshing your organization\u2019s goals to keep pace with the latest and greatest innovative trends in your industry. This is especially true in tech-based industries and data science functions where new innovations and roads towards digitization are a daily reality.", "While the competitive outlook may be daunting, professional development training is a direct and efficient way to cement innovation at the heart of your workplace culture.", "The 2019 L&D report from findcourses.com benchmarked how companies across industries and markets are using L&D training to keep their organizations at the forefront of innovation in their respective fields. The report found ongoing relationships between growing revenue, learning, and innovation. From building agility into your training infrastructure and making use of the latest technologies in the training environment, training professionals have illustrated how companies are using L&D training to build sustainable cultures of innovation as they navigate the 21st century marketplace.", "Working with a data science function or in a tech-based industry, you may feel that agility is already an inherent aspect of your day-to-day responsibilities. While it\u2019s true that these roles and industries often require a significant amount of flexibility, it\u2019s also a worthwhile exercise to ask yourself some key questions:", "How much agility is built into your organization\u2019s training infrastructure? Furthermore, is that agility translatable into your overall workplace culture?", "According to Anthony Sandonato, the Vice President of Learning and Development at Wyndham Destinations, implementing an agile training infrastructure for over 25,000 employees in 110+ countries has been a core strategy for success. Sandonato explains that Wyndham\u2019s \u201cL&D team structure is built upon that flexible framework, and designed to remain nimble and adjust to continuous organizational changes without compromising either the speed or quality of our talent development strategies.\u201d", "Creating an agile training function will help you to align training goals with overall shifts in the goals of your organization. These goals can change on a dime, as every business is trying to stay abreast of the latest innovations and trends. While data science is a tech-heavy field, if you\u2019re looking to attract and retain the best talent, adopt the mindset that a flexible and creative workplace culture should be your priority before you evaluate the innovativeness of your technologies.", "The report also found that companies with executives highly engaged in L&D were 3x more likely to say that their company had a culture of innovation. Illustrating the importance of a flexible mindset in the training room with an agile training function (introduced by upper management) will help bring about cultural change from the bottom up.", "In a similar L&D report from the U.K., 41% of market challengers predicted an increase in their L&D budgets. L&D helps to create the space for employees to bring adaptability and agility out of the theoretical realm and into hands-on practical application.", "Agile Data Science isn\u2019t always the perfect methodology for all teams, but according to Eugene Yam, \u201cThe data science team has strengths in \u201clistening to the data\u201d and research. Applying innovation to improve organisational outcomes should be part of their mandate.\u201d [1] Once you\u2019ve established agility as a key tenet of your organization\u2019s training function, the flexible skills and strategies learned in the training room can be scaled up to improve the quality and abilities of your data science function overall.", "Once you\u2019ve established a culture of innovation in your training function and across operational hierarchies, re-evaluating the use of technology in your training offerings is a logical next step in making innovation into the new cultural norm.", "Technology and digitalization is an ongoing and inevitable path in the world of business, and the training industry is no different than data science when it comes to evaluating the best technologies to get the job done.", "The report found that of all the companies surveyed, a whopping 84% were using technology within their L&D function. From e-learning to microvideos to virtual reality, innovative technologies have revolutionized the training industry. Furthermore, the report saw that companies with revenue growth were 2x as likely to use innovative technologies like virtual reality and game based learning in their L&D offerings.", "Taking advantage of these innovative technologies in the training environment will not only impact the overall agility of your training infrastructure, but will reinforce and bring theoretical training principles into your burgeoning culture of innovation. Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) through gamified AI training strategies like Mean Field-, Stochastic and Evolutionary Games are all innovative ways of harnessing the power of technology and maximizing its potential in training.", "Virtual Reality (VR) offers another opportunity to maintain a culture of innovation through your training function. According to Danny Belch, the Chief Strategy Officer at the digital coaching company STRIVR, \u201cWith VR, because of the on-demand nature, a real life experience can be fired up with a click of a button. You can now practice these situations. You can get a legitimate lifelike scenario with full end-to-end practice. It\u2019s not role play. It\u2019s alone and the stakes are free. You have this beautifully free space to practice, to stumble on your words.\u201d", "Alongside game-based learning, creating real-life scenarios to train new or existing employees through VR is not only a great way to reinforce important learning objectives, it can also help you on test runs to get immediate and valuable feedback from your employees knee-deep in the specificities of the technology at play.", "\u201cYou can influence innovation when you\u2019re living it,\u201d says Karen Bicking, the Head of US Learning & Talent Development at Bayer. Take advantage of innovative L&D training strategies to begin building an infrastructural basis to support a culture of innovation in your organization, and look to the power of training technology to further drive innovation up and out from the training room. Driving innovation won\u2019t create change overnight, but L&D training can make the journey a more efficient, productive and creative experience for everyone involved.", "Your home for data science.
