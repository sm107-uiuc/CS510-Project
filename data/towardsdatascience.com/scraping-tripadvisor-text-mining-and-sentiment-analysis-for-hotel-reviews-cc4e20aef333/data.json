However, understanding the nuance of TripAdvisor bubble score vs. each of thousands of TripAdvisor review text , can be challenging. In an effort to more thoroughly understand whether hotel guests reviews influence hotel performance overtime, I scraped all English reviews from TripAdvisor for one hotel \u2014 Hilton Hawaiian Village. I will not discuss the details of the web scraping, the Python code for the process can be found here. Thanks for the tips from Furas.", "The highest number of weekly reviews were received at the end of 2014. The hotel received over 70 reviews in that week.", "We can definitely do a little better job to combine \u201cstay\u201d and stayed\u201d, and \u201cpool\u201d and \u201cpools\u201d. So called stemming, stemming is the process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to their word stem, base or root format.", "We often want to understand the relationship between words in a review. What sequences of words are common across review text? Given a sequence of words, what word is most likely to follow? What words have the strongest relationship with each other? Therefore, many interesting text analysis are based on the relationships. When we exam pairs of two consecutive words, it is called \u201cbigrams\u201d.", "So, what are the most common bigrams Hilton Hawaiian Village\u2019s TripAdvisor reviews?", "The most common bigrams is \u201crainbow tower\u201d, followed by \u201chawaiian village\u201d.", "We can visualize bigrams in word networks:", "The above visualizes the common bigrams in TripAdvisor reviews, showing those that occurred at least 1000 times and where neither word was a stop-word.", "The network graph shows strong connections between the top several words (\u201chawaiian\u201d, \u201cvillage\u201d, \u201cocean\u201d and \u201cview\u201d). However, we do not see clear clustering structure in the network.", "Bigrams sometimes are not enough, let\u2019s see what are the most common trigrams in Hilton Hawaiian Village\u2019s TripAdvisor reviews?", "The most common trigram is \u201chilton hawaiian village\u201d, followed by \u201cdiamond head tower\u201d, and so on.", "What words and topics have become more frequent, or less frequent, over time? These could give us a sense of the hotel changing ecosystem, such as service, renovation, problem solving and let us predict what topics will continue to grow in relevance.", "We want to ask questions like: what words have been increasing in frequency over time in TripAdvisor reviews?", "We can see a peak of discussion around \u201cfriday fireworks\u201d and \u201clagoon\u201d prior to 2010. And word like \u201cresort fee\u201d and \u201cbusy\u201d grew most quickly prior to 2005.", "What words have been decreasing in frequency in the reviews?", "This shows a few topics in which interest has died out since 2010, including \u201chhv\u201d (short for hilton hawaiian village I believe), \u201cbreakfast\u201d, \u201cupgraded\u201d \u201cprices\u201d and \u201cfree\u201d.", "Let\u2019s compare a couple of selected words.", "Service and food were both the top topics prior to 2010. The conversation about service and food peaked at the beginning of the data around 2003, It has been in a downward trend after 2005, with occasional peaks.", "Sentiment analysis is widely applied to voice of the customer materials such as reviews and survey responses, online and social media, for applications that range from marketing to customer service to clinical medicine.", "In our case, we aim to determine the attitude of a reviewer (i.e. hotel guest) with respect to his (or her) past experience or emotional reaction towards the hotel. The attitude may be a judgment or evaluation.", "The Most Common positive and negative words in the reviews.", "Let\u2019s try another sentiment library to see whether the results are the same.", "Interesting to see that \u201cdiamond\u201d (as diamond head) was categorized to positive sentiment.", "There is a potential problem here, for example, \u201cclean\u201d, depending on the context, have a negative sentiment if preceded by the word \u201cnot\u201d. In fact unigrams will have this issue with negation in most cases. This brings us to the next topic:", "We want to see how often words are preceded by a word like \u201cnot\u201d.", "There were 850 times in the data that word \u201ca\u201d is preceded by word \u201cnot\u201d, and 698 times in the date that word \u201cthe\u201d preceded by word \u201cnot\u201d. However, this information is not meaningful.", "This tells us that in the data, the most common sentiment-associated word to follow \u201cnot\u201d is \u201cworth\u201d, and the second common sentiment-associated word to follow \u201cnot\u201d is \u201crecommend\u201d, which would normally have a (positive) score of 2.", "So, in our data, which words contributed the most in the wrong direction?", "The bigrams \u201cnot worth\u201d, \u201cnot great\u201d, \u201cnot good\u201d, \u201cnot recommend\u201d and \u201cnot like\u201d were the large causes of miss-identification, making the text seem much more positive than it is.", "Except \u201cnot\u201d, there are other words that negate the subsequent term, such as \u201cno\u201d, \u201cnever\u201d and \u201cwithout\u201d. Let\u2019s check them out.", "It looks like the largest sources of misidentifying a word as positive come from \u201cnot worth/great/good/recommend\u201d, and the largest source of incorrectly classified negative sentiment is \u201cnot bad\u201d and \u201cno problem\u201d.", "Lastly, let\u2019s find out the most positive and negative reviews.", "The most positive review\u2019s ID is 2363:", "The most negative review\u2019s ID is 3748:", "It was fun!
