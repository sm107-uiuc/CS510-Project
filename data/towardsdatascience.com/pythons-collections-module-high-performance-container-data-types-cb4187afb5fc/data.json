This module aims to improve the functionalities and provides alternatives to Python\u2019s general purpose built-in containers such as dict, list, set, and tuple.", "Let\u2019s begin the article with a quick glance at the concept of modules and packages.", "A module is nothing but a .py script that can be called in another .py script. A module is a file containing Python definitions and statements which helps to implement a set of functions. The file name is the module name with the suffix .py appended. Modules are imported from other modules using the import command. Let\u2019s import the math module.", "Python has innumerable inbuilt modules and there are packages already created for almost any use case you can think of. Check out the complete list here.", "Two very important functions come in handy when exploring modules in Python \u2014 the dir and help functions.", "Packages are a collection of related modules stacked up together.

Now, this might not be needed in simple cases. However, in case a tuple has many fields this might be kind of a necessity and will also impact the code\u2019s readability.", "It is here that namedtuple\u2019s functionality comes into the picture. It is a function for tuples with Named Fields and can be seen as an extension of the built-in tuple data type. Named tuples assign meaning to each position in a tuple and allow for more readable, self-documenting code. Each object stored in them can be accessed through a unique (human-readable) identifier and this frees us from having to remember integer indexes. Let\u2019s see its implementation.", "We construct the namedtuple by first passing the object type name (fruit) and then passing a string with the variety of fields as a string with spaces between the field names.

The number of elements has to be specified as n. If none is specified it returns the count of all the elements.", "Dictionaries are an efficient way to store data for later retrieval having an unordered set of key: value pairs. Keys must be unique and immutable objects.", "Things are simple if the values are ints or strings. However, if the values are in the form of collections like lists or dictionaries, the value (an empty list or dict) must be initialized the first time a given key is used. defaultdict automates and simplifies this stuff.

Let us now run the same example with defaultdict.", "The defaultdict in contrast will simply create any items that you try to access (provided of course they do not exist yet).The defaultdict is also a dictionary-like object and provides all methods provided by a dictionary. However, the point of difference is that it takes the first argument (default_factory) as a default data type for the dictionary.", "An OrderedDict is a dictionary subclass that remembers the order in which that keys were first inserted. When iterating over an ordered dictionary, the items are returned in the order their keys were first added. Since an ordered dictionary remembers its insertion order, it can be used in conjunction with sorting to make a sorted dictionary:", "A point to note here is that in Python 3.6, the regular dictionaries are insertion ordered i.e dictionaries remember the order of items inserted.
