During these events, I often speak about the skills I learned during my masters and how they transferred to the workplace. I get asked many questions from students looking to get into the data science field, but some questions are more common than others. With that, I wanted to share with you the most common questions I have received in 2020 with their corresponding answers.", "Here is the list of eight most common questions:", "I wrote an article a while back, answering this question in more detail. All in all, the studies suggest that you can begin your career with a bachelor\u2019s degree or data science boot camp, but to advance further, you should consider an advanced STEM degree. The requirements will vary from job to job and company to company.", "I chose to go to school for my master\u2019s in data science to learn relevant data science and business skills in an academic environment. Through the program I attended, I gained experience working on research projects and writing papers for publication. I found this to be helpful to me as I enjoy more research-focused work. Depending on the program, you can work on industry research projects while still in school. The program I was in allowed me to work with a company in Boston my last semester. The project was to develop libraries that would aid in the automation of data acquisition, cleaning, and preprocessing. I found this project beneficial as it showed me the type of work that could be possible when working with data.", "When getting a degree in data science, many individuals may think of data scientists as the main career path. Still, you can take many other paths, such as data engineer, software engineer, machine learning engineer, and more. The main con of getting another degree for me was the time and money to invest. If you have to pay your way or get loans, college can be expensive, and a second degree can take you another 1 to 2 years. For myself, the pros outweighed the cons, and I went back to school.", "Tip: Find a niche area that you enjoy in data science and focus on developing your skills in that area.", "The primary skills that I learned during my undergraduate years come from my computer science classes. These classes discussed object-oriented programming, databases, algorithms, and data structures. When I transitioned from Computer Engineering into Data Science, I went back to school for my master\u2019s. In my current position, I do use many of the skills I learned during my masters. The main ones I use daily are:", "Tip: Pick the skills to focus on and learn based on the job you want to have. For example. if you\u2019re going to go into data engineering, concentrate more on databases and learn to build up large data sets.", "Yes. Machine learning is commonplace within data science. Being a field that evolves quickly, I find myself spending a lot of time learning new techniques, determine what applies to my work, and reading up on current research that has been published. Instead of starting with machine learning in mind, my philosophy is to start with the problem. When I have identified the problem, I can begin to solve it. You may be surprised to find out that machine learning is not always the best option. You need to pick the technique that is best suited for the work you are doing.", "Lesson: Start with the problem. Once you have determined your problem, you can begin to develop a solution that fits it.", "My day tends to have three main focuses: sprint work, project planning/road mapping, and research.", "Sprint Work \u2014 This work refers to most of the items I take on during a sprint. Sprint work can include fixing a bug in code, creating new functionality in a library, or running an analysis on some data based on customer input on an issue. Sprint work is my planned three weeks\u2019 worth of work.", "Project Planning and Road Mapping \u2014 I am the team lead for my group, and therefore spend time cleaning our backlog of work, adding new concepts, and road mapping what the months ahead look like. During this time, I am working with stakeholders and other team members to add information where needed and roadmap the next few months.", "Research \u2014 If I am not doing one of the two above, then I am researching what is in the market, new techniques that have come out, and ways to solve problems that we are currently facing. As mentioned previously, data science is a revolving door of new ideas, concepts, and teachings. You will spend a lot of your time learning what has come out and if it applies to your work or not. My research can be either part of my sprint work or project planning. It depends on what I am doing that week.", "Lesson: Your day will vary depending on the type of role you pick. Make sure you choose something that suits what you want to be doing in your position.", "I didn\u2019t initially choose data science; it chose me. I began college as an English major and studied for two years as one before transferring to another college and becoming a computer engineer. It was during my final year of undergraduate that I began to explore my love for data. I worked on a research project that required me to ingest data from sensors and user input for analysis. It was then that I thought I was initially interested in becoming an embedded engineer. I explored the idea for a while, took a few more classes for embedded programming and chip design, and then did an internship.", "The more I got into looking at data for embedded system, the less I wanted to become an embedded engineer. Then I began my master\u2019s in data science. As I took more classes and worked with different datasets, I began to enjoy big data challenges. Data science is an evolving field that lets you interact with people of all backgrounds. It offers new challenges each day, and with additional data comes additional problems to solve. I didn\u2019t initially choose data science, it chose me, and I am glad it did.", "Lesson: Life is not a straight forward path. There will be many twists and turns in it. You may not know where you will end up, and that is okay.", "My interests were initially in the Internet of Things (IoT) and home automation. When I began looking for another job, it so happens that the job I became interested in was in the aerospace field. Since starting in aerospace, I have enjoyed it immensely and learned a lot about planes. Although I would not mind working in another area, I see myself staying in aerospace for now.", "The way I look at it is, you can either generalize or specialize in the type of data you want to work in. If you generalize, you don\u2019t mind switching to different fields but understand that you will rely more on subject matter experts (SME) to understand your data. If you specialize, you will become an SME in that field as you gain more experience with your data.", "Lesson: Your interests can change over time. You may want to start out generalizing your skills and then specialize in a specific type of data. That is okay. Find what works for you and what you enjoy doing.", "With every job comes different challenges. The three interesting challenges I have seen with data science are the space\u2019s evolving nature, data cleanliness, and analysis paralysis.", "Tip: Data science is full of challenges. Embrace the challenges and find helpful solutions to them.", "I am someone who firmly believes in work-life balance, but not every job accommodates that. You need to understand what you are looking for in terms of balance and define that for yourself. If working 80+ hours a week is not for you, don\u2019t accept a job that requires that. No matter what position I have held, I have looked for companies that understand their employees have a life outside of work. I find my current role balanced between free time to live my life and time to invest in work. Depending on the project, I may work longer than my expected hours, but that is not required.", "Lesson: You need to know the work-life balance that works for you and then find a job accepting that.", "Of all the questions I get asked, number five is always my favorite to answer. It shows that you can change your mind and try out new things in your career. I get asked many questions from students, but some are more common than others. I hope these answers help you as you are figuring out your next steps.", "In summary, for my tips and lessons learned:", "Are there any other questions you commonly get asked? Are there questions you would ask that are not on the list?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "Your home for data science.
