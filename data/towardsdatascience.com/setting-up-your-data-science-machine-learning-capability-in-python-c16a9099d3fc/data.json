With its rich and dynamic open source software ecosystem, Python stands unmatched in how adoptable, reliable, and functional it is. If you disagree with this premise, then please take a quick detour here.", "The Purpose of Your Data Science & Machine Learning Capability", "Your goal as a lead of a DSML team is to deliver the best return on investment to the business. The business invests in the DSML capability with a budget for staff and resources, while your job is to deliver the maximum business impact you can.", "Your business impact can be measured in many ways. The most high-level objectives are cost optimization, risk optimization, and revenue growth. You may focus on a variety of specific metrics within each objective, such as customer acquisition cost optimization, churn prediction, fraud detection, patient health outcomes, or personalized product recommendations.", "Anything diverting goal-setting, budget and execution from this purpose drives down the ROI your team can deliver. Where the attention goes, the energy flows, to quote a self-improvement guru.", "This a re-framing of the classic Buy vs. Build discussion, in context of many DSML platforms offering \u201cpay as you go\u201d pricing now, much like Amazon Web Services. I feel it\u2019s necessary to rephrase the discussion, because unlike \u201cBuying\u201d where you pay a fixed cost whether or not you use it; \u201cRenting\u201d implies that you only pay for when you use it. This is much more convenient for the end-user.", "As you begin to set up your DSML platform in Python, you can own the internal architecture or you can rent it from a vendor. I\u2019ll use Saturn Cloud as the primary vendor, because I am expectedly biased.", "Owning a DSML capability carries inherent \u201cscope creep\u201d issues that are not in plain view from outset. It is all too easy to expect owning the capability as simplifying integrating your favorite open source tools together: Jupyter, Dask or PySpark, Prefect or Airflow, Kubernetes, NVIDIA RAPIDS, Bokeh, Plotly, Streamlit, etc.", "Here is a short list of \u201cscope creep\u201d dealbreakers we hear from our customers who have previously tried to own a DSML capability:", "Each of these bullets has a list of further burdens that may not be attractive. In fact, some of it is so painful that our Saturn Cloud co-founder and CTO, Hugo Shi, wrote an article on Kubernetes just to vent.", "Here are the cost components of ownership that you need to consider as you build your DSML capability.", "Example 1: Owning Results in Higher Total Cost", "Your team is tasked with developing a customer churn model. If you could predict churn, sales could take proactive measures to retain more accounts. Your company generates $100M in annual sales, and there\u2019s an opportunity to reduce churn from 10% to 5%, or by $5M annually. To keep it simple, we\u2019ll assume you\u2019re a SaaS company with 100% gross margins.", "Figure 1: Renting = Automated DevOps", "Given the cost savings in automating DevOps, the renting scenario generates higher ROI due to less total spend.", "Example 2: Owning Carries High Opportunity Cost", "Now let\u2019s assume in both scenarios your team is 9 FTEs, but in the renting scenario all 9 are dedicated to Data Science & ML. A team of 9 FTEs can produce 50% more output than a team of 6 FTEs, so with the spare capacity you take on a second project around customer personalization. Let\u2019s assume this project could result in 5% higher software sales in year 1.", "Figure 2: Renting = Force Multiplier", "Notice that in the renting scenario, you\u2019re actually spending more money, but with the same team size you can generate higher ROI. By shifting labor spend to Data Science & ML from DevOps, your team is more efficient and can tackle more positive ROI projects in the same time period. The owning scenario carries an inherent opportunity cost, which is not inherent in the renting scenario.", "In both scenarios, the ROI of renting outperforms that of owning a DSML capability. It is also worth noting that cloud computing pricing has dropped significantly over the past decade, whereas labor costs for data science, machine learning and DevOps has increased significantly.", "Not every organization needs to rent DSML architecture. But, it is much easier and less risky to rent first before you own.", "I have spoken with hundreds of DSML leaders in the past couple years. A good portion of them lead their teams into owning DSML architecture without renting, and without assessing the obvious and hidden costs of owning. All too often, they turn back half way, realizing renting is cheaper, easier, more flexible, and allows them to stay focused. Furthermore, many developers on the teams expected they would be only part of building the architecture upfront, but later had to serve in full-time support roles, spending much less time on interesting scientific projects they joined the company for!", "\u2026is what you\u2019ll be saying when you rent the architecture. Yes, all the integration of open source tools, open source version management, building state-of-the-art security around data and code, building enterprise administration architecture, cloud hosting, support services, open source expert consultations \u2014 say it with me \u2014 \ud83d\udc4f somebody \ud83d\udc4f else\u2019s \ud83d\udc4f problem!", "Not only is that offloaded, but you get some pretty great benefits from a dedicated team working on it.", "Ownership Model: Team and budget are divided in using DSML capability to create value and supporting DSML capability.", "Rent Model: Entire team and budget are streamlined towards using rented DSML capability to create value.", "The purpose of your DSML capability is to maximize its ROI. You want as much of your budget going towards that target: whether the endpoint is faster stock market trading decision-making, recommending new marketing investment, running more drug discovery models, and so on.", "Good luck and if you are curious about Saturn Cloud, please check us out here.", "Your home for data science.
