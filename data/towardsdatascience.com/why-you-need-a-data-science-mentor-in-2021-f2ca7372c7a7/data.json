When I began my role as a data scientist, I adopted two mentors. One was a senior person who had been there since the team\u2019s conception, and the other was a technical fellow who was looking to mentor younger women. The first 6 to 8 months of my job, I spent learning from my mentors. I asked them tons of questions, threw ideas at them, and tried to understand what I wanted for my career progression. This past year, I have learned a lot from these two individuals about my career and learning. I want to share with you some of these insights.", "In my first month as a data scientist, I sat down with a senior member of my team, and I asked him what his thoughts were about the team, projects I could work on, and what to look forward to. He asked me one question: What type of contributor are you? He wanted to know if I was interested in staying an individual contributor, leading a team, progressing into a management position, or becoming a technical fellow. Being new to the team and company, it was a hard call to make, but this was the best question I could have been asked at the time. This question got me thinking of what I wanted in the next 2\u20135 years and was when I began to plan out my goals for work.", "Why do you need a mentor? They can ask you hard questions that require you to reflect on your decisions and next steps.", "Another interesting tidbit I picked up from this mentor was his philosophy on working styles. He has this pattern that has worked well for him in which he works on high-value projects, gets them 75% complete, and then passes on the next 25% to someone else. This allows him to work on the project, learn from it, and then teach and mentor the next person on that project.", "No matter if you agree with this working philosophy or have your own, I learned from this that everyone has a way that they work best. Through many conversations and my own experiences, I have found the style that works well for me and have implemented it for my projects. Working with a mentor has shown me that different people work differently but can achieve comparable results.", "Why do you need a mentor? A mentor can show you different ways to tackle the same problem. Learning how they approach a specific situation, such as developing a working style, will allow you to compare those approaches to your own and let you decide how best you work.", "As I continued to traverse these two mentorships, one of my main topics of conversations with my other mentor was career growth. I had frequent conversations with her about what I was learning, what I wanted for the future, and how I could get there. Through this relationship development, I was given a person I could receive feedback on my plan with. I started by bringing her my first annual review summary and goals. I outlined everything with her and asked for her advice. She told me that I needed to learn to show the value-add of my work and outline my long-term goals. She helped me better understand what it meant to mentor individuals, lead a team, and share a vision with that team. As I lead my team now, I see many of the lessons she has taught me to come through in the way I develop our team goals, roadmap our work, and present the value-added to the broader group.", "Why do you need a mentor? Your mentor(s) can help you better understand what you want in your job and career. You may change your mind as you go, but you can work towards it if you have a plan in place.", "The most challenging lesson to learn came from both my mentors, learn to showcase your value-added to those who care. The ones who care are your manager, stakeholders, or executives who want to see what value you have added to the business.", "In the past year, I have learned to approach this differently than before. Typically, I would write a few sentences on what the project was, what I did in the project, and what steps I took to get that done. Like the STAR method, I outlined the situation (project), task, and actions taken. What I was missing in the assessment of my work was what the results were? I did not explain the outcome of my work. As I worked with my mentors, I understood how better to track a project\u2019s performance to compare those values and draft my results. I could summarize these results in one slide and showcase my work\u2019s impact and my team\u2019s work to those who wanted to see it.", "Why do you need a mentor? Having a closely aligned mentor with your work can help you with valuable skills, such as learning to track your projects\u2019 performance. They can teach you how to showcase your work positively to stakeholders and share how it added value to the business.", "As the year progressed, I have presented at universities and begun to mentor interns. During this time, I spoke to my mentors about the experiences and what I could do to improve. The most significant piece of advice I received from one of my mentors was telling my story. I know who I am, what I have accomplished, and what I have learned through these experiences. As I worked with different universities, college students, and mentees, I refined my story and began to focus on the lessons I learned. This was one of the main reasons I began to write on Medium. Through these conversations, I realized that I do have experiences I commonly speak on that would translate well into written form.", "Why do you need a mentor? A mentoring relationship can help teach you more about yourself as you think through challenging questions they ask and reflect on your discussions. Mentors can also teach you how to present your story and develop your personal brand as you grow as a data scientist.", "A mentor in data science can help teach you many things. If someone on your team can aid you in your projects, provide feedback, and help push you along when you need a hand. Consider finding a mentor in 2021, especially if you are starting in data science. Finding someone who will advocate for you and support you can be a valuable asset to you as you learn and grow in your position. Here are five questions you can ask your mentor:", "What have you learned from your mentors this past year? Are you considering a mentor for 2021?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "Your home for data science.
