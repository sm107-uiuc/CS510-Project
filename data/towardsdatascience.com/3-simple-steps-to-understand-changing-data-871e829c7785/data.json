Why?? How?? Help!!\u201d \u2014 if you\u2019re a data analyst, you\u2019ve no doubt heard something like this before from a distressed colleague. Change is a part of every business and occurs across all timescales. It can affect many areas, such as the weekly purchases on a website, the number of units produced or the weather. When people see change, they\u2019re driven to understand what\u2019s causing it so they can make a suitable action plan. As analysts, we should facilitate such understanding and outline core issues.", "In this article, we\u2019ll explore some of the common types of change to analyse. We\u2019ll also discuss the approaches that you can take to understand those changes. These are the basic descriptive (or diagnostic) analytics methods used by data analysts, but anyone with an interest in utilising data can apply them.", "Note that we define a change in some value or metric when it has a different value compared to a previous time. Change can happen to dimensions other than time though, such as changes by location. It\u2019s possible to apply many of the methods discussed below to these other types of variances.", "When looking at a specific metric that is changing, we have a tendency to adopt tunnel vision. We hone in on that single metric and how it\u2019s bouncing up and down. This can be especially true for well established teams who religiously track set metrics. One key thing to keep in mind when looking at metrics is that all metrics have their flaws. While a given metric may be good for some use-cases, it could fall down in others. A metric may represent one behaviour well, but fail to capture another. For this reason, a great first step is to look at other metrics to see how they\u2019re affected.", "A great first step is to look at other metrics to see how they\u2019re affected.", "You can start by looking at competing metrics. Competing metrics are metrics that can move in opposite directions as they compete for the same resource. An example is likes and comments on a Youtube video. A product change that calls attention to the like button would increase the likes, but decrease the comments. Here both features compete for the user\u2019s attention for a method of leaving feedback. Of course, likes and comments may go up together as the number of total views increase. Other examples include sales on different clothing brands or time spent using different apps. For your analysis, you might find that while your typical metric is down, another metric has jumped up. This might even be good for the business!", "Other metrics that are worth looking at are the constituent metrics. Constituent metrics are metrics that other metrics are \u2018made up of\u2019. Take the number of purchase on an e-commerce website; this can be broken down in one way as:", "purchases = no. visitors x sign-up rate x sign-up to purchase rate.", "Upon analysing each metric it might be seen that the latter two metrics are constant while the number of visitors has tanked. In general, constituent metrics give you another way to investigate metrics by breaking them down into smaller chunks.", "Note that there are many possible options when choosing how to break down a metric. Often some are no more obvious than others, making it somewhat of an art to make the right decision. In this case, having strong business experience is quite valuable. For example, for certain businesses some metrics will have inherent interest. Of course, it would be best if you could investigate all the metrics. With a more automated approach using scripting and alerts it\u2019s certainly achievable.", "In this process, it may also become clear that other metrics aren\u2019t changing in an expected way. This is often cause for alarm as the problem may be caused by data tracking bugs.", "Whether it\u2019s constituent or competing metrics or some other metric, stop and think about the other metrics that could be influencing change in your system. Often by analysing other metrics we can detect stronger signals which significantly decrease the difficulty of the analysis.", "Once you have a metric that you\u2019re sure you want to analyse it\u2019s time to dive into the details. The next step to detect the change is to analyse the various dimensions in your data. By dimensions we are referring to the various attributes of a data point. You can consider a user has various dimensions such as age, gender, device, country and language. These dimensions describe the user and allow us to break down the data into different groups.", "The next step to detect the change is to analyse the various dimensions in your data.", "Commonly we refer to groups of users (or anything, really) as segments. For data analysts, it\u2019s important to identify the key segments for the business. This can be done through a business-driven approach, e.g. we understand users in different countries have different behaviours, or by applying some statistical analyses (data science) such as user clustering. With different segments identified, it\u2019s then possible to analyse the respective changes in the metric. This can show how changes affect different users and narrow down the search.", "Another key thing to look out for is mix-shift. In the case of mix-shift, there\u2019s a shift in the mix of segments. This is a little tricky, so let\u2019s consider an example of an e-commerce store that sells two products with the data for two separate periods below.", "The boss notices that there\u2019s a reduction in the site\u2019s overall conversion rate (sales / user) and asks the analyst to investigate. Following what they\u2019ve learnt above, the analyst decides to break down by the products. They promptly see that each product has a steady conversion rate \u2014 how is that possible? It\u2019s a classic case of mix-shift. Since the proportion (mix) of products for A:B has changed (shifted) from 1:2 to 1:1, Product A with a lower conversion rate now has more of an influence on the aggregate metric. We\u2019ve actually had a growth in sales and both products are still selling well, we\u2019re simply seeing an artefact of the metric.", "Mix-shift is important to understand since it can often turn a bad change to a neutral, or even a good one (as we saw in this example). It\u2019s also quite common to see when analysing long term trends such as the year-on-year changes where many macro events can influence the outcome of an analysis.", "Understanding the key dimensions and how they shift is often instrumental to understanding why things are changing and narrowing down the search.", "With metrics and segments identified and understood, the last step is to find out what exactly caused the change to happen. In more technical terms, we\u2019re looking for a correlation between the metric and some underlying events. Common places to source a list of events would be:", "In general, it\u2019s instructive to gather information from various teams within an organisation to find out what might be related to the problem. Ideally all of the above is already being recorded to easily be leveraged but if not, it might be good to start!", "With metrics and segments identified and understood, the last step is to find out what exactly caused the change to happen.", "In an ideal world, we might see something like the first figure below: a distinct event that causes a significant, noticeable change. This can happen in an environment with low noise or where large changes are made (it\u2019s the signal-to-noise ratio that we\u2019re concerned with here) \u2014 but is quite rare in every day practice. What we usually see is more like the second figure where we have the same average difference in the metric but the noise is much higher.", "For the first case, it\u2019s fairly easy to convince someone that change was brought by that specific event. In the second case, we can approach this via some tests for statistical significance. A common approach would be a stationarity test such as the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test.", "It may also turn out that there isn\u2019t a single event which caused the change in a metric, it may be a cumulative process not detectable in the method discussed above. In this case, it could be constructive to do a correlation analysis in time. One approach is to identify competitors and contrast your metric to the daily metrics of other platforms. Depending on the size of the companies you may see a positive or negative correlation where over time the metrics move in significant ways to each other. This would tell you that some portion of the change is due to the correlated metric.", "There are plenty more things to consider when doing data analysis (else we\u2019d be out of a profession), some of these include setting hypotheses, putting data in context and incorporating wider understanding.", "Throughout the points above, we\u2019ve implicitly been making hypotheses. It\u2019s worth making this explicit, as stating your hypotheses creates a more scientific and reproducible approach. Creating hypotheses also helps to avoid the continuous risk of cherry picking data in which the data is chosen to find a conclusion but the negative cases where we didn\u2019t find data are ignored.", "We should always strive to put data into context. When performing an analysis it might be easy to say a certain metric is down, but why stop at that? As previously mentioned, most businesses have many intertwined metrics, so if one thing is down, another may be up. It\u2019s worth checking on other key metrics and flagging if there are any other unexpected variances that the original requester may not have noticed. Maybe this down meant another up which would have an overall good effect for the business. At the same time, it\u2019s useful to keep a record of all other areas you analysed as these questions will inevitably pop up.", "Change itself, is changing. While we might see a change in a metric, what is the expected behaviour in the future? Will the metric stabilise at its new value, or it will continue to evolve? This is particularly interesting for product changes. You can imagine a feature like a Snapchat filter update. When the filter is updated many users will interact with it and an initial analysis may show an improvement but as users get tired with the feature it would begin to change again. In most cases it\u2019s not easy to forecast the long term behaviour but it\u2019s worth taking note whether or not it\u2019s likely and planning on re-analysing at a later date.", "While we talked about time-based events, we didn\u2019t get into the topic of seasonality. Due to fluctuations from month to month it\u2019s common for metrics to move up and down in a relatively predictable manner. When performing analyses it\u2019s best to adjust for this seasonality by comparing the metric\u2019s value to a forecast of how you expected the metric to look. Forecasts can be simple based purely on the last year or more detailed using a model like Facebook\u2019s Prophet.", "The language in this article has focused on bad changes \u2014 but let\u2019s not forget that things aren\u2019t always going down, they go up too. In business though, we tend to focus on the negatives, trying to understand what went wrong, but not so much what went right. It\u2019s equally important to spend time on why things are going up so that these learnings can be used to further grow the business.", "It\u2019s important to consider each of the points discussed above separately. They each have their own merits and can help build out a more well-rounded view of the data. We discussed considering the metric in context of the system, breaking the metric down by various dimensions, and searching for events that could cause changes.", "Throughout the data I\u2019ve specifically mentioned data analysts as the audience, but in reality, many jobs are now data-driven and I would argue that this basic understanding of data analysis and how to think about change is something that\u2019s necessary for us all. So if you have a colleague who might benefit, please do share it with them! Alternatively, if you have any techniques you like to use that weren\u2019t mentioned, let\u2019s discuss.", "Your home for data science.
