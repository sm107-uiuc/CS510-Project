Think about the past and the future. Think about our way of life and our achievements. But most importantly, think about what has been and would be our contribution to the world. And, as I was seeking for inspiration and energy, I decided to grasp the question of happiness and get a deeper understanding of the complex nature of its dynamics.", "We all have our own ideas about happiness and its key determinants. Some would choose wealth as it is indispensable to enjoy a comfortable like with high living conditions. Some would reject this materialistic point of view and would argue that social relationships (family, friends, etc.) and values are what matters the most. Others would defend the idea that, as citizens who benefit from a set of rights while abiding by certain rules, it\u2019s the government and its policies that really determine our living conditions and thus our happiness.", "These are all intuitive ideas. But what does the available data tell us?", "In this perspective, I analyzed data from The World Happiness Report which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness. More specifically, it contains, on the one hand, happiness scores based on the answers gathered from the Gallup World Poll (GWP) and on the other hand, indicators of economic production, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity.", "In a series of two articles, I will share with you my key findings. The first article intents to give a general overview of the evolution of happiness and related indicators across countries through a data explanatory analysis. The two others focus on the causal impact of these indicators on happiness.", "First, let\u2019s start by defining the key indicators that will be used. The data taken from the World Happiness Report is particularly interesting as it combines fundamental economic with more subjective social measures.", "These indicators mainly come from the Gallup World Poll (GWP). It continually surveys residents in more than 160 countries using randomly selected, nationally representative samples. Typically, a set of questions is asked to 1,000 individuals in each country during interviews conducted face-to-face or by phone. For more information, you can read this article.", "The main challenge of studying happiness is, first, how to measure it. In fact, the assessment of well-being goes from general judgments of life (life evaluation) to feelings (daily affect). In this context, we will be using 3 metrics:", "In terms of social support, we will analyze two indicators:", "Finally, to grasp the impact of people\u2019s perceptions of politics on their happiness, we will use the following metrics:", "Here a quick description of data:", "The overall sentiment of happiness is very dependent on the economic conjecture, as one would have expected. In fact, the Life Ladder, which represent people\u2019s own life evaluation, is at its lowest point in the year 2006 just before the financial crisis.", "This is also the case of Positive affect and Negative affect. These metrics bring an interesting nuance to the previous one: they refer to the average of previous-day affect in terms of happiness, laughter, and enjoyment or worry, sadness, and anger respectively. Therefore, contrary to Life Lader, there are somewhat short-term measures of happiness.", "In this context, as shown in the graph below, these variables are at the lowest point after the financial crisis as well. However, the impact on Negative affect is certainly stronger than on Positive affect.", "In terms of geographical differences, there is no surprise. Rich countries are on average happier. Most importantly, the graph below shows the tremendous inequalities that exist from a region of the world to another.", "Even within the same region, there are important disparities between countries, especially in South Asia, Middle East, and Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa, as represented in the graph below. On the contrary, happiness levels in countries of North America or Europe are very similar.", "For decades, the question of whether more wealth leads to more happiness has absorbed economists, behavioral scientists, and the general public. There is no doubt that people\u2019s happiness and wealth have a strong correlation. And, data do not contradict this general trend. In fact, as shown in the graph, the higher the GDP per capita is, the higher is the happiness level.", "However, there are many exceptions to this rule: the happiness level of countries with a similar GDP per capita can significantly differ. For instance, Norway and Kuwait have similar GDP per capita but their level of happiness differs significantly (1.3 points!).", "Even within the same region, the level of happiness can differ significantly from a country to another although they have a close GDP per capita. For instance, Finland and Belgium have a similar GDP per capita but their level of happiness differs from 1 point!", "Are these observations a proof of the old clich\u00e9 \u201cmoney can\u2019t buy happiness\u201d? Actually, they point to two well-established ideas:", "When we think about what the ingredients of happiness would be, it is almost impossible to exclude the social aspect. In fact, as social creatures, we need love, meaning, support from our close relationships with family and friends, and a sense of belonging from our broader networks.", "So, is social connection the best path towards happiness?", "Let\u2019s take a look at data. More especially, we will focus on the following variable:", "The table below contains the average per region. In terms of Social Support, North American and Western European countries have the highest value, while South Asian countries have the lowest. In terms of Generosity, North American and Southeast Asian countries have the highest value while Sub-Saharian countries have the lowest. Unsurprisingly, these variables are high when Life Ladder and Positive affect are high and Negative affect low.", "In order to compare the strength of the association between happiness and these \u201csocial\u201d variables, let\u2019s compare their correlation. Below are the correlation matrices for two regions, one with a high level of happiness, Western Europe, and the other one with a low value, South Asia.", "As you can see, while Life Ladder, Positive affect, and Negative affect are highly correlated to Social Support and Generosity in Western Europe, there are not in South Asia. What can we deduce from this? Is it due to the culture of the country, the political system, or other variables? Further study is needed to shed some light on the question.", "A quick word about the Harvard Study of Adult Development", "In 1938, a group of Harvard researchers investigated the question of the happiness, by tracking the development of a group of teenage boys through periodic interviews and medical checkups. Their objective was to understand the evolution of their health and well-being through time. It became one of the longest and most famous longitudinal studies of its kind. More than 80 years after, the research concluded that social connections are one of the most important factors for people\u2019s happiness and health. As Robert Waldinger, the current director of the study, simply summarized in a famous TED video: \u201cThose who kept warm relationships got to live longer and happier, and the loners often died earlier\u201d. For more information about the study, you can read this article.", "There is no doubt that governments have an impact on people\u2019s well-being, as the public policies they implement define important happiness factors such as access to education, employment, healthcare, etc.", "Actually, the question of the relationship between people\u2019s happiness and the policies put in place by the government is delicate, and this on two levels:", "Some countries have historically put happiness in the center of their ideals.", "For instance, the American Declaration of Independence lists the Pursuit of Happiness as one of three naturally unalienable rights, alongside Life and Liberty. It also clearly states it as the final goal of any government.", "\u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.\u201dConstitution of the United States, 1787", "The government of Bhutan, a country in South Asia, went a step further by putting aside regular economic indicators and focusing primarily on the Gross National Happiness (GNH), an index that aims at measuring the collective happiness and well-being of the population. Contrary to GDP, its values include harmony with nature and traditional values. For more information, you read this article, and watch this short video.", "Here, I analyze the impact of people\u2019s perception of the government on their happiness. The following aspects are considered", "The table below contains the average per region. Countries of Central and Eastern Europe have the lowest value for Confidence in national government and Freedom to make life choices and, the highest Perceptions of corruption, this compared to other countries such as those of North America.", "In order to compare the strength of the association between happiness and these \u201cpolicies\u201d related variables, let\u2019s compare their correlation. Below are the correlation matrices for two regions, one with a high level of happiness, North America, and the other one with a low value, Central Europe.", "There are 3 elements to notice :", "The correlation matrix below shows to extended these difference between developed countries and other countries applies for the other regions of the world:", "Again, there are 3 elements to note:", "What can we deduce from this? It is hard to conclude anything from these observations since the distribution of the variables varies tremendously form a region to another. However, the correlations above shed light on important facts and present interesting insights to understand happiness dynamics across regions of the world.", "As expected, happiness dynamics are extremely multifaceted varying across countries and through time. However, this complexity should not discourage policymakers from taking them into account. On the contrary, they should use happiness indicators to determine the right policies to implement, but also to measure policies performance. They can rely on the help of experts across the fields of economics, psychology, survey analysis and health to define how measurements of well-being can be used effectively", "In this article, I simply carried out a data explanatory analysis so as to get a solid insight into happiness dynamics. In the next, I will focus on the causal relations between happiness and other factors.", "Your home for data science.
