In particular, the field of natural language processing (NLP) is seeing an exponential expansion in terms of capabilities but also network size as Transformer architecture-based models appeared (for example BERT, GPT-2). In this article, I\u2019ll focus on the classification of short documents (pre-prints of scientific papers) by using Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) embeddings and a quantum machine learning kind of operator called variational quantum circuit which is, roughly speaking, the equivalent of a fully-connected (dense) layer in the classical machine learning realm. For an introduction of how word and sentence embeddings can be used for classification purposes, see my previous post Classifying Scientific Papers with Universal Sentence Embeddings. If you are not familiar with the concepts of quantum computing, I hope you\u2019ll enjoy reading my article Spooky Computers at CERN.", "Before we delve into the actual code (that you can find on https://github.com/rdisipio/qnlp), a few words are needed to explain what quantum machine learning is, and how it can be useful for this kind of application.", "To begin with, in quantum computing one deals with the equivalent of bits called qubits, which notoriously can handle information in a non-binary state thanks to a property of quantum systems called superposition (sometimes it is said that they can represent 0s and 1s at the same time). A quantum circuit is a series of operations applied to qubits that change their state, e.g. by changing their relative phase. Qubits can be represented geometrically with a so called Bloch sphere, so an operation onto a qubit corresponds to a rotation of the quantum state vector in this virtual space.", "There are many possible quantum circuits, depending on the goal of the calculation. In general, a quantum circuit implements a quantum algorithm. For an overview of what sort of calculations that are possible, refer to the Quantum Algorithm Zoo maintained by Stephen Jordan at Microsoft. The most famous one is probably Peter Shor\u2019s factorization algorithm. One key concept of quantum algorithms is that, because of the intrinsic nature qubits, certain calculations can be carried out with smaller complexity compared to the classical equivalent (this property is known as super-polynomial speedup). To be completely fair, there\u2019s also lots of ongoing research in the attempt to \u201cde-quantize\u201d such algorithms and make the classical version as fast as the quantum version \u2014 that is because the initial state of qubits has to be prepared before running the actual algorithm, which reduces the overall speedup. The seminal paper in this direction is \u201cQuantum-inspired classical algorithms for principal component analysis and supervised clustering\u201d by Ewin Tang.", "As a matter of fact, practical applications are more likely to be a mix of classical and quantum operations. Especially in the field of machine learning, one may wonder if the two realms can be combined together to join forces, and the good news is that in fact they can and they do. A software library called PennyLane developed by the Canadian startup Xanadu provides an interface between the common ML frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow and the quantum computing ecosystem. The main idea is simple yet very powerful: one can replace part of a neural network (let\u2019s say a dense layer) with a quantum counterpart, and that\u2019s it! You have created a hybrid classical-quantum neural network. As a matter of fact, as classical machine learning does not end with just neural network, also quantum machine learning find its strength in a variety of methods, such as quantum support-vector machines. For an overview of what\u2019s possible, I suggest following this online course on edX, taught by the late Peter Wittek from University of Toronto.", "Variational circuits (also called parametrized quantum circuits) are a family of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms that carry out operations in a manner similar to a classical dense layer. At the core of the algorithm is a quantum circuit \ud835\udc48 which depends on a set of parameters \ud835\udf03, as well as an objective function which defines a scalar to be optimized. The circuits can be thought of as a black-box, and the optimization is usually achieved through an iterative scheme for example by gradient-based optimization.", "As I explained in Classifying Scientific Papers with Universal Sentence Embeddings, Google released a pre-trained version of the Universal Sentence Encoder (USE) model on TensorFlowHub. To use it:", "The output consists of a list of vectors with 512 dimensions, each vector corresponding to a string of text in the input (in the example above e.g. \u201cThe quick brown fox\u2026\u201d). This model can be used as part of a larger network as per the transfer learning paradigm. One can use it as-it, with its parameters fixed, or fine-tune it by allowing the optimized to modify them. In turn, the output of the USE model are passed to other layers to train the rest of the network for a given downstream task. There are a few examples linked from the official documentation, but document classification is probably the most intuitive. In this example, we\u2019ll convert the abstract of pre-prints belonging to two very different categories (namely astro-ph and cs.AI) to sentence embeddings, and attach a dense layer with two outputs. Each output node corresponds to one category, thus a softmax activation function is applied before the output is compared to the actual labels. This is what a simple model would look like:", "Interestingly, one can train such a model in a few seconds with only 1,000 examples, and yet obtain a 99.6% accuracy.", "In order to \u201cquantize\u201d our model, we have to replace the layer that sits in between the embeddings and the output with a variational quantum circuit. Typically, a classical dense layer has N inputs and M outputs, so internally it corresponds to a matrix multiplication followed by the addition of bias, and the application of the activation function, e.g.:", "Unfortunately, quantum layers cannot do that explicitly, but need to be dressed. This means that a quantum variational layer is actually made of three operations:", "To do this with the PennyLane library, one has to define a device that will execute the quantum operations (e.g. the simulator default.qubit, or a real device such as those provided by IBMQ or Rigetti). Then, the actual circuit is encoded in a python function, e.g.:", "As one can stack a number of dense layer on top of each other to increase the depth of a network, the same can be done with quantum variational layers. In this example we\u2019ll keep it simple and run quickly with four qubits and just two layers.", "Finally, there a wrapper class QNode is responsible for dispatching the command to the backend device, and get the result out. Most notably, this class provides interfaces for both TensorFlow and PyTorch by simply specifying a parameter, e.g.:", "The overall quantum model would look like this:", "The quantum version of the classifier takes much longer (about one minute per epoch with a batch size of 32) to be trained using the simulator. That should not come as a surprise: if we had efficient simulations of quantum processes, we would not need quantum hardware in the first place! The fact is, no such thing can even exist in principle because quantum physics has properties such as entanglement that have no counterpart in the classical realm. So the takeaway message is that simulations of quantum processes take a long time, and become increasingly unmanageable as the number of qubits increase. On the other hand, real-life quantum hardware are noisy, hence the definition by John Preskill that we live currently in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) technology era. In fact, thermal noise limits the ability to carry out long computations without introducing errors and is probably today the main obstacle toward the goal of creating large scale, reliable quantum hardware.", "This being said, the hybrid network is able to perform classification with a 98.8% accuracy, comparable to the purely classical model. This, too, should not be too much a surprise as the heavy-lifting is actually done by the USE embedding layer. However, this is actually a remarkable result: it means that we can deploy transfer learning, so that we do not have to train a purely quantum network for the same purpose, but only use it for the downstream task. There is another example of transfer learning for image classification on the PennyLane website that I encourage to check out.", "The era of Quantum-enhanced Natural Language Processing is coming up!", "Your home for data science.
