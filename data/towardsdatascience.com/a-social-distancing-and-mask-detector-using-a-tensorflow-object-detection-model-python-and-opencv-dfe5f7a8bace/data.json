Social distancing also called \u201cphysical distancing\u201d, means keeping a safe space between yourself and other people who are not from your household. As the country has started to unlock amid surging COVID-19 cases, maintaining social distancing has become a key issue. The biggest concern revolving around the COVID-19 situation is how quickly the infection spreads from one person to another through contact or even being within proximity of an infected person. Social Distancing is here to stay longer than expected to fight Covid-19.", "So this got me thinking to develop an AI model to detect if people are following social distancing and at the same time are wearing masks. So here is a sample of the outcome of the model. With the use of deep learning and OpenCV, we can extract interesting insights from video clips. Red bounding boxes indicate that the person is in the proximity of another person and the blue box indicates the person is maintaining social distance. And we have separate bounding boxes for identifying if the person is wearing a mask or not.", "You can find the code I used on my Github Repo.", "The TensorFlow object detection API is the framework for creating a deep learning network that solves object detection problems. The API provides pre-trained object detection models which they refer to as Model Zoo, have been trained on the COCO dataset. The Common Objects in Context (COCO) dataset has 200,000 images with more than 500,000 object annotations in 90 commonly found objects. See the image below of objects that are part of the COCO dataset.", "In this case, we care about class \u2018Person\u2019 which is part of the COCO dataset.", "The API also has a big set of models it supports. See the table below for reference.", "The models have a trade-off between speed and accuracy. Here have I chosen ssd_mobilenet_v1_coco to detect \u2018Person\u2019. Once we identify the \u2018Person\u2019 using the object detection API, to predict if the person is maintaining social distance we can use OpenCV which is a powerful library for image processing. Once social distancing is detected, I have used faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco API which I had previously trained on top 2000 images using a GPU(NVIDIA Quadro P4000 Linux) to detect if the person is wearing a mask or not.", "Now let's go into the code in detail.", "If you are using the Tensorflow Object Detection API for the first time, please download the GitHub from this link.", "The main steps I followed are (please follow along in the jupyter notebook on my Github)", "This brings us to the end of my article. Social distancing along with other basic sanitary measures are very important to keep the spread of the Covid-19 as slow as possible. This project is only a proof of concept.", "I am well aware that this project is not perfect.
