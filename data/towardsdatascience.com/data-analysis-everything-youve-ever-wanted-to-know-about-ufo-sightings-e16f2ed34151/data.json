In this post, we dig into 80,000+ NUFORC (National UFO Reporting Center) UFO sighting reports. In the course of this investigation, we\u2019ll be using a host of methods in R, from treemaps, lollipop charts, and network diagrams, to geographical maps and even a couple of statistical tests.", "What might we learn from this? At the very least, if we want to maximize our chances of seeing a UFO, we might learn where and when to look for one. You might even learn some nifty R tricks for cleaning and visualizing your data. You can access the data here at NUFORC.", "Ever since I saw a UFO in the middle of broad daylight in the 3rd grade, I\u2019ve been interested in aliens and UFOs. Here\u2019s what happened.", "It was just another Sunday afternoon at the local park in La Mesa, CA. The year must have been around 1993 or so. As my buddy and I were skateboarding, something in the sky caught my eye. We looked up to watch a shiny, silver disk hovering effortlessly and silently in the blue sky, shooting across the lengths of entire clouds instantaneously. I don\u2019t mean it moved quickly. I mean it did not move \u2014 it simply appeared at different locations. The best way I can describe it would be to imagine taking a pencil and poking holes in a two-dimensional sheet of paper. If you were facing the paper, unaware of the pencil moving behind the paper, the holes would appear \u201cinstantaneously.\u201d In reality, the pencil is simply moving in another \u201chidden,\u201d third dimension.", "The UFO was not far from us, either, at a height you might see a helicopter. I distinctly remember the way the sun glared off the metallic exterior of the craft \u2014 it was just like the UFOs in the movies and the ones you hear about on your local news. Shocked, we ran and told our confused but intrigued parents, who then came and watched with us for another ten minutes or so. All in all, I believe we had at least five witnesses. Eventually, the UFO shot up into the atmosphere at a hyper-drive-like speed that can only be described as physically impossible. It simply vanished upwards, like a piece of dust being vacuumed up a tube.", "Ever since then, I\u2019ve tried to figure out what exactly UFOs might be. Could a government be so stupid as to test secret, highly-advanced technology in the middle of the day in San Diego? Not likely. Let\u2019s see if we can find out anything that might help us to decide whether UFOs are indeed human or alien.", "Now we can use the great tidytext package to dive into the reports and see what we can find in the text descriptions.", "Treemaps work by making the area of the rectangles proportional to some variable in our dataframe. In this case, we have counts of the bigrams, so we will set the size of the rectangles to reflect the count of each pair. Hopefully this will tell us something interesting about the most common characteristics of UFOs.", "As I expected, most people say that UFOs move at incredibly fast speeds. I like the description of \u201cwarp speed.\u201d I\u2019d say the UFO I saw also moved at a laws-of-physics-defyingly fast speed.", "It seems like there\u2019s a definite pattern of UFOs having erratic and unusual kinds of movements.", "Interestingly lots of cigar-shaped and triangle shaped UFOs. I\u2019ve never heard of Chevron/boomerang shaped UFOs before.", "It looks like most of the lights seen are either white, orange, red, or blue lights.", "Another way to represent the same information is a lollipop chart. These are essentially slicker-looking versions of bar charts, where the length of the bar is proportional to some column in our dataframe. Remember that in ggplot2, we use the aes() argument to map variables (i.e., columns) onto our plots. This is an extremely useful aspect of ggplot.", "The lubridate package is great. It makes working with dates and times easy. If you\u2019re familiar with xts or ts objects, you\u2019ll know that working with dates and times in R can be cumbersome.", "One really handy function is floor_date(), which allows you to essentially aggregate observations into buckets of time. It\u2019s similar to how you might choose your bin size in a histogram, but here we are choosing what interval of time to consider a \u2018bin\u2019 or \u2018bucket.\u2019 As you change the interval (i.e., unit of time), you\u2019ll see different patterns emerge as the zoom level of the data changes. You\u2019ll need to use your judgment to figure out which level of aggregation best fits your needs.", "California, Washington and Florida see the most UFOs. Not surprising given their large populations.", "California has dominated with sightings, though Washington took over in the mid 1990s for just a year or so. What about which cities have seen the most UFOs?", "How have UFO sightings changed over time in the most popular UFO locations?", "We can see that all of the top cities have experienced roughly the same increase in sightings over time. Seattle and Phoenix stand out as having the most in a single year. Strangely sightings seem to have decreased since 2008.", "How have UFO shapes changed over time? Are cigar-shaped UFOs as common as disk-shaped ones?", "Looks like lights are the most common now, though it wasn\u2019t always that way. Disks dominated back in the day.", "Instead of counts, let\u2019s look at the proportion of each shape sighted:", "Since the 1950s disks have gone down massively in popularity, while triangles rose to the top in the late 1980s, then were finally overtaken by lights. Spheres and circles have remained stable at around 10% of all sightings.", "How have shapes changed in California over the past 50 years?", "Are there daily patterns to sightings? What time of day is best to maximize one\u2019s chances of seeing a UFO? We\u2019ll use the super useful functions from lubridate that extract the different pieces of time out the datetime objects we created. Once we mutate the new columns it\u2019s super easy to groupby() on these times and make nice visuals.", "Now we are ready to start grouping and visualizing.", "This was really unexpected: UFOs are extremely seasonal! Nearly every year shows the same distribution of sightings through the months with a big peak between June and July in almost every year. What could possibly explain that?", "What about time of day? Do more sightings happen in the morning or evening?", "I\u2019m surprised by the fact the most sightings are happening around 9\u201311 p.m. Of course at night our vision isn\u2019t good and there are so many other things in the sky competing for our attention.", "Also, look at the two peaks visible in the chart above: first, the big peak on the 4th and the big peak around midnight on the 1st. We\u2019ll explain these shortly.", "I realize now that my daytime sighting was a very rare event. How rare? Let\u2019s estimate the probability of seeing a UFO at 3 p.m.", "Apparently only about 1.7% of all sightings occur between 3\u20134 p.m. We can also see that only about 33% of sightings occur between midnight and 3 p.m. The vast majority happen between 8\u201310 p.m. More specifically, nearly 50% of sightings (actually I should say reports of sightings) occur between 8 p.m. and midnight.", "What about the day of the week? Do more sightings happen on the weekends? I saw mine on a Sunday afternoon. We\u2019ll use lubridate\u2019s useful wday() to get the name of the day.", "Saturdays and Sundays do indeed see a big uptick in sightings. But does this always hold in all months? If you\u2019re familiar with Simpson\u2019s Paradox, then you\u2019d know that sometimes aggregate results can be completely at odds with results broken down into groups.", "As suspected, there are more sightings on the weekends. There is more time to stare into the sky and drink alcohol, all of which would explain the increase in sightings. The gradual ramping up of sightings through the week is similar to what you would see in retail sales. Monday is slow then shopping picks up through the week, with the biggest bumps on the weekends. This suggests to me that the sightings are more of a function of people\u2019s weekly schedules/habits than any real alien phenomenon.", "Is this weekend bump a random fluke? Let\u2019s conduct a Chi-Squared significance test of the day of the week. We\u2019ll assume as a null hypothesis that sightings are equally likely to occur on any day of the week.", "Yup, it\u2019s almost certain that weekend sighting rates are substantially higher than weekday, assuming the null hypothesis of equal probability of occurrence.", "Are there certain months where UFO sightings occur at different times?", "This graphic shows us that for the top 5 states, all have similar UFO sighting times throughout the day. Yet in July we notice a spike coming from more sightings past 8 p.m. Could it have something to do with the Fourth of July holiday? More people are outside and looking at the sky for fireworks, maybe?", "The two days with the biggest spikes in sightings are indeed the Fourth of July and New Year\u2019s Eve, two days where tons of people shoot fireworks into the night sky. I was hoping there would be a much cooler reason for the mysterious spike in sightings during the middle of the year \u2014 but it turns out it\u2019s likely just people mistaking fireworks for alien spacecraft.", "The only cyclical pattern in UFO sightings is that of Americans\u2019 weekly routines. I don\u2019t see much evidence here that people see UFOs beyond what they would be expected to given their increased leisure time and consumption of alcohol on weekends and holidays.", "With this section concluded, let\u2019s go back to the textual descriptions and see if we can find anything of interest there.", "The igraph and ggraph packages will help us here. And I highly recommend the free tidytext book by David Robinson and Julia Silge.", "This graph gives a nice overview of the major descriptions of the UFOs. The direction of the arrows indicate whether the word was the 1st or 2nd word in the bigram pair.", "To conclude our analysis, let\u2019s focus on geographic locations to see if we can find any \u201chotspots\u201d or patterns in sightings.", "In order to plot using latitude and longitude, we\u2019ll follow the same strategy I outlined in my ggmaps tutorial. First, groupby() location, then average the latitude and longitude of each city. If you want to see how that was done, go here.", "Note: I believe Google Maps has changed their API. Now you must sign up for access.", "We are ready to visualize by overlaying our dataframe on top of our country map.", "Besides most sightings happening in big cities on the coasts (where most of the people live), it is interesting to see a big vertical gap in the Midwest where almost no sightings occur. I wonder if geographical features (mountains/rivers) are playing a role. There\u2019s almost a vertical line splitting the US into two halves.", "Where are the UFOs in Kansas, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota? There also is a gap in sightings in the region that appears to be Northern Nevada and Idaho.", "Can we zoom in to better see?", "Clearly the bigger the population, the more opportunity for sightings. It could be the relatively sparsely populated areas that account for the lack of sightings. Or it could be that UFOs have an aversion to potatoes. I\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll ever know. For now, I\u2019m sticking with the potato hypothesis.", "In order to do this we will look at single words that are most common in each region.", "First, you should note that I removed the word \u201cred\u201d and \u201cnight\u201d to make room for other, possibly more meaningful words. So if you see some red stuff at night, there\u2019s a good chance it\u2019s a UFO.", "Second, we see that fast glowing fireballs seem more common around Seattle. Though in Southern Texas there also seems to be many green fireballs. By the way, the Seattle Fireballs would make an awesome NBA team name. Just saying.", "It is also interesting to see which areas witness UFO formations. It looks like the areas near Lake Havasu, CA and Phoenix, AZ tend to see more UFO formations.", "Is it just a coincidence that the areas without many UFOs seem to be located in the general area where Area 51 is claimed to exist? Probably not. Most of the terrain is just sand and mountains with very few people around to spot a UFO. I would be very surprised if we found a location with a very small population but a lot of UFO sightings. That would indicate something abnormal is happening there.", "Based on this graphic there don\u2019t seem to be any unpopulated areas with high amounts of UFOs: UFO reports are basically a function of having more people around to make UFO reports \u2014 not any underlying increase in unidentified flying objects. This goes to show you the limits of pure data analysis without causal knowledge: garbage in, garbage out. I would say that probably a very high percentage of these reports are false positives.", "Once we figured out that 4th of July and New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks were responsible for the big spikes in reports, I lost a lot of faith in the quality of the reports. The fact that many more are reported on weekends is also dubious. Most of the reports are probably just a result of people with more free time on their hands. Also, given the huge numbers of mere \u201clights\u201d that people see, there are just so many possible things they could be.", "It\u2019s also troubling that there are almost no more sightings of \u201ccigar-shaped\u201d or \u2018disk-shaped\u2019 flying saucers anymore. For my money, I would only trust sightings that occur in daylight and under good, clear weather conditions.", "The truth, apparently, is still out there.", "Your home for data science.
