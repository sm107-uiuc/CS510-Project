As a result of this, thousands of COVID cases were \u201clost\u201d in the UK. People who were infected with the disease did not know they were positive \u2014 meaning they could have infected others unknowingly or skipped seeking treatment, which could have resulted in potential deaths.", "How could this have been avoided?", "The absolute first thing to do is to make sure the size of the data matches what you were expecting from the original source. In most cases, you\u2019ll only need to check two numbers: the number of columns and the number of rows.", "Example of a failed check: If you were trying to import daily Google stock price data for 2019, and your imported data contained 15,000 rows (expected 365).", "This check alone could have prevented the missing COVID data.", "Next, you need to give a quick glance over the first few rows of the data.
