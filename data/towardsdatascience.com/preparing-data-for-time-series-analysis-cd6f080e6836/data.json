However, to unlock this potential, data needs to be prepared and formatted appropriately before putting it through the analytics pipeline.", "TS may look like a simple data object and easy to deal with, but the reality is that for someone new it can be a daunting task just to prepare the dataset before the actual fun stuff can begin.", "So in this article we will talk about some simple tips and tricks for getting the analysis-ready data to potentially save many hours of one\u2019s productive time.", "If you are doing the analysis with your own dataset, you have it. But folks who are just learning TSA, finding the right dataset can be burdensome.", "There are actually quite a few data sources. Some datasets \u2014 toy data as they are known\u2014 that came with machine learning libraries have been around for a long time. These \u201ctoy\u201d data are great to play with, especially for beginners. But it\u2019s an addiction that everyone needs to get past ASAP and dive into the real world.", "Below are some sources to find data on a range of topics in different domains \u2014 some are curated and some require cleanups. You should definitely find your favorite one from this list.", "I recommend that you start with curated datasets so you don\u2019t have to pull your hair to fix problems with data and lose interest in the real fun stuff. But once you learn the fundamentals, find data as messy as possible, it will force you to go through the entire analytical pipeline.", "Okay, so here are some toy datasets \u2014 clean, curated and analysis-ready \u2014 frequently used in machine learning tutorials:", "For real-world datasets, there are some really great repositories. I honestly think you don\u2019t need to go beyond these repositories to learn advanced TS analytics and modeling.", "1 ) The US Census Bureau has a large selection of time series data on a wide range of US business activities", "2 ) Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) is a great data source on the US economic indicators", "3 ) World Development Indicators (WDI) is a huge repository on social, economic and environmental issues of countries around the world, maintained by the World Bank.", "For starters, there\u2019s always a temptation to treat time series just like any other dataset. And then jump the gun. But TS observations are different from cross-sectional observations we are familiar with.", "Time series data have been around for a long time and many people devoted their lives to make other peoples\u2019 lives easier (Rob Hyndman in R programming language and Jason Brownlee in Python world came to mind).", "There are quite a few wonderful libraries specifically designed to deal with TS data. Through transforming data you let the library recognize that it as a special TS object.", "Assuming that you have done the required pre-processing \u2014 e.g. renaming columns, taking care of missing values etc. \u2014 here is how you\u2019d prepare data in a few steps.", "For this exercise I\u2019m using a toy data over-used in machine learning \u2014 air passenger dataset \u2014 and executing codes in Python.", "All we can see from the first few rows is that the dataset has two columns, the first representing a date column in \u2018yyyy \u2014 mm\u2019 format and a value column with actual observations.", "Remember, we don\u2019t know yet if it is a time series object, all we know is it\u2019s a dataframe with two columns.", "So among other info this summary confirms that it is a pandas dataframe with two columns. The first column is an object and the second one an integer.", "It doesn\u2019t show any time dimension, that\u2019s because Month column is stored as strings. So we\u2019ll need to convert that into a datetime format.", "Next, make it the index. The benefit of doing so is that you can filter/slice data any way you want: by year, month, days, weekdays, weekends, specific day/month/year range and so on.", "One final good practice is extracting years, months and weekdays from the datetime index and storing them in separate columns. This gives some extra flexibility to \u201cgroup by\u201d data according to year/month etc if needed.", "So here we have it, the final dataset. Just compare the differences compared with the original data. Also, as highlighted in yellow ink below, it now confirms that it is not just any dataframe, it\u2019s a time series object.", "In summary, we have done a few things to convert our data into a time series object:", "1) converted the Month column from strings to datetime;", "2) set the transformed datetime column as the index;", "3) extracted year, month and weekday from the index and stored in new columns", "Now that you have the analysis-ready data, what\u2019s next? You can now have all the fun analysis you want with this, which I\u2019ll cover in future posts.
