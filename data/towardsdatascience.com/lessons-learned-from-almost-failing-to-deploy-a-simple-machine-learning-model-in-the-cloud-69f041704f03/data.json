Its source code can be found in the dedicated GitLab link.", "As a cybersecurity consultant and a junior software engineer working for large corporations, we have always had an interest in cloud and seeing how this technology can be leveraged for developing simple AI applications.", "With Covid-19 and lockdowns, we started having many ideas which would combine the skills we learned during our short careers. However, we decided to start with a very simple \u2014 and unoriginal \u2014 idea before jumping into a more complex project: To deploy a simple and production-ready web application that would guess people\u2019s age thanks to a trained neural network.", "We focused on the creation process and learn the \u201cbest way\u201d of doing things. We defined the following constraints:", "Based on our project context and objectives, our approach was to follow the below steps:", "This project looked quite easy to build and deploy, doesn\u2019t it?", "When looking at this approach, there are some key words for which we underestimated the underlying difficulty and didn\u2019t ask ourselves some relevant questions such as:", "When thinking about how to write this article, we realized that most of the mistakes me made could be grouped into four major mistakes. If you are new to AI and/or Cloud, we hope that our very short experience in the field can help you avoid making the same mistakes.", "Over the past couple of years, we have been hearing a lot about the wonderful world of fully managed PaaS (Platform as a Service) and SaaS (Software as a Service) products. For our project, we wanted to use a service that would allow us to deploy our trained model without needing to worry about infrastructure or costs.", "Thanks to a quick google search, we understood that the most fashionable and cheapest (via free tier advantages) service at the moment was called AWS SageMaker. Our decision to pick this service was based on the very first introduction sentence on the product\u2019s page: \u201cAmazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer (\u2026) with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly\u201d.", "As mentioned previously, our goal was to \u201cquickly\u201d develop a TensorFlow Python project and migrate this project to SageMaker in order to train our model once it was functional. We believed that only minor refactoring would be required to migrate our source code to SageMake.", "However, we realized after developing our training scripts that the migration was a non-trivial process which would require major refactoring of our code. In fact, we figured out that our preprocessing would simply not work following SageMaker\u2019s training workflow. In order to train our model, we would have to completely rework our training scripts.", "Our main (and obvious) mistake was jumping right into code development before validating our understanding and assumptions about how SageMaker works. On top of that, we did not take into consideration SageMaker\u2019s pricing model. Although we knew that SageMaker was free for the first two months (which was supposed to be enough to train our model), we discovered that SageMaker simply relies on EC2 instances. We understood that a Jupyter notebook would have to be constantly running in order to be used in conjunction with API gateway. This would break two of our main requirements:", "Very quickly, we realized that this could have been avoided by simply reading SageMaker\u2019s documentation and pricing model. \u201cDuh!\u201d you might be thinking. However, we were blindly convinced that such a popular service would provide us with everything we needed to succeed.", "TL;DR: If you do not know the tech, do not assume that it will meet your way of working based on its popularity. In our context, we should have simply adapted our training scripts to SageMaker requirements rather than hoping that the tool could import any training scripts.", "This second major mistake is linked to the first one as it is in fact its cause. In this section we will talk about the classic mistake of trying to build things that have already been built by experts in the past. During our project, we realized that we spent too much time trying to re-engineer a well-known and efficient solution: Neural Network Models that provide age recognition.", "The open source community is awesome, and most of the time, it is very likely that people will have already built awesome tools that do what you\u2019re looking for.", "Even if you feel \u2014 like us \u2014 very excited about the project and you want to build everything yourself, it might be a bad idea to blindly start coding. As you probably know, it is highly recommendable do some research on what has been done about the topic you want to tackle.", "This might sound obvious at first, but you will understand the importance of these words when you experiment and suffer the consequences of not doing it. In our case, we started working on our neural network immediately since we believed we could train and deploy such model without much effort.", "In fact, even though we were not convinced by our training scripts or the quality of the data, we tried to give it a go on AWS via GPU-optimized instances. The result? After spending 10\u20ac and countless tweaks, our top result was a model with a 20% accuracy on the training dataset. Although we learned a lot about the process, this turned out to be a disaster.", "You might be thinking: \u201cIf you don\u2019t want to learn how to train a model, why don\u2019t you directly use a public API such as AWS Rekognition or Google Cloud Vision?\u201d. The answer to that question is fairly simple: The main objective of our project was to learn how to deploy an AI model to the cloud and make it scalable and production-ready.", "After failing to build the local project (the causes of which are explained in the next section), we faced the truth and started looking for an alternative. We started doing some research, and we found what we were looking for with: DEX: Deep EXpectation of apparent age from a single image.", "Rasmus Rothe, Radu Timofte and Luc Van Gool published a dataset with more than 500k images with age and gender labels as well as their respective trained model. And the cherry on the cake was that the paper was the winner of the NVIDIA apparent age competition in 2015. We went from trying to build everything on our own to having one of the best ready-to-use age recognition models \ud83d\udc4f.", "At this point we were confronted with the fact that this paper was better than anything that we could have built, and by far. In fact, we realized that this was not a bad thing since we are not data scientists, and our goal was never to improve the state of the art way of predicting face ages. Although we were sad to see that we could not implement our own trained model, we learned that way better people already built an awesome model. It was therefore obvious to us that we should reuse that model.", "Our problem here was that we started working on parts of the project that weren\u2019t necessarily of interest to us since we assumed that they were trivial. This meant that we ended up re-building a worse and less performant neural network model.", "On a positive note, we learned a lot about deep learning by reading the paper, and more specifically the fact that training a model is not a trivial task. On top of that, most of our constraints (learn by doing, having fun, building a real product) remained intact, meaning that we were still motivated to move on!", "After abandoning the hope to develop and train our very own ML model, we started working on the back-end that would provide users with their age once the upload a picture.", "We started developing a simple Flask API in order to confirm that we could understand how to use the trained model. The result was a simple ~90 lines-long python script:", "Once we validated that this API worked locally, our next objective was to migrate this to a \u201cfree to use\u201d and \u201cinfinitely scalable\u201d AWS service. With that in mind, we took the path of using AWS API Gateway and AWS Lambda functions. Since we had a positive previous experience with these tools, we did not even bother checking out any limitations since we \u201cknew\u201d how to do it.", "We encountered our first issue when trying to launch a Python Lambda function with OpenCV and other dependencies. We learned that this could be done with Lambda layers and packaging our lambda function with its dependencies. You will find below the lessons learned after a lot of troubleshooting:", "After learning how to correctly download our script dependencies and package them, we uploaded the script to the lambda environment and noted that the remaining step was to import and use our trained ML models.", "We were confronted with a harsh reality once again: Lambda functions have restrictive storage limits. By reading Lambda\u2019s official documentation, we noted that each functions deployment packages has a maximum size of 250 MB while both our ML models were 500 MB and 600 MB.", "Please note that this might not be accurate anymore since Lambda supports EFS now.", "Once again, we tripped over the same stone: We did not take the time to read and learn about the limitations of the products we wanted to use. We were, once more, blindly guided by the hype and great use cases delivered by this Function-as-a-Service product. In this case, we overestimated our knowledge of the technology based on great results we had from previous experiences.", "What should have been done before trying to port our code? Do some basic research and understand if the product is adapted to our needs. It appears that selecting the most popular product can sometimes mean making a very poor technological choice. See for example \u2014 what we should have read before even starting \u2014 \u201cWhy we don\u2019t use Lambda for serverless machine learning\u201d.", "This project was driven by the belief that we knew how to make things \u201cproperly\u201d even though we had very little experience on the fields we were addressing (i.e. AI and Cloud). The fourth and last major mistake is in fact the cause of our other mistakes: We underestimated the difficulty of delivering production-ready products while being overly confident that we had sufficient knowledge on how things should be done based on what we had read and heard about each of the underlying technologies.", "We started our project having a look at large data sets available online. We mainly searched through Kaggle and found a model with 10.000 faces labelled by their ages. \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d \u2014 we thought \u2014 but when we started deep diving a bit into the data we realized that the road to create a good predictor was not going to be as peaceful as we thought.", "Firstly, we underestimated how difficult it would be to obtain a proper dataset for free:", "Amount of data: Although we never considered ourselves experts on the field of AI, we knew that having only 10.000 faces from 100 different people would not be sufficient to train an accurate model. In this context, we realized that the amount of data was insufficient. In addition, when we analyzed the amount of faces per age, we realized that the dataset was completely unbalanced. Although we tried to balance the dataset by grouping the faces by range of age, the result remained very unbalanced. We noted that 90% of the available pictures were from 30 to 50 years old individuals.", "Quality of data: In addition to the previous issue, we discovered that the data was biased. We noted that most of the pictures were pictures from celebrities. We knew that we could not use pictures from Keanu Reeves and hope that the average looking person looks as young as him. On top of that, we noted that some images were cropped and would show a fairly incomplete part of the face.", "Lesson learned: Before jumping into training the neural network with a dataset, take the time to ensure that the data you have downloaded has sufficient quality and quantity of samples.", "Then, we overestimated our knowledge on AI and Cloud and the target solution.", "As very curious people, we have always tried to learn as much as possible about everything in the shortest amount of time. In this context, the concepts of Cloud and Artificial Intelligence were two topics on which we spent a significant amount of time reading about the great things companies and startups make, but a very limited amount of time to understand and deep dive into the technology being used.", "In essence, we could say that our knowledge of the technologies we wanted to work with was very low, although we felt like we knew a lot. This could be explained by the below graph, which we are sure is very familiar to many of you:", "Without spending too much time analyzing this graph, we can confirm that at the beginning of this project we felt somewhere around the \u201cPeak of mount stupid\u201d, and that, over time, we were able to enter the Valley of Dispair. This project helped us realize how little we knew about Machine Learning.", "We learned the important lesson that selecting the right piece of technology and the right data to begin with is not always simple. There is a significant gap between the creation of a working Proof of Concept, and the deployment of a user-friendly and \u201cfinal\u201d product.", "With the above picture you will see a good description of our expectations against the reality. The result of our multiple mistakes and changes led us to the following \u201cfinal\u201d result:", "By doing a self-assessment against our main objectives, we reached the following conclusions:", "During the building process of this project, we noted that the mistakes we kept making were smaller and less time consuming since our ability to find pragmatic solutions grew. Below we listed the lessons learnt from this project:", "Although we are quite happy with our solution result and the results achieved with this project, we are aware that the solution is far away from being \u201cproduction-ready\u201d since we are currently hosting our model in a single (and not very performant) Virtual Machine. This means that if our project becomes suddenly popular, it will basically crash. Multiple solutions could be used to ensure the project is scalable for a very limited cost. Below are some of our thoughts:", "I am Jonathan Bernales, a Cyber Security consultant working at Deloitte Luxembourg, I mainly work for the Financial Services Industry and I am passionate about how technology and security can transform industries and create business opportunities over time.", "I am Manuel Cubillo, a Software Engineer who loves technology and the way that it can impact on our lives.

On my free time, I enjoy sports and reading.", "Feel free to get in touch with us shall you have any question or would like to have a tutorial about this project!", "I am a Dev(Sec)Ops Engineer at Ekonoo.
