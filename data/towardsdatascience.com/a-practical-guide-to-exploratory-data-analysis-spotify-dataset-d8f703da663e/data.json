We can collect lots of data which allows to infer meaningful results and make informed business decisions. However, as the amount of data increases, it gets trickier to analyze and explore the data. There comes in the power of visualizations which are great tools in exploratory data analysis when used efficiently and appropriately. Visualizations also help to deliver a message to your audience or inform them about your findings. There is no one-fits-all kind of visualization method so certain tasks require different kinds of visualizations. In this post, we will try to explore the Spotify dataset that is available here on Kaggle.", "Kaggle is a very popular platform among people in data science domain. Its fame comes from the competitions but there are also many datasets that we can work on for practice. One of the cool things about Kaggle is that you can create notebooks, directly import datasets on Kaggle and share your work on the website without having to download anything.", "Just click on \u201cnew notebook\u201d and select your preferred language. Once the notebook is launched, click on \u201cadd data\u201d and select the dataset you want to work on.", "After adding the dataset, we can start by reading the dataset into a pandas dataframe.", "Dataset contains more than 160.000 songs collected from Spotify Web API. The features include song, artist, release date as well as some characteristics of song such as acousticness, danceability, loudness, tempo and so on. Date range is from 1921 to 2020.", "Let\u2019s first check if there is any missing value:", "There is no missing value. df.isna().sum() returns the number of missing values in each column. By adding another sum(), we get the total number of missing values in the dataset.", "I will not use some of the features in my analysis so I will drop them.", "The dataset includes many different measures on songs. Some of the names give an idea of what they mean such as tempo, loudness, energy. There are also very specific measures that are hard to understand if you are not that into music. For instance, acousticness, liveness, and speechiness are technical terms that we do not hear often.", "Some of these measures may be correlated. At first glance, danceability and valence seem correlated. We can use corr method of pandas to calculate the correlation and use a heatmap to visualize them.", "There is a positive correlation between valence and danceability as we suspected. There seems to be a strong negative correlation between energy and acousticness.", "Let\u2019s also check top 10 artists in terms of average energy per song and compare the results with their average acousticness values.", "With a few exceptions, artists with high energy songs produce low acousticness. The average acousticness in the entire dataset is 0.50.", "The dataset contains songs from as far back as 1921. We can get an overview how the characteristics of song change over a hundred-year-period.", "For five different measures, we obtained the average yearly values. The variety of different software packages and useful functions, there is almost always more than one way to do a task in the field of data science. I will show you two different ways to create a line graph that shows the trends in these variables over time.", "The first one is to create a figure and add a line for each trend.", "Another way is to convert year_avg dataframe to a long dataframe using pandas melt function.", "Different measures are combined under a column named \u201cvariable\u201d. 5 features are combined into one feature so the length of melted dataframe must be 5 times the length of year_avg dataframe:", "We confirmed the shapes. Let\u2019s now see how to create the same plot using the melted dataframe.", "Instead of adding multiple axes, we used hue parameter which made the syntax simpler. Both of these two ways produce this plot:", "I wonder how many unique artists we have in the dataset.", "There are 33268 artists in the entire dataset. Some of them produce a lot of songs whereas there are some artists with very few songs. Let\u2019s see the top 7 artists who have the most songs in the dataset.", "Francisco Canaro has 956 songs and the runner up, Ignacio Corsini, has 635. We can create a new dataframe that shows yearly song production for these 7 artists.", "We first create a list using the index returned by value_counts function:", "Then filter the dataframe using this list and group by year:", "This dataframe contains artist name, year, and how many songs the artist produced in that year.", "We cannot really separate the lines. Since it is such a long period (100 years) artists appear in only a part of the entire timeline. For instance, \u201cFrancisco Canaro\u201d seems to be dominating 1930s.", "I will now try a different way to see which artists are dominating which era. First, I will create an empty dataframe that contains the entire timeline (1921\u20132020) and the names of top 7 artists.", "The dataframe includes 100 rows for 100 years and 8 columns (7 artists and a year column). Then I will convert it to a long dataframe using melt function.", "Song count is zero in all years. I will merge song counts from df_artists dataframe using pandas merge function.", "If an artist does not have any songs in a particular year, that value is filled with NaN. Please note that it is important to set how parameter of merge function as \u201couter\u201d. Otherwise, merged dataframe only includes year-artist combination in which there is at least one song of that artist.", "I will replace NaN values with 0 and drop song_count_x column.", "I also want to add a column that shows the cumulative sum of the songs that each artist produced over the years. One way to do that is to use groupby and cumsum functions.", "If we only use cumsum and not groupby on artists, then cumsum column includes cumulative sum based on only years. It does not take artist column into consideration.", "I\u2019ve managed to reformat the dataframe that fits to what I want to plot. I will create an animated bar plot that spans through the entire timeline. There will be a bar for each artists. The bars will go up as the cumulative number of songs for artists increase. We will be able to see how each artist dominates in different years.", "I will use plotly python (plotly.py) which is a great library to create interactive visualizations. Plotly express is the high level API of plotly that also makes the syntax very simple and easy to understand.", "I paused the recording at 1986 and started again at the end. Dynamic plots change based on what is passed to animation_frame and animation_group parameters. It is important to define a range to prevent datapoints from falling out of the figure.", "We have covered some techniques to manipulate or change the format of a dataframe. We have also created some basic plots as well as an animated plot. There is much more we can do on this dataset. For instance, we can analyze the popularity of songs or artists. How popularity changes over time based on the music style can also be investigated. Thus, there is no limit to the exploratory data analysis process. We can approach the dataframe from a specific point of view depending on our needs. However, the techniques and operations are usually the same. So, it is better to practice with different kind of datasets.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
