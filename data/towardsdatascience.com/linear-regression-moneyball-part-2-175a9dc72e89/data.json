In this post, we will continue to study relationships between the numerical variables and build a few models to predict the Oakland A\u2019s run in 2002.", "Let us have a look at the data again.", "Now let us look at the formulas for calculating some of the numerical terms that may seem obscure to most people.", "We can see that all three of the statistics previously discussed contribute in some way to the number of runs scored by the team. I won\u2019t go into specific details of explaining each variable involved. All you need to know is that OBP, SLG and AVG are strong indicators of runs scored by the particular team.", "Let us validate these assumptions by plotting the relationship between each of these variables with RS(Runs scored):", "There is a clear linear relationship between each of the variables and runs scored.", "As a rule of thumb, correlation above 0.7 is considered as strong positive correlation. All of our variables satisfy this rule.", "Similarly, we can hypothesise that OOBP(Opponent\u2019s OBP) and OSLG(Opponent\u2019s SLG) have a similar relationship with RA(Runs allowed).", "Before we see the relationship between these variables and RA, I noticed that there are a few missing values in the OOBP and OSLG columns. We have to remove these rows of observations in order to plot a proper relationship. In a future post I shall explain about the various ways we can \u2018impute\u2019 missing data.", "We store the reduced dataset into a new variable.", "Let us now see the relationship between these variables and RA:", "We shall now build regression models in order to predict runs scored, runs allowed and wins.", "The scikit-learn library in python is extremely powerful in building a vast variety of machine learning models using very few lines of code. We shall utilise this library in order to build our models.", "Our first model is used to predict \u2018runs scored\u2019. Our independent variables as on-base percentage, slugging percentage, batting average.", "Thus, our model is of the following form:", "At this point, we notice something odd. Our model has a variable with a negative coefficient a.k.a Batting Average. This is counter-intuitive as a team with a higher batting average should have more runs scored. This situation represents a phenomenon known as multi-collinearity which leads to discrepancies in multiple linear regression models.", "In order to avoid multi-collinearity, we must either add an interaction variable or remove the variable causing the discrepancy. For the sake of simplicity let us remove BA from our model.", "Similarly, we build a model for \u2018runs allowed\u2019 using opponent\u2019s on-base percentage and opponent\u2019s slugging percentage as independent variables:", "Lastly, our model for predicting wins from runs difference:", "Here are the Oakland Athletics statistics in 2001 before the playoffs.", "Lets plug in these values into the above models to generate predictions.", "Thus, our models predicted the following:", "Finally, we plug in RD into our wins model:", "Comparing our model results with the actual outcome and De Podesta\u2019s estimates we get:", "Quite remarkable isn\u2019t it? Our model\u2019s predictions actually turned out to be fairly accurate as compared to reality.", "We finally conclude our case study of linear regression applied to Sabermetrics. An important point to note is that during this case study I made a lot of assumptions about our regression models. In a future post, I will discuss in depth about regression assumptions and how to avoid violating them.", "I hope all of you enjoyed this two-part blog post on linear regression.
