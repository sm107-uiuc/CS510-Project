The motivation for this article derives from an unusually large number of requests that I have received or seen regarding the topic. The underlying reason for this is the discontinuation of Google\u2019s SOAP and AJAX API s \u2014 both of which were designed for this exact purpose. There are many areas around data-science and python that are very well documented, but I have found that the use of a Google search within Python is not as well documented, which was my motivation for this article.", "The use of a Google search has become a staple of our time unlocking information from all corners of the internet within just a few milliseconds. Over the last 20 years, we have relied on this common method to query information ranging from news articles, all the way to research topics. With the rise of data science over the last few years, two of the most common reasons to search the internet are (1) solving problems with Stack Overflow, or (2) data mining \u2014 the second of which will be the focus of this article.", "Whether this is being done for a scientific purpose, or a business intelligence project, Python and data mining have proven to be a very effective pair of tools. Data mining is defined as the method of examining large sets of data to extract new information or insights. For the purposes of this article as it relates to the web, the method of mining data from the internet is known as web mining, which can be split into three categories: (1) Web Content Mining, (2) Web Usage Mining, and (3) Web Structure Mining.", "In many of the recent projects that I have seen related to web mining, the preferred method of retrieving data was using a google search to retrieve URLs for web scraping purposes. The bulk of the projects followed this general format in which URLs were obtained, each URL was parsed and scraped, and finally all the data was organized. For the purposes of this article, we will focus only on the URL retrieval process (blue section) for now. It is important to highlight that depending on the type of data you are looking for; the utilization of RSS feeds may be more appropriate. This of course will be heavily dependent on whether the sources of data you are considering offer an RSS feed. We will revisit this issue in just a moment.", "Let us now examine a specific use case. We wish to identify and quantify news articles of a certain company or topic of interest. In this case, I want to find all the articles relating to what people are saying about the new iPhone from Apple Inc.", "On the date that this article was published, there were three common libraries that allowed for a Google search via Python. We will begin with the easiest and move to the most complex as I would like to ensure all data scientists and all non-technical readers are able follow. That said, you will notice that the code I outline is not exactly the most \u201cPythonic\u201d. While writing this article, I tried to maintain a healthy balance between \u201ceasy\u201d and \u201cefficient\u201d to ensure all readers benefit from this.", "Option #1 \u2014 The \u2018google\u2019 library (Free, but limited)", "We begin by installing the google library using pip on the terminal command line:", "In our Jupyter Notebook, we can then import the library via:", "We then outline what it is we want to query. In our case, we wish to monitor a specific company or a topic. Let us take for example the company \u201cApple\u201d and the topic \u201ciPhone\u201d and retrieve news articles about those.", "The next step is to create an empty list, and use a \u201cfor loop\u201d to iterate through the code:", "This library works well and returns results reliably (and for free!). However, there is one aspect that we have not considered. The \u201cpause\u201d argument delays the query by 2 seconds each time. This will significantly increase your search time if you are looking for a larger number of results. Removing this argument will generally result in a 403 error within a few seconds (aka Google stopping you). There is no good way to remedy this issue (at least with this particular package) aside from abiding by the 2 second rule.", "Option #2 \u2014 The google-search-results library (Not free, unlimited)", "The second option here is to use the google search capabilities of SERP.", "Although this library has a cost associated with it, it is worth looking into as it allows you to circumvent the 2 second pause for HTTP requests in the google library above in Option #1. In summary, it is a great library but it is not free.", "Option #3 \u2014The Google API Client (Mostly Free, mostly unlimited)", "The Google API client, to my knowledge, is the only Google-owned item from the ones we have looked at so far. They offer a wide range of capabilities when it comes to navigating this space. I list them last as the process of getting an account fully set up and ready to go can be a difficult space to navigate for some. However, if you are developing a model that heavily relies search queries, I would recommend that you jump to this option above all others.", "I have tried to cover the basic steps of getting registered in the past, but minor steps within the process seem to change quite often. I recommend you start off by reading the most current \u201cGetting Started\u201d page first. Once you have set up an account, you will need to obtain two items: (1) A private API key, and (2) A Custom Search Engine ID.", "Once you have your account set up, go ahead and install the library:", "With the library installed, you can go ahead and run your first query:", "This last option is what I would argue to be the best way to retrieve a list of URLs (and even some of the raw HTML data!) in a reliable and free way.", "With these three approaches concluded, we end with a list of URLs that we can now parse through to retrieve information of interest. One aspect that I would like to point out is that we ran a google search to retrieve information about a company or topic of interest. One may argue that an RSS feed would have been more appropriate for retrieving news \u2014 and it is. However, when it comes to a business intelligence standpoint, we want to ensure that all relevant results are present in our query, and that the data does not have a bias towards one news source over another. A common approach is combining the results of the query and RSS feeds together, however, we will discuss that another time.", "Now that you have a list of URLs all set up, your next objective is to parse through the URLs and retrieve data. Scraping the web is a well-documented area of data science that has flourished with articles and tutorials over the recent years. That said, I will not cover it in this article. However, I will provide some guidance on next steps.", "Looking back to the previously mentioned framework, the next step is to scrape the web for data, and then organize the contents accordingly in preparation for a model to be developed. There are several different libraries we can use for this process. Scrapy is an excellent scraping framework known as the \u201call in one\u201d package when it comes to web scraping. On the other hand, we have Selenium which is a library designed for browser automation allowing you to navigate in between pages. Finally, we have BeautifulSoup which is a more conservative and user-friendly data retriever. Given that BS4 is more straight forward and suits the majority of data scientists\u2019 needs quite well, I would recommend moving forward with that.", "I hope you found this article to be useful and informative about the use of search queries in Python 3.7.
