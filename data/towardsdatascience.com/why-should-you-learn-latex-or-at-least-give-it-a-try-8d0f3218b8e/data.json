This processor probably fulfills all your needs. I would say that 95% of users out there have no idea what is LaTeX. And this is perfectly fine. However, it is a pity. Because LaTeX is one of the most successful and amazing free software projects ever done. It has been around for more than thirty years with two Turing awarded researchers directly participating in its design and implementation. LaTeX must have something special. Hopefully, after reading this post you will consider giving it a try.", "I will not showcase how to use LaTeX because there is a lot of wonderful tutorials around. I will only enumerate when you MUST, SHOULD, and SHOULD NOT use LaTeX.", "Donald Knuth (Turing Award 1974) published his first edition of The Art of Computer Programming in 1968 when he was thirty. By then, books were printed using monotype settings. Knuth was happy with the final print. However, the second edition in 1976 had to be typeset again because the original fonts were no longer available. When Knuth received the galley proofs he was disappointed. He found them inferior.", "He committed himself to design his typesetting system. We are talking about the late seventies, when digital typesetting itself was a problem to be solved. Steve Jobs himself contributed to this topic. Knuth planned to spend his sabbatical year in 1978 to finish the project. He underestimated the complexity of the task. The final solution was not ready until 1989! Knuth called this language TeX with each letter a capital Greek letters tau \u03c4, epsilon \u03b5 and chi \u03c7. TeX is the abbreviation for \u03c4\u03ad\u03c7\u03bd\u03b7 (techne) which means \u201cart\u201d and \u201ccraft\u201d. Knuth has always insisted that you should pronounce it /t\u025bk/.", "When Leslie Lamport (Turing Award 2013) started using Knuth\u2019s TeX he started writing some macros for his own purposes. LaTeX is simply LAmport\u2019s TeX, a collection of macros on top of TeX to make it easier. And this is the main collection we have today.", "With LaTeX you can have a high quality typesetting (the best I would say) document with a low effort and no money. With no money because it is free. And with no effort. Yes with no effort. This claim is huge. EVERYBODY can get professional results writing plain text and using markups with a software that is free and can run virtually everywhere. That is why LaTeX is the standard in academia and engineering.", "This sounds fantastic\u2026 but as you can expect from the title of this article there are some drawbacks. The main one is the learning curve. LaTeX is not a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) solution and requires a learning period. Let me give you some guidelines about when you MUST, SHOULD and SHOULD NOT use it. Of course all this comes from my point of view and experience after using LaTeX for more than 15 years.", "can be impossible to write. Every decent solution around to manage math formulas is based on LaTeX. Why not use it directly?", "If you have read this far, thanks. I probably captured your interest. If so, you can start learning some basics here, and if you need some help check out the StackExchange.", "What about you? What is your experience using LaTeX?
