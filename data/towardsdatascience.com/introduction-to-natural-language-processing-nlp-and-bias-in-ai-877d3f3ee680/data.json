From voice assistants to Gmail\u2019s Smart Compose, deep learning has made it possible for machines to understand us in a more intuitive way.", "Of course, working with natural data is very different than working with tabular data, because we now need to represent words and sentences in a way that machines can understand.", "In this post, I will introduce key concepts of NLP such as word embeddings, and we will see how an algorithm can become biased, and how we can remove that bias.", "For hands-on video tutorials on machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, checkout my YouTube channel.", "Usually, when working with NLP applications, we access a dictionary of words, that contains thousands of different words. Now, we need to express each word in a way that a neural network can understand.", "Using one-hot encoding is a common way to represent a word in a dictionary. For example, if you have a dictionary of 10 000 words, and \u201cKing\u201d is the 4914th word, then its one-hot vector representation will be a 10000x1 vector filled with 0, but a 1 at position 4914.", "The weakness of this representation is that it treats each word as a unique element by itself. This means that it will not recognize that both apple and orange are fruits, or that king and queen are related words. Therefore, it does not allow the algorithm to easily generalize the meaning of the words.", "Assuming that you have basic knowledge of linear algebra, you realize that the dot product between any two vectors presented above will be 0! Therefore, there is no way for the algorithm to understand that certain words are related.", "Instead of one-hot vectors, it would be useful to have words being represented as a collection of features. For example, there could be a \u201cgender\u201d feature, \u201cfood\u201d feature, \u201cage\u201d feature, etc.", "This forms the basis of word embedding. This allows to build matrix that lays out the different words, with a corresponding score for each feature.", "This way, each word is now a vector where each value is a score for a certain feature.", "From the picture above, let\u2019s consider \u201cMonarch\u201d and \u201cKing\u201d. Their respective vector is [0.5, 0.5, 1] and [0, 0, 1]. Now, we know that these words are related, and the dot product between both vectors is no longer 0! Thus, the algorithm can now understand that \u201cMonarch\u201d and \u201cKing\u201d are related, just like \u201cMonarch\u201d and \u201cMan\u201d are not related.", "We can further simplify this representation using t-SNE, and reducing the dimension space to 2D.", "As you can see, similar words are grouped together, which show the advantage of using word embedding.", "Now, let\u2019s apply NLP to word analogy. Before moving on, you can find the full notebook if you wish you code along.", "Man is to woman as king is to _____ (queen)", "To do accomplish such task, the algorithm must have a way to understand that two words are similar.", "An easy way to do so is to apply cosine similarity. This measures the degree of similarity between two embedding vectors. Mathematically, cosine similarity is expressed as:", "From the equation above, if two vectors are very similar, the value will be close to 1. Otherwise, it will take on a smaller value. However, if the vectors are similar, but opposite, the value will then be closer to -1.", "Now, we can use it to compute the cosine similarity between different words:", "The cell above outputs the following:", "As you can see, father and mother are related words, whereas ball and crocodile are not. Likewise, Paris and Rome are similar, but opposite, so the cosine similarity gives a negative number close to -1.", "Great! Having cosine similarity working, how can it be applied for word analogy?", "As aforementioned, word analogy involves finding a word that is related to another, based on the relation of two other words. For example:", "Man is to woman as king is to queen", "Mathematically, this means that the difference between each pair of word vectors is approximately equal. Therefore, the cosine similarity of each difference should also be equal.", "Defining each word vector as e, the following equations describe the logic of word analogy:", "Now, we can run the code cell below, and we get:", "Awesome! It seems that the algorithm can effectively understand basic word analogy using only cosine similarity!", "Take some time to appreciate how simple, intuitive and efficient this method is to represent words and understand their meaning.", "We have an algorithm that can perform word analogy. However, it turns out that our word representation is biased.", "A way to see the gender vector, we can subtract the man vector from the woman vector:", "This is how gender is encoded. Now, let\u2019s further explore gender bias by outputting the cosine similarity between different names and the gender vector:", "As you can see, female first names have a positive cosine similarity, and male first names have a negative value.", "Now, let\u2019s run the same operation, but with other random words:", "As you can see, engineer and technology are closer to man, whereas receptionist and literature are close to woman.", "Clearly, our algorithm is biased, and we need to fix that.", "To do so, we need to identify the bias component, and remove it from the word vector. The bias component is simply the projection of word vector onto the bias vector:", "Then, we simply subtract it from the word vector to obtain an unbiased word representation:", "Representing the vectors in a 2D plane, this is what it would look like before and after removing bias:", "Coding the logic described above, we first define a function that will neutralize gender bias:", "And now, we can equalize word pairs:", "Let\u2019s see if we successfully removed bias:", "Amazing! We indeed removed any gender bias in our word representation!", "In this post, you learned how words are represented in natural language processing, you learned how to build a simple algorithm that can perform word analogy, and you saw how to remove gender bias in the algorithm.", "Bias in AI algorithm can sometimes be a big problem, and the community is becoming increasingly aware of it. Be careful when you develop an algorithm and make sure it is as neutral as possible.", "Your home for data science.
