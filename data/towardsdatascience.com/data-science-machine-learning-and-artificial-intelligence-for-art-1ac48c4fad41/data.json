Their adoption is almost certainly correlated with the rise in \u201cbig data\u201d over the last decade.", "Advanced data analytics has the potential to transform the way companies understand insights, organize activity, and create value. Progress with programming languages, open source libraries and cloud computing have also made it easier for these methods to be applied effectively to data.", "The Art market remains a sector where the data analytics revolution has yet to properly begin, until now.", "This blog post will explain how state-of-the-art data science, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) methods are being used in the art market by Thread Genius, a firm acquired by Sotheby\u2019s, the oldest international auction house in the world (Est. 1744). I\u2019ll give you some insight into our team dynamics, the problems we are solving and how we are doing it.", "That\u2019s a good question. Firstly, data science is a discipline where data is used and analyzed to test hypotheses, answer questions and understand insights.", "Machine Learning is when computational tools and statistical techniques are leveraged to give computers the ability to learn from, and with, data. Yufeng G from Google Cloud uses a more refined definition in his article: \u201cusing data to answer questions\u201d.", "Artificial Intelligence is when computational tools start to possess cognitive abilities \u2014 for the purposes of this post, AI will refer to \u201cdeep learning\u201d techniques that use artificial neural networks.", "Thread Genius is an artificial intelligence startup founded by Ahmad Qamar and Andrew Shum in 2015 and was acquired by Sotheby\u2019s in January 2018. Both founders used to work at Spotify prior to starting Thread Genius. The main use of its technology was a visual search engine that applied deep learning techniques using artificial neural networks for the fashion industry.", "By training artificial neural networks, Thread Genius was able to recognize clothing from images to find visually similar ones.
