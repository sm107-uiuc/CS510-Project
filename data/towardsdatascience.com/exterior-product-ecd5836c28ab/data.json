If you maintain a physics related codebase you need to make sure all the libraries that you\u2019re using and are using you, have adequate orientation conversion.", "Turns out Linear Algebra only became popular after Maxwell publicized his famous equations but there were others like Grassman and Clifford that were working with lesser known formalisms which make certain spatial operations much simpler.", "While studying the details of Geometric Algebra may seem esoteric right now, consider that for the foreseeable future we\u2019re going to be working with deep models and build robots so it\u2019s only natural that our mathematical tools evolve to better suit us.", "To get a taste of the kinds of things you can do with Geometric Algebra, we\u2019ll be looking at the exterior product.", "The exterior product is defined as a \u2227 b in some vector space V where a, b \u2208 V.", "It needs to fulfill 2 properties", "So far these 2 properties seem abstract but let\u2019s see an example where Antisymmetry and Bilinearity hold.

Instead we could think of an n dimensional vector as a single element of \u211d^n and perform our computations on this higher level structure.", "Any vector can be expressed in terms of the basis vectors .

This is a general theme in Geometric Algebra.", "In Linear Algebra we typically think of vectors as matrices as containers holding elements of \u211d, so an n dimensional vector holds n elements of \u211d. Instead we could think of an n dimensional vector as a single element of \u211d^n and perform our computations on this higher level structure.", "Geometric Algebra is a mathematical language to program geometry problems.", "It\u2019s extremely likely we\u2019ll be doing more geometry in the future because of how popular deep learning and robotics have become. Why settle on a popular formalism like Linear Algebra if it doesn\u2019t express geometric problems as naturally as Geometric Algebra.", "I only discussed a single operator, the wedge product \u2227 \u2014 there are still many more applications of it and a good way to get exposed to them is to check out the below references.", "I never thought I\u2019d end up researching something like Geometric Algebra but Adam Nemecek insisted numerous times that it would be worth my while and he was right. He maintains a fun and active Discord community of graphics researchers and mathematicians that discuss how to use Geometric Algebra more broadly.
