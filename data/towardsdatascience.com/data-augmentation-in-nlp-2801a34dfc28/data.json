However, it is very too luxury to annotate a large amount of training data. Therefore, proper data augmentation is useful to boost up your model performance. Augmentation is very popular in the computer vision area. Image can be augmented easily by flipping, adding salt, etc via image augmentation libraries such as imgaug. It is proved that augmentation is one of the anchors to the success of computer vision models.", "In the natural language processing (NLP) field, it is hard to augment text due to the high complexity of language. Not every word we can replace it with others such as a, an, the. Also, not every word has a synonym. Even changing a word, the context will be totally different. On the other hand, generating an augmented image in the computer vision area is relatively easier. Even introducing noise or cropping out a portion of the image, the model can still classify the image.", "Given that we do not have an unlimited resource to build training data by humans, authors tried different methods to achieve the same goals which are generating more data for model training. In this story, we explore different authors how they leverage augmentation to tickle NLP tasks via generating more text data to boost up the models. The following story will cover:", "Zhang et al. introduced synonyms Character-level Convolutional Networks for Text Classification. During the experiment, they found that one of the useful ways to do text augmentation is by replacing words or phrases with their synonyms. Leveraging existing thesaurus help to generate lots of data in a short time. Zhang et al. select a word and replace it with synonyms according to the geometric distribution.", "Wang and Yang introduced word similar calculation in That\u2019s So Annoying!!!: A Lexical and Frame-Semantic Embedding Based Data Augmentation Approach to Automatic Categorization of Annoying Behaviors using #petpeeve Tweets. In the paper, Wang and Yang proposed to use k-nearest-neighbor (KNN) and cosine similarity to find the similar word for replacement.", "Alternatively, we can leverage pre-trained classic word embeddings such as word2vec, GloVe, and fasttext to perform similarity searches.", "English is one of the languages which has lots of training data for translation while some languages may not have enough data to train a machine translation model. Sennrich et al. used the back-translation method to generate more training data to improve translation model performance.", "Given that we want to train a model for translating English (source language) \u2192 Cantonese (target language) and there is not enough training data for Cantonese. Back-translation is translating target language to source language and mixing both original source sentence and back-translated sentence to train a model. So the number of training data from the source language to target language can be increased.", "Rather than using static word embeddings, Fadaee et al. use contextualized word embeddings to replace target words. They use this text augmentation to validate the machine translation model in Data Augmentation for Low-Resource Neural Machine Translation .", "The proposed approach is TDA which stands for Translation Data Augmentation. The experiment showed that the machine translation model is improved by leveraging text augmentation.", "Kobayashi proposed to use a bi-directional language model in Contextual Augmentation: Data Augmentation by Words with Paradigmatic Relation. After selecting the target word, the model will predict possible replacement by giving surrounding words. As the target will exist in any position of the sentence, bi-directional architecture is used to learn both rightward and leftward context.", "Kobayashi verified the language model approach with CNN and RNN on six datasets and the result is positive. Text augmentation helps to further improve the NLP model result.", "Kafle et al. introduced a different approach which generates augmented data by generating it in Data Augmentation for Visual Question Answering. Different from the previous approach, Kafle et al. approaches do not replace a single or few words but generate the whole sentence.", "The first approach is using template augmentation which is using pre-defined questions that can use rule-based to generate an answer to pair with the template questions. The second approach leverages LSTM to generate a question by providing an image feature.", "The above approach is designed to solve problems that authors are facing in their problems. If you understand your data, you should tailor-made augmentation approach it. Remember that the golden rule in data science is garbage in garbage out.", "In general, you can try the thesaurus approach without a quite understanding of your data. It may not boost up a lot due to the aforementioned thesaurus approach limitation.", "I am Data Scientist in Bay Area.
