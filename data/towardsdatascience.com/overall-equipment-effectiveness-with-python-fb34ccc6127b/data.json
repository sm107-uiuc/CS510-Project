OEE is a key process indicator that measures effectiveness and deviations from effective machine performance. It is highly used in Total Production Maintenance (TPM) and Lean programs for locating the source(s) of inefficiencies and for quantifying the degree of inefficiency.", "OEE\u2019s goal is to reduce the six big equipment-based losses: equipment breakdown, setup and adjustment, minor stoppages, reduced speed, start-up scrap and product scrap. These losses are grouped into 3 categories:", "The OEE can be obtained through the multiplication of its three components:", "Measuring the OEE and the underlying losses allow companies and organizations gain significant insights on how to systematically improve a manufacturing process, and thus, to eliminate waste.", "As a benchmark, the OEE can be used to compare the performance of a given manufacturing process to industry standards, to similar (or identical) manufacturing processes, or to results for different shifts working on the same manufacturing process.", "As a baseline, the OEE can be used to monitor and track the improvement and waste reductions of a given manufacturing process.", "What is considered as a \u201cgood\u201d OEE?", "For the following example, let\u2019s obtain the OEE for a machine that had 100 hours of total available time but that ran for 85 hours due to some material shortages and unexpected maintenance, which had a maximum production rate of 10 units per hour but produced 700 units in the run, from which 50 units were defective. Let\u2019s take a look at the Python code!", "The OEE obtained for the machine analyzed in the previous example was 65%, which according to the OEE benchmarks explained previously, it can be considered as an OEE above typical ones (i.e. 60%) but still below a World Class OEE (i.e. 85%).", "The real challenge of any company or organization aiming to improve the OEE and reduce the wastes of a particular process is not to increase the OEE itself, but to sustain it over time.", "Think of the OEE as if it were the speed of a racing car. Even though some racing cars from the F1 could speed up to 220 mph (~354 km/h) or more, the motor at some point will fail (i.e. the driver would not be able to sustain the racing car at maximum speed for a long period of time). The same occurs with production machines and equipment: since an OEE of 100% is impossible to sustain most cases, an OEE of 85% or above is still considered as a World Class OEE.", "OEE represents a great tool for operations managers in production facilities to keep track of the performance of a given manufacturing process. It is a metric that must be constantly monitored to identify opportunity areas within its components to develop and execute action plans as necessary.", "Effective production planning and scheduling, as well as accurate preventive maintenance plans, could lead to an increase in the effective run time (B), which would improve the OEE availability component. Adequate training for operators could lead to an increase on the actual production (D) by reducing small stops, which would improve the OEE performance component. Finally, the use of lean and six sigma tools on process improvement projects could lead to a reduction of wastes and variability on the final outcomes (F), which would improve the OEE quality component.", "Python represents a simple yet effective tool for calculating a process\u2019 OEE with just a few lines of code. In the same way, it allows obtaining the OEE plot to graphically visualize its components and losses, and thus, the real added value percentage on the process.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
