Ask yourself if you can handle that amount of stress right now.", "Tip: Build a plan to manage additional stress that comes your way while you prepare for the exam. (ex. How might your schedule/workload change if you get sick.)", "Staying motivated is important. Remain focused on your goal \u2014 whether that is to learn new skills, create new projects, get a new job, or prove your aptitude\u2013 and work reminders of that goal into your study plan.", "The exam is difficult. Many of the questions will challenge your knowledge as well as your test-taking skills.", "Layout of what\u2019s on the exam.", "This sample example strongly resembles the exam structure and question style. I\u2019d recommend taking this practice exam prior to beginning studying \u2014 so you know how to intake the information.", "Studying for an example provides you the knowledge based on the material of the exam.

Then, $50 USD", "Note: I work well with deadlines \u2014 registering was my way of motivating myself.", "Review the exam guide so that you know what to study for.", "So that you can understand the exam style and know what to expect.", "Tip: Take the practice exam prior to beginning your studies.

After taking this course, I was able to deploy & scale applications with some level of comfort.", "Note: It\u2019s a massive course and will take you 2\u20133 weeks at 10 hours/week.", "See how well you know the content. What you should spend more time studying.", "Note: It\u2019s best to be well rounded since most questions on standardized exams are low level spanning a wide set of knowledge. Make sure your late stage studying focuses on your weak spots.", "Tip: Consider reviewing your study notes while you eat breakfast. (It\u2019s a great brain warm up.)", "Cramming has been proven to have negative effects on outcome. Do yourself a favor and relax the day prior to your exam.", "I signed a confidentiality agreement when taking the exam not to disclose any of the exam questions. That said, here are some of the areas you\u2019ll need to know well.", "Here are some test taking tips which will help you take the exam:", "If a question is befuddling you, skip it!

In a frenzy, they restore the wrong database and now the network is crashing. How do you ensure security configurations for the new database?", "Some answers are wrong (and can be eliminated) irrespective of the question. These false answers come in several forms:", "Don\u2019t spend too much time on a question. If something is taking more than you\u2019d like, mark it and get back to it later.", "Look away from the screen every few minutes to relax your eye muscles. It\u2019ll help you stay focused.", "Take 15\u201330 seconds every now and then to close your eyes and breathe slowly. The time-cost of such an effort will be well worth the calm and relaxation you\u2019ll achieve.", "Iterate on your exam by reviewing marked questions. If you\u2019re able to solve it, unmark the Q. If not, leave as marked and move on. Do this once \u2014 then review your answers (#9) \u2014 then do a second time.", "For each Q, first read the answer you selected, then the question, then the answer.
