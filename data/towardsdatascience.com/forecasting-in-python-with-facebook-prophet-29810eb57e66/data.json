The new and updated Second Edition is available for purchase on Amazon.", "The book covers every detail of using Prophet starting with installation through model evaluation and tuning. Over a dozen datasets have been made available and used to demonstrate Prophet functionality from the simple to the advanced with fully working code. If you enjoy this Medium post, please consider ordering it here: https://amzn.to/42xTkOb! At more than 250 pages, it covers far more material than can be taught on Medium!", "Thank you so much for supporting my book!", "Stuck behind the paywall? Click here to read the full story with a Friend Link!", "I\u2019m Greg Rafferty, a data scientist in the Bay Area. The code for this project is available on my GitHub.", "In this post, I\u2019ll explain how to forecast using Facebook\u2019s Prophet and demonstrate a few advanced techniques for handling trend inconsistencies by using domain knowledge. There are a lot of Prophet tutorials floating around the web, but none of them went into any depth about tuning a Prophet model, or about integrating analyst knowledge to help a model navigate the data. I intend to do both of those with this post.", "In a previous story about forecasting in Tableau, I used a modification of the ARIMA algorithm to forecast the number of passengers on commercial flights in the United States. The ARIMA approach works decently well with stationary data and when forecasting short time frames, but Facebook\u2019s engineers have built a tool for those cases which ARIMA can\u2019t handle. Prophet is built with its backend in STAN, a probabilistic coding language. This allows Prophet to have many of the advantages offered by Bayesian statistics, including seasonality, the inclusion of domain knowledge, and confidence intervals to add a data-driven estimate of risk.", "I\u2019m going to look at three sources of data to illustrate how to use, and some of the advantages of, Prophet. If you want to follow along, you\u2019ll first need to install Prophet; Facebook\u2019s documentation provides simple instructions. The notebook I used for this article provides the full code to build the models discussed.", "Let\u2019s start out with something simple. The same Air Passengers data from my previous article. Prophet requires time series data to have a minimum of two columns: ds which is the time stamp and y which is the values. After loading our data, we need to format it as such:", "With just a few lines, Prophet can make a forecast model every bit as sophisticated as the ARIMA model I built previously. Here, I\u2019m calling Prophet to make a 6-year forecast (frequency is monthly, periods are 12 months/year times 6 years):", "Prophet has included the original data as the black dots and the blue line is the forecast model. The light blue area is the confidence interval. Using the add_changepoints_to_plot function added the red lines; the vertical dashed lines are changepoints Prophet identified where the trend changed, and the solid red line is the trend with all seasonality removed. This plot format is what I\u2019ll be using throughout this article.", "With that simple case out of the way, let\u2019s move on to more complicated data.", "Divvy is a bike share service in Chicago. I did a project previously where I analysed their data and correlated it with weather information scraped from Weather Underground. I knew this data exhibited strong seasonality so thought it would be a great demonstration of Prophet\u2019s ability.", "The Divvy data is on a per-ride level so to format the data for Prophet, I aggregated to the daily level and created columns for the mode of the \u201cevents\u201d column per day (i.e., the weather conditions: 'not_clear', 'rain or snow', \u2018clear', \u2018cloudy', \u2018tstorms', \u2018unknown'), the count of rides, and the mean of temperature.", "Once formatted, let\u2019s look at the number of rides per day:", "So there\u2019s clearly a seasonality to the data, and the trend appears to be increasing with time. With this data set, I want to demonstrate how to add additional regressors, in this case the weather and temperature. Let\u2019s look at the temperature:", "It looks a lot like the previous chart, but without the increasing trend. And this similarity makes sense because bicycle riders are going to ride more often when the weather is sunny and warm, so both plots should rise and fall in tandem.", "In order to create a forecast with the addition of another regressor, it is necessary that the additional regressor have data for the forecasted period. For this reason, I\u2019m cutting the Divvy data short a year so I can predict that year with the weather information. You can see I\u2019m also adding Prophet\u2019s default holidays for the US:", "The above code block creates the trend plot as described before in the Air Passengers section:", "The components plot consists of 3 sections: the trend, the holidays, and the seasonality. The sum of those 3 components account for the entirety of the model in fact. The trend is simply what the data is showing if you subtract out all of the other components. The holidays plot shows the effect of all of the holidays included in the model. Holidays, as implemented in Prophet, can be thought of as unnatural events when the trend will deviate from the baseline but return once the event is over. Additional regressors, as we\u2019ll explore below, are like holidays in that they cause the trend to deviate from the baseline, except that the trend will stay changed after the event. In this case, the holidays all result in reduced ridership, which again makes sense if we realize that a lot of these riders are commuters to work. The weekly seasonality component shows that ridership is pretty constant throughout the week, but with a steep decline on the weekend. This is the evidence that supports the theory that most riders are commuters. The final thing I want to note is that the yearly seasonality plot is quite wavy. These plots are created with Fourier transforms, essentially stacked sine waves. Clearly, the default in this case has too many degrees of freedom. In order to smooth out the curve, I\u2019ll next create a Prophet model with the yearly seasonality turned off and an additional regressor added to account for it, but with fewer degrees of freedom. I\u2019m also going to go ahead and add in those weather regressors in this model as well:", "The trend plot looks very similar so I\u2019ll only share the components plot:", "The last year of the trend is upwards in this plot, not downwards as in the previous! This is explained because the last year of data showed lower average temperatures, which reduced ridership more than expected otherwise. We also see that the yearly curve is smoothed out and there\u2019s an additional plot: the extra_regressors_multiplicative plot. This shows the effect of the weather. What we\u2019re seeing is to be expected: ridership is increased in the summer and decreased in winter, and a lot of that variability is accounted for by the weather. I want to see one more thing, just for a demonstration. I ran that above model yet again but this time only included the regressor for rain or snow. Here\u2019s the components plot:", "This shows that when it\u2019s raining or snowing, there will be about 1400 fewer rides per day than otherwise. Pretty cool, right!?", "Lastly, I wanted to aggregate this dataset by hour to create one more component plot, the daily seasonality. Here\u2019s what that plot looks like:", "As Rives noted, 4am is the worst possible hour to be awake. Clearly, Chicago\u2019s bicycle riders agree. There\u2019s a local peak just after 8am though: the morning commuters; and a global peak around 6pm: the evening communters. I also see that there\u2019s a small peak just after midnight: I like to think that this is people heading home from the bars. That\u2019s it for Divvy data! Let\u2019s move on to Instagram.", "Facebook developed Prophet to analyze its own data. It only seems fair therefore to test out Prophet on a fitting data set. I scoured Instagram for a few accounts exhibiting interesting trends which I wanted to explore and then I scraped the service for all the data for three accounts: @natgeo, @kosh_dp, and @jamesrodriguez10.", "In 2017, I was working on a project where I noticed an anomaly in National Geographic\u2019s Instagram account. For the month of August in 2016, the number of likes per photo suddenly and inexplicably increased dramatically, but then returned to the baseline as soon as the month was over. I wanted to model this spike as due to a marketing campaign during the month to increase likes, and then see if I could predict the effect of a future marketing campaign.", "Here\u2019s what Natgeo\u2019s likes per post chart looks like. The trend is obviously increasing and there\u2019s also increased variance over time. There are a lot of outliers with dramatically high likes, but there\u2019s that spike in August 2016 where all photos posted during that month had likes which were much higher than the surrounding posts:", "I don\u2019t want to speculate why this could be, but for the sake of this model let\u2019s just pretend that Natgeo\u2019s marketing department performed some month-long campaign specifically aimed at increasing likes. First, let\u2019s build a model ignoring this fact so we have a baseline to which we can compare:", "Prophet seems to be confused with that spike. It\u2019s attempting to add it to the yearly seasonality component, as can be seen by the August spikes each year in the solid blue line. Prophet wants this to be a recurring event. In order to tell Prophet that something special occurred in 2016 which is not repeating in other years, let\u2019s create a holiday for this month:", "The promo dataframe contains just the August 2016 event, and the promos_hypothetical dataframe contains an additional promo which Natgeo is hypothetically considering for August 2020. When adding a holiday, Prophet allows for a lower window and an upper window, essentially days to include with the holiday event if you, for example, want to include Black Friday with Thanksgiving, or Christmas Eve with Christmas. I\u2019ve added 31 days after the \u201choliday\u201d, to include the whole month in the event. Here\u2019s the code and the new trend plot. Note that I\u2019m just sending holidays=promo when calling the Prophet object:", "Fantastic! Now Prophet is not adding that silly August bump annually but is indeed showing a nice spike in just 2016. So now let\u2019s run the model again, but using that promos_hypothetical dataframe, to estimate what would happen if Natgeo were to run an identical campaign in 2020:", "This demonstrates how to forecast behavior when adding in an unnatural event. Planned merchandise sales could be model this year, for instance. Now let\u2019s move on to the next account.", "Anastasia Kosh is a Russian photographer who posts whimsical self-portraits to her Instagram and makes music videos for YouTube. We were neighbors on the same street back when I lived in Moscow a few years ago; she had about 10,000 Instagram followers back then but in 2017 her YouTube account went viral in Russia and she has become something of a celebrity among tweens in Moscow. Her Instagram account has grown exponentially and is quickly approaching 1 million followers. This exponential growth seemed like a good challenge for Prophet.", "This is the data we\u2019re going to model:", "It\u2019s the classic hockey stick shape of optimistic growth, except that in this case it\u2019s real! Modelling it with linear growth, the same way we did the other data above, results in unrealistic forecasts:", "That curve will just keep going on to infinity. Obviously, there\u2019s an upper limit to how many likes a photo on Instagram can get. Theoretically, this would be equal to the number of unique accounts on the service. But realistically, not every account will see, nor like, the photo. This is where a little bit of domain knowledge from the analyst will come in handy. I decided to model this with logistic growth, which requires that Prophet be told a ceiling (Prophet calls it a cap) and a floor:", "Through my own knowledge of Instagram and a little bit of trial and error, I decided upon the ceiling of 200,000 likes, and a floor of 0 likes. It\u2019s important to note that Prophet does allow these values to be defined as functions of time, so they needn\u2019t be constant. In this case, constant values were exactly what I needed:", "I defined the growth to be logistic, turned off all seasonality (there didn\u2019t appear to be much of it in my plots), and adjusted a few of the tuning parameters. I also added the default holidays for Russia, as that is where the majority of Anastasia\u2019s followers are located. When calling the .fit method on the df, Prophet sees the cap and floor columns and knows to include them in the model. It\u2019s very important though that when you create your forecast dataframe, you add these columns to it (that\u2019s the future dataframe in the code block above). We\u2019ll walk through this again in the next section. But now our trend plot looks a lot more realistic!", "Finally, let\u2019s look at our last example.", "James Rodr\u00edguez is a Colombian soccer player who was a standout performer in both the 2014 and 2018 World Cups. His Instagram account has had steady growth since its inception; but while working on a previous analysis, I noticed that during the two World Cups his account saw sudden and lasting spikes in followers. In contrast to the spikes in National Geographic\u2019s account, which could be modeled as a holiday, Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s growth did not return to the baseline after the two tournaments but redefined a new baseline. This is fundamentally different behavior and will require a different modelling approach to capture it.", "This is what James Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s\u2019s likes per photo looks like throughout the account lifetime:", "This is going to be difficult to model cleanly with only the techniques we\u2019ve used so far in this tutorial. He experienced an increase in the trend baseline during the first World Cup in the summer of 2014, and then a spike, and potentially a changed baseline, during the second World Cup in the summer of 2018. Modelling this behavior with the default model doesn\u2019t quite work:", "It\u2019s not a terrible model; it just doesn\u2019t neatly model the behavior around those two World Cup tournaments. If, as we did with Anastasia Kosh\u2019s data above, we model those tournaments as holidays, we do see an improvement in the model:", "I still don\u2019t like how slow the model is to adapt to the changed trendline, especially around the 2014 World Cup. It\u2019s just too smooth of a transition. By adding additional regressors though, we can force Prophet to consider an abrupt change.", "In this case, I\u2019m defining two periods for each tournament, during and after. Modelling it this way assumes that before the tournament, there will be a certain trend line, during the tournament there will be a linear change to that trend line, and after the tournament, there will be yet another change. I define these periods as either 0 or 1, on or off, and let Prophet train itself on the data to learn the magnitudes:", "Note where I\u2019m updating the future dataframe to include these \u201choliday\u201d events below:", "Here, the blue line is what we should be looking at. The red line shows just the trend, with the influence of the additional regressors and holidays subtracted out. Look how the blue trend line takes sharp jumps during the World Cups. That\u2019s exactly the behavior our domain knowledge tells us would happen! After Rodr\u00edguez scored his first World Cup goal, suddenly thousands of new followers arrived on his account. Let\u2019s take a look at the component plot, just to see what specific effect of these additional regressors:", "This tells us that in 2013 and the beginning of 2014, the World Cup had no effect on Rodr\u00edguez\u2019s likes per photo. During the 2014 World Cup, there was a dramatic uptick in his average like per photo which continued after the tournament was over (this can be explained because he gained so many active followers during the event). There was a similar, but less dramatic, event during the 2018 World Cup, presumably because by this point there weren\u2019t as many soccer fans left to discover his account and follow him.", "Thanks for sticking around for this whole post! I hope you now understand how to use holidays, linear vs. logistic growth rates, and additional regressors to enrich your Prophet forecasts significantly. Facebook has built an incredibly valuable tool with Prophet, making what was once a very difficult exercise of probabilistic forecasting into a simple set of parameters with enormous latitude for tuning. Good luck with your forecasting!", "Your home for data science.
