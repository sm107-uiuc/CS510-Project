It\u2019s often said that data modeling is 90 percent data gathering/cleaning and 10 percent model building. So it\u2019s a huge headache to gather the right kind of data which would give fruitful insights.", "A few weeks before delivering my baby, I was having a chat with a friend on possible tech projects I can do while on maternity leave. After all, I was going to have a baby, and there was tons of data I can collect around her!! Some of the ideas we thought were:", "\u00b7 Taking snapshots of baby\u2019s fingerprints over a period of time and analyzing whether and how they change", "\u00b7 Collecting audio clippings of different baby cries and using a machine learning model to classify the meaning of different cries.", "Well, both the ideas flopped for me. I simply could not take the fingerprint pattern properly of my baby. And it was harder to record audio clippings every-time she cried.", "Another idea was to use a prediction model to find a pattern of her poop and pee. I started collecting the diaper data within a few weeks of birth. However, I realized that the poop and pee patterns were changing every week, depending on how much breastmilk and formula the baby was taking. It also was changing as she was growing older. When I asked the doctor about the inaccuracy, she exclaimed \u201cWell obviously, her poop cycles will change. There will be some days when she doesn\u2019t poop at all, and there is nothing to be surprised of\u201d. I realized that it\u2019s hard to do predictive analytics on poop frequency for a baby so small. There went my idea down the diaper pail!", "I realized that just my baby\u2019s data is not sufficient to make any predictions. Scouting the internet I came across a dataset with newborn baby weights. The dataset contained the features of the baby like the birth date, gender, time of birth etc together with datapoints regarding pregnancy like prenatals, medical conditions of birth mother like gestational diabetes, anemia etc, and history of the parents which include data points like race, number of children born, drinking and smoking habits. Overall the dataset [1] had 131422 data points which I felt were sufficient for a prediction model. The goal was to predict the birth weight of baby depending on the week of pregnancy. This is an important goal as a large size baby at delivery can be associated with an increased risk of injuries to the newborn and its mom [2]. So the better a doctor can predict birth weight, the easier the delivery may be.", "While ultrasound is the popular method used by doctor\u2019s to predict baby weight, they always tend to have a 10\u201315 % difference. I decided to employ machine learning to predict the birth weight using the available dataset.", "I imported the required libraries and loaded the datasets \u201cbaby-weights-dataset2.csv\u201d from the kaggle link.", "This step helps us understand the target variable birth weight \u2014 its mean, standard deviation, minimum and maximum values, median etc. We also plot a histogram of the birth weight variable to understand its nature. We also compute the skew and kurtosis of the target variable", "Next, we identify the categorical values from the training dataset and print the qualitative and quantitative columns. At this point, we process the missing values and set them as \u2018MISSING\u2019. We also take the qualitative variables HISPMOM and HISPDAD and encode it.", "Lastly, we use the Spearman\u2019s rank correlation to find correlations between variables and take the most correlated features in Correlated_Feature list and use it for further modeling. Some of the most correlated features were the completed weeks of gestation, amount of weight gained by mother, age of mother, race of parents and number of prenatal visits.", "Next, we split 80% of the data to the training set while 20% of the data to test set using below code. The test_size variable is where we actually specify the proportion of the test set.", "Here the \u201ctraining\u201d set is the data file used to create the machine learning model and the \u201ctest\u201d set is the one where we use our model to predict the target variables. ATrain and ATest splits the correlated features while BTrain and BTest splits the Birth weight variable.", "We then apply a normalization technique to our ATrain and ATest features dataset.", "After splitting the data into training and testing sets, finally, the time is to train our algorithm. For that, we need to set the seed and use theta to calculate the predicted value and improve the model. One can also use the scikit learn Linear Regression library for this step", "Lastly, let's use the model to predict the birth weight target variable for each of the testing dataset using the regression model we fitted in Step 4. I examined how well the model performed using error function:", "I took the Average RMSE and Standard Deviation to evaluate the linear model. The RMSE is the more popular metric and is typically used as the primary metric to interpret the model, along with standard deviation.", "The Average RMSE came around 1.07 which I felt is decently good for this dataset. Also, the standard deviation was around 2.64 which could be improved by trimming features further. Although there is still some good enough error, these birth weight predictions might help aid the doctor in estimating size of baby during delivery more accurately.", "I look forward to sharing the insights from this model as I return back to the office from my maternity leave.", "The code and datafiles for this model are added to this Github repository.
