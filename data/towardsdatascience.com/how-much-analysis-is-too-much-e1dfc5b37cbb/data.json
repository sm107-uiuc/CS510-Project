The more time and thought you give a problem, the better and more insightful your solution should be. And that\u2019s true to a degree.", "But there are two big caveats. First, the incremental value of more analysis can decline rapidly. While I wouldn\u2019t necessarily call this wasted effort, the bang for buck of your 30th hour of research is probably going to be a lot lower than that of your 3rd hour of research.", "Second, it\u2019s possible for people or even entire teams to become frozen in indecision as they gather more and more information. This is commonly known as analysis paralysis and can happen for several reasons:", "So how can we avoid being paralyzed by data? While this is by no means an exhaustive checklist, the following bullets have helped a lot whenever I attempt to ingest data, analyze it, and ultimately make a decision based on it.", "No matter how much analysis we do, there will always be something that we didn\u2019t check. And even if we could check everything, life is not chess \u2014 outcomes are random, not deterministic. So the only thing we can do is to become comfortable with randomness and uncertainty. That despite our best efforts, sometimes everything still rides on the flip of a coin.", "But it is our job as analysts and data scientists to make sure that we are primarily flipping unfair coins. That is, while there may be uncertainty, we want our opportunity\u2019s (or decision\u2019s) outcome distribution to be shifted in our favor (like a coin with a >50% chance of turning up heads). So our analyses should focus on identifying the set of opportunities where the odds are tilted in our favor (and on avoiding the ones with bad odds).", "I want to reiterate this key point \u2014", "Our job as analysts, data scientists, and strategists is not to eliminate risk and uncertainty (this is impossible); rather it is to identify and act upon asymmetric risk/reward opportunities (unfair coins).", "Prospect theory, a behavioral economics theory developed by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky, tells us that the average person feels the pain of a loss more than the pleasure of a gain. From their theory, Kahneman and Tversky were able to make several interesting observations about our mental biases:", "So one of the key takeaways from prospect theory is that people will work really hard to avoid mistakes because they:", "It\u2019s probably impossible to eliminate these biases, but knowing that they exist and affect us is a good first step. The next few items on our checklist help us reduce the negative impacts of these mental biases.", "Sometimes we find ourselves spinning our wheels and thinking, \u201cOh maybe I should look at this before I decide what to do. And there was that other thing I wanted to check out too. And I should see what my coworkers think. But they won\u2019t be back for 2 weeks, so I guess I will just hold off on my decision until then.\u201d", "That\u2019s not being thorough, that\u2019s procrastination. We all know when we\u2019re procrastinating, even if we do our best to rationalize that it\u2019s OK.", "What makes us procrastinate and dilly dally? Assuming that we\u2019re not lazy (I\u2019m not, I swear!), then we\u2019re probably putting off making a decision because we\u2019re scared of being wrong (because of all the reasons detailed in Item 2 above). So we need to be really honest with ourselves \u2014 if we find that fear of the unknown (and of being wrong) is driving our lack of action, then that\u2019s probably a decent signal that it\u2019s time to make our choice and move on.", "When we choose something, we should know why we chose it. More specifically, we should be able to identify the key assumptions that need to be true for us to be right. For example, we might think that a stock is cheap because the company owns a fast growing software business that has been overlooked by the rest of the market.", "So in this case, our key assumption is that the software business has been mis-valued by other investors, and that it will either grow much faster than everyone expects it to or earn much higher profit margins than expected (or both). In this case, the success of our stock investment primarily hinges on our prediction of the software business\u2019 future. So we should focus the bulk of our checking on the software business (and how we may have mis-analyzed it), and spend relatively less time on the other aspects of the business that we deem to be fairly valued by the market.", "When left to their own imagination, people routinely overestimate how bad things might get. That\u2019s why insurance companies can routinely turn a profit.", "So one way to combat this bias is by quantifying, as best we can, the probability and magnitude of the worst case scenario. If we can make a reasonable estimate of how bad things can get, then we can decide rationally how much we should worry about the worst case. We might find that the worst case is not quite so bad, and that we were worrying for nothing.", "And if we find that the magnitude or probability of loss is likely to be more than we can bear, then either we should not go forward at all or we should figure out a way to hedge some of the risk.", "I will caution you that estimating worst case scenarios is not easy. For example, worst case scenarios created with purely historical data should be viewed with skepticism \u2014 in 2007 and 2008, historical data told us that the housing market would never crash and then it promptly did so.", "It\u2019s my own personal belief that the value added of more and more analysis follows the Pareto principle, which states that 80% of the benefit is produced by 20% of the work:", "Of course that doesn\u2019t mean that we can just do 20% of the work and call it a day \u2014 the benefit is rarely if ever accrued linearly. But what it does mean is that we should be attempting to measure the amount of incremental value that each analysis adds.", "The key word here is incremental. No matter what we choose for our first analysis, it will probably add a lot of value because we know very little at the beginning. Then as we study up and build more models, they will on average produce less and less incremental value (with some lucky breaks). There\u2019s no right answer as to when we should stop analyzing and start making the decision \u2014 but it\u2019s important to realize that each additional analysis is progressively more expensive in terms of value produced per employee hour.", "Finally, it helps to keep the big picture in mind. Very few decisions are final (unless you are literally betting the firm). We do some analysis to inform our decision, make a choice based on our read of the data, learn from the result, and then start the process anew again.", "Great organizations aren\u2019t the genesis of a single make or break decision.", "Rather, they are the result of compounding one good decision after another, all the while weathering and learning from the inevitable bad choices and failures.", "I hope you found this enjoyable and insightful.
