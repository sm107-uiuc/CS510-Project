Add a page every time you struggle with a term or you have a issue. Your future you will thank you.", "I know there is still no clear answer to how you are supposed to get started at all, but we will change it soon.", "As you might know, development expertise is a must if you want to do machine learning. Python is always a good choice, there is a big community, plenty of tools and examples and wide support if you want to train your model in the cloud.", "Tip 2: Get comfortable with Python for creating Machine Learning Models with TensorFlow.", "So far you know how you can manage the learning process and which language you want to use. What\u2019s next? Exactly, data we need data and we need a lot of them.", "In almost any get started examples out there on the web you use one of the common MNIST datasets, either the fashion (made from researchers at Zalando Research) or the digit dataset. And if you train a model on one of them, you might reach pretty good results but you miss a lot of practice.", "Create your own dataset instead and you will learn how to collect, store and process large datasets.", "Tip 3: Learn how to work with your own data is an important skill which is required in real world applications. Start with a simple example, collect text with a corresponding label and save it in a csv. This is might be text from StackOverflow with the corresponding tags. Where you want to predict the programming language, based on a given text. There are so many possibilites choose one.", "Extract insights from your dataset help you to understand your data.

Or use Colaboratory if you prefer a cloud-based environment that is free to use and requires no setup.", "I want you to use AutoML before you start building custom machine learning models in TensorFlow. You might ask \u201cwhy AutoML or what is AutoML\u201d and that are good questions.", "With AutoML you can archive good machine learning results within hours instead of weeks or months.

Do you really need to train a machine learning model? Or can you use an already existing API with a pre-trained model to solve your issue? There are many ready-to-use APIs which can be used.", "Tip 4: AutoML or pre-trained APIs should be the first product of choice if you want to solve a problem.", "If Google AutoML or pre-trained APIs do not fit your needs you can still go with the custom machine learning model in TensorFlow or Keras.", "Unfortunately, you cannot simply use the data which you collected and start training a machine learning model. Preprocessing steps are required until the data is ready to use. The preprocessing depends on the data which you use. For text, you need a different preprocessing than for images.", "Tip 5: Data preprocessing is a necessary step and a complete chapter itself. Get familiar with data preprocessing before you continue and train your custom model with TensorFlow. And guess what.. you can use your insights which you got while digging in your dataset.", "We reached the point where we can train a custom model with TensorFlow. This is by far the most complex and time-consuming part, I am talking about a range between days to a month.", "The first step is to consume the data, this depends on the framework which you use. TensorFlow, TensorFlow Hub modules, or Keras. Don\u2019t worry too much about the different types you will learn on the way.", "After that, you have to choose an algorithm, this is the time to learn about the different types of algorithms, how and when to use them, what are the differences.", "The next step is to train our model, while the training on small datasets and simple models might perform well on your laptop, others require a large amount of processing power. For that, you can take advantage of training your models in the cloud.", "Tip 6: The first few steps with TensorFlow are the hardest, don\u2019t give up and continue. Building your own projects give you the most out of it. While you build your projects read the TensorFlow documentation and get familiar with the framework.", "One final and the most important step is still missing. The model evaluation, how well did your model solve the issue? Does the model also work with previous unseen data also called generalization? It is important to understand your results and classification accuracy is simply not enough to evaluate a model.", "Tip 7: Get familiar with different evaluation metrics on how and when to use them. Use different metrics like a confusion matrix, F1 score and so one.", "Depending on the issue which you want to solve it is not needed to archive 100% accuracy. Think about how your model might help to solve an issue either to save time, money or automate a process. And if you can solve a highly time consumable process with an accuracy of 80% you might already save a lot of money.", "Your model training is done and the results are looking good enough to solve the issue and what now? Now it is time to bring your model into production. Give the people the opportunity to use it. You can host models in different ways like TensorFlow ModelServer or Google AI Platform.", "Last Tip: Be consequent and create for all of your projects a GitHub repository. It is the best way to build your own portfolio. And even more, you will re-use a lot of code in other projects.", "And if your first year with ML might feel like this. Be aware at some point you have enough knowledge to build ML products with confidence.", "That\u2019s not all, I will share with you examples and further posts to give you some hands-on experience.
