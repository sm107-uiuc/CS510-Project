In this article we are going to talk about the algorithm that is the driving force behind mixed integer programmming, the branch and bound algorithm.", "First of all, let us define an optimization problem in general so that we are on the same page. An optimization problem can be summarized very simply in 1 line:", "In this equation we are effectively saying that we want to minimze the function f (which is also known as the cost function) by x which comes from the set X. The set X might be a set of all real numbers, might be a set of integers\u2026 Might be also a set containing vectors of real numbers and integers (which is mostly the case with mixed integer programming). The point to remember is that X is the feasible set. So we need only concern ourselves with the solutions that come from this set.", "The idea of the branch and bound algorithm is simple. It finds the bounds of the cost function f given certain subsets of X. How do we arrive at these subsets exactly? An example would be if certain members of our solution vector x are integers, and we know that these members are bounded between 0 and 2 for example. Then we would start with the first member and explore solutions with each of those values for that dimension of the vector. This kind of search procedure leads to a tree structure that would look as the following (imagining that the different integer solutions are enumerated between 1 and 5):", "The different subsets of the feasible sets are contained within the curly braces. Logically, we want to search this tree in the most efficient way possible, evaluating function f at each leaf node might be very expensive and might involve optimizing for the continuous variables of the problem. Fortunately, we can use some tricks to intelligently bound the costs of the parent nodes that prevents us from expanding them all the way to the leaf nodes, leading to more efficient search strategies.", "The branch and bound algorithm relies on the bounding principle from optimization, which is just a fancy term used to describe a very intuitive thing. Imagine subsets of the feasible set, S1 and S2. If the upper bound of the solutions from S1 is lower than the lower bound of the solutions in S2, then obviously it is not worth exploring the solutions in S2. This is the whole magic behind the branch and bound algorithm. From this point on, I will denote the upper bound with UB, lower bound with LB and global upper bound with GUB for brevity sake. Now it is time to get our hands dirty and go through a concrete example of the algorithm.", "The way that we employ the algorithm is the following. We have a certain stack of open nodes, let us call it OPEN. Open just means that they are not yet fully explored. We also keep track of the global upper bound GUB. At each step we take a node from the open set and expand it, we also evaluate it if it is a leaf node. If the node has children, we look at the LB and UB of the child nodes. If the LB of the child node is lower than the GUB, then we add it to the OPEN stack, if it is higher than the global UB then it is not worth exploring. Additionally, if the UB of the node if lower than the global UB then we update the global UB to the UB of the node.", "Let us give some upper and lower bounds to the picture above to illustrate the point:", "We start with an infinite GUB. In red we denote the costs of each node, additionally, for simplicity, we enumerate each node of the tree with a number (in black). So, what is going to happen when applying branch and bound? First, the OPEN stack is going to contain node 1, since it is the root node. We pop a node from the stack and expand it. We are now looking at nodes 2 and 3. We see that node 3 has a lower UB than the current GUB, we set GUB to 40 and add it to OPEN. Node 2 has still a lower LB than the GUB, so we add it to the OPEN stack. Again we pop a node from the stack and look at the children, now we are looking at the children of node 2 and we see that node 4 is a leaf node, with the cost 10. We can now update the GUB to 10 and look further. Node 5 is too expensive so it is not noted. We again pop a node from the stack (node 3), but we see that node 3\u2019s LB is higher than the current GUB (10), therefore we don\u2019t do anything.", "At this point, the algorithm is finished and we managed to prune all the solutions that would be resulting from node 3. Naturally, in practice the branch and bound algorithms with thousands of nodes, this example was here to illustrate its mechanics. The magic lies in efficiently deriving lower and upper bounds of solutions sets, which is a whole area of research by itself.", "One more useful fact about the branch and bound algorithm is that it incrementally gives better solutions with tighter bounds. This means that the algorithm, when it is terminated early gives also meaningful solutions sometimes. This is often used in optimization to bootstrap some other methods with meaningful starting points. Key takeaway from this article:", "If the lower bound is greater than the global upper bound, it doesn\u2019t pay off to look for solutions there!", "I hope that I was able to shed some light on the mechanics of branch and bound. Keep on optimizing!", "Your home for data science.
