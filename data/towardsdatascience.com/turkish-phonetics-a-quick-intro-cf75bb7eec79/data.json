In this article, I will share the tips I found out during developing a Turkish speech recognition system. Being an infinite corpus source here \ud83d\ude04, I generated examples with my own voice. For making some phonetic events easier to understand, I contrasted Turkish pronunciations with English counterparts.", "Turkish is almost a phonetic language, most of the words are pronounced as written. The alphabet consists of 29 letters, 8 vowels and 21 consonants: a b c \u00e7 d e f g \u011f h \u0131 i j k l m n o \u00f6 p r s \u015f t u \u00fc v y z . Developing a Turkish g2p is relatively easy, one can go for a rule-based system. Vowels are easy, consonants are easy. Word level stress pattern is rule-based and also not very complicated. Turkish phonetic system is quite deterministic indeed.", "I use Turkish SAMPA phoneset for my Kaldi experiments, you can use it from here. The corresponding phonetic lexicon is here. All of the tricks below are used during the generation of this lexicon \ud83d\ude09.", "Our orthography has 8 vowels, no diphthongs, no consonant clusters and nothing fancy indeed. Vowels are categorized to backness/frontness, roundedness and being high/low.", "Turkish syllable pattern is easy, there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between vowels and syllables, one vowel = one syllable . As a result Turkish syllabification algorithm is rather an easy one.", "That\u2019s it about the vowels, really. In the next two sections I will describe two points about vowels that you should keep your eyes/ears open for a good g2p.", "Turkish has many Arabic/Persian loan words. Before the Script Revolution, Turkish language was indeed a mix of Persian, Arabic and Turkish words. Today, modern Turkish consist of mostly Turkish words but still with a decent influence of Arabic and Persian. Problem with these words is, usually there are Turkish counterparts written the same but vowel is indeed different. Compare   k\u00e2r (profit) vs kar(snow) h\u00e2la (still) vs hala(aunt) K\u00e2s\u0131m (proper noun, a male name) vs Kas\u0131m(November)   \u201cRoof mark\u201d , ^ is excluded from the written language in 90s. Hence, these words become indistinguishable in the orthography and create trouble for SMT, ASR and many other statistical systems.   Let\u2019s hear the words and compare the vowel lengths:", "Compare it to the k\u00e2r, with a long a below: 1. See the difference in vowel length from the raw signal  2. See the similarity of formants of both as in the spectograms  3. Also hear and see the difference of ks. Here, ks are different indeed. k has two allophones, /c/ and /k/ ; palatalized and non-palatalized allophones. Long vowels has the effect of palatalizing the consonants in the same syllable as well. Here, k in k\u00e2r is indeed /c/, where k of kar is /k/. See the different signatures of /k/ and /c/ from the spectograms. Turkish SAMPA distinguishes /c/ and /k/, obviously they are different phonemes, as seen from the spectogram signatures:", "Summary: Though written same, kar and k\u00e2r acoustically very different, as seen from the spectograms.", "How to deal: As I said before, this case occurs if an old loan word has a native Turkish twin. Number of such words are limited, while doing a Turkish g2p, one usually takes help from a dictionary of such words. Most probably you would like to include both pronunciations in your phonetic lexicon like this:", "Speaking from loan words, vowel epenthesis happens often in Western loan words. As I mentioned in the vowel section introduction, Turkish has no onset clusters; every syllable has one vowel and every vowel is one syllable; there is a 1-to-1 correspondence of vowels-syllables. Hence no wonder we insert one vowel first syllable to split the underlying onset cluster. See the extra vowels in pronunciations:", "Assaf, a colleague and friend of mine, a senior linguist noticed this phonetic event with his educated ears. He said I insert an extra vowel, and I told him it\u2019s very common among native Turkish speakers.  Let\u2019s hear Br\u00fcksel from my mouth. Notice the two distinct same vowels in the spectogram:", "Ben is a colleague, a talented coder and an English native speaker from USA. Hence, his vocal tract definitely knows how to produce consonant clusters that I cannot produce. Listen to Brussels from him, see the onset cluster from the spectogram:", "Summary: Vowel epenthesis happen with Western loan words.", "How to deal: These words are easy to distinguish, if a word starts with two consonants; then it belongs to this class. Find the first orthographic vowel, then insert a suitable phonetic vowel to the transcription. Epenthesis vowel should be a high vowel ([iiu\u00fc]).", "We cannot produce diphthongs either, that\u2019s right \ud83d\ude04. I tried to pronounce low and failed while Ben succeeded \ud83d\ude04Let\u2019s see it on action:", "Unlike English, for Turkish backness and roundedness of vowels are uncorrelated. We have both front rounded (\u00f6, \u00fc) and back rounded vowels (o, u). If we look at the formants of the spectogram, we notice low F2 pointing to backness. Relatively high F1 goes to being low and F3 together with gap between F1 and F2 hints roundedness ... this vowel is /o/. So, I pronounced a monophthong unfortunately. Also notice, there is only one rise in speech signal and duration is rather long. Ben comes to rescue again:", "Notice the transition from one vowel to another in the spectogram. However, there is ONLY ONE rise in the speech signal; technically there is one syllable; but two vowels in spectogram. Being an US American, Ben\u2019s vocal tract accomplishes the glide perfectly, while all I was able to produce was \u201cLovvvvvvvv\u201d unfortunately \ud83d\ude04", "Soft G is a controversial sound. In Turkish orthography, it is marked as a consonant while it is indeed not a real sound. In some cases it lengthens the previous vowel, in some cases it vanishes completely. Here are some observations:", "Let\u2019s see Soft G on the action. You will hear the word da\u011f (mountain), here Soft G is in syllable-final position, hence he is expected to lengthen syllable vowel a. See the duration of the vowel in speech signal and compare it to another one-syllable word kar, very first word of this notebook:", "Turkish stress pattern is highly morphology dependent. Majority of the native words carry stress in their last syllable, suffixes usually shifts the stress \u201ctowards\u201d the end of the word. Word-final stress is more or less standard for most words, exceptions occur with old Arabic/Persian loan words.   Let\u2019s see one example. koyun can be interpreted both as", "Imperative suffix carries stress to previous syllable, hence", "From my experiments with Kaldi, I noticed that neural network learns the Turkish stress pattern anyway, no need to feed stress positions. Indeed, it is better not to mark the stress position at all and let neural network learn. If you accidentally make a wrong marking, you might make WER worse (I did \ud83d\ude02).", "After exploring the articulation, let\u2019s play with some continuous speech data to explore the Turkish acoustic model. I used Mozilla Common Voice Turkish speech corpus below. The dataset contains 13725 utterances, total 14 hours of speech.", "Just as in any speech task, first I extracted the acoustic feature vectors, I like to use mfcc with 40 features . Here is the code:", "Then I projected the extracted mfcc vectors into 2 and 3 dimensional spaces respectively with t-SNE . I used t-SNE function from sklearn :", "mfcc alone is just a featurization method, it does not include any contextual/sequential information. It does not provide any information about which phones occur together with which density, which phones are similar, which phones occur together in similar phonetic contexts \u2026 as I said no sequential information. Language and speech are about context, i.e. sequential by nature. Hence I decided to do a more contextual featurization, I made an autoencoder on top of the extracted mfccs. It\u2019s really a basic seq2seq, nothing fancy:", "I used two LSTMs, one for the encoder and one for the decoder. RepeatVector layer is for making a many-to-many architecture. Resulting architecture looks like:", "OK, now comes the fancy part: I extracted output of the encoder LSTM and projected it onto 3-dimensional space via t-SNE :", "This is how Turkish speech looks like after the encoding, the result is just beautiful. No wonder it is this way, Turkish itself is beautiful.", "Dear readers, we reached the end of this article. It is important to appreciate beauty, it is more important to appreciate beauty together \ud83d\ude04 For more from me, please stay tuned either with my Medium blog or reach out to me anytime you like via my Linkedin page.
