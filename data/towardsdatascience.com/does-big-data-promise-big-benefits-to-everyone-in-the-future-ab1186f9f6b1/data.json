Big data, machine learning, and automation are now casually helping businesses make efficient and more intelligent decisions daily.", "Big data is now making a significant impact on the global economy. The global market for big data is expected to rise to nearly $67 billion by 2021. According to Andreessen Horowitz, 90% of all the data in the world was generated in the last two decades. Today, 2.5 quintillion bytes of data is created every day and the pace is set to accelerate in the coming years.
