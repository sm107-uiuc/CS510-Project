With the rise of the XGBoost library, Decision Trees have been some of the Machine Learning models to deliver the best results at competitions.", "This kind of model consist in many different variants; Random Forest, Exremely Randomized Trees, Adaptive Boosting, Gradient Boosting and many more. However, in this article, we will just explore the basics of the very standard Decision Tree.", "Let\u2019s just start with the very basic idea behind Decision Trees, which is to split our data to get the best possible grouping of data based on some features. So what does that really mean? Let\u2019s consider the following dataset:", "This is data from the classic Titanic dataset that you can use to predict whether the person survived or not based on features such as class, age, fare, and a few others. For the small sample of data that we have, we can see that 60% (3/5) of the passengers survived and 40% (2/5) did not survive. What we basically want to do, is to see if we can split this data on any of the features, such that we can better predict the outcome. Let\u2019s have a look.", "Okay, so it looks like, by just knowing the Pclass of the passengers, we can make a split whether they are 1st class or 3rd class, and now make a prediction where we get just one error (on the right-hand side we predict one passenger to not survive, but that passenger did in fact survive). This means we now have an accuracy rate of 80% by just making one split (better than the 60% we would get by just guessing that all survived). This is obviously quite a simplistic explanation, however, this is really the main idea of Decision Trees: to split groups into more \u2018pure\u2019 sub-groups (i.e. such that they contain a majority of just one group). You might however be thinking: how do we decide which feature to split on? How do we decide where to split on that feature? How do we decide how many times to split? And probably many other questions. Let\u2019s try to dig a bit more into the details.", "We can indeed split observations based on features as we just saw above, but how do we really decide if a split makes two groups of data that are more \u2018pure\u2019 than the initial data. To understand how to measure this, we have to understand the gini impurity. The gini impurity is mathematically described as:", "However, if you, as me, don\u2019t really like mathematical notation, what it all really means is just that you take the square of the number of observations in each group divided by the total observations. In this case, we have two groups (survived and not survived), so we just do it two times and subtract it all from one. This example calculates the gini of the inital node of the decision tree:", "So how does this gini impurity actually work, and why do we use it? First of all, it's important to know that this is not the only measure, but it's used quite widely. The gini impurity has the nice feature that it approaches 0 as a split becomes very unequal (e.g. contains only \u2018Survived\u2019 observations) and it is at 0.50 when both groups contain exactly the same number of \u2018Survived\u2019 and \u2018Not survived\u2019 observations. So the idea is that we want to decrease gini impurity for both nodes at the new split. Try to go back to the representation of a basic decision tree above and see that the gini is actually lower for both of the new nodes (try to see if you can calculate the gini for both nodes yourself). Notice also that the gini impurity is 0.00 for the left split, as we have just one class (Survived) on this side, and we can thus not make that side more \u2018pure\u2019. For the left side, it only became slightly more pure from 0.48 to 0.44.", "Now that we know what classifies a split as good or not, let\u2019s dig into how the algorithm for splitting the tree actually works. Not surprisingly, the algorithm actually works just how we could expect, i.e. to go through each possible split of every single feature in the data, calculate what the gini impurity would be in each case, and then split based on the very lowest weighted gini impurity that was found. These steps are then repeated based on each group of data to which the data has been split and is stopped when there are no more splits that can decrease the gini impurity. This algorithm is called CART, and is the one that sklearn has implemented,", "It is actually fairly simple but makes it quite difficult to do manually, as the number of potential splits is so big that it would take too much time to do manually. If we go back to the shortened dataset from before, this practically means that we would have to simulate a split on Pclass (this one is easy though, as there is only one potential split), thereafter simulate a split on Age (which has a total of 3 potential splits as 35 years occurs twice), lastly we have to simulate splits for Fare (which then has 4 different potential splits as all values are unique \u2014 remember, we don\u2019t have 5 splits as we need to put at least 1 observation in each of the groups).", "For each of these split that we simulate, we obviously have to calculate the gini impurity on both sides. Important to note is that we evaluate the post split based on the weighted average of the two gini impurities. Imagine that we had 500 observations instead, it would be very likely that we could make a split in some way that would but 1 observation in one group and 499 observations in the other group. In the group with just one observation, we would have a gini impurity of 0.00 (remember, this is what we have when everything is correctly classified), and on the other side, depending of the distribution of the data, we would likely have a gini impurity close to 0.50. If we just take the normal average, we would have an average gini impurity of 0.25, while a weighted average would be (0.00 * 1 + 0.50 * 499) / 500 = 0.499. For me at least, it seems much more reasonable that we take a weighted average, rather than giving equal weight to a split where we just leave one observation out.", "We can actually put the simulation of all the splits into a table, as the amount of data is not that big. We see that the two best split would be Pclass < 3 and Fare < 53.1 \u2014 this is indeed what we saw on the image above.", "One thing worth to note about decision trees is that, even though we make a split that is optimal, we do not necessarily know if this will lead to splits that are optimal in the following nodes. So when we decide to split on the Pclass, which is the most optimal split locally, we do not know if this split leads to the most optimal splits further down the tree. For this reason, the decision tree algorithm is often mentioned as a \u2018greedy\u2019 algorithm, as we do not calculate the global optimal splits. If we would have to do so, the algorithm would be much slower (potentially even impossible to execute for fairly large datasets).", "The CART algorithm can actually be implemented fairly easy in Python, which I have provided below in a GitHub Gist. The code is not optimised in any way and just made to work with the Titanic dataset. You can try to make some tweaks to se if you can make it work on other datasets. Moreover, it just only calculates the optimal first split. I\u2019ve deliberately decided to do so, as more functions of the code just makes it much larger, and I just wanted to convey how a single split is made, as it is really the same process of making the next split.", "Let\u2019s try to go back to the very first picture of a decision tree trained with the sklearn DecisionTreeClassifier, which I did not mention anything about.", "We see that the weighted gini impurity of this decision tree is exactly 0.33454, which we can calculate in the following way:", "I hope that this article has been helpful for you to understand decision trees better in-depth and understand how the algorithm works. Feel free to leave your comments or questions. I\u2019m also currently working on a post on random forest, which I will link here as soon as it\u2019s ready.", "MSc Business Analytics | ESADE Business School | Passionate about all kind of AI and
