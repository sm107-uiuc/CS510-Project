The relevant part of our earlier DAG is:", "Race is said to influence the propensity to use the app. Hence, the statistical model of this relationship is often called a propensity model in the causal inference literature. That is, it models how the would-be intervention is statistically related to its inputs.", "The true model for app usage as a function of race is the logistic model listed in the Appendix of Part 1. The propensity to use the app is measured as the probability of using the app. In the context of this causal model, this probability is therefore called a propensity score (Rosenbaum and Rubin, 1983).", "In reality, we wouldn\u2019t know this true model. But suppose we\u2019d correctly modeled it and estimated its parameters as follows:", "The propensity to use our app is like a selection process: here, \u201cbeing selected\u201d to use the app depended on race.", "In survey sampling, such selection probabilities are used in probability sampling to ensure that survey participants are representative of the target population from which they are sampled. These probabilities are specified in the survey design \u2014 and hence, fully known in advance.", "These selection probabilities can then be used to weight the survey respondents\u2019 outcomes by the reciprocal or inverse of their corresponding selection probabilities. This general technique, called inverse probability weighting, provides a statistically consistent estimate of the mean outcome (i.e., the average outcome taken over the entire target population). In survey sampling, the resuling estimator of the population mean is called a Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator (Horvitz and Thompson, 1952).", "Intuitively, each respondent is weighted in order to represent individuals who are similar in the factors that determine their selection probability. To see how, let\u2019s revisit our earlier example of height and gender:", "Suppose these eight individuals were part of a small probability sample (n = 514) taken from a much larger target population (n = 10000). The code to generate the target population and sample is:", "In the target population (with numbers derived from ourworldindata.org/human-height):", "Women were selected into our sample with probability 0.01, and men with probability 0.09. That is, men were nine times more likely to be selected into the sample than women; 90% of our sample are men (n = 464). Hence, the sample overall average height of 5.555 is higher than the true population mean height of 5.406.", "However, if we weight each individual by the inverse of their respective selection probability, sum these values, and divide by the total population size, we get the weighted average:", "This is closer to the true population mean height of 5.406.", "We can apply such an HT estimator to estimate the ATE. In our case, there are two types of \u201ctarget populations\u201d just within our RWE data:", "Each potential outcome (Neyman, 1923; Rubin, 1974; Holland, 1986) is observed according to an individual\u2019s actual app usage. The other unobserved potential outcome is called a counterfactual outcome, or simply counterfactual.", "We weight each individual by the inverse of their respective propensity score, sum these values, and divide by the total number of individuals in our dataset to get the weighted averages per app usage group:", "We calculate the estimated RD as -0.022. Compare this to our RCT estimated RD of -0.034. Both estimates are much closer to the true ATE of -0.031 than our original RWE estimated RD of -0.169.", "We\u2019ve successfully applied two causal inference methods to estimate the true ATE of app usage on infection risk. These methods are statistically consistent for the ATE, but they rely on some key assumptions being true:", "You can learn more about these and other important assumptions in Hern\u00e1n and Robins (2006) and Hern\u00e1n and Robins (2020), and at Adam Kelleher\u2019s Medium page.", "What\u2019s stopping us from treating as many variables as possible as potential confounders (perhaps after cross-validated model and variable selection)? Why shouldn\u2019t we include them all in the statistical model? One interesting caution against this is the prospect of \u201cM-bias\u201d (Ding and Miratrix, 2015). This is a special type of collider bias (Pearl, 2009) arising from including a model input that is not a confounder. The argument is that including such non-confounders can bias the ATE estimate, due to the induced collider bias.", "We\u2019ve decided on an RWE explanatory model. But which statistical model should we fit? The outcome model, or the propensity model? Our choice will depend, in part, on how confident we are in fitting either model. And this choice will determine whether we use the g-formula or propensity score weighting.", "What if there is only equivocal evidence in favor of one over the other? Perhaps we\u2019re otherwise agnostic to which model to fit. In such cases, there are what are called \u201cdoubly robust\u201d estimators that make use of both models (Bang and Robins, 2005). They are called as much because only one of the models needs to be correctly specified in order for the estimator to yield statistically consistent estimates of the ATE.", "There are at least three other popular methods for enabling ATE estimation and inference using RWE data.", "Suppose we mistake [the real-world evidence] empirical RD as an estimate of the ATE. Unbeknownst to us, in our simulated world we would overstate our telemedicine app\u2019s effectiveness by claiming it reduces the risk of new coronavirus infections by 16.9%-when in fact it will only reduce this risk by 3.1%.", "But we can re-weight our real-world evidence results to provide more accurate risk-reduction estimates of either 2.3% or 2.2%.", "We conclude Part 2 with the following high-level action plan:", "The more general (abstract) expression of the statement from our earlier height-by-gender example is", "where E(.) is the expectation operator. Note that the variables are now all upper-case, indicating that they are random variables (e.g., due to random sampling) \u2014 unlike the lower-case fixed variables in our height-by-gender example.", "The expectation operator takes the expectation (i.e., expected value or mean) of the random variable inside the parentheses like so:", "Loosely speaking, the expectation operator calculates a weighted average \u2014 with probabilities as the weights.", "The expression E(Y|Z) denotes a conditional expectation, where the expectation of Y is taken over all Y at a given value Z. The general expression above can be compactly stated as", "where E_Z(.) specifies taking the expectation of the expression inside the parentheses over all values of Z.", "The Law of Total Expectation states:", "That is, the expected value of a random variable Y is equal to expectation of the expected value of Y conditional on a different random variable Z, taken over all values of Z.", "Dr. Daza is a biostatistician and health data scientist \u2014 not an epidemiologist \u2014 who develops causal inference methods for personalized (n-of-1) digital health. | \ud83c\uddf5\ud83c\udded\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 ericjdaza.com @ericjdaza linkedin.com/in/ericjdaza | statsof1.org @statsof1 @fsbiostats", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
