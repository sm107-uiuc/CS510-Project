This is the third part of the new Django series I have started writing on, which is Building a Job Search Portal with Django. I hope every one of you has already read the first and second parts of the tutorial series.", "If you have not yet read the first two parts of this series, I would strongly recommend reading the first two parts first and then coming back to this one. Here I am linking the first part and the second part:-", "So, in this part of the series, we will discuss the backend part of the Candidates app, which consists of the forms, models, views and URLs of this section.", "Also, in the URLs section, we will talk about the main urls.py file, which should have been discussed in Part 2, but I forgot to mention it, so will do it here together with the urls.py file of the candidates part.", "In the candidates part, we will mostly discuss all the things relevant to the job seekers (candidates), which will consist of the job search, job application and saving of jobs. It also shows the current status of your application, whether its accepted, pending or rejected. Also, there is an intelligence search feature built-in which shows you the jobs which are the best fit for you based on your skills and job requirements.", "So, let\u2019s understand how each segment works one by one:-", "So, we are starting with the models.py file. This file contains all the parameters every object will have in our Django app relevant to candidates. This tells the database what features would be there in each model class.", "To learn more about models in Django and how they work, Django's official documentation is a great place.", "So, we have four classes in our models' file. We first define a CHOICES variable which consists of four choices which we would be using in the Profile class.", "So, let\u2019s deal with all four classes one by one:-", "Now let\u2019s have a look at the source code of the models.py file:", "So, that wraps up the models part of the Candidates App. These models will be used to store all data relevant to the candidates.", "The forms part will consist of two forms which we will be using in for the candidates part of the website \u2014 ProfileUpdateForm and NewSkillForm. Let\u2019s go through them one by one:-", "Below is the source code for the forms.py file:-", "Now we will deal with the views.py file, which contains all the views related to the candidates part of our app.", "It is the longest part of the backend section of the Candidates app since many things are working in this part, and almost all the app's logic is being written here. So, we will try to break these into small parts, taking a single function at a time and discussing it.", "First up, we need to import various things, all of which have separate functions. We will discuss them when they are being used.", "This is the simplest function, which is just there to serve the homepage. We have little going into it.", "This is used to search for jobs by candidates. It takes in the job query and the job location the candidate is looking for.", "We then build a list which consists of the jobs which the candidate will see when he clicks on the search button.", "If the user does not give any input, we display all the jobs. Otherwise, we match the query to job type, title, skill and company names and combine all results we get in a single list.", "We then do the same for location data. If it is provided, we filter out jobs from that location; otherwise, we take in all the jobs.", "Next, we will take the union of the query and location lists to make the final list. We also apply a paginator to restrict each page of the search result in 20 job posts.", "We then pass all this data to the template, which would then display the job search results.", "This is the function which will display the job post in detail. It has two variables \u2014 apply_button (checks whether the user has applied for the job or not) and save_button (checks whether the user has saved the job or not), which stores the data related to the job the candidate is looking at.", "We then make a list which consists of the jobs which are similar to this one to recommend to the user. This is produced by considering the job type, title and company of the job the user is looking at.", "This is a very simple view function which takes the saved jobs by the user and orders them in order of the date posted. It then renders it using a template.", "To access this function\u2019s rendered template, the user must have logged in, which is checked by the login_required decorator.", "This function displays all the jobs the user has applied to. It also requires the user to have logged in to access this page.", "It also has a status list, which contains the status of all the applications of the user, whether they have been selected, rejected or pending.", "This function is used to show jobs to a candidate which suit the skill set of the user and matches the job type the user is looking for.", "This filters out jobs first based on what the candidate is looking for and then processes all these jobs and gets the skills they require. We also get the skills a candidate possesses in a list. We then keep matching these two lists, and if we get more than half of the skills required by the job post matched by the candidate\u2019s skills, then we recommend that job post on that page.", "Also, we order these job posts by the skill match ratio. The higher the skill match percentage, the higher the position it will occupy in our list. We then zip the job list, skills of candidates and common skills count and pass it on to the template. These will help us to write the number of skills matched in the job description on that page.", "This function holds all the data for the candidate profile. It displays the user profile and also the skills possessed by the user. It also has the ability to add new skills by using NewSkillForm. This also requires a user to have logged in first.", "This function allows candidates to edit their profiles. It makes use of the ProfileUpdateForm to do so. This also requires a user to have logged in first. It allows only the owner of the profile to edit it.", "This view function is similar to the my_profile function but with a small difference. Unlike the my_profile, which was for viewing your own profile, profile_view is for recruiters to view your profile. So, we do not allow skills editing in this view. It also requires the user to have logged in.", "This view function is used to delete the skills of the user. It allows the user to select the skills they want to delete by checkboxes and then click on the delete button.", "Obviously, the user needs to be logged in to perform this step. We also use a csrf_exempt in this function. To know more about csrf, view this official documentation.", "This is used to save any job which the candidate likes and wants to store for further viewing. It adds the job to the SavedJobs model class. The user needs to be logged in to do so.", "This is used to apply to any job which the candidate likes. It adds the job in the AppliedJobs model class. The user needs to be logged in to do so. It also adds this to the Applicants model class of the Recruiter App.", "This is used to delete a job from the saved jobs list. It requires the user to have logged in.", "So, that sums up the views.py file of the Candidates App. Here\u2019s a look at the complete code:-", "This file stores all the URLs of the Candidates App. This helps us to get URLs for all our view functions. It allows users to navigate our website through these URLs. We give each URL path a name to remember it and use it within templates for linking.", "This is the urls.py file we are talking about:-", "Now, since we missed discussions on the main urls.py file, which is stored in our fenice folder, we will discuss it here. It contains links to various templates which we used in users App and also we need to include the Candidates and Recruiters templates in our main template. Also, we include allauth.urls file in our main urls.py file.", "So, here is the main urls.py file:-", "So, we have finished all the backend stuff related to the Candidates App. In the next part, we will deal with all the templates for the Candidates App.", "Hopefully, you enjoyed this one! Also, here is the GitHub Repository for this project which you can star and fork if you like and test out on your own.", "The next part of the tutorial series is:", "If you want to learn about Django Rest Framework, there is a new and exciting series I am working on, which you can have a look on:", "Also, you can check out the five-part Social Media Website with Django series, which was quite well received. It is a different project based on Django, and you will surely love it.", "Here are some more good articles to read after this one:-", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Upcoming SDE @ Wells Fargo | Ex-SWE Intern @ ByteLearn | Student @ IIT BHU | Web Dev | DSA | https://www.linkedin.com/in/shubham1710"],
