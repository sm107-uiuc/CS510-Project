We can also see most \u201cAlley\u201d values are missing. Since these data columns aren\u2019t varied, we can\u2019t learn how prices differ across streets or alleys.", "To simplify the process of investigating the data, you can use the visualization provided for this dataset on Kaggle to gain more insight on each data column.

For example, we can use the ordering of the categories with label encoding. If the categories have no ordering, we can use one-hot encoding, which creates a new feature for each category and fills it with boolean values.

If we preprocess based on all of the data we\u2019ll gain insight into the data we\u2019re validating against, resulting in a false positive evaluation!

We can use different n_estimators values to create and evaluate our model against the validation set, ultimately choosing the value the gives us the closest prediction to the actual label on the validation data \u2014 doing that causes our model to be tuned by the validation set, which is why we need to have a test set, a dataset the model hasn\u2019t seen or has been tuned by. n_estimators is also used to control underfitting and overfitting in the example model.", "We can now use that pipeline to fit our model using all the previously defined steps:", "Aaaaaand\u2026 we finally have a fitted model!", "Can the model successfully predict house prices on data it hasn\u2019t seen?
