People are changing out calendars, reaching out to loved ones, and deciding on what resolutions they want to try and hold themselves to this year. And if people are doing something (anything really), you can bet that a decent number of them are tweeting about it.", "There are articles out there about what the most popular resolutions are, how achieving them won\u2019t make us happy, and how we\u2019re probably not going to achieve them anyways. Cheery. I decided that nothing really looks at how people approach the whole resolution enterprise. So for that, I took to Twitter and using some good ol\u2019 computational social science decided to look at how people were approaching the idea of resolutions. What are the topics to twitterers tweet about in relation to resolutions? What are the most common words in those topics? Does it say anything about how we approach the idea of resolutions? Those are the questions we\u2019re going to answer today.", "Just a quick word before delving in. Although this project uses techniques from computational social science, I\u2019m not racing to stamp the label of \u201cscience\u201d on it. This is what I\u2019m emphatically NOT saying: \u201cComputer algorithms show that there are only 7 types of New Years resolution tweets. Here\u2019s what they are thanks to Big Data\u2122.\u201d Instead, it\u2019s just a fun way to get a sense of some broader patterns that existed out in the Twitterverse encircling new years resolutions.", "Using Twitter\u2019s API, I searched for tweets containing #newyearsresolutions2019, #resolutions, #newyearsresolution, #newyearsresolutions (yes, there was a difference) and any tweet that contained the words \u201cnew years resolutions\u201d without awkwardly cramming them into a hashtag. I started collecting data around 12:00 PM December 31st and did the last pull just after 12:00 AM January 1st. The earliest tweets dated as far back to December 22nd and, thanks to the magic of time-zones, extended into 5:17 AM January 1st. This process yielded 41,502 unique tweets. I wasn\u2019t exactly methodical about when I made the pulls because I was too busy enjoying saying goodbye to 2018. In accordance with the primer before, take this with a grain of salt.", "After cleaning the data (removing stop words and punctuation, stemming the text, removing htmls, etc), I used Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to model the latent topics in the tweets. LDA assumes that there is a fixed number of topics present across all of the documents in a corpus \u2014 which, in our case, are all of the tweets that we scraped \u2014 and allows for there to be multiple topics presented in a single document. The method then tells you the probability of any particular word appearing in a topic. So there might be a probability of .0002 that \u201capple\u201d appears in the first topic and a probability that it pops up with a probability of .05 in the second topic (presumably, the data derives from an apple-enthusiast forum). You can take the most popular of these words, investigate when they crop up together, and get a sense of when", "There\u2019s a caveat with LDA. You have to choose how many topics exist in the data in order to implement it. It\u2019s also up to us to determine what those topics mean. While there are ways to get a good sense of the right number of topics, attempting them in this data resulted in over 25 different topics. This intuitively makes sense but, frankly, makes for bad blog posts. I started seeing increasingly diminishing returns in how much the models explained after, like, 7 \u2014 so that\u2019s the number I went with. Again, not scientific, but suffices for some fun.", "People love to read and they love to write. Or, at the very least, the love to want to read and want to write. Reading and writing more are pretty common resolutions, so this one didn\u2019t surprise me so much.", "\u201cOne of my quiet resolutions for 2019 is to avoid online discussions about the writing process and instead spend some of that time actually reading or writing.\u201d \u2014 SheerHubris", "\u201cContemplating life\u2026 I want to run more, eat less, laugh more, stress less, sing more, shout less, hear more, speak less, read more, scroll less, write more, text less #NewYearsResolutions #writer #writinggoals\u201d \u2014 Grumpy_SENCO", "Self-care and love was another topic for resolution tweets.

Too many of them will do exactly what happened here, construct a \u201ctopic\u201d that\u2019s basically just centered around the original tweet. But if that\u2019s what people are actually doing while on Twitter, it\u2019s important to know that too.", "For what it\u2019s worth, my opinion is that retweets are generally endorsements. Some people will use them to draw attention to an argument, but they\u2019re mostly doing it to say \u201cI feel this way too!\u201d So I feel that it\u2019s defensible here but a viral tweet can very clearly muck up the works for quantitative content analysis.", "After that break-neck pivot in the tone of these topics, we turn to one a bit more commensurate with what you\u2019d expect.
