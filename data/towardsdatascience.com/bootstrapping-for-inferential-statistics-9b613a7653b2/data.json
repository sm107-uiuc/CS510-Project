Null hypothesis is something that is assumed to be true by default even before we collect data. Alternate hypothesis is something that we are trying to prove using data", "We can bootstrap a sample set of data and compute the sample mean again and again, build a sampling distribution and confidence interval to determine what are the reasonable values for the population mean with some level of confidence", "We can see that our 95% confidence interval is (66.0 , 67.59). Value of 70 is beyond 95% confidence interval so it is safe to say that alternate hypothesis is not true. We fail to reject our null hypothesis", "We start by assuming that null hypothesis is true.
