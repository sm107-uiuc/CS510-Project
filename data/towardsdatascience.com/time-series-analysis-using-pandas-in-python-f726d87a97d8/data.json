You might have worked with housing data wherein each row represents features of a particular house (such as total area, number of bedrooms, year in which it was built) or student dataset wherein each row represents such information about a student (such as age, gender, prior GPA). In all these datasets, the common thing is that all samples (or rows in your dataset), in general, are independent of each other. What sets these datasets apart from time-series data is that in the latter, each row represents a point in time so naturally, there is some inherent ordering to the data. This is how a typical time-series data looks like:", "In the above dataset, we have recorded some value (say the temperature) for each day of the month of January in the year 1991. You can, of course, have more values collected on a particular day in addition to the temperature, such as humidity that day or the wind speed.", "We will be working with the publicly available dataset Open Power System Data. You can download the data here. It contains electricity consumption, wind power production, and solar power production for 2006\u20132017.", "Loading the dataset into Jupyter Notebook:", "This is how our data looks like:", "If you read my previous article, you know the importance of proper date-time formatting. Likewise, when working with time series, it becomes much easier if we have the Datecolumn represented as a Timestamp. Timestamp is the main pandas data structures for working with dates and times. The pandas function to_datetime() can help us convert a string to a proper date/time format.", "We will now go ahead and set this column as the index for the dataframe using the set_index() call.", "If you compare this with the output in Fig 1 above, you would notice that the indices of the dataframe are no longer in range 0 to 4382. Instead, now the indices are the respective date on which the data was collected.", "We can explicitly check the indices as well:", "An interesting thing to note here is thatfreq = None. What this means is that it is not known if data is collected by the hour, by day, my minute, etc. However, just by eyeballing the indices, we can see that it looks like the data was collected by the day. It would be nice to explicitly put this info into the data frame as well and we will be seeing how to do this shortly! But first a quick detour\u2026", "You will come across datasets where the Date and Time were recorded as separate columns at the time of data collection. A simple yet neat trick to set them as data index is:", "Alternatively, you could set them as the index at the time of reading the file like below:", "As we mentioned previously, quick glance at the data suggests it was collected at an interval of 24 hours (or a day). However, the data reflects freq = None. We can correct it as follows:", "What we have done above is say \u201chey, the data was collected at a day\u2019s interval and hence each row is a new day\u201d. So technically, we should have values for power consumption, solar production, wind production, etc for all days from 2006\u20132017.", "In case, some days are missing in our data, the above code is going to insert empty rows and in each of these rows the values corresponding to the columns would be allNaNs. In order to avoid these NaN values, we can tell as.freq function how to fill these null values", "ffill refers to forward fill. This means when a null is encountered for a particular column, it will be replaced by the value in the previous row. As an example:", "In the above table, forward filling the nulls would produce the following dataframe:", "This technique of forward filling makes sense on some level \u2014 if we are not aware of the amount of power consumption on today\u2019s date, we can always assume it is the same as it was yesterday.", "Similarly, filling missing data in a time-series dataset can be achieved as follows:", "Remember, replacing missing data with medians or means in not such a good idea when it comes to time-series data. Better alternatives exist such as forward filling, backward filling, linear interpolation, mean of nearest neighbours, etc.", "Finally, looking at our data set after fixing the frequency type and imputing missing values, we find that our dataset is the same as before (no new rows were added. I guess whosoever did the data collection did one hell of a job!)", "You might be wondering why are there still some null values, especially at the beginning of the dataset. The reason is that these have been forward filled but because the value in the very first row was null, we are unable to see any difference.", "Resampling simply refers to an aggregation of data over a certain time period. Its performance is similar to the group by function in SQL, i.e. data is first split into time bins and some computation is performed on each bin. For instance, given our daily data, we can resample (or bin) it by the month or year and generate some relevant statistics such as minimum, maximum, or mean values.", "To compute weekly mean values for electricity consumption, wind, and solar production:", "Similarly, to compute monthly maximum values for electricity consumption, wind, and solar production:", "This is quite similar to the resampling process that we just learned. The difference is that the bins over which some aggregating functions are performed) are overlapping.", "To compute a 7-day rolling mean:", "In the above command, center = True means for the time bin, say Jan 1 to Jan 8, the rolling mean would be calculated and placed next to the center of the bin i.e. Jan 4. To make it clearer, let's check the output of the above code:", "By the same logic, to calculate the mean consumption value for 2006\u201301\u201301, we would need to average the values from 2005\u201312\u201329 to 2006\u201301\u201304. However, the data for the year 2005 is missing and thus we obtain a Null for the first few rows.", "Rolling means are quite handy for assessing the trend in our dataset. But first, what are trends?", "Trend is the smooth long term tendency of a time series . It might change direction (increase or decrease) as time progresses.", "An increasing trend looks like this:", "An easy way to visualize these trends is with rolling means at different time scales.", "Let\u2019s see the trend of electricity consumption in our dataset using rolling means at an annual scale (365 days):", "Let\u2019s visualize our results to get a better sense of trend. We will be plotting the annual trend against the daily and 7-day rolling mean:", "Looking at the 365-day rolling mean time series, we can see that the overall annual trend in electricity consumption is fairly stable with low consumption recorded around 2009 and 2013.", "Sometimes it would be beneficial to remove the trend from our data, especially if it is quite pronounced (as seen in Fig 3), so we can assess the seasonal variation (more on this in a few minutes) or the noise in our time series. Removing the trend (or de-trending) can also simplify the modeling process and improve model performance.", "A time series with a trend is called non-stationary. A time series that does not have a trend or has the trend removed is said to be stationary.", "Detrended time series is used as input for learning algorithms such as ARIMA (Python library for analyzing and forecasting time series data) or it can also be used as an additional input for a machine learning algorithm.", "We can remove the trend by using a method known as differencing. It essentially means creating a new time series wherein value at time (t)= original value at time (t) - original value at time (t-1)", "Differencing is super helpful in turning your time series into a stationary time series.", "To create first-order differencing of time series:", "In general, what the differenced time series tells us is not the actual value at that particular point in time, but how much different it is from the value in the preceding point in time. That means when we plot this differenced time series, most of these values will lie on either side of the x-axis (or y=0).", "Plotting to visualize the differenced time series:", "We did not have any trend, to begin with, so it might be a bit hard for you to see if the trend has been removed or not. But you don\u2019t have to just take my word for it! When you perform 1st order differencing for your own data (that has a trend component as seen in the figure below on left), you should be able to see a transformation similar to the one in the right:", "P.S: In case 1st order differencing is unable to remove the trend, you can perform 2nd order differencing using the formula:value at time (t)= original value at time (t) \u2014 2 *original value at time (t-1) + original value at time (t-2)", "P.P.S.: The time series resulting from second-order differencing have N \u2014 2 observations. This is because no difference value can be created for the first two observations (there is nothing for it to be subtracted from).", "A time series is periodic if it repeats itself at equally spaced intervals, say, every 12 months, every 1 week, every 4 months, and so on.", "Let us check if our time series has some seasonality element to it.", "It seems our consumption time series is repeating every 12 months. We can see a peak at the beginning and end of every year with a trough in the middle summer months.", "We can look in-depth into a particular year to see if there is any weekly seasonality. Here we look at two month\u2019s worth of data: Jan 2010 & Feb 2010:", "As you can see, the weekly oscillations are quite clear. The power consumption is in general low on weekends and quite high during weekdays.", "Autocorrelation is a technique for analyzing seasonality. It plots the correlation of the time series with itself at a different time lag.", "I learned a great intuitive way to understand autocorrelation using the tutorial here. It basically says, if you take a time series and move it by 12 months (lag = 12) backwards or forwards, it would map onto itself in some way. Autocorrelation is a way of telling how good this mapping is. If it is very good, it means the time series and the shifted time series are almost similar and the correlation at that time lag would be high. The correlation of a time series with such a shifted version of itself is captured by the concept of autocorrelation (big shout out to Hugo Bowne-Anderson for this wonderful explanation, which I have re-iterated here).", "Before I show what the plot looks like, it would be nice to give heads up on how to read the plot. On the x-axis, you have the lag and on the y-axis, you have how correlated the time series is with itself at that lag. If the original consumption time series repeats itself every two days, you would expect to see a spike in the autocorrelation plot at a lag of 2 days.", "From the plot, we can see there is a high peak in correlation at the lag of 7th day, then again on the 14th day, and so on. Which means the time series repeats every 7 days i.e. weekly. This pattern wears off after 3 months (100 days approximately). As you move further away, there\u2019s less and less of a correlation.", "The dotted lines in the above plot actually tell you about the statistical significance of the correlation. Each spike that rises above or falls below the dashed lines is considered to be statistically significant.", "Thus, we can be sure the consumption series is genuinely autocorrelated with a lag of 1 week.", "Note: For brevity, we have only plotted the autocorrelation plot for a subset of our time-series data. If we are to expand to include the complete dataset, the autocorrelation plot would still look pretty much the same.", "At times, it would be essential to extract the month, day of the week, date, etc for each timestamp (i.e. each row of our data). Since we already have the indices set in the DateTime format, extracting these elements become super easy:", "We can also use these additional features as inputs in our models. But more on that in Part 2 of Time Series Modeling in Python (hopefully next week).", "These additional features can also be useful for exploratory analysis of your dataset. For instance, we can plot the median power consumption for each month.", "Hopefully, this warm introduction to time-series data was enough to get you started. In Part 2 of this article, we will be learning how to develop prediction models that can forecast electricity consumption on a particular day. In Part 3, we will be working on a case study analyzing the time series data generated by call centers, essentially working towards analyzing the (dreaded) increment in abandonment rates.", "I enjoy writing step-by-step beginner\u2019s guides, how-to tutorials, interview questions, decoding terminology used in ML/AI, etc. If you want full access to all my articles (and others on Medium), then you can sign up using my link here.", "Your home for data science.
