However a few weeks back I had made up my mind to start working out again. Previously, I had devoted enough months to gain fitness, only to see unproductive efforts and heartbreaking outcomes. It was my last cheat day, as I humped into the spicy, aromatic and freshly prepared Chicken Curry, I came up with this sudden idea.", "What if I use historic data from my apple watch to identify the workout routines with the highest impact and prepare a weekly plan accordingly. I know what you are thinking right now! What about personal trainers or a good instructor? Imagine, what if Data Science turns out to be your trainer with the right combination of routines to achieve better health?\u201d", "Apple Watch Series 4 is now an FDA approved Class 2 Medical Device with fall detection and better heart-monitoring capabilities. Fitness trackers gradually will become the \u201cguardian\u201d of our health. It\u2019s high time we explore the data captured rather than just looking at the numbers and exercise rings. To understand this analysis better, let\u2019s take a peek at some of the key metrics captured (credits: iPhone Health App).", "Note: When you start using a fitness tracker, there is that initial euphoria that makes your workout spike. After a point, the body gets used to it and you don\u2019t see the same level of calorie burn. Hence, it\u2019s important to analyze the same activity over a longer period to see where the body plateaus in terms of intensity.", "Apple\u2019s Health App allows you to export your health records in an XML format. You can process and manipulate the data using Python (Jupyter Notebook) and import it using a visualization app like QlikSense to create your own Decision Board. The iPhone Health App along with the Activity Tracker comes with its dashboard. Does that help you in making informed decisions? Partly yes, partly no!", "Can your trainer tell you what might happen if you Swim for half an hour more or run a little longer? Yes, they can. The standard answer is \u201cyour fitness will improve\u201d! But what if just a kilometer of high-intensity running followed by half an hour of swimming is all you need to keep yourself healthy. What if listening to optimum audio levels, a few flights of stairs and just an hour of swimming is enough for you. This is where data science and machine learning comes into the picture.", "Author\u2019s Note: I Converted the XML data from my phone\u2019s Health App into a structured format using Marwyk\u2019s codes. Running Marwyk\u2019s code created multiple CSV datasets, each tracking one metric separately at a timestamp level ( YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss). I then used Jupyter Note Book to wrangle, manipulate, clean and summarize the data at a day level which formed my analytical dataset (ADS). The ADS is used to fire up the QlikSense dashboard and finally goes into the OLS Regression Model which will help me understand the interaction of various routines. Since I last worked out around a year and a half back, I had access to 3 months of complete data starting Mar \u201918 \u2014 May \u201918.", "Multiple linear regression is used to explain the interaction between one continuous variable and two or more independent variables. In this example Resting Heart Rate (a measure of health) is my dependent/continuous variable and other factors like exercise time, distance covered, flights, etc. are our independent variables. The reason we need a multiple regression model is to understand and quantify the combined impact of multiple workout factors on health rather than looking at them in silos. Note, the impact of running alone on our health might be different when combined with swimming. Multiple linear regression helps us understand these interactions.", "Let me focus more on the findings, rather than talk about the processes involved in coming up with the dashboard or the final model. Since I didn\u2019t track my weight daily, I used Resting Heart Rate as a proxy of my overall health. I regressed Resting Heart Rate on other variables like Steps, Exercise Time, Basal Energy, Swimming Duration, Swimming Strokes, Audio Levels, Running, etc. All five assumptions of Linear Regression namely linear relationship, multivariate normality, no or little multicollinearity, no auto-correlation and homoscedasticity were kept in mind while developing the model. Missing value treatment & Z Score standardization was done on the dataset. Since I won\u2019t perform all routines daily, all missing values were replaced with zero. I had 90 days of data, hence I used the K-Fold Cross Validation technique to achieve the final model results. Note this is just the primary results and the model statistics (R-squared=0.642) can still be improved on.", "A decision board is the other name of a dashboard with Key Insights & Findings. Imagine looking at your Phone\u2019s inbuilt tracker. It just shows you pure numbers and fancy graphs. Your data should tell you a story and here is what I found.", "I hope you find this useful. I am currently using these results to plan my routine, focusing mostly on an hour of Swimming and some initial warm-up runs. I made it a habit to improve my Stand Hour, reducing my Idle Time by 2 percentage points. Data Science will have a much bigger impact on the Health Care Industry in days to come. I strongly believe my analysis is just a start of what is possible. Feel free to drop me a note if you want to collaborate on this analysis further or would like to reuse the code snippets and improve the model results.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
