In Russia, PCs were not very abundant at that time, so my first gaming station was ZS Spectrum with games on tapes. The colorful and bright DOS games later became a real discovery for me. For me, the majority of existing genres arose from the 90s. After a bit of nostalgia, I decided to recall my youth and run one of the old games on the Dosbox emulator and was unpleasantly hit by giant pixels and low resolution. Although the large-pixel old graphics may have their charm, many are now not happy with this quality.", "Improving the quality of graphics is often critical for gamers. Redrawing textures for the HD game Heroes 3 took about six months in 2014 from Ubisoft and caused a peak of interest in this game", "The same is happening with CNC first game of series due to high-its res remaster (red line) (https://www.ea.com/ru-ru/games/command-and-conquer/command-and-conquer-remastered).", "Not every game deserves remastering in HD since it takes a lot of effort in redrawing graphics. Another approach is algorithmic enhancement.", "To increase the resolution and get rid of large pixels and steps in games, various postprocessing and anti-aliasing algorithms are currently used (for more details, see https://vr.arvilab.com/blog/anti-aliasing), but anti-aliasing algorithms lead to all the hated \u201cblurry\u201d pictures, which are often even less preferable than the angularity of large pixels.", "But you can try to improve the quality of the graphics using the technology of superresolution. The idea of superresolution is to improve the resolution of the image drawing the missing pixels using a neural network. Impressive results have now been achieved, resembling the scene for improving the image from the Bladerunner movie", "Superresolution technology improves the visual perception of the image, for example, here https://github.com/tg-bomze/Face-Depixelizer , but brings new information to the image. It can be used to improve the quality of films https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49oj2JUtn0A , https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RYNThid23g . However, most algorithms are resource-intensive and quite slow, and I wanted to create a script to improve the game in real-time.", "All of the following will apply to convolutional neural networks (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network ) a subtype of neural networks used for working with images. First, let\u2019s look at how a neural network works to solve the superresolution problem. The task is very similar to the solution of the auto-encoder task (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoencoder). It is necessary to feed an image to the network input, to get the same image at the output. However, autoencoders are usually used to solve the problem of efficient data compression, therefore, a feature of their architecture is Bottleneck \u2014 a bottleneck, that is, a network layer with a small number of neurons. The presence of such a layer makes the remaining parts learn for effective coding and decoding of information. To train superresolution networks, the resolution of high-quality images is first intentionally reduced and fed to the input of the neural network. The expected output is the source image in high quality. The superresolution task defines the architecture of the networks used.", "Usually, there is a connection between input and output data (skip-connection), which greatly accelerates learning. The pixel size of the input data increases and is added to the output of the convolutional network. Thus, you do not need to train the network from complete scratch to turn the image into almost the same. That connection allows the training of drawing up the difference between the enlarged by increasing the size of the pixel and the real HD image. The idea of having skip connections at various levels and through a different number of layers is extremely effective and has led to the emergence of the Residual Networks class of networks. Nowadays, such connections are used in almost all popular architecture. A good overview of state-of-art architectures for solving superresolution problems can be found here (https://github.com/krasserm/super-resolution ). My task was to create a neural network to solve the superresolution problem in real-time.", "The edsr architecture with four residual blocks was chosen to 4 times resolution increase (standard edsr have 16 blocks). After investigation and optimizations, its size was significantly reduced (size of nonlinear part reduced for 4 blocks and linear upsampling step was optimized without quality loss optimized) and speed enhanced without significant quality loss. The general network architecture is shown in the diagram. Each block is an X * Y * N image, where the width corresponds to the number of channels. Transitions \u2014 correspond to 3x3 convolutions (in the case of res blocks followed by activation of ReLU for non-linearity). Upscaling step \u2014 an increase of dimension due to flattening of channels.", "High-quality photos have been downloaded from https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/DIV2K/. Generally, any photo can be used. The code for training is here (With some functions from https://github.com/krasserm/super-resolution for data generator). Image resizing used for better work is pixelized games is the NEAREST method", "I should note, that downsizing method affects the quality of training a lot. The best methods for downsampling were nearest neighbor or median filtering. Methods that include some averaging over pixelsusually are not applicable.", "After that remove cached data in ./cache folder and recreate generators with our data (downsized properly)", "The output is a relatively small (2.6 MB) neural network with a simple architecture. At the same time, the check gives a subtle difference from the pre-trained 16 block network:", "I have launched the resulting network on a video card (I have a GTX 1060 3 Gb) with cudnn support (https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) for high performance.

Drawing the enhanced image in a new window", "During development, I found that when launching games in the DOSBox emulator, the resolution is 640x480 pixels, but most often it is produced by doubling pixel size, so before enhancement optional initial 320x240 image restoration step may be required (I later found the details https://www.dosgamers.com/dos/dosbox-dos-emulator/screen-resolution ).", "Capturing of screenshots uses the mss library in Linux or d3dshot library for windows", "Image processing and drawing \u2014 using OpenCV-python and PIL libraries.

According to the benchmarks http://ai-benchmark.com/ranking_deeplearning_detailed.html GTX 1070 and 1080 at similar tasks should outperform 1060 almost 2 times (have not really tested either)!
