Automating tasks helps reduce the amount of human effort wasted on that task, cut time and reduce the risk of human injury that may result in the process of completing or implementing the task. However, in this story, we would focus mainly on automating tasks in the software space. This is to say, writing automation scripts in various programming languages to get work done way easier, faster and with tremendous accuracy.", "Automation is cost-cutting by tightening the corners and not cutting them.\u2015 Haresh Sippy", "For every individual we can randomly pick who works especially with computers, there will be a task or a list of tasks that you constantly do. You will find that those tasks are normally time-consuming and quite laborious. The tasks could be as simple as sending emails, exploring datasets, analyzing spreadsheet files and others. No matter how simple the task appears to be, it can be very stressful especially if you have to spend multiple hours per day working on it. Automation then would be very necessary to save you the stress and multiple hours per day you spend on the task so you can use that time and effort for something more worthwhile. Automation scripts are very similar to the regular scripts that you can write in programming languages with the exception that automation scripts seek to automate a process or task.", "Any daily work task that takes 5 minutes will cost over 20 hours a year, or over half of a work week. Even if it takes 20 hours to automate that daily 5 minute task, the automation will break even in a year.\u2015 Anthony J. Stieber", "There are a lot of programming languages around today but python is by far the most popular and preferred language to anyone who seeks to learn the art of task automation. Python is very easy to learn and write, code experimentation and implementation can also be carried out very easily and swiftly in Python. Most people also prefer python for automation because of the large community built around it where people could easily share their problems and get help from other people in the community. Also, there is a wide range of resources to choose from on the internet to guide you with Python for automation with my personal favorite being the book, Automate the Boring Stuff With Python. This is a very insightful and beginner-friendly book that takes everyone even with no prior knowledge in the python programming language from beginner to mastery in the art of automation, you should read it if you have a keen interest in learning general python as you specialize in automation as well.", "Technology advancements do sometimes mean that certain jobs become less needed over time, but that doesn\u2019t mean entire industries are just out of luck. In fact, research shows that automation doesn\u2019t reduce the number of jobs available, and it can even add more jobs to the workforce.", "The idea of automating tasks is very scary to certain people because it gives them the impression that their jobs are going to be replaced by automation bots or made obsolete. In pure honesty, automation merely seeks to free time and reduce effort. If your jobs fall into both categories of being time-consuming and requiring too much manual effort or labor to perform, it is most likely to be automated if there is that option or available service for the automation to take place. However, it is your sole responsibility to make yourself useful in these times of evolving technology. Automation is expected to coin in more jobs than it replaces and it is going to be most available for people who work on automating tasks or jobs. Grow along with technology. Teach yourself to learn, unlearn and relearn. By doing this, you prepare yourself for the evolving times in today\u2019s fast-growing technology world.", "Automation won\u2019t take your job, but the self-inflicted imprisonment of industrial isolation will.\u2015 Richie Norton", "In the software development space, automation can come in many forms; writing and packaging automation scripts or classes to be used as packages or libraries, is one of the most common ways. This can save you the stress and time of having to write numerous lines of code each and every time you need to implement something. As an agile software developer, data scientist, AI or ML engineer, automating simple but time-consuming tasks should be a go-to method for you. It makes you stand out at what you do even as it saves you time and effort \ud83d\ude09.", "I currently have two big automation scripts I have published as python packages, FastML and Xplore. I have a few more currently being tested and will be released soon. I am very passionate about automation as I seek to make the work of data scientists or analysts, AI and ML engineers easy. Reach out to me if you want to chat about something I mentioned in this story or just want to get friendly \ud83d\ude0aI am available if you want to chat personally on Twitter or connect on LinkedIn.
