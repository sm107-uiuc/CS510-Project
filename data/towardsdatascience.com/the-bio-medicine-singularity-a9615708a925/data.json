There are many exciting fields where this will be applied: energy systems, health, technology, space exploration, etc. I prefer to look where these predictive mechanisms can be applied for growth and wellbeing, rather than meddling in the discussion of whether or not we live in a simulation. Out-innovating problems rather than trying to mitigate the source is the way of our capitalist, growth-obsessed society.", "Commonplace in the field of artificial intelligence is the term The Singularity, where technology development will dramatically outpace human development, which was coined in Vernor Vigne\u2019s 1993 piece \u201cThe Coming Technological Singularity\u201d. This moment is for-seen by many to happen \u2018soon,\u2019 and with irreparable changes to our day to day lives (I intentionally omit the discussion of how far various high-profile thinkers place The Singularity in our future).", "If one assumes any marginal increase in ability to simulate more accurately every year, we are guaranteed to reach some monumental inflection point s of capability. The question for biology is\u2026", "What happens when simulation of molecular biology becomes rich enough for offline drug discovery?", "Right now it costs over $1billion to get a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. This cost covers layers of discovery and hard science phases with clinical trials. Frequently the mechanisms for bio-therapeutics are often patched over once efficacy is shown, so many early clinical trials are extremely dangerous and can have long term consequences or death.", "Being able to iterate on this process digitally would fundamentally change drug manufacture and design. We would allow scientists to test their wildest ideas and learning algorithms to explore possibilities with no marginal cost. The lack of marginal cost on development is what enables the uber-profitability of the most prolific technology companies.", "Early explorations of modeling complex biological systems fall into systems biology. Wrapping ideas from machine learning, big data analysis, formal biology, chemistry, etc. together will be a giant interdisciplinary affair. The validation required before testing these new experimental drugs on humans will be extreme, but the potential payoff is infinite.", "Maybe a complex embedding such as Neural Ordinary Differential Equations could lead to discoveries that enable rich modeling of complex systems. The list of exciting pathways to try here from a machine learning perspective, is lengthy. Ultimately, I would be extremely interested in the life-changing multi-agent reinforcement learning problem that would be solving disease digitally.", "Having an effectively accurate model for human biology will make health and wellbeing a game that humans can easily sign off on a computer. Whether or not that is ethical or enjoyable is a question that researchers in machine systems biology should start asking now. Where should we let machine meet body?", "\u201cBio-Medicine Singularity: The moment when we can digitally represent complex biology, and therefore study it at zero marginal cost\u201d \u2014 D.A.

The answer is almost certainly yes, so as scientists we are obligated to try and solve this ideas that seem impossible, with infinite return.", "The Santa Fe Institute, who\u2019s research partially touches novel cybernetics towards the bio singularity.
