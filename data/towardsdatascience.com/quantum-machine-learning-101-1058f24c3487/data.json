Hence, this should all be just a fun reading for you, while I plan to write a more systematic & in depth series of Tutorials on QML.", "The Classical Computers are universal as they can implement any logical operation, whereas Quantum Computers are Universal in the sense that the any Quantum state over set of qubits can be converted to any other Quantum state. A lot of good early hope in feasibility of Quantum (circuit) Computing comes from Solovay\u2013Kitaev theorem, which on very broad terms (finiteness of neuron/ Gate & Universal function/ State Approximation) can be equated to Universal approximation theorem for Deep Learning.", "Simply put, Ising model is an mathematical model for representing the phase transition & interaction within a system [1][2]. The energy of such a system at any point is given by respective Hamiltonian (equation) at that point.", "So lets say in the Fig 1. below, we have a system of 4X4 (lattice) Matrix. Each of the cell is in one of the two possible states (say +1, -1). Let\u2019s say every cell would have only four adjacent ( top, left, right, bottom) cell, if present.", "Now each of the cell would possess some energy due to the interaction with its neighbors and some due to its own state. Every system would want to achieve (transition to) the lowest energy state.", "So Eq1. above is the Energy equation for such a system at any point", "Now, though the equation above is not even accurate enough for a simple physical Magnet ( for which it was initially proposed), but it does a fair job of putting modelling the energy of a system due to state of each particle, its interaction with other particles and for any external factor on each particle.", "Fig 2. Above shows transition of such a system (200X200) from initial state (left) to the final state (right).", "Though summarizing all the possible ways for Quantum ML would not be possible for me, mostly due to my limited understanding of handful of the algorithms I have read but since in general any Quantum Optimization/ minimization algorithm can have an equivalent QML use-case.", "Of the 3 methods provided below, we would only focus on the 1st model for the later part of our discussion in this blog, other two methods are put here just to give the bigger picture of QML algorithms", "If you would want to read more on these, check below pointers:", "Basically, all the above methods would somehow turn out to be, we getting an equivalent Quantum Circuit & solving it over a Quantum Processing Unit (QPU), in combination with our standard CPU.", "Going forward on this blog, we would assume we are magically given a Quantum circuit for our problem & we want to solve it on a QPU with an programming interface.", "For now, we would try to build a simple regression cum classification problem, provided in the notebook below, but here we would break it piece by piece.", "Again we would already assume a circuit for the problem, mainly driven by the final MNIST problem circuit as suggested by Farhi et al & also used by Google TFQ MNIST example.", "Before we start, we would need to install tensorflow-quantum (TFQ) & Cirq on top of tensorflow (TF).", "Let\u2019s import all the packages we would need", "Let\u2019s make a dummy toy data for our problem", "The generated data looks like below, output of above print statement. Basically x1 =1 \u2192 y = -1 and x2 =1 \u2192 y = +1. Do not ask me why, but this looks like way to simple problem to start with :)", "One fun fact about Quantum data is, it can\u2019t be stored & it can be only generated/provided as a Quantum Circuit itself. Check out few more", "Hence each data point we generated above should be convert to an equivalent Quantum circuit. So basically for 0 bit we do not do anything, but we pass a 1 bit though a NOT Gate. Below is a simple function for doing the same, converting our data over 0/1 into equivalent circuits", "So, let\u2019s get the equivalent quantum data (circuit) for each data point in our classical dataset.", "For passing the circuits / data points generated above with CIRQ to TFQ, we would need to convert each circuit/ data point to a tensor in TFQ.", "Now we are ready with our Quantum Data, all we now need is the Quantum circuit for our Problem & a way to solve it :)", "As mentioned above, let\u2019s just assume one circuit, even if it\u2019s not the best for the problem in hand, but we trust if a similar circuit can solve simplified MNIST binary (3 vs 6) digit classification, it should easily solve our problem", "Here the (-1,-1) line/ qubit is what would have our final output class prediction, while (0,0) & (1,0) qubits would have our input data.", "So, let\u2019s build the above circuit in CIRQ.", "The SVGCircuit(model_circuit) code/ command should be able to draw your circuit image on the inline console.", "And from here on things would make same sense as in Classical Machine Leaning", "Now more like Keras Sequential Neural Network model, we would build a model to solve our Problem Circuit.", "Finally, we would need to define the loss function, optimizer & metric to track.", "Below is what our model built so far contains (from model summary)", "Let\u2019s Train our Quantum Circuit model with Quantum Data.", "Below is how your training & validation data loss (& accuracy) would change with each epoch.", "Hoping all went well, try Predicting the values from the test data.", "Now based on above you would believe we have solved a classical Classification problem as regression problem, so please go ahead & improve itHint: Hinge Loss ?", "Finally, once you understand this, it would be much more easily for you to write your own simple MNIST two-class classifier without referring to Google\u2019s Tutorial for the same :)", "If you are wondering how Quantum Processing Unit would be used in combination of current processing units and where does everything we used above fits in bigger picture (?).
