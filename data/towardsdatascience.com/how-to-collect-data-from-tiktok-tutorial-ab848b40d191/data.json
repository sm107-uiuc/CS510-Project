To name a few prominent examples,", "In short, TikTok and its driving algorithms now have a sizeable real-world influence, especially considering that a typical user spends almost an hour per day watching videos on the platform. With this in mind, it is important to understand what TikTok shows to millions of eyeballs every day, and to do that, we will need some data.", "Below, I have included code for how to collect TikTok data in a variety of ways. I tried to keep it general and helpful for most use cases, but you will probably need to tweak it depending on what you are doing. The remainder of this post covers how to do the following:", "(A couple notes for the nerds: if you plan to make more than a few dozen requests, I suggest setting up a proxy. I have not yet tested it, but the API I demo here should integrate with your proxy quite easily. Second, if you want to track popularity over time, you will want to add timestamps to the statistics.)", "A good place to start is collecting videos from a given user.

You will probably be mostly interested in just a few stats, which you can extract from the full dictionary with the following function:", "Then, we can go from the API-outputteduser_videos list to a nice, clean table (i.e. Pandas data frame) with just three lines:", "Here is what the output file looks like (I removed some rows and columns to make it readable on here):", "In this case, you may be interested in the videos \u201cliked\u201d by a given user. This is pretty straightforward to collect. Let\u2019s see what videos the official TikTok account has liked recently:", "And the output file looks similar to the one from last time, since it also saves a list of videos:", "Say you wanted to create a large list of users from which you could collect videos they post and videos they like. You could use the 50 most-followed TikTok accounts, but 50 may not generate a wide enough sample.", "An alternative approach is to use the suggested users to snowball a list of users from just one user. First, we will do this for four different accounts:", "Here is the code I used:", "And here are the suggested users:", "Notably, the list of recommendations for washingtonpost and chunkysdead were identical, and there is a lot of overlap between the other recommendations, so this approach may not give you what you need.", "Another method to create a large list of users it to use the getSuggestedUsersbyIDCrawler to keep the snowball rolling, so to speak. To create a list of 100 suggested accounts using tiktok as the seed account, you just need the following code:", "This creates a list which contains a variety of different celebrity accounts, here are a few:", "From what I observed, the getSuggestedUsersbyIDCrawler method starts to branch out and find smaller, more niche accounts, which have tens of thousands of followers rather than hundreds of thousands or millions. This is good news if you want a representative dataset.", "If you want to collect a wide sample of data from TikTok, I advise starting with the suggested users crawler.", "Finally, maybe you simply want to collect trending videos for a simple content analysis, or just to keep up \ud83d\ude42.
