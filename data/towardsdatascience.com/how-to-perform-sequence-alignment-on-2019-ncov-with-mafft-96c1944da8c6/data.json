They can infect humans in many ways, most often through contacting mouth, nose, and eyes. To avoid infections, it is advised to avoid outdoor activities, especially in crowded areas. It is also important to sanitize hands often and not to rub our eyes with our hands.", "People joked about how they can now contribute to society by simply laying on a couch at home. All of my meeting plans during Lunar New Year is now canceled. Therefore, I decided to share a tutorial on how to obtain genetic sequence data of 2019-nCoV and perform a Sequence Alignment on it with MAFFT. I hope this article raised interest in bioinformatics research and may aid us in fighting the next epidemic.", "Sequence Alignment is a way of arranging DNA, RNA or protein to identify regions of similarity that may reveal functional, structural or evolutionary relationships between the sequences. A recent publication suggested cross-species transmission from snake to human with the help of sequence alignment through MAFFT.", "MAFFT (Multiple Alignment using Fast Fourier Transform) is a multiple sequence alignment program published in 2002. It can be used to perform sequence alignment for RNA sequences. Coronaviruses are, for example, viruses with a single-stranded RNA enveloped in a shell derived from the cell membranes of the host. Details on the algorithm used in MAFFT can be found here.", "The latest update of 2019-nCoV can be found on NGDC (National Genomics Data Center of China). In this tutorial, we will analyze the 2019-nCoV virus and the SARS-CoV virus found inside the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) data bank. SARS-CoV, infamously know as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), resulted in 774 deaths in 17 reported countries around the year 2020.", "I have a copy and pasted the data into a file with the name of the virus. They should look like something above, with an index number followed by codes in a batch size of 10, 60 codes per line, separated by spaces. I have uploaded the related files of this analysis and attached a link at the end of this article.", "First, we need to install MAFFT. We can install it via Anaconda with the following commands. Manual installation for different operating systems can be found on the MAFFT official website.", "MAFFT is very easy to use, but it processes data in a special format. We will need to preprocess our obtained data so it can be aligned by MAFFT. Below is the Python script that does so:", "We can save the above Python code into a file called \u201cpreprocess.py\u201d, inside the same folder as my virus RNA data. Then we can run the following bash command in the folder to preprocess the data.", "The output file called \u201cSEQUENCES.txt\u201d should now look like something below. With the virus name appended in front of the file, the white spaces and index numbers are also stripped off.", "Now we can perform Sequence Alignment with MAFFT under our Terminal with the following steps:", "After we hit enter, we just need to wait for MAFFT to align our RNA codes. The finished product should look like something below. \u201c-\u201d is used to shift the codes and \u201c*\u201d down below is to indicate similar sequences.", "Congratulations, you have just learned how to perform Sequence Alignment with MAFFT! Now you can play with the gene code and take advantage of the alignment information however you like!", "Help Wuhan fight off deadly disease as a developer, data scientists and more:", "Your home for data science.
