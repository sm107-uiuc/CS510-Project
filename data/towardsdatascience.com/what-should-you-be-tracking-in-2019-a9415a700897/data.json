During time-triggering events like a birthday or a new month or year, we declare what we want to change and attempt to build a new habit or reach a long-desired goal. A lot of those will fail. By some estimates over 90% of new years resolutions fail.", "We think a lot about what we want to achieve. But how often do we think about the process underlying how we achieve or even how to measure our progress towards those goals?", "While a lot of jargon terms get thrown around, at its essence self-tracking, quantified self, personal informatics, or whatever you call it can be defined as the activity of measuring or documenting something about your self. In turn, I find it\u2019s best to frame this tracking towards either better self-understanding or optimized self-improvement. So, when it comes to goals, tracking data can serve as a feedback mechanism for understanding a specific area like health or productivity or as a gauge to measure your progress towards an objective goal.", "In this post, I want to share what I\u2019ll be tracking in the year ahead, but I also want to argue why I think tracking is a useful and meaningful activity today.", "In the first part, I\u2019ll share a few reasons why many people track and why personal data collection is such a valuable pursuit today. To cut to the chase, the main reason I find tracking beneficial is that it is an enabler for better self-understanding and empowered self-improvement. But the only way tracking can be an enabler is if we go beyond just tracking and data collection and start to engage with our data. That\u2019s why I believe data engagement is so important. You don\u2019t need to be data scientist to put your data to use.", "In the second and longest part, I\u2019ll layout what I\u2019ll be tracking in 2019, including the specific area and technologies I use. I\u2019ll also share three ways I engage with my tracking data through a weekly review, personal data dashboard and goal check-in\u2019s.", "In conclusion, I\u2019ll briefly share four areas I think everyone should track and how tracking and personal data can align with your goals.", "Let\u2019s get started looking at what you could be tracking in the year ahead!", "A few years ago, I first wrote a post about what I planned to track for an entire year. My initial point then was that it was easier than ever to track a life, and I shared an big list of what I\u2019d track for the year ahead. The ease of tracking remains just as true today. With just a smartphone, a few apps, and ideally a wearable, you can generate and collect a lot of data about yourself.", "What has changed is how I position tracking with my goals. I no longer track just to track, but instead track to enable a data-driven life of self-understanding and empowered self-improvement.", "What I\u2019ve come to realize is that self-tracking is best thought of as a support structure for goals. We use data to get some objective measurements on our life and pursuits. We then use that data to understand what is happening and visualize our status and progress. Tracking isn\u2019t the point; tracking is the enabler of some other pursuit or goal, like understanding our health or bettering how we think or write.", "The main reason I find tracking a beneficial human activity and pursuit is that tracking data can be a powerful enabler for better self-understanding and empowered self-improvement. Data helps us answer questions and pursue data-driven efforts towards our goals. But the only way data and tracking can be an enabler is if we engage and use that data. We need to go beyond just tracking and data collection and start to use our data for feedback, self-reflection and data visualization.", "In short, tracking can be empowering and beneficial, but really only if we engage with our tracking data. This has lead me to realize that self-tracking should divided into two parts: data collection and data engagement.", "Let\u2019s look at what I\u2019ll be tracking and how I plan to engage with my data in 2019.", "When it comes to what to track, the best thing to thing to do is think about a goal or two you want to achieve and then find ways to track it. If you want to run more, track your runs. If you have several habits you want to build or remove, track your habits. If you want to better manage your time (or decrease computer or screentime), track those.", "You\u2019ll have better success sticking with tracking if it aligns with a goal you already have. In turn, by tracking your goals and using your tracking data, you\u2019ll be able to become more engaged with whatever you are trying understand or achieve.", "There is no real point to tracking stuff if you don\u2019t intend to use it, and the vast majority of what I track serves towards my own goals. As I mentioned in a previous section, I now divide my tracking efforts into two parts: 1. my actual tracking or data collection and 2. my data engagement. Let\u2019s look at what I track first.", "Over the last several years, I\u2019ve slowly built up a lot of ways in which I track my life. I do not advice someone who is just getting started with self-tracking to try and implement all of these methods.", "In spite of this warning about limiting how much tracking, most of the data that I do track now are tracked passively. So it really doesn\u2019t take that much time to do.", "Across the year I\u2019m tracking about 20\u201325 area or metrics. A few of them are mostly focused on ensuring background stats on my health, time and productivity, while others have a strong correlation to what I\u2019m trying to achieve in terms of writings, learning, and tech products. These focused areas I use in a feedback loop to build up habits and reach my intended outcome.", "While a lot of focus tends to be put on what we track, including wearables, blood tests, apps, etc, I find that this singular focus on personal data collection misses a major component, namely data engagement. Basically if you don\u2019t periodically engage with your tracking data or allow your data to provide feedback, then it isn\u2019t very useful. So, if I had to offer one tip to anyone starting to track their lives: Engage with your data!", "You don\u2019t need to be data scientist to put your data to use. You just need an active curiosity and some familiar with a few simple tools. Often times looking at the data in a spreadsheet application is enough to get started. Additional tools like Python\u2019s Data Science Tool Kit, Google Data Studio or Tableau can help you go one step further.", "Personally, I follow a couple of habits to ensure I use what I track to better understand myself and make improvements towards my goals. Here are three examples of my data engagement:", "I\u2019m strong believer in the power of the weekly review. Whether it\u2019s weekly or monthly, the basic idea is once a week to do a bit of organizational cleanup and reflect. Think about the past week and plan for the week to come. For me, it\u2019s period of time where you go \u201cmeta\u201d and consider what worked and didn\u2019t work in your processes. Iterating on this process will over time help you better understand your work and life systems and implement changes for improving your life and work.", "Personally, I started doing weekly reviews several years ago, and it remains one of my most useful productive or goal-driven habits. Once a week, I set aside about 30 minutes to look at my past week, check-in on key areas and plan and set goals for the week ahead. While the format has gone through a few different iterations, I stick to doing it every Sunday, keeping it under 30 minutes and making sure at least 10 minutes of that time is dedicated to personal reflection writing.", "Originally inspired by Getting Things Done, I now use a data-driven approach to my weekly reviews. First, I aggregate and log several data points using Google Form and store it into a Google Sheet. I also collect some screenshots of a few tracking areas. Second, I then do some minor cleanup and run some simple comparison formulas in the spreadsheet. Third, I generate a template with the filled in data points. Fourth and finally, I use that template to write up my own thoughts and reflect on the week past and week to come.", "If I could only recommend a single weekly change for someone to try, it would be weekly reviews. It\u2019s simpel to get started, but it can have a profound impact.", "Whether it\u2019s at a company or just for your personal needs, one of the best ways to engage with your data is by creating a data dashboard.", "Here is an example of my \u201cproductivity\u201d dashboard:", "There are a lot of tools you can use to create a personal data dashboard. How it looks isn\u2019t that important, since the main objective is to help you compare your data over time and visualize various trends. A spreadsheet app like Google Sheets or excel can also be used to visualize your tracking data, while Tableau or Google Data Studio are slightly more professional options, which can provide a way to sync with stored data.", "Increasingly I\u2019m a fan of using IFTTT or Zapier to automate my data collection into Google Sheets. I then use some simple formula functions to process that data into additional time dimensions like date, month, week and year and into useful metrics. Finally, I link that data into Google Data Studio to create interactive data visualization.", "I spent a few hours building my current dashboard and have adding a few tweaks here and there as my objectives and focus changes. Admittedly, there is a slight learning curve with Google Data Studio, but it shouldn\u2019t take more than an afternoon or two to get up and running.", "If you are interested in learning how to create your personal data dashboard, I\u2019m currently preparing a course on Google Data Studio for Personal Data Analysis and Quantified Self that will be released in early 2019. Signup for my newsletter to get early access and other goodies.", "Goals are a complex subject. It\u2019s a lot more fun to think about the target and content of goals rather than ponder the systems that can positively support (or negatively undermine) us in reaching them. I\u2019ve recently started to be more conscious in setting and tracking my goals, especially since doing more research into the science of goals.", "Ultimately the key to using tracking with your goals is use data and your data analysis when evaluating your goals.I keep a big list of my goals in a spreadsheet application called AirTable. I then categorize, prioritizing and schedule those goals.", "For example, I follow Buffet\u2019s recommendation of goal prioritization and have set 5 big long-term goals. My additional sub-goals or incentives are short-term goals aimed at fulfilling those big goals, like financial freedom or running a marathon under 4 hours. In view of how hard it is to work on multiple goals at the same time, I schedule these sub-goals by the month or quarter. I find this is a pretty good balance and it helps me view goals as a process, rather than a target. Specifically, I\u2019m able to do goal setting, goal tracking and goal management all in one place.", "This has proven relatively sustainable, and I use my existing tracking data along with a bit of reflection to see how I\u2019m doing and figure out what to fix or optimize. Goals are a process and tracking helps me optimize that process.", "Tracking and personal data remains a complicated and contentious topic, and I expect it to remain so for the coming years. One of the big reasons it remains such a hot topic is that the majority of the benefit of all of this data goes to a few technology companies. By collecting data on their users, companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook and others are able to know with a high degree accuracy who their users are and how to manipulate them. This isn\u2019t a fair balance of how data is used, since as creators and owners of that data, we should be able to benefit too.", "One of my personal missions is to help people to better understand, collect and use their personal data. In this post, I shared why I think tracking data is beneficial and how it can be an enabler for better self-understanding and improving how we improve. I also shared a pretty hefty list of what I\u2019ll be tracking in the year ahead. I don\u2019t expect or recommend most people to track all of these areas. For one reason, it will take some time to get setup, but mostly because what you track should align with what you want to work on.", "What should you be tracking in 2019?", "I think there are four key areas everyone should track: health, money, time, and projects (e.g. tasks, habits, and goals).", "Unless you are fortunate to be born rich, I believe most people would benefit from some degree of financial literacy, planning and setting goals. Money is one of the easiest and simplest to track. Most banks and money transactions are digital, meaning it\u2019s easy to get your data. Wealth tracking is also an area where you can easily automate many of the processes from transaction categorization to investment deductions. Tools like Mint, Personal Capital, Spendee or You Need a Budget are all great ways to get started. In terms what and how to track, I recommend tracking three aspects: your transactions, your financial check-in\u2019s (periodic account balances) and your financial goals.", "Time is also relatively easy to track. You can use either a passive method or manual logging to record your time usage. There are advantages to both manual and passive time tracking as well as a hybrid method, which I personally use, where you passive track device usage and manually track project time. To get started with time tracking, checkout RescueTime which lets you track your computer time and categorize which sites or apps are productive vs. distracting. After logging your computer usage for awhile, check your overall numbers, decide if your allotment is what you want and implement changes to decrease or increase time in certain areas.", "If you are more concerned about mobile phone usage, Android and Apple both provide apps to log your screentime and know how much time you spend on your devices. Both let you set notifications and limits too.", "Arguably the hardest yet most powerful time tracking method is manual tracking. Personally, I use Toggl to log my hours but most timer tools will work. Start by tracking a single key area like writing or studies and consider expanding from there. If you want to ensure you are putting in the time on a goal, then log it.", "3. Your Productive activity = Projects, Tasks, Habits, and Goals", "Anything that takes more than one step is a project. Under the umbrella term of \u201cProductive Activity,\u201d I include projects, goals, habits, and tasks. It is my way of providing a catch all phrase about tracking and better managing any multistep initiative or activity. There are countless books and articles on productivity and how best to manage it. My main point here is to show that with tracking you can create a \u201cscorecard\u201d that allows you to track the regular steps you complete and overall achievements too. For example, you can use a task tracker like Todoist to know how often you complete tasks from a certain project or you can use a habit tracker like Habitica to know how often you complete a new habit and your current streak. Once you start logging the tasks you complete, you can start to gamify it by ensuring you get so many done in a day and how many high vs. low priority tasks.", "Of these four items, health is one of the harder ones to nail down on how best to measure and quantify. One key distinction that might useful when tracking health is whether you are measuring your health status (like blood tests, heart rate, etc.) or tracking certain health commitments (like running, drinking, water, taking vitamins, etc). You should aim to track a mix of both your health status and your healthy habit commitments.", "When it comes to health status, I recommend periodically getting your blood biomarkers tested and, if you are over 35 and you\u2019ve never checked it regularly, your blood pressure. Both will provide a good baseline. If you are overweight, you should get a scale and track that. Personally I\u2019m fan of HRV which is a way of measuring your chronic stress and automatic nervous system. I use to see if I\u2019m overtrained, overstressed, over-traveled, etc and make periodic adjustments to get more rest.", "The thing to remember is that \u201chealthy\u201d and even \u201csick\u201d are not simple binaries. In fact there are a multitude of parameters (like blood biomarkers) that score on ranges and scales from sick to normal to optimal and even those ranges are somewhat subjective too. That said, while you might decide on your own health numbers, when it comes to health and wellness there are a few well-established health measurements I recommend and use. The key point is to track them consistently and use health data as a feedback loop to understand if lifestyle changes are improving your health or not.", "When it comes to tracking your health commitments, there are nearly countless ways you can do that. If you just need to get moving more, a wearable or pedometer step counter will work. Use it for a few days to get a baseline, then see a goal to improve. If running, swimming or another activity is your thing, track it with Strava or another app. Ultimately it doesn\u2019t matter what you use but just try to find an easy way to get a sense of how often you move and what you are doing. Personally I find the easiest way to do this is with a Wearable. I use an Apple Watch, but I\u2019m also a fan of Fitbit, MiBand, Garmin, and Oura Ring too.", "Finally, if you are interested in collecting your tracking data and doing some data analysis to engage with that data, check out my open source project QS Ledger on github.com. It\u2019s a collection of Python Jupyter notebooks that walks you through collecting your data and data processing to full data analysis and creating your own data visualizations.", "What will you be tracking in 2019?
