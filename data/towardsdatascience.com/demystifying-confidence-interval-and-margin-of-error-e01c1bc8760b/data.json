The margin of error for the survey is 3 at 95 per cent confidence level. More than 20,000 interviews were conducted globally for this survey.", "I tried to find more about the Confidence Interval and Margin of Error but they seem to be quite hard to understand for someone without in-depth knowledge of statistics. The challenge is most of the explanations rely on a lot of jargon which a layman might not know about.", "In this article, I would try to explain the concepts margin of error and confidence intervals without too much mathematics and fancy statistics terms.", "Let say a news agency is trying to figure out what percentage of the population would vote for a political party A in the upcoming election. As it is almost impossible to interview the entire population, they randomly select a sample of say 100 people. Out of those 100 people interviewed, 43 are willing to vote for A.", "Let\u2019s convert the problem in mathematical terms. We are going to say, sampling someone who is going to vote for A is equivalent to sampling 1, and sampling someone who is not going to vote for A is equivalent to sampling 0. It means that out of those 100 samples 43 are 1 and the remaining 57 are 0.", "Here you might wonder why the denominator for calculating the standard deviation is n-1 instead of n. This is done using Bessel Correction to remove the bias in the estimation of the population variance. Refer here for more information.", "For a population with mean \u03bc_p(not known)and standard deviation \u03c3_p(not known), the Central limit theorem tells us the following:", "Important side note: The above estimate would only hold if our samples are random i.e. they represent the whole population.", "To calculate \u03c3_x, we need the standard deviation of the population(\u03c3_p) which is unknown. Instead, we estimate \u03c3_p using the standard deviation of the sample(\u03c3_s) after removing the bias using Bessel correction.", "From the above distribution, let\u2019s find an interval i.e. a range of values that we can be 95% certain contains the true population mean(\u03bc_p, whose value is the same as the mean of the sampling distribution(\u03bc_s)). It is not quite correct to say that there is a 95% chance that the population mean(\u03bc_p) lies within the interval. The population mean(\u03bc_p) has a fixed value which we don\u2019t know. If we repeatedly perform the same experiment, it wouldn\u2019t change the value of the population mean(\u03bc_p). Therefore it isn\u2019t correct to ask about the probability that the population mean(\u03bc_p) lies within a certain range. In contrast, the confidence interval we compute depends on the sample collected. If we repeat the experiment, the confidence interval would almost certainly be different. So we should ask about the probability that the interval contains the population mean.", "A 95% confidence interval simply means, out of repeated random samples, there is a 95% chance that the true population mean(\u03bc_p)lies within the interval.", "Confidence interval is the most widely used method of interval estimation in frequentist statistics and is often confused with credible interval, an analogous concept in Bayesian statistics. Refer here for a more technical explanation of the differences: What\u2019s the difference between a confidence interval and a credible interval?", "Let\u2019s now find the value of z such that the area of the shaded region is 0.95. z is the number of standard deviations away from the sample mean, also known as the critical value.", "Formulas for calculating CIs take the general form:", "CI = Sample mean \u00b1 z value \u00d7 Standard error of the mean (SEM)", "CI = Sample mean \u00b1 z value \u00d7 (Standard deviation/\u221an)", "If we are calculating the 95% CI of the mean, the z value to be used would be 1.96.", "The above statement can be interpreted as \u201cWe\u2019re 95% confident that the interval between 0.332(0.43\u20130.098) and 0.528(0.43+0.098), capture the true mean proportion of the population that would vote for A.\u201d This implies that were the sampling process to be repeated over and over with random samples from the same population, then 95% of the calculated intervals would be expected to contain the true value.", "We shouldn\u2019t say there is a 95% chance that the true mean of the population(\u03bc_p) is between 0.332 and 0.528 , because it implies that the mean may be within this interval, or it may be somewhere else. This makes it seem as if the population mean is variable, but it\u2019s not. This interval either captured the mean or didn\u2019t. Intervals change from sample to sample, but the population parameter we\u2019re trying to capture does not.", "A 95% CI does not mean that 95% of the sample data lie within that interval. A CI is not a range of plausible values for the sample, rather it is an interval estimate of plausible values for the population parameter.", "In the first experiment, I randomly selected 1000 samples with a sample size of 5, and 95.5% of the time our confidence interval contains the true parameter. One important thing to note that if we want our interval to be narrower we need to increase the sample size as it is inversely proportional to the square root of the sample size.", "I hope the terms confidence interval and margin of error will no longer be a foreign concept.
