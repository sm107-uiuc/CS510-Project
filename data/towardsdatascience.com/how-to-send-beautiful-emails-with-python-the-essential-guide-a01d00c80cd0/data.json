For example, you might want to manage a mailing list without paying monthly fees, or use it to notify you when something breaks in production code. Today you\u2019ll learn how to easily send beautiful emails \u2014 to multiple recipients. Attachments included.", "To achieve this, we\u2019ll use Python\u2019s smtplib. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, for you nerds out there. It is a simple library that allows us to send emails. We\u2019ll also use the email library for formatting purposes. Both are built into Python, so there\u2019s no need to install anything.", "If you are more of a video person, I have a treat for you:", "It\u2019s a lot to cover, so let\u2019s get straight to it.", "I\u2019m assuming you have two-factor authentication enabled on your Gmail account. If not, you should. We\u2019ll have to generate a password that Python script will use to log into your account and send emails.", "It\u2019s a straightforward step to do. Just click on this URL, and you\u2019ll be presented with a screen like this:", "You won\u2019t see the \u201cPython Email\u201d row, however. Just click on the Select app dropdown, and then on Other (Custom name). Enter a name (arbitrary), and click on the Generate button.", "That\u2019s it! A modal window like this will pop up:", "Just make to save the password somewhere safe.", "You can now open up a code editor (or notebook) and create a Python file. Here are the library imports and variable declarations for email and password:", "Keep in mind \u2014 EMAIL_ADDRESS variable should contain your actual email address, and the EMAIL_PASSWORD should contain the app password generated seconds ago. There is a more robust and secure way to do this \u2013 with environment variables, but that\u2019s beyond the scope of this article.", "You\u2019re ready to send your first email now.", "Here\u2019s the part you\u2019ve been waiting for. A couple of steps are required before you can send emails, and those are listed below:", "It sounds like a lot of work, but it boils down to less than ten code lines. Here\u2019s the snippet:", "As you can see, I\u2019ve set the From and To fields to the same value. It\u2019s not something you would usually do, but is essential for testing purposes. And here\u2019s the email I\u2019ve received seconds after:", "Let\u2019s see how to send emails to multiple recipients next.", "If you understood the previous section, you\u2019ll understand this one. There\u2019s only a single thing you have to change.", "In the msg['To'], instead of specifying an email address you want to send to (as with the previous example), you will have to specify a list of emails.", "Can you spot the difference? Sending to multiple recipients is easier than expected, as you don\u2019t have to iterate through the list manually. Let\u2019s continue with the email attachments.", "Sending attachments is a bit weird until you get the gist of it. You have to open every attachment with Python\u2019s with open syntax, and use the add_attachment method from the EmailMessage class to, well, add it.", "In the example below, this method was used to send a PDF document. Here\u2019s the code:", "And here\u2019s the email I\u2019ve got a couple of seconds later:", "Awesome! Let\u2019s see how to create customized emails next!", "You can cross inbound from your list if you intend to send pure textual, unstyled, and otherwise ugly emails. That\u2019s where HTML and CSS come into play.", "Code-wise it\u2019s nearly identical thing as in the previous section. The only difference is the email content. This time you\u2019ll use the set_content method from the EmailMessage class to write the HTML. CSS styles are set inline.", "Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve managed to design in a couple of minutes:", "Not great, but an improvement from what we had before. And that\u2019s just enough for today. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "Sending emails in Python is easy. Gmail configuration enables you to send them right from your machine \u2014 there\u2019s no need to upload anything to a live server. And that\u2019s great if you ask me. A couple of years ago, when I first started sending emails through PHP, the localhost was not an option (according to my experience).", "You have seen a bunch of new concepts today \u2014 from sending emails to front-end technologies. It\u2019s just enough to get you started, and the web is full of more advanced guides.", "Join my private email list for more helpful insights.", "Loved the article?
