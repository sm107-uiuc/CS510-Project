Even the COVID-19 pandemic, which has curtailed international travel, has led to increasing virtual interaction via the internet. Yet the barriers to fluent and proficient inter-language communications remain formidable.", "The quality of machine translation has improved dramatically in recent years, thanks to the introduction of Artificial Intelligence methods such as neural networks to the task. The AI-driven optimization of translating has trickled down rapidly to consumer apps like Google Translate and Microsoft Translator, which simplify the usage of machine translators and improve the ability to convey meaning across linguistic frontiers.", "There\u2019s a huge difference between translating a language via software and learning a new language. For most adults, learning a new language is hard. But some people love linguistic challenges: for them, the hardest languages to learn may be the most enjoyable to conquer. The neuroplasticity of young brains, of course, makes new language acquisition a relative snap for children. But few adults have it so easy.", "Online language learning, now a $582 billion/year industry according to the ICEF, has made more convenient and easier the learning of a new language for millions. English language learning accounts for most of this total. While the popularity of English may not be surprising \u2014 it is the most spoken language and the main language of business worldwide \u2014 proficient English speakers are branching out to additional languages at a rapid pace.", "Rosetta Stone, a leading provider of language courses, reports that Spanish topped the list of languages that British people were most eager to take on in 2018, with 23.1% of its UK learners learning the language last year. Four other European languages \u2014 French, English, Italian and German \u2014 rounded off the top five. Perhaps surprisingly, Mandarin Chinese, the most popular native language, with more than a million, was not in the next tier.", "No doubt the perception of that language\u2019s difficulty played a role in its relatively low popularity ranking. Mandarin Chinese, poses major hardships for a non-Chinese speaker. And yet more than a 1.1 billion speaking, read, write and understand it fluently. So is it really hard? Or is it just unfamiliar to an English speaker? The question raises a major challenge: isn\u2019t the perception of difficulty a totally relative matter, differing to some degree for each language learner, depending on background and education.", "The challenge that faces a data scientist, of course, is how can language difficulty be measured. If we wish to split hairs, there is a distinction between the difficulty of learning a language and its inherent difficulty of usage. But for purposes of this article, we will focus on the task of evaluating a way to measure a language\u2019s degree of difficulty, if we can borrow a term from the language of gymnastics and other competitive sports.", "Nearly a decade ago, Voxy posted an infographic (shown below), sourced from the Foreign Service Institute, which breaks language difficulty for native English speakers into three neat categories: easy, medium, and hard. The basis for comparison was how long \u2014 in terms of calendar weeks and learning hours, attaining \u201cproficiency\u201d would be required for different languages. The site did qualify its findings by noting that difficulty depended on language complexity, how close it was to the learner\u2019s own language (in this case, English), how many learning hours per week, and the language resources available. It appears from the chart that the basic assumption of 25 hours of learning per week.", "While Voxy clearly intends the chart to be a teaching tool or subject of discussion, it\u2019s not hard to pick apart weaknesses in its analytical method. First, who is to set the bar of \u201cproficiency\u201d? And how to measure the quality of instruction? How to account for factor-like second-language knowledge? For a data scientist, the results would appear disappointingly arbitrary.", "A more intriguing approach to the problem, at least from a data science perspective, is offered by linguist Michael Campbell at Glossika. In a detailed blog post aptly titled \u201cLanguage Difficulty,\u201d he devised a scoring system for answering, numerically, the precise questions which intrigue us:", "Distinguishing Campbell\u2019s approach is its relativistic data-based approach. Language difficulty is based on the relative similarity between any two languages according to various criteria of linguistic complexity. Perhaps counter-intuitively, this approach actually makes an objective assessment of language learning difficulty possible, because it is based on numerical criteria that can be objectively assessed. Among the criteria he offers are:", "This he considered with respect to how close the language is to the learner\u2019s language.", "Languages are divided into families, branches, and sub-branches. For example, English belongs to the Indo-European Proto-language, to which languages like Russian, Armenia, and Greek all belong. By contrast, Arabic, Chinese, and Japanese would be in a different family. Within the Indo-European grouping, that branch, English is a Germanic-Romance language, therefore closer to languages like German and French. In terms of similarity, English is closest in any way to German, despite grammatical differences. Similarly, Portuguese, Spanish and Italian would belong to the same sub-branch, making language-learning easier. Campbell assigns high importance to this criterion, with language-learning difficulty reflected in exponentially higher numbers. Same sub-branch branch: 0 points. Different sub-branch: 1 point. Different branches: 10 points. Different family: 100 points.", "Campbell, a linguist by profession. broke down into a list of factors, such as", "For each of these criteria, Campbell assigns 1 point plus or minus if there is a difference between languages. The results of his calculation are rendered in a matrix:", "By comparing rows in this matrix, he can assign a score to the syntactical and grammatical differences between two languages and thus the difficulty of learning from a given language. The difficulty score for a German speaker learning French would be 6 points, a Japanese speaker learning Spanish 13 points, and a Chinese speaker learning Polish a whopping 34 points.", "Campbell\u2019s calculations account for the difference in total phonemes (written sounds) and allophones (the sounds people say), considering 12 points of articulation and the number of vowels and intonations.", "According to this matrix, comparing rows enables you to calculate language difficulty as related to these phonological criteria. The difficulty score for a German speaker learning French would be 1 point, a Japanese speaker learning Spanish 11 points, and a Chinese speaker learning Polish a whopping 15 points.", "Data scientists will note that the scores assigned for various parameters are arbitrary and subjective, but there is merit in the attempt to break down degrees of difficulty into component factors.", "For example, for an English speaker, the following are the score assignments according to language family:", "It is hard to reconcile a 0 score in German (So einfach ist das?) with a score of 5 in French or Spanish. And is Georgian really 10 times harder to acquire vocabulary than Polish? So the specific enumeration is certainly open to fine-turning, though the method is intriguing \u2014 if a bit rough around the edges.", "His 2016 article concluded with a list of some of the most difficult languages. He mentioned, in this connection, the Romany language of European gypsies, which are not even written down, and Sentinelese, the language of the Pacific island where wannabe visitors are killed on arrival, polysynthetic languages like Greenlandic, and Ubykh, with no less than 84 consonants. Honorable mention goes to Bella Coola, a language is only written down by linguists to record the grammar.", "Two years later, Campbell wrote a follow-up piece applying his scoring system and setting it against the FSI rankings.", "Non-linguists may be nonplussed by the dismissive way the author chalks up Thai, Vietnamese, Turkish and Finnish as \u201ceasy\u201d \u2014 except, he hastens to say, for their utterly unfamiliar vocabularies. He confesses surprise that, per his ranking system, Korean beats out Taiwanese in difficulty. But he credits Ubykh, an extinct Circassian language, as leaving even Korean in the dust.", "Here you can learn Ubykh numbers and listen to a tale of futility that should appeal to every data scientist \u2014 in any language.", "Your home for data science.
