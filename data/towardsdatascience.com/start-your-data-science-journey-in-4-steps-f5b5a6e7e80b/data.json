I was posting letters for Royal Mail and curious as ever to learn a skill that didn\u2019t require me to physically exert myself. The thought of programming did come to mind, but I didn\u2019t think I was smart enough \u2014 by trade I am an athlete after all and did not have proper formal education after High School (unless you want to include my Level 3 Coaching badge and BTEC in sports).", "Just under 2 years on, I have received what I deem to be a major achievement in my journey: I am now a Top writer in Artificial Intelligence on Medium.", "After initially being filled with joy, my mind switched and before I knew it I was reflecting on where I have come from\u2026", "Every major action that I have taken has come as a response to a difficult situation, but it does not have to be that way!", "I sucked up my fear of programming, and the fact I hadn\u2019t done an inch of math in 5+ years no longer concerned me, however, that was only because I had lost my job as a Postman \u2014 I had no other option. I began my Medium journey in December 2019, but only started posting regularly because the Covid-19 outbreak left me furloughed \u2014 I needed to do something productive with my time or I\u2019d just be bored at home until I am wanted back at work (if I am wanted back that is).", "Realising that my reactive approach to life is unnecessarily strenuous, I\u2019ve made a decision to be proactive and hope to make a mark in the Data Science field.", "You don\u2019t need to be like me! If you are reading this now then you have an opportunity to decide to be proactive today! On that note, I aim to provide you with the tools that have helped me to reach where I am now so that you can kickstart your career.", "Don\u2019t wait for opportunities, create them! \u2014 Kurtis Pykes", "We often see prerequisites to become a Data Scientist, how daunting are they; Mastery of Statistics, Linear algebra, Calculus, Programming, Machine learning, etc (The list does not stop).", "Am I saying that these skills are unnecessary? Heck no! You will need to have knowledge of programming and the ability to work with data using the programming language of your choice, but only basic understanding of mathematics is enough to begin your journey.", "Note: Remember this post is about beginning your career", "Using an excerpt from Dataquest let\u2019s define Data Science:", "It\u2019s the process of asking interesting questions, and then answering those questions using data. Generally speaking, the data science workflow looks like this:", "It\u2019s easy to get caught up in trying to learn everything before getting started, I will tell you from experience that this will be an uphill battle that you cannot win \u2014 I am yet to find someone to prove me wrong about this, if it is you, leave a response. To develop as a Data Scientist, yes you\u2019d need more mathematical fluency and other specialized skills but at the start of your journey you want to focus on building the necessary skills to allow you to get your foot in the door.", "One of the debates of the century, Python vs R. My choice was Python when I started learning to program and that is only because it was the only language I had heard about when I first started learning to programme in 2018.", "If I were to pick which is better to learn first today, I\u2019d say pick the one that is easier for you to grasp because they are both very good choices with many packages to support the Data Science workflow. In other words, expose yourself to both and decide which you find easier.", "You don\u2019t need to become Dan Bader (Python programming expert). Your focus should be geared towards understanding data types, data structures, syntax, functions, conditional statements, comparisons, comprehensions, loops and modules. The rest you can learn as time goes on.", "Note: I apologise to R users as I can only refer things that I have personally used and found useful.", "The Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to Python \u2014 https://docs.python-guide.org/", "The extent of Math skill that you require is totally dependent on the role that you wish to go for \u2014 If you are just starting out, it is most likely you will be going for a Junior/Intern role. On that basis, the math you require is definitely less than you think. As I started learning math, I thought it was pretty fun and decided to learn the whole A-Level syllabus, but I can assure you, you don\u2019t need to do that and it is very time-consuming.", "Considering that you have a good intuition of the math and know how to code then you are fine. You know enough to get a role as a Junior Data Scientist or Intern \u2014 upon getting the role, it is down to you to go deeper into the math and build up your mathematical skills that will allow you to progress your career further.", "It\u2019s important that you set a time of when you will stop focusing on Math \u2014 target around 2\u20133 months depending on how quickly you grasp things.

Additionally, you\u2019d of built a good foundation in the necessary Math, so what\u2019s left is to learn Machine Learning.", "Many people go straight to deep learning, which I personally don\u2019t think is the best thing to do since many fundamental concepts in deep learning stem from Machine Learning. With that being said, you\u2019d want to learn some Machine learning algorithms, here\u2019s 5 that I\u2019d say to start with:", "Note: Wikipedia and Cross-Validated stack exchange are a good place to start for the above algorithms.", "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow \u2014 https://amzn.to/2ZESDEp", "Introduction to Machine Learning with Python \u2014 https://amzn.to/32oj6I5", "Machine Learning (by Andrew Ng) | Coursera \u2014 https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning", "Deep Learning Specialization (by Andrew Ng) | Coursera \u2014 https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning", "Note: The Machine Learning course is in Matlab, you may want to reproduce it in your chosen language as this will also be good practice for developing your programming skills as well as intuition.", "Do not ever stop learning!
