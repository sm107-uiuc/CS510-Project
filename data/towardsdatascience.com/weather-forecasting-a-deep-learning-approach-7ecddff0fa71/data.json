Unfavorable weather could devastate the food we eat, the businesses we rely on, and the well-being we depend on. It is imperative, therefore, to forecast weather in an accurate and timely fashion so that we can take the necessary precautions to minimize weather-associated risks.", "In this article, we are going to take a look into how weather, specifically of rainfall, can be predicted in advance using 10-year daily precipitation records from Indonesia\u2019s 70+ weather stations spread across the archipelago. We are going to build a Long-Short Term Network (LSTM)-based model.", "An LSTM is generally used favorably for time-series data (such as our precipitation datasets) as it is able to \u2018remember\u2019 long-term dependencies/information from a feature called cell state. This cell state runs across the networks and passes down (or up) information such that earlier information from a sequence, for instance, could influence prediction of later input. This passing of information is crucial for time-series weather data where each input is dependent on other input from varying time points.", "The information that is stored, removed, modified, and passed around is controlled by gates. The general architecture of an LSTM model is demonstrated in Figure 1 below. This article will assume reader\u2019s familiarity with LSTM and will not go to the specific detail of the network\u2019s architecture. If you want to learn more, you can visit this good and simplified introduction to LSTM.", "Now that we have our basic network explained, let\u2019s begin by importing the datasets. You can find a cleaned-up version of our rainfall CSV data here.", "The summary of the CSV can be seen in Figure 2 below.", "We will then proceed by splitting the training and testing set in a 90:10 ratio.", "Our idea would be to predict 5 days into the future, using 30 days worth of data in the past. To do this we would need to create a collection of training data by which the x-values will be a 30-day windowed data and the corresponding y-value as the subsequent rainfall data in the next 5 days.", "After generating the x\u2019s and y\u2019s for the training set, we will ensure that the data type is correct, and that the shape fits the model\u2019s requirement.", "Now that we have our training set, we will define our predictors utilizing the LSTM architecture. We have the following:", "Now that the model has been trained for 500 epochs, we are ready to make inferences on the prepared test set.", "If we sample the 30 days in our sample datasets, the predicted result and its corresponding real temperature will be printed as follow:", "Our initial predictor seems to not perform as well to extreme precipitation level (eg. 47mm). Some improvements could be made by:", "In conclusion, the use of LSTM as an improved RNN-based architecture is interesting in the case of weather forecasting (in general, time-series datasets). And being able to perform weather forecasting in a timely and efficient manner is not only beneficial, but is critical to the masses who directly or indirectly rely on good weather.", "Note: The data provided in this article has been cleaned and combined into a single CSV.
