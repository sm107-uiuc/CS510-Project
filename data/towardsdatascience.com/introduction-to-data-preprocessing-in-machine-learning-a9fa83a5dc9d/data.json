It doesn\u2019t really matter whether it is a regression, classification or any other kind of problem, no model can handle these NULL or NaN values on its own so we need to intervene.", "In python NULL is reprsented with NaN. So don\u2019t get confused between these two,they can be used interchangably.", "First of all, we need to check whether we have null values in our dataset or not. We can do that using the isnull() method.", "There are various ways for us to handle this problem. The easiest way to solve this problem is by dropping the rows or columns that contain null values.", "dropna() takes various parameters like \u2014", "However, it is not the best option to remove the rows and columns from our dataset as it can result in significant information loss. If you have 300K data points then removing 2\u20133 rows won\u2019t affect your dataset much but if you only have 100 data points and out of which 20 have NaN values for a particular field then you can\u2019t simply drop those rows. In real-world datasets, it can happen quite often that you have a large number of NaN values for a particular field.", "Ex \u2014 Suppose we are collecting the data from a survey, then it is possible that there could be an optional field which let\u2019s say 20% of people left blank. So when we get the dataset then we need to understand that the remaining 80% of data is still useful, so rather than dropping these values we need to somehow substitute the missing 20% values. We can do this with the help of Imputation.", "Imputation is simply the process of substituting the missing values of our dataset. We can do this by defining our own customised function or we can simply perform imputation by using the SimpleImputer class provided by sklearn.", ".values used here return a numpy representation of the data frame. Only the values in the data frame will be returned, the axes labels will be removed.", "It is another integral preprocessing step. In Standardization, we transform our values such that the mean of the values is 0 and the standard deviation is 1.", "Consider the above data frame, here we have 2 numerical values: Age and Weight. They are not on the same scale as Age is in years and Weight is in Kg and since Weight is more likely to greater than Age; therefore, our model will give more weightage to Weight, which is not the ideal scenario as Age is also an integral factor here. In order to avoid this issue, we perform Standardization.", "So in simple terms, we just calculate the mean and standard deviation of the values and then for each data point we just subtract the mean and divide it by standard deviation.", "Consider the column Age from Dataframe 1. In order to standardize this column, we need to calculate the mean and standard deviation and then we will transform each value of age using the above formula.", "We don\u2019t need to do this process manually as sklearn provides a function called StandardScaler.", "The important thing to note here is that we need to standardize both training and testing data.", "Another important thing to note here is that we will use only the transform method when dealing with the test data.", "Handling categorical variables is another integral aspect of Machine Learning. Categorical variables are basically the variables that are discrete and not continuous. Ex \u2014 color of an item is a discrete variable whereas its price is a continuous variable.", "Categorical variables are further divided into 2 types \u2014", "The important thing to note here is that we need to preprocess ordinal and nominal categorical variables differently.", "First of all, we need to create a dataframe.", "Here the columns \u2018size\u2019 and \u2018classlabel\u2019 are ordinal categorical variables whereas \u2018color\u2019 is a nominal categorical variable.", "There are 2 pretty simple and neat techniques to transform ordinal CVs.", "Here M will be replaced with 1 and L with 2.", "Here class1 will be represented with 0 and class2 with 1 .", "The biggest mistake that most people make is that they are not able to differentiate between ordinal and nominal CVs.So if you use the same map() function or LabelEncoder with nominal variables then the model will think that there is some sort of relationship between the nominal CVs.", "So if we use map() to map the colors like -", "Then according to the model, Green > Blue, which is a senseless assumption and the model will give you results considering this relationship. So, although you will get the results using this method they won\u2019t be optimal.", "The correct way of handling nominal CVs is to use One-Hot Encoding. The easiest way to use One-Hot Encoding is to use the get_dummies() function.", "Here we have passed \u2018size\u2019 and \u2018price\u2019 along with \u2018color\u2019 but the get_dummies() function is pretty smart and will consider only the string variables. So it will just transform the \u2018color\u2019 variable.", "Now, you must be wondering what the hell is this One-Hot Encoding. So let\u2019s try and understand it.", "So in One-Hot Encoding what we essentially do is that we create \u2019n\u2019 columns where n is the number of unique values that the nominal variable can take.", "Ex \u2014 Here if color can take Blue,Green and White then we will just create three new columns namely \u2014 color_blue,color_green and color_white and if the color is green then the values of color_blue and color_white column will be 0 and value of color_green column will be 1 .", "So out of the n columns, only one column can have value = 1 and the rest all will have value = 0.", "One-Hot Encoding is a pretty cool and neat hack but there is only one problem associated with it and that is Multicollinearity. As you all must have assumed that it is a pretty heavy word so it must be difficult to understand, so let me just validate your newly formed belief. Multicollinearity is indeed a slightly tricky but extremely important concept of Statistics. The good thing here is that we don\u2019t really need to understand all the nitty-gritty details of multicollinearity, rather we just need to focus on how it will impact our model. So let\u2019s dive into this concept of Multicollinearity and how it will impact our model.", "Multicollinearity occurs in our dataset when we have features that are strongly dependent on each other. Ex- In this case we have features -", "color_blue,color_green and color_white which are all dependent on each other and it can impact our model.", "If we have multicollinearity in our dataset then we won\u2019t be able to use our weight vector to calculate the feature importance.", "Multicollinearity impacts the interpretability of our model.", "I think this much information is enough in the context of Machine Learning however if you are still not convinced, then you can visit the below link to understand the maths and logic associated with Multicollinearity.", "Now that we have understood what Multicollinearity is, let\u2019s now try to understand how to identify it.", "Here (Weight, BP) and (BSA, BP) are closely related. You can also use the correlation matrix to check how closely related the features are.", "We can observe that there is a strong co-relation (0.950) between Weight and BP and also between BSA and BP (0.875).", "We can use drop_first=True in order to avoid the problem of Multicollinearity.", "Here drop_first will drop the first column of color. So here color_blue will be dropped and we will only have color_green and color_white.", "The important thing to note here is that we don\u2019t lose any information because if color_green and color_white are both 0 then it implies that the color must have been blue. So we can infer the whole information with the help of only these 2 columns, hence the strong correlation between these three columns is broken.", "And with that, we have come to the end of this article.
