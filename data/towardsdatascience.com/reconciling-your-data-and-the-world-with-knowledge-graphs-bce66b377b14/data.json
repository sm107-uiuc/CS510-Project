In the age of data, one would think that the task of incorporating knowledge would be easier than ever.", "However, the three Vs-volume, velocity and veracity of data-make the task anything but easy. What is an effective way to accomplish the same?", "Graphical representation of knowledge has been around for decades now, dating back to the 1960s.", "In our previous article, we talked about graph tech (databases, processing, and visualization). We also explored how it solves multiple pain points that impede data-driven initiatives from operating at high efficiency.", "A key point in the rise of graph tech was Google unveiling its knowledge graph (KG) back in 2012.", "Some of the biggest technology companies have knowledge graphs (KG) at their core. In 2018, Gartner included KGs in the technology hype cycle.", "Despite prominent academic and industry examples, there is a lot of confusion around the term knowledge graph. The 2016 paper \u201c Towards a definition of knowledge graphs \u201c explored this dilemma and tried to provide a definition.", "You can also find other reasonable definitions online. Building upon these definitions, here\u2019s my attempt to provide one:", "A knowledge graph is made of a graph data store coupled with a knowledge toolkit. It stores a domain\u2019s data as entities and relationships using a graph model, which abides by an ontology.The knowledge toolkit supports continuous integration of data from multiple sources, allows end-users to query the graph effectively, and draws inferences from existing information.", "Think of ontology as loosely being a schema for graph data. This isn\u2019t entirely accurate, but it is a helpful way to start. A domain\u2019s ontology defines its members (entities, relationships) and their properties in a way that resembles the real world. Read more about it here.\u200b", "Also, the toolkit mentioned above can provide a host of advanced features such as semantic search and Machine Learning (ML) capabilities. My definition covers just the bare minimum.", "When Google introduced KGs, they wrote a blog that mentioned how KGs allowed users to search through \u201cthings, not strings\u201d. Graphs, being closer to our mental models, make it easy to describe your data as real-world objects.", "A KG comes with the usual advantages of graph tech. That means freedom from expensive join operations, whiteboard-friendly data models, effective handling of sparse data, and access to handy algorithms such as PageRank. Graphs can also help improve the current state of ML. In particular, graph neural networks have been in the news lately.", "Now, throw in a robust knowledge toolkit and you get:", "Moreover, a KG acts as a shared source of truth and a common interface for multiple teams and even entire organizations. For example, an ML model using data from numerous departments needs to query the KG\u2019s entities and relationships rather than data from multiple silos (warehouses, lakes, and RDBMSes).", "You may often find knowledge graphs and semantic web mentioned in the same context. For some time, semantic web technology and standards were synonymous with KGs. That\u2019s not the case now.", "Notice how the definition above says nothing about specific standards.", "Building your graph using semantic web standards offers advantages, including easy integration with many public knowledge bases published using the same standards. However, the associated complexity and steep learning curve may make it harder and less useful.", "Either of the following methods can provide access to a KG:", "Successful examples exist across industries, academia and public domain.", "The GDelt project is a real-time global open data graph. It continuously extracts information from news media across the world.", "Knowledge graphs are used across different industries and their use cases may differ in their capabilities. But the core challenges they face in implementing a useful knowledge toolkit are the same.", "At Atlan, we\u2019ve been working towards tackling data democratization for data teams around the world. We deal with exciting challenges daily, including the ones listed above. Stay tuned to hear about our experiences soon.", "Connected data is more important than ever. Being able to bring together silos effectively is critical for extracting value out of your data. Knowledge graphs provide a great way to do the same. It can empower stakeholders ranging from business users (improved data discovery) to data scientists (better ML models).", "Going about building and operating a knowledge graph does come with challenges. But an effective toolkit to do so can help you navigate the challenges.", "If you want to understand whether KGs suit your use case or have a question, please leave a comment. \ud83d\ude42", "Below are some references that helped me when researching for this post:", "Originally published at https://humansofdata.atlan.com on August 22, 2019", "Thanks for the read.
