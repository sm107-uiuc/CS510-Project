Many people think of it as a message bus that moves messages from one place to another. Surely it is true but in reality it is more than that.", "Kafka is an open source, distributed event streaming platform, which can handle all of the data and all of the events within the entire system. It is a platform on which real time applications can be built and it can integrate different systems together driven by the power of events.", "It streams records in a fault tolerant, durable way, providing backpressure, integration points and decoupling source system from sink system. These features combined with flexible architecture make Kafka a powerful tool that guarantees high performance and low latency.", "Kafka is built based on publish-subscribe pattern which enables an application to announce messages to multiple interested consumers asynchronously, without coupling the senders to the receivers. Kafka is run as a cluster on one or multiple servers, which made easy to meet the guarantees that are given by the creators of Kafka.", "This (kind-of) formal/general concept of Kafka architecture might seem overwhelming. Therefore, the core concept of kafka has been introduced in the next chapter.", "In the \u201cold\u201d days information was stored in the databases. This approach made developers to understand programming in terms of things (i.e ticket, truck, camera). Each single thing had its state that had been stored in the DB.", "Lately, some people has proposed to understand programming in terms of events. Each event has its state (like a \u201cthing\u201d stored in DB), but also has a description of what happened and indication in time that the \u201cthing\u201d took place.", "Storing events in a DB may seem to be a good reconciling of the past with the present, however it it a bit inconvenient. Instead of it, structure called \u201cLog\u201d has been suggested. Once an event happens is write into a log. Which mean that a Log is ordered sequence of events.", "Logs are easy to think about. They are also easy to built at scale, which historically has not entirely been a true with databases. Apache Kafka is a system (or platform) for managing this logs, having a bunch of advanced features from which a part of has been already mentioned.", "In the past, when the databases ruled the world of programming it was very popular to build a single gigantic application that uses a single database. This approach was reasonable and common for many reasons. However with the time, the complexity of these applications have grown. They have become difficult to think, understand and finally to change.", "At present, there is a tendency to write a lots of small programs, each one of which is small enough to think about, change and evolve. This programs can communicate to each other through log oriented broker.", "Each service can consume a message from a given log, perform some computation or process a message and produce the result into a log (or i.e a database). The output can be durably (and even permanently) recorded there for other applications in the system.", "Now you should got a decent idea of the key concept behind kafka. In addition you should have a real understanding not only what kafka is but also the kind of approach to building a software that kafka tends to give a rise to.", "You have already know that kafka helps with moving data between a source and a sink system. Let\u2019s dive into some essentials of Apache Kafka.", "A single, individual piece of data is called a message. While the message is being send, Kafka is indexing it and is placing it in the appropriate a topic.", "Topics are a particular streams of data (you can imagine them as a table in RDBMS, but without relations and constraints). Each topic is identified by its name and is splited into partitions. Each partition has identify number. This numbers start at 0 and go to n-1 where the n is amount of partitions within a given topic.", "Partitions are ordered and immutable sequences of messages. Each partition is acting independently of all other partitions, this means that there is no ordering between partitions created within one topic. They can also work as a unit of parallelism when there is a need to balance the load. Each message in the partition have a sequential id number called offset that uniquely identifies each message inside the partition.", "Now, when you know what kafka is, how it works and what is behind the scene the best thing you can do is to use this knowledge in practise. In addition, having known some key definitions, like messages, topics, partitions and offsets, you can read about more advanced aspects of kafka like producers, consumers, delivery semantics or internals of kafka cluster.", "Some sources which may help you to explore kafka has been attached into this article. If you want to learn more about kafka in general its documentation is the best place. When you are aiming into more detailed information \u201cKafka \u2014 The Definitive Guide\u201d should fit to your demands. Finally if your goal is to find out more about the concept of logs the third position - \u201cI Heart Logs: Event Data, Stream Processing and Data Integration\u201d will be the best source of knowledge.", "[2] Kafka: The Definitive Guide | Neha Narkhede, Gwen Shapira, Todd Palino | O\u2019Reilly Media, Inc. | 01 November 2017", "[3] I Heart Logs: Event Data, Stream Processing, and Data Integration | Jay Kreps | O\u2019Reilly Media, Inc. | 23 september 2014", "Your home for data science.
