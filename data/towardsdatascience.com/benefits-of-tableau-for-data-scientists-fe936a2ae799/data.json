If you are not familiar with Tableau, it is essentially a tool that is widely used by several different types of people in their respective careers. You can visualize data and share it with others so you can see how it is not only beneficial to a Data Scientist, but also to a Product Manager, SQL Developer, Data Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst, and many more \u2014 the list goes on and on. But, the real question is, what makes this tool specifically useful for Data Scientists? Below, I will be discussing some general benefits that Data Scientists can reap, but also some more contoured Data Science tools and benefits of utilizing Tableau.", "As a more broad benefit, Tableau can be quite quick and simple to use. If you have a CSV file ready, you can create a dashboard in minutes. This dashboard will include several sheets of different visualizations whether that be a map, chart, or table (etc.). You can essentially drag and drop fields into your sheet and select a visualization \u2014 it really is as simple as that. Now let us talk about how we can incorporate some programming languages.", "You can either choose a static CSV file or live connection through a SQL database where you update the same query to update your data and its respective sheets, dashboards, and stories connected to it.", "As a Data Scientist, you will become familiar with SQL, or structured query language. In order to develop your dataset for your Data Science model, you will need to query from a database using SQL (most likely). Tableau makes it easy to connect to your current SQL database so that you can perform the query within Tableau and then develop reports from there. For Data Science, this feature can be useful when you need to do the following:", "You can import R packages as well as their associated libraries. More powerful, you can also import your saved data models into Tableau.", "Also known as TabPy, this integration of Tableau allows users to use a framework that can remotely execute Python code. Some of the main usages are for data cleaning and predictive algorithms (and the use of calculated fields). Here is a useful link for TabPy [3]:", "For deploying models from MATLAB, you can utilize this integration. It includes use in predictive insights, as well as preprocessing data.", "Of course, all of these integrations and languages can be used for data analysis as part of your Data Science process. Additionally, the results you develop from your predictive models can be displayed in Tableau.", "You can use Machine Learning algorithms from Tableau itself. This clustering algorithm is also known as k-means. The idea is to find patterns in your data by grouping similar data together from its features. You also want to make sure that those same groups are different from other groups. The technical terms for this grouping include the within-group sum of squares (WGSS) and between-group sum of squares (BGSS). All you have to do in Tableau is load your data, then pick your columns and rows, while isolating the variables that you want to build your clustering off of. You can either automatically create clusters based on metrics, or you can manually force the number of clusters.", "Since Tableau focuses on visualization, your clusters will be well labeled, interactive, and colorized for easy viewing and easier understanding.", "The benefit of utilizing this popular algorthim in Tableau is that it performs it fairly quickly and does not require any code on your part.", "Here is a link that describes clustering in Tableau in more detail [4]:", "Perhaps the most important benefit of Tableau for Data Scientists is that you can use the tool for its main function \u2014 to share data visually. As a Data Scientist, you may encounter different types of people in different types of departments within your company. It is your job to be able to explain your complex Machine Learning algorthim and its respective results to others. One of the best ways to do that is to visualize it. You can use any of the charts to describe your model results \u2014 whether you made improvements to the business, which groups of your data performed better, etc. There are countless use cases of Tableau in Data Science. Here are some of the advantages of Tableau in Data Science.", "As you can see, there are several main benefits of Tableau for many different roles, but also for Data Scientists. Whether you want to simply drag and drop your data to create simple exploratory data analysis, or create a model from scratch within Tableau, it serves as a wholistic tool for the whole Data Science process.", "To sum, here are the benefits laid out and summarized:", "Thank you for reading! I appreciate it. Please feel free to comment down below and write about your experience with Tableau as any user or as a Data Scientist.", "Your home for data science.
