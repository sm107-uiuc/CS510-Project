I mentioned in that article that choosing the right test and control groups is critical for success. Given its importance, the topic deserves a more detailed look into the best practices and pitfalls that will help you achieve the best test design.", "So you\u2019ve come up with the next great idea for your company, and you have the common sense to not just throw caution to the wind and run with it, but instead, you want to test-and-learn. Who will be a part of the test? This is the critical question that you need to answer. If you have the wrong sample of individuals in the test, it will be at best inconclusive and at worst misleading. Thankfully, this is not uncharted territory, and there are a number of principles that you can follow and a few aspects to consider to ensure you are successful!", "Of course, the first part is identifying the type of individuals to test. Is this a test that you will run across all of your customers (e.g. everyone who lands on your website or visits your store?), or on only a select group where the change is either the most relevant or thought to be the most effective? For instance, testing a banner ad for a new mobile app will not be very meaningful to users who visit your website from a PC. You can think of segmenting your customer population both by demographics (age, location, income, etc.) or by behavior (frequent visitors, power users, mobile users).", "Consider also that the idea you want to test may affect multiple parties, and you will want to have controls for all the parties involved. For instance, a test on a marketplace will likely affect both producers and consumers, sellers and buyers, drivers and riders, advertisement producers and viewers, and their interactions can end up obscuring the true impact of the test. For instance, consider testing a new recommendation system that is supposed to drive more traffic to sponsored content from your test group. The content producers impacted notice this and start producing better content. Now the control group is seeing the spillover impact from this test, and their engagement also goes up. Choosing the right unit of randomization (buyers? sellers? sessions?) in such scenarios is especially tricky.", "You never want to end up in a situation where you are taking out unclean individuals from a test post hoc. Do yourself a favor: either plan a clean test from the start, or plan on the interactions you need to measure.", "Another important consideration is overlapping tests. This is why keeping a clean testing pool is recommended, and this should be maintained and updated diligently. If you end up sampling individuals with overlapping tests, it will create a dangerous temptation for picking out poorly performing test group members and rationalizing a justification. It is the stairway to p-hacking, kitchen sink statistical testing, and other circles of data science hell. You can, however, consider multiple tests in a multi-factor analysis, and design your analysis up-front to look into test interactions.", "So now you know the types of customers on which to run your test, but how do you choose the specific individuals to be part of the test and control groups? The golden method of A/B testing has always been the random sample. However, in some cases, random sampling is not enough. Take for instance tests on social networks, where individuals in the test group interact with individuals in the control group, and thereby impact the control group\u2019s behavior. Here you will want to partition test and control in coarser groupings than the individual, such as geography or social clusters. Here graph partitioning methods, for instance by using thresholds of interaction frequency, may help. Furthermore, if your sample size is small, you may also want to stratify your samples along a few key criteria to ensure you are unbiased in your segmentation.", "So now you know what kind of test subjects you need, but what about how many of them are needed? Here there are both strategic and statistical considerations.", "From a stratetgic perspective, you should not make tests too large. You want to maintain that shared pool of clean test subjects for other tests, so using more subjects than needed depletes this resource faster, and then one needs to wait for it to replenish. The second element, of course, is also cost: many ideas fail, and running costly tests on larger samples increases the negative impact to the business.", "The statistical point says that you want to make sure your tests are not too small. Any data scientist worth his salt knows about power analysis, and the basic rule that to measure an effect size of of x reliably, you will need at least N individuals, and N gets larger as x gets smaller. If your test is expected to double sales, you likely won\u2019t need to that many individuals. But statistical power will only tell you the minimum needed, and you will often want more than that. You will need more, for instance, if you plan to do segmentation in your analysis afterward, and especially if you want to use the data for targeting through regressions and machine learning models. There are good tools and good articles that cover this topic in more detail.", "In the age of statistical computing, where a computer can run hundreds of tests and models in a few hours, it has become fashionable to take critical thinking out of the process of testing and let the machine clean up the mess people have made. This is a recipe for disaster: it is literally garbage-in-garbage-out.", "A machine cannot tell if a test is biased from the results alone, it cannot tell if there were interaction effects between multiple parties in a marketplace, and it cannot tell if an insignificant result is because of a low sample size or because the effect is not there.", "When running a statistical test is a help command away in Python or R, and model cross-validation is reduced to a function, the critical knowledge of the data scientist will not be in technical details, but in conceptual thinking. The high impact data scientist starts adding value to the business even before the data are in. Designing the right test by choosing the right test subjects is therefore central to being an effective data scientist.", "Your home for data science.
