The code below runs the code for each approach 10000 times and outputs the overall time it took in seconds.", "Comparing these two approaches shows that using sets to remove duplicates is more efficient. While it may seem like a small difference in time, it can save you a lot of time if you have very large lists.", "A common use of sets in Python is computing standard math operations such as union, intersection, difference, and symmetric difference.

It just looks a bit different.", "Membership tests check whether a specific element is contained in a sequence, such as strings, lists, tuples, or sets. One of the main advantages of using sets in Python is that they are highly optimized for membership tests. For example, sets do membership tests a lot more efficiently than lists. In case you are from a computer science background, this is because the average case time complexity of membership tests in sets are O(1) vs O(n) for lists.", "The code below shows a membership test using a list.", "Something similar can be done for sets.

Some of the challenges people often encounter are when to use the various data types.
