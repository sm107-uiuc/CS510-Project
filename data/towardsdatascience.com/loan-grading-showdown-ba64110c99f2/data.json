Then I built a public API to serve the model\u2019s predictions. That\u2019s nice and all, but\u2026 how good is my model?", "Today I\u2019m going to put it to the test, pitting it against the risk models of the very institution who issued those loans. That\u2019s right, LendingClub included their own calculated loan grades (and sub-grades) in the dataset, so all the pieces are in place for the most thrilling risk modeling smackdown of this century (or at least this week). May the best algorithm win!", "This post was adapted from a Jupyter Notebook, by the way, so if you\u2019d like to follow along in your own notebook, go ahead and fork mine on Kaggle!", "This is going to be a clean fight \u2014 my model won\u2019t use any data LendingClub wouldn\u2019t have access to at the point they calculate a loan\u2019s grade (including the grade itself).", "I\u2019m going to sort the dataset chronologically (using the issue_d column, the month and year the loan was issued) and split it into two parts. The first 80% I\u2019ll use for training my competition model, and I\u2019ll compare performance on the last 20%.", "At the earlier end of the test set my model may have a slight informational advantage, having been trained on a few loans that may not have closed yet at the point LendingClub was grading those ones. On the other hand, LendingClub may have a slight informational advantage on the later end of the test set, since they would have known the outcomes of some loans on the earlier end of the test set by that time.", "I have to give credit to Michael Wurm, by the way, for the idea of comparing my model\u2019s performance to LendingClub\u2019s loan grades, but my approach is pretty different. I\u2019m not trying to simulate the performance of an investment portfolio; I\u2019m just evaluating how well my predictions of simple risk compare.", "The test: who can pick the best set of grade A loans, judged on the basis of the independent variable from my last notebook, the fraction of an expected loan return that a prospective borrower will pay back (which I engineered as fraction_recovered).", "LendingClub will take the plate first. I\u2019ll gather all their grade A loans from the test set, count them, and calculate their average fraction_recovered. That average will be the metric my model has to beat.", "Then I\u2019ll train my model on the training set using the same pipeline and parameters I settled on in my last notebook. Once it\u2019s trained, I\u2019ll use it to make predictions on the test set, then gather the number of top predictions equal to the number of LendingClub\u2019s grade A loans. Finally, I\u2019ll calculate the same average of fraction_recovered on that subset, and we\u2019ll have ourselves a winner!", "That\u2019s a pretty high percentage. I\u2019m a bit nervous.", "First, I\u2019ll copy over my run_pipeline function from my previous notebook:", "Now for the moment of truth:", "Phew, that was a close one! My win might be too small to be statistically significant, but hey, it\u2019s cool seeing that I can keep up with LendingClub\u2019s best and brightest.", "What I\u2019d really like to know now is what quantitative range of estimated risk each LendingClub grade and sub-grade corresponds to, but it looks like that\u2019s proprietary. Does anyone know if loans grades generally correspond to certain percentage ranges like letter grades in academic classes? If not, have any ideas for better benchmarks I could use to evaluate my model\u2019s performance? Go ahead and chime in by leaving a response!", "Your home for data science.
