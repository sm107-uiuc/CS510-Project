Which are the right engagement strategies for motivated vs. casual shoppers?", "As any great sales assistant knows, consumers display clear clues of their real interests through verbal and bodily behavior: how they move through the aisles, what questions they ask, how they are dressed etc.. If that is definitely true in the physical world, what happens in the digital one, when there is no face to read?", "If a user is browsing our website, it will certainly be very helpful to detect with as few \u201cclicks\u201d as possible her real shopping intent: in the age of Big Data we can actually follow (anonymously) users as they browse through our shop and precisely record their action. Can we turn the art of prediction into the art of salesmanship leveraging all the digital breadcrumbs that consumers leave behind?", "At Tooso, we are helping some of the largest and most innovative retailers in the market to transform online shopping through Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Preliminary results suggest that we are able to reliably predict buying customers after only six actions on the website! We also hope to make soon a further contribution to the A.I. community in retail through a research-friendly licensing of real data: more on that in the concluding remarks, now it\u2019s science time.", "A few months back, we started Tooso Labs. The project was launched with the idea of bringing fresh interdisciplinary solutions to old and new A.I. problems, by matching our vision, skillset and proprietary datasets with our network of high-profile researchers in industry and academia; the \u201cclickstream prediction problem\u201d is our choice as the first problem to tackle with a new methodology.", "This work-in-progress report is the result of the ongoing collaboration between Tooso Labs and Dr. Lucas Lacasa, Senior Lecturer in applied mathematics at Queen Mary University, amazing physicist, fairly decent basketball player and great friend of Tooso.", "\u201cPerhaps because I\u2019ll never be one, humans are interesting to me.\u201d Jeff Lindsay", "We will start our deep dive by making the problem a bit more precise and the context a bit more explicit. You can think of your favorite e-commerce website as a network, i.e. a formal structure where the nodes are the pages in the website and the edges are the links between the pages: a user landing on the site can therefore navigate the network by repeatedly taking actions at each page/node, as shown in the picture below:", "Each user will pick just one among the countless possible paths in the network: some paths will be common to many users (e.g. going from a landing page to the home page), some will be relatively rare (e.g. going from one SKU to another through some link in the product description); some paths will end up in a purchase (like the red path above), but most of them will get interrupted somewhere in the middle, i.e. when the user leaves the shop without buying.", "Thanks to our Apache licensed Tooso Analytics tag, our Big Data warehouse stores all the actions in users\u2019 paths, so that the events in the example would be recorded as something like the following list:", "If instead of taking one user we take thousands, the resulting set will be a very long list of paths, some of which will contain some purchase event, most of which won\u2019t; every path in the list is a self-contained time series made up of single events in strict chronological order.", "Our goal is then to train machines to predict human behavior so well that it will be possible to understand, just from a few initial events, if the user is gonna buy something or not.", "Our training setting will therefore involve feeding sequences to our A.I. to train our prediction model:", "Our offline prediction setting will involve feeding partial sequences of 1, 2,.. N events to the trained model and record prediction for buying behavior to measure accuracy at several sequence lengths (intuitively, the more events, the better the prediction should become):", "Once we are happy with the model accuracy, powering real-time adaptive products with online prediction can be engineered in a straightforward way (given a reliable system to ingest clickstream data and react accordingly).", "Now that the problem boundaries have been set explicitly, it is time for the real fun: how can we teach a machine to predict human shoppers?", "\u201cIt should be possible to explain the laws of physics to a barmaid.\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein", "The problem of predicting shopping behavior (or, more general, navigation patterns) from clickstream data has been approached with several methods in academia and industry: from high-order Markov chains (as in this PLOS paper), to RNNs (as in this Rakuten-backed SIGIR paper), with recent papers suggesting that even a simple timestamp could be a very powerful predicting feature.", "As part of Tooso Labs interdisciplinary philosophy, we are interested in taking a fresh look at the problem; in particular, we start by focusing on developing \u201ccheap\u201d (from a computational standpoint) methods that can be used efficiently in real-time settings without loss of accuracy compared to more traditional, \u201cheavy\u201d algorithms.", "Our interdisciplinary approach has its root in physics, in particular in the so-called visibility graph (NERDS ALERT: check out this PNAS paper). If you consider a generic time series, a visibility graph can be constructed by linking together data points (as nodes) that can \u201csee\u201d each other (e.g. intuitively, you can draw a straight line between them without crossing intermediate points):", "This seemingly innocent transformation opens up a universe of modeling techniques, as visibility graphs have been successfully used to characterize the structure of time series and underlying dynamics in a variety of settings (e.g. predicting Alzheimer and turbulence).", "Crucial ingredients for full-fledged visibility analysis are \u201cmotifs\u201d, that is pattern of connectedness between \u201cclose\u201d nodes, where \u201cclose\u201d is defined through a sliding window that gets computed traversing the graph in the time dimension. For a window of size 4, for example, the possible motifs/patterns are only six, and they can be easily computed through simple inequality checks (full details here):", "As simple as they might appear, these motifs have been shown to be a useful combinatorial tool to characterize chaotic processes and other types of complex data. Armed with these new concepts (thanks physics!), how can we approach our original problem in the retail world? The geeky reader probably knows the answer already: we are going to transform our user trajectories to visibility graphs, and use \u201cmotifs\u201d as feature to answer our classification problem: will the user buy something in this session?", "\u201cA good forecaster is not smarter than everyone else, he merely has his ignorance better organized. \u201c\u2014 Anonymous", "As our first playground, we extracted from our dataset of online users ~500.000 clickstream trajectories of real customers. While interested in the more generic \u201cbuy vs no-buy\u201d classification problem, a first question is what can be predicted with the simplest possible model through visibility graphs.", "Simplicity has two natural virtues: first, simple models are easier to understand, debug and improve upon, providing good baselines for any rocket science stuff we may want to try later; second, simple models are easier to engineer in real-time, low latency settings: as our ultimate goal is to improve the shopping experience for millions of users across our partners\u2019 sites, it is of paramount importance to strike the right balance in accuracy vs speed vs maintenance costs.", "Our basic pre-processing is fairly simple: for each trajectory, we map the events in the series to integers (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4 \u2026) , based on conventional e-commerce event types (e.g. 1=page view, 2=product view etc.). So, our sample path for user 123:", "From the ~500.000 sequences of integers so created, we then extract a balance sample (~50%/50%) of buyvs no-buy chains, retaining the sequence labels but removing purchases events: when we feed the sequences to train our model, the algorithm cannot therefore use buying events to predict purchases (as that would be Human Cheating more than Artificial Intelligence). Looking at the data so transformed, even the (trained!) human eye can highlight some interesting features:", "Thanks to our visibility graph machinery, we can now take a more \u201cholistic\u201d view on the process and actually use the above mentioned features as part of the general graph-like description of our time series. While a lot more goes into data preparation (SPOILER ALERT: we are going to release a full research paper in the upcoming months), for now we are happy to share the results on the simple prediction problem stated above:", "What does this mean? An SVM classifier on our visibility graph representation already boasts a 86% prediction accuracy. This means that, given a sequence and a label buy vs no-buy, the model can distinguish almost 9 times out of 10 which label is the correct one!", "This is an incredible first step: by leveraging very simple features of the original time series, we are able to uncover sufficient patterns in the data to achieve a pretty significant result in predicting shopping behavior.", "Obviously enough, while this is truly encouraging for our visibility-based feature extraction, a more realistic use case \u2014 as depicted in our introductory section\u2014 is predicting shopping behavior late in a sequence from only a handful of data points: to unlock business value for our partners, what we really want is the answer to the following question:", "when given only 1, 2, 3, \u2026 N events in a user trajectory, how good is the model at figuring out if late in the sequence a shopping event is likely to happen?", "To answer this further question, we extracted from our pre-processed datasets the first m points of each trajectory (m = 4, 5, \u2026); as usual, we then discarded at random no-buy trajectories to balance our classes. Skipping over the nerdy details, these are the results of the visibility-based classification (as assessed with ten-fold cross-validation) for m = 4, 5, 6:", "After only six actions on a target website (a product view, a page view, etc.), the model is able to accurately tell if the user is going to buy a product 7 times out of 10!", "As a final nerds-only note, please note that we did some sanity checks in the existing literature: while fairly different in the implementation details, the general level of accuracy achieved by the model is comparable with some state-of-the-art peer-reviewed papers.
