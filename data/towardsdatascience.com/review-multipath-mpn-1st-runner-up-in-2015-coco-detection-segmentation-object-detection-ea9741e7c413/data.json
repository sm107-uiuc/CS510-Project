This approach has a name of MultiPathNet in GitHub, MultiPath in the paper. It is also called MPN in SharpMask. Three modifications are made to improve Fast R-CNN:", "Couple with SharpMask object proposals, the combined system improves results over the baseline Fast R-CNN detector with Selective Search by 66% overall and by 4\u00d7 on small objects. It placed second in both the COCO 2015 detection and segmentation challenges. It is published in 2016 BMVC with more than 100 citations. (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)", "Except the original 1\u00d7 size of ROI pooling region, additional 1.5\u00d7, 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 ROI pooling regions as shown above are also exploited. This provides differently-sized foveal region.", "These four ROI pooling regions go through fully connected (FC) layers (FC5 and FC6) and then concatenated as a single long feature vector (4096\u00d74).", "In original Fast R-CNN using VGG16 as backbone, only conv5 layer is used for ROI pooling. At this layer, features have been downsampled by a factor of 16. However, 40% of COCO objects have area less than 32\u00d732 pixels and 20% less than 16\u00d716 pixels, so these objects will have been downsampled to 2\u00d72 or 1\u00d71 at this stage, respectively. RoI-pooling will upsample them to 7\u00d77, but most spatial information will have been lost due to the 16 downsampling of the features.", "Thus, skip pooling, suggested by ION, is performed at conv3, con4 and conv5 are used for ROI pooling as well. The idea is that earlier layers usually have larger values than the later layers, which is mentioned in ParseNet. Thus, each pooled ROI is L2-normalized and re-scale back up by empirically determined scale, prior to concatenation. After that, 1\u00d71 convolution is performed to reduce the dimension to fit the classifier input dimension.", "These skip connections give the classifier access to information from features at multiple resolutions.", "In PASCAL and ImageNet datasets, the scoring metric is only focusing on Intersection over Union (IoU) over 50, i.e. AP\u2075\u2070. However, COCO dataset evaluate AP over a range of IoU from 50 to 95.", "In original Fast R-CNN, the loss function only focus on optimizing AP\u2075\u2070:", "The first term Lcls is the classification log loss while the second term Lloc is the bounding box localization loss. k*\u22651 only if IoU greater than 50. Otherwise k*=0 and the second term of loss is ignored.", "In general, Lcls is modified to fit into the COCO evaluation metric:", "The above equation approximate the integral as a sum with du = 5.", "Specifically, only 6 IoU thresholds, from 50, 55, \u2026, to 75 are considered. The modified loss become:", "where n=6 and u are from 50, 55, \u2026, to 75. During training, fewer proposals overlapping the ground truth as u is increased. Therefore, it is restricted with u\u226475, otherwise, the proposals contain too few total positive samples for training.", "This integral loss function is shown at the right part of the above figure.", "During training, there are 4 images per batch and 64 object proposals per image. It takes about 3 days on 4 NVIDIA Titan X GPUs. Non maximal suppression threshold of 30, 1000 proposals per image are used. And there is no weight decay. The network requires 150ms to compute features, 350ms to evaluate the foveal regions, thus a total of 500ms per COCO image.", "While there are missing objects and false positives, many of them are quite good.", "The results in the paper and in the COCO detection leaderboard are a bit different. But the results in SharpMask are the same as in the leaderboard.
