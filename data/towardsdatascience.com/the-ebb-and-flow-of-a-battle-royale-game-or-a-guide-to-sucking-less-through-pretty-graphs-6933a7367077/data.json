The aim of the game is to collect these items from the map and be the last person/team standing by killing rival players.", "The mechanic of a \u2018safe zone\u2019 ensures the match keeps progressing. A safe zone is circular in shape and shrinks in increments over time. If players are caught outside of this safe zone, they die after a short while. This way, surviving players are eventually corralled into a tiny safe area towards the end of the game, where they have no choice but to kill each other.", "The fifth image on this page is a good visual guide to the safe zone mechanic.", "Every increment of the safe zone is a) randomly decided but b) a subset of the previous increment, so there is an element of controlled unpredictability that makes gameplay and strategy a little unique.", "My thanks to user KP who scraped the original data and provided it on Kaggle. I\u2019ll let them introduce the datasets:", "\u201cThis dataset provides two zips: aggregate and deaths.", "Since there is so much data, I\u2019ve used tiny (1%) random samples in places for clearer visualisation. I grouped my findings into 3 buckets: 1) Survival and Placements, 2) Locations and 3) Weapons and Kills. Finally, all the feature engineering, wrangling and visualisation code can be found at my Github in a Jupyter Notebook.", "Playstyles in BR games can be imperfectly divided into two categories: i) Camping, where a player/team hides in an advantageous position, waits for opposing players to kill each other and engages only when enemies approach them or ii) Aggression, where players don\u2019t stay in one position for long and may actively seek out enemies.", "Because this is a descriptive analysis and not an experiment, we can\u2019t infer causality. This is true for every piece of analysis and graph in this post; they are all my own interpretations. It could be that a spurious variable is responsible for the relationship or the direction of causality is reversed.", "Regardless, not shying away from enemy engagements is certainly associated with better in-game outcomes:", "This graph displays the mean survival time and mean placement by each value in number of kills by individual players.", "In other words, every single player that killed two enemies in a match survived, either alone if they were playing alone or in a team, an average of a little over 1000 seconds. Additionally, they placed on average in the late 10s. This measure suggests that better players don\u2019t simply wait for opposing players to kill each other and then engage with the leftovers.", "But isn\u2019t it possible that camping players simply pick off enemies while cocooned in their advantageous position?", "We can answer this by looking at this question from another angle that captures the essence of camping perhaps more precisely: movement", "There\u2019s a weak-to-moderate linear relationship where the data is coloured sailor blue.", "Interestingly, there are so many instances of where teams/players don\u2019t move much but consistently rank between 15 and 30. However, as placement improves further, distance travelled undeniably increases.", "Sticking around in one place may: i) invite successive waves of enemies because they may have found your exact location or ii) not be conducive in a game where the safe zone changes like it does.", "So the imperfect answer is that while camping can get you pretty far, you\u2019re more likely to go all the way if you play less like a couch potato.", "Camping isn\u2019t exactly the same as pacifism, but I wanted to know how few enemies one could kill and still have a decent chance of remaining the last man standing.", "Let\u2019s look at all players who won their matches and how many players they killed to get there:", "50% of winners kill between 4 and 8 players while anything north of 14 kills can be considered pretty extreme.", "This seems to be an ideal mix of the two playstyles mentioned to strive towards.", "Erangel is one of two maps on which data is provided and it is, according to PUBG, 8 km x 8 km in area. Here are the hotspots on Erangel where most players meet their collective demise:", "And the original image for comparison:", "Pochinki is statistically one of the worst places to be on Erangel. It has a geographical neighbour to the south-east that is even less conducive to survival and should be avoided.", "I\u2019m not as familiar with PUBG as I am with Warzone but I guess Pochinki and its cousin must: i) offer some good weapons so players are attracted to them or ii) be a common site of the final increments of the safe zone.", "Similarly, south-east of Severny should be a no-go zone.", "These 3 areas are the most lethal pockets of Erangel, and we could say the same to a lesser extent for the areas north of Primorsk, Mylta and the north-east corner of Military Base.", "I wanted to find an answer to this question that didn\u2019t rely on a time variable but rather on an in-game event, given that the time a match lasts can vary considerably so there are no fixed benchmarks.", "\u2018Placement\u2019 is the rank of a player for a single match. If a player is the first to be eliminated, their placement is equal to the number of players in the game; if n = 100, the player\u2019s placement is 100 (i.e. the worst).", "The second player to be eliminated will have a placement of n-1, or 99 in this case.", "The winner(s) always has a placement of 1, since they are the last man/team standing. In other words, the lower your placement, the better you played.", "Interestingly, players die most often soon after they have just finished pumping lead into a rival. We can come to this conclusion by comparing the placements of Killers and their Victims:", "The majority of the data is between a difference of -5 and 10 in placement.", "Restricted to positive differences, this means that a player who has just killed another is often going to attain a placement that is just <10 places better than than their Victim.", "Moreover, Killers follow Victims out of the game almost immediately (0< placement difference < 5) very frequently.", "This can be due to the mechanic of \u2018looting\u2019; when you kill a player in a BR game, you can pick up or loot their equipment. Other players know this and often aim at fresh corpses to pick off would-be vultures. On the other hand, it may be that now your position is known to other players, due to the sound of the firefight you were engaged in.", "Conversely, how can we explain the presence of negative placement differences?", "The answer is that players may play as a team. If a player kills another player, but the first player\u2019s entire team is eliminated before the second player\u2019s entire team, then the placement difference will be negative for that observation.", "Competitive players pretty much do anything to find an edge over others, so the extent to which a weapon is used is a good proxy for its effectiveness.", "Here\u2019s an unexpected finding: there isn\u2019t a single sniper rifle among weapons responsible for the most kills across both maps, which is odd considering their sizes. On the other hand, the apex predator is unsurprisingly the assault rifle:", "The M416 boasts the most kills and is considered a very \u2018meta\u2019 weapon in Warzone also. A single submachine gun in the form of the UMP9 sneaks in, which also makes sense as SMGs excel only in close quarters.", "It is accompanied in engagements of this nature by shotguns, 3 of which make the cut.", "Finally, a possible proxy for the sniper rifle, the marksman rifle, makes its presence known too.", "I\u2019m going to give the sniper rifle another chance to shine by stacking the odds in its favour. To do that I need to see the range of kills on Erangel specifically.", "The range of axes in the data is 0, 800000 and, as I mentioned earlier, Erangel is a 64 km\u00b2 square-shaped map.", "This means that 100 \u2018steps\u2019 in my \u2018Range of Kill\u2019 variable is equal to 1 meter of distance on the ground. I kept this convention instead of converting the distance units to meters.", "Half of all kills involve the Killer and Victim being between 5 and 75 meters apart with all outliers being north of around 200 meters in distance.", "If we expect sniper rifles to excel at long ranges, then we can look for the deadliest weapons at > 80 meters, since this is the approximate 3rd quartile of the above distribution and can serve as a useful benchmark.", "But PUBG players really don\u2019t like this class of weapons:", "Either sniper rifles have too high of a skill floor and there aren\u2019t enough players who can use them effectively or players see marksman rifles as better substitutes and use them instead.", "Another observation is that far too many players get caught out pretty far from the safe zone.", "This is what the Bluezone kills indicate; 5000+ players in this small sample were more than 80 meters away from the safe zone when they died, which is really poor geographical awareness.", "It can\u2019t get worse than that, right? Wrong:", "Since this is a descriptive analysis, the following list tells us what successful players do. But that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean copying them will make you successful; you have to implement these strategies and find out for yourself!", "Your home for data science.
