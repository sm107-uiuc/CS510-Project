Lower than you think!", "Let\u2019s start with the basics. Here\u2019s the formula:", "Bayes\u2019 is all about calculating conditional probability, i.e. the probability of one event given another event. That\u2019s what the | (pipe) symbol denotes in the equation. So P(A|B) is the conditional probability of event A occurring given that event B occurred.", "I\u2019m a big history nerd, so I have to talk about Reverend Thomas Bayes a little. Bayes was a Presbyterian minister, statistician, and philosopher in 18th century England. He formulated the titular theory in \u201cAn Essay towards solving a Problem in the Doctrine of Chances\u201d (I vote to rebrand statistics as the \u201cDoctrine of Chances\u201d), trying to solve a problem of \u201cinverse probabilities\u201d, or given that x has happened, what can we say about y.", "There are two major camps in the field of inferential statistics, or using sample data to infer about the sampled population, Bayesian and Frequentist. The two groups think about probability in drastically different ways. For Frequentists, the definition of probability is more limited. Only random, repeatable events have probabilities and we cannot attach probabilities to hypotheses or unknown values. They argue that using prior probabilities is inherently subjective, and thus cannot be used a base for logical, unbiased understanding.", "For a Bayesian, there is no issue with ascribing unknown values and hypotheses with a probability even if they happen infrequently. They argue that we should included prior probabilities because they provide more information/context than raw frequencies. [1]", "Let\u2019s start with a classic example in Bayes\u2019 Theorem, getting tested for a rare disease! Here\u2019s our base formula and then we can substitute what we are actually looking for, mainly \u201cWhat is the probability that you have the disease given that you tested positive?\u201d. If we\u2019ve heard that the test is 95% accurate, then the obvious, intuitive, and incorrect answer is .95!", "Let\u2019s start by understanding our variables individually.", "P(disease|positive) \u2192 what is the probability that you have the disease given that you had a positive test result?", "P(positive|disease) \u2192 what is the probability that you had a positive test result given that you do have the disease? This is the test\u2019s sensitivity, or true positive rate, 95% here. And let\u2019s say the test\u2019s specificity, the true negative rate, is also 95%.", "P(disease) \u2192 what is the probability of having the disease? This is the disease\u2019s incidence rate in the population. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s 1/1,000 or 0.001.", "P(positive) \u2192 what is the probability of testing positive? This is where the first wrench is introduced because you can test positive and have the disease (the true positives) or you can test positive and not have the disease (the false positives).", "How does this make sense? Less than 2% of those who test positive have the disease?", "As humans, we\u2019re pretty bad at understanding the relative size of numbers especially as the order of magnitude increases. What\u2019s happening here is that we are seeing 95% true positive and not realizing that 95% of a small number is less than 5% of a much larger number! This is what P(pos) is capturing. Given a positive test, you are much more likely to be healthy and receive a false positive than you are to have the disease (it\u2019s only 1/1000 after all) and get a positive test.", "Bayes\u2019 can be leveraged to better understand your data. As an example, I\u2019ve been exploring this popular Bike Sharing Ridership dataset. In it we have various features related to weather conditions that you could use to ask interesting questions and drive business understanding.", "Given that it\u2019s raining, what is the probability that a casual rider will rent a bike? Given high temperatures, what is the probability of good weather? How does that affect ridership? These questions can be approached in many ways, but hopefully applying Bayes\u2019 theorem will now be an option you consider! Understanding A/B testing, for example, is a great application.", "I\u2019ll link this excellent overview by Jason Brownlee. Naive Bayes is a very common classification model that calculates P(class|data), or probability of a class given the data. Bayes Optimal Classifier can be used to predict on new observations given previous training data. Bayesian optimization can be used to fine-tune hyperparameters of ML models. Brownlee covers all these and more in the guide, and he does it better than I could.", "There was an interesting and controversial article released in 2005 by John Ioannidis titled, \u201cWhy Most Published Research Findings Are False\u201d. In it, he uses Bayes\u2019 Theorem to argue that, much like in our example above, the probability that a phenomenon is true given a positive research result is much lower than we think. This can be dangerous because we may be taking research as fact without additional verification. It also highlights an important issue in the scientific community, mainly that there is little funding/interest in replicating previous studies.", "Bayes\u2019 Theorem allows us to overcome our incorrect intuitions about conditional probability in a logical, straightforward manner. Its applications are real and varied, ranging from understanding our test results (with real-world consequences) to improving our machine learning models. I hope this guide was useful and illuminated some of the counterintuitive aspects of Bayes\u2019.", "I\u2019m always looking to connect and explore other projects!", "Your home for data science.
