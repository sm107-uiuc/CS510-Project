We classify everything from our closet, where all the jeans go under one rack and all the shirts go in another meant only for shirts, to the apps on our phones and the files on our computers, where we have separate folders for each kind of files or apps.", "Now a more \u201cdata scientific\u2019 definition of classification is that it is a form of data analysis that extracts models describing important data classes or a task of predicting the value of the categorical variable (class or target). Basically, finding out which set of predefined categories will a new observation belong to. A very common example for this is with emails where we wish to classify certain emails as spam and others as not spam. The machine is able to achieve this task by learning from the training data whose class is already known.", "Classification algorithms can only be used when we have discrete labels as outputs. A situation like the above example where emails are classified as spam or not, where there are only two possible outcomes, is called as binary classification.", "Another type is a multi-labeled classification. In multi labeled classification multiple labels may be assigned to one instance. This is mostly used for audio and video classification, text classification, sentiment classification in sentiment analysis etc.", "Anyway, that was the basics and the sort of prerequisite information required to move forward with this article.", "In this article we will classify the continents, which is the label and will be used as a class, in the Life Expectancy Data Set.", "This is a very small data set with 6 columns and 223 rows, one for each country. The columns are Rank, Country, Overall Life, Male Life, Female Life and Continent.", "To perform this classification we will use 5 different classification techniques and algorithms and calculate the precision and accuracy for each of the algorithms and compare them. The 5 classification algorithms are:", "Let us now begin with the analysis using R Programming and let us see which classifier performs the best.", "We will use the following libraries/packages throughout the code: e1071, class, caret, rJava, RWeka.", "Although the Continent column was already of factor data type we still ran the command to make it factor nevertheless. With this view of the data we can get a clear idea of how the data looks, the head() function enables that. The summary functions shows us some vital descriptive information. Most importantly we can see how many countries lie in which continent, this will help us later while checking the accuracy. We can also observe the mean of the overall, male and female life expectancy, which is 72.49, 70.04 and 75.02 respectively. Medians, quartiles, mix, max values can also be observed.", "2. For the second part of the data preprocessing we will:", "KNN classification will be performed with help of preprocess and train methods, available in the caret package. The tunelength in train method will be chosen as 20 on basis of fit model results, it will help us to automatically select the best value.", "In our case K is chosen to be 5. Also, accuracy was used to select the optimal model using the largest value.", "SVM classification function will be deployed with help of tune method and using e1071 package. The svm fit classification will be tuned by choosing kernel as linear and cost as 1 from tune method.", "Ripper classification function will be deployed with help of JRip method in RWeka package.", "C4.5 classification function has been deployed with help of J48 method in RWeka package.", "Finally let us list out all the accuracy values from the various classifiers used in this article.", "Clearly SVM has out performed all the other classification techniques by a good margin. RIPPER and C4.5 were the closest, with both showing 48% accuracy, which is pretty impressive. OneR algorithm performed the worst with only 20% accuracy.", "Your home for data science.
