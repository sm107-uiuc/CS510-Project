That\u2019s great, but you\u2019re not done yet. Ideally, you would want your model to determine if a transaction is fraudulent in real-time so that you can prevent it from going through in time. This is where model deployment comes in.", "Most online resources focus on the prior steps to the machine learning life cycle like exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, and model evaluation. However, model deployment is a topic that seems to be rarely discussed \u2014 the reason being is that it can be fairly complicated. Deployment is a topic that is completely unrelated from EDA, model selection, or model evaluation, and thus, it\u2019s not well understood by those without a background in software engineering or DevOps. In this article, you\u2019ll learn what model deployment is, the high-level architecture of a model, different methods in deploying a model, and factors to consider when determining your method of deployment.", "Deploying a machine learning model, known as model deployment, simply means to integrate a machine learning model and integrate it into an existing production environment (1) where it can take in an input and return an output. The purpose of deploying your model is so that you can make the predictions from a trained ML model available to others, whether that be users, management, or other systems. Model deployment is closely related to ML systems architecture, which refers to the arrangement and interactions of software components within a system to achieve a predefined goal (Opeyemi, 2019).", "Before you deploy a model, there are a couple of criteria that your machine learning model needs to achieve before it\u2019s ready for deployment:", "(1) A production environment is a term used to describe the setting where software and other products are actually put into operation for their intended uses by end users (Techopedia, 2012)", "At a high-level, there are four main parts to an ML system:", "There are three general ways to deploy your ML model: one-off, batch, and real-time.", "It\u2019s not always that you need to continuously train a machine learning model in order for it to be deployed. Sometimes a model is only needed once or periodically. In this case, the model can simply be trained ad-hoc when it\u2019s needed and pushed to production until it deteriorates enough to need some fixing.", "Batch training allows you to constantly have an up-to-date version of your model. It is a scalable method that takes a subsample of data at a time, eliminating the need to use the full data set for each update. This is good if you use the model on a consistent basis, but don\u2019t necessarily require the predictions in real-time.", "In some cases you\u2019ll want a prediction in real-time, for example, to determine if a transaction is fraudulent or not. This is possible by using online machine learning models, like linear regression using stochastic gradient descent.", "There are a number of factors and implications that one should consider when deciding how to deploy an ML model. These factors include the following:", "For more articles like this one, check out Datatron\u2019s Medium page or their blog https://blog.datatron.com/", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Opeyemi, Bamigbade (2019).
