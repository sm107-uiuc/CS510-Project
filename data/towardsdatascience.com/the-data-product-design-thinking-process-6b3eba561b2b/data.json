We are constantly carrying out research into processes, causes and effects.", "We want to understand how companies, operational processes and economic relations work, what steps and parts they consist of, why things happen and how everything is interrelated.", "Once we have analyzed everything, we can use this knowledge to exert influence on the world in a positive way.", "Data is an increasingly important factor in the search for correlations. The right data (smart data instead of big data) shed more light on the darkness. Without data, an accurate, systematic analysis and precise design of the world around us is no longer conceivable. Intuition and gut feeling alone are no longer enough.", "But data in its raw version (binary, in tables, logfiles, databases, etc.) cannot actually be read by humans. If we want to be fast, we need data visualizations that make the right selection of data easily and precisely visible at the appropriate level of aggregation. This task is performed by so-called data products. They visualize our world in a suitable form and make it accessible for our analysis and our search for causes and effects.", "Data products such as Google Maps, Google Analytics or mobile apps for weather, health or timetables provide us with this at a really high level. What we see as an attractive, clear display is a highly complex condensation and sophisticated visual summary of data, connections and structures.", "Data products are digital products that use and visualize data to support decision-making and help control complex systems.", "A data product is the visually processed result, with the help of algorithms, of a statistical, mostly complex data analysis of systems. Systems can be processes, facilities, companies, cities, countries, infrastructure, solar systems, organisms, ecosystems, climate conditions. Indeed, our world consists of an infinite number of systems.", "A data product describes historical, current or future conditions and developments of this system. Users use data products to describe complex conditions and developments of systems quickly and visually and to derive information and their own decisions from them.", "The visual interface between machine (data product) and human being is very important.", "But how exactly do you develop them? How do we ensure that they fulfil their tasks effectively? Especially in professional environments, very different requirements are placed on a new data product by very different users. You can quickly find yourself in a situation where you have to solve a tricky problem (wicked problem).", "Tricky problems are characterized by the following characteristics:\u2022 there are many interdependent influencing variables\u2022 there are no right or wrong solutions, only good and bad ones\u2022 you can\u2019t solve them with a formula and logic alone\u2022 you can only solve them intuitively, not logically\u2022 there are social, psychological and cultural aspects to consider.", "The challenge with data products is\u2026", "on the content side:\u00b7 the complexity of the underlying system is high", "on the data side:\u00b7 data from different data sources must be connected to each other\u00b7 the data quality is often insufficient\u00b7 the preparation of data (ETL) is complex and time-consuming\u00b7 data science techniques must be properly integrated", "on the visualization side:\u00b7 the classic visualization methods (bar chart, pie chart, dot plot) are no longer sufficient\u00b7 the possibilities of visualization with common tools like Qlik, Tableau and PowerBI are limited", "on the user side:\u00b7 the users have very different knowledge\u00b7 they have to do very different jobs (jobs to be done)\u00b7 decoding the information contained in data products and assigning it to your own knowledge is a challenge\u00b7 the working environments of the users (medical technology, system control, vehicle control) are highly complex", "More details on all these aspects can also be found in our article on the Data Design Guide. here", "Design Thinking offers a very effective approach to solving tricky problems. Here, an interdisciplinary team approaches a potential solution in individual, systematic steps and from the user\u2019s perspective. This is then tested for suitability by users.", "Design Thinking has become a well-known and well-proven method of developing innovation. Many large technology and consulting companies use it.", "The internet is full of practical and descriptive explanations of Design Thinking, so here is just a brief overview of the four underlying phases in the Design Thinking process.", "\u00b7 Discover \u2014 Discover the environment and context for the question or problem under consideration\u00b7 Define \u2014 Formulate the requirements and needs of users\u00b7 Develop \u2014 Develop initial ideas to the solution\u00b7 Deliver \u2014 Create a solution and get user feedback.", "We wondered whether this method could also be used for data products. Design thinking is all about the users and their needs. Now another very complex dimension is added: data or data science. We then adapted the classic design thinking method specifically for data products and have been working with it very successfully since the beginning of 2018.", "The challenge of using Design Thinking in the development of data products for business applications lies in the following points:\u2022 Data product development for Big Data and Data Science applications often breaks new ground. At this point, the target use (job to be done) is not clearly defined at the beginning. The context of use and user requirements must be developed equally with the data product. Sometimes they only become apparent after the first visualization of the previously invisible system.\u2022 The data competence of the user is unknown or too low to understand the message\u2022 Designers need a deep insight into the data structure, the raw data and the data pipeline. What is developed creatively must also be technically possible. A pure UX view is not enough.\u2022 Many data products are based on data science algorithms. Data and the potential of statistics and data science are the raw material for the creative process. Data products only become efficient when they fully exploit this data potential. Here, too, designers cannot go any further without an understanding of data literacy and data science.\u2022 Data products in a professional environment are aimed at users and experts in specialist fields. The data product thus intervenes deeply in so-called business domains \u2014 a further level of complexity.", "Authors: Evelyn M\u00fcnster / Christoph Nieberding", "Evelyn M\u00fcnster and Christoph Nieberding are managing partners at Designation, a Munich based design company for data products and business design. www.designation.eu", "Your home for data science.
