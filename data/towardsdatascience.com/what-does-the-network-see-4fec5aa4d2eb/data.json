Persia at that time was ruled by \u2018Cyrus the Great\u2019, also called \u2018Cyrus the Elder\u2019. The priestess told \u2014 \u201cIf Croesus goes to war he will destroy a great empire\u201d. Croesus was pleased to hear that and, preparing his army, set off marching over the river Halys to conquer Persia. When winter came by, Croesus disbanded his army as it was the usual practice in those days. Cyrus, however, did not \u2014 he surprised Croesus and took him down!", "The oracle in typical ambiguity had failed Croesus \u2014 because Croesus did not think twice about its predictions. Since then, it continues to be proved time and again how blindly following a prediction can bring upon one\u2019s downfall.", "We have evolved and become more intelligent creatures since then. We don\u2019t blindly follow predictions by astrologers, right? Indeed, we do not harbor superstitions anymore \u2014 but we still blindly follow them. Astrologers? No! \u2014 Neural Networks!", "Neural Networks have been the biggest boon to the AI research community \u2014 they have helped solve completely unsolvable problems in the realm of AI and have given outstanding results in a very short period of time. However, along with the results, they have brought a new term into AI \u2014 the black box", "In neural networking or heuristic algorithms (computer terms generally used to describe \u2018learning\u2019 computers or \u2018AI simulations\u2019), a black box is used to describe the constantly changing section of the program environment which cannot easily be tested by the programmers. This is also called a white box in the context that the program code can be seen, but the code is so complex that it is functionally equivalent to a black box. \u2014 https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_box", "Modern complex AI techniques, such as Deep Learning and genetic algorithms are naturally opaque \u2014 one might guess but can never know what is actually happening inside the network. As a result of their opaqueness, applying them in clinical fields has been near to impossible as people can\u2019t trust an unexplained network with their lives.", "This naturally gave rise to Explainable AI \u2014 a research field where the solutions provided by a neural network are examined and possibly interpreted by an expert. Explainable AI (XAI), however, is still vastly under development and significant advances have not been made to bridge the gap between researchers and machines. As of now, research works are largely dependent on intuition mixed with bits and pieces of XAI integrations.", "Let\u2019s explore the intuition behind the working of a simple CNN classifier network \u2014 one of the most popular networks of the time.", "[Note: This is not a guide for CNNs \u2014 rather I would like the reader to have some knowledge of CNNs and their working as this is an intuition-based explanation of the methods used. Needless to say, this article would not cover the complete basics of a general CNN]", "To brush up the basics, a convolutional neural network is a type of neural network where we get the outputs after convolving the input with a kernel that is learnt by the machine. In other words, the convolving kernel keeps updating its parameters till the outputs come close to the desired value or the loss function reaches a low.", "A pictorial representation would be \u2014", "Thus, we can see that the 3x3 kernel convolves the 32x32 input into the 30x30 output. A 3x3 window slides over the input image (all channels) and we obtain the dot product of the 3x3 window and the kernel \u2014 which we represent in the output by a single point. A single convolutional operation thus gives us a single channeled image. A set of \u2018n\u2019 convolutional filters or a convolutional \u2018block\u2019 would give us an \u2018n\u2019 channeled output as the outputs from each filter is concatenated along the channel width. But, why use \u2018n\u2019 filters?", "A single filter can capture at most a single feature or detect a specific characteristic trait of the input. The inability of the single filter to capture more data makes it imperative to use multiple filters where multiple features need to be studied.", "Over time the network learns the values of the filter matrix for all the filter in all the convolutions and thus begins to identify patterns in the input it has seen before. It can now perform complex tasks like object detection and segmentation.", "Since we are generating the filter values, we can say this is both a classification and a regression problem \u2014 we regress the kernel matrix and ultimately classify the image.", "Now, if we are ultimately using filters and getting outputs, why cannot we complete the entire network in a single convolutional block?", "We cannot use a single conv block to get the whole work done because the features come in layers too! Unless the low-level features are extracted from the image, we cannot get to the mid-level or high-level features. Thus, we have to first extract the low-level features from the image with the help of the convolutions we use in the beginning of the network. After the low-level features have been extracted, we perform future operations on the convolved output to extract mid-level and high-level features respectively. Effectively, we are starting with simpler features and aggregating these into complex features later on.", "Now, what exactly are the low-level features in an image?", "By low level features, we are talking about features like edges and boundaries\u2014 the most basic and most important of all information. The mid-level features would represent features like corners and blobs and at the end, we would get the high level features that would help us classify or segment the image as per our requirement.", "This is the general intuition behind why we use convolution and why we use so many layers in a full convolutional network. There are other aspects of the said networks \u2014 aspects like dropout for controlling regularization, activations for introducing non-linearities, Batch Normalization for normalizing the activations of each layer, and many more. Let me know if you would like to read more about the intuition behind these aspects of a network \u2014 I won\u2019t disappoint you ;)", "Check out my blog for faster updates and don't forget to subscribe for quality content :D", "Hmrishav Bandyopadhyay is a 2nd year Undergraduate at the Electronics and Telecommunication department of Jadavpur University, India.
