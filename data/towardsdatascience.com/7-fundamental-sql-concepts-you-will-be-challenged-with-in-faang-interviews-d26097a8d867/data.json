Below I share 4 platform/courses that I personally recommend:", ">>> Not a Medium member yet? Consider signing up with my referral link to gain access to everything Medium has to offer for as little as $5 a month!", "While interviewing for a role in data science, data engineering or software engineering with Top Tech Companies, it\u2019s very likely that the technical round will include one or more live code sessions to test your knowledge of SQL and a programming language of your choice.", "Despite practicing to solve algorithms in Python or JAVA is often demanding and might take a good chunk of your time (because of the almost infinite amount of problems out there!), you should try not to underestimate the difficulty of SQL problems in FAANG interviews.", "Tech companies have large amount of data stored in their databases and they expect candidates to be able to extract and manipulate data in an efficient way using complex SQL queries, before jumping on more advanced analysis. Since a decent SQL knowledge is almost taken for granted for these roles, often interviewers expect you to solve those challenges \u201cwith flying colors\u201d and are less prone to prompt you or overlook obvious mistakes.", "As a striking example, a few years ago, a recruiter contacted me for a role in one emerging e-commerce company in London and just before the coding screen, he called me asking how confident I felt solving timed SQL problems. I told him that as a BI developer, I used SQL on a daily basis to write elaborate queries, therefore I felt positive about passing the test. I remember his answer to this day:", "\u201cSQL coding interviews may get tricky. You don\u2019t know how many experienced candidates claimed to be ready and than failed at this stage.\u201d", "Like a prophecy, this is exactly what happened to me: I passed the Python coding screen and failed the SQL test. At first I felt extremely ashamed and I kept saying to myself: \u201cHere I am: a BI developer, that fails SQL interviews\u2026can you believe that?\u201d.", "However, not long after, I realized that it\u2019s not rare for many of the SQL problems you will be asked in a technical interviews to address edge cases, that are not as common to encounter on the workplace on a daily basis, hence requiring a specific preparation.", "In order to help you assessing your readiness in sight of the next live coding round or take-home timed SQL test, in the next session I will go through a number of interview practice problems (and solutions) to cover the following 7 fundamental concepts:", "Write an SQL query to report the customer_idand customer_nameof customers who bought products \u201cA\u201d, \u201cB\u201d but did not buy the product \u201cC\u201d since we want to recommend them buy this product. Return the result table ordered by customer_id.", "Note how compact this query is: it avoids the use of multiple CTEs (saving a lot of typing in a live coding session) by taking advantage of sub-queries in the WHERE() clause to only select customers that purchased product A and B but not C. While filtering, remember that if a subquery returns multiple values, you can use IN() or NOT IN() operators to check for membership.", "Write an SQL query that reports all the projects that have the most employees.", "The problem is basically asking to return the project (or projects) that involve the highest number of employees. In order to achieve that:", "As you can see, HAVING() should be used to filter a dataset when some kind of aggregation is involved ( be ready to explain the difference between HAVING() and WHERE() as it is a pretty popular question particularly for entry roles).", "Write an SQL query to reformat the table such that there is a department_id column and a revenue column for each month. The result table should have 13 columns (1 for the department id + 12 for the months).", "In some cases, interviewers will wish to test your ability to manipulate data and will ask you, for example, to unpivot a table by expanding it horizontally . For this problem the goal is to get rid of the month dimension and create as many fact columns as the number of months. This can easily be achieved using a CASE WHEN() clause to identify specific months and generate new aggregated columns.", "Write a SQL query that for each customer, returns the second earliest order_id, for each date they placed at least two orders.", "Problems that involve the use of ranking functions (and in general window functions) are extremely frequent in SQL technical rounds. For instance, in this case the RANK() OVER() function is used to rank each order in the partition by customer_id and order_date . Note how the partition uses order_date, whereas the ranking is then arranged in ascending order by order_datetime. In this way the very first order will get order_rank = 1 and the second earliest order_rank = 2. Only second earliest orders are then kept using the WHERE order_rank = 2 clause. Dates for which customers placed less than two orders are automatically excluded by the filter above, so there\u2019s no need to add anything else.", "Write a SQL to find the price of all products at 2019\u201308\u201316, assuming that all products prices before the modification is 10.", "This problem is a bit challenging: it is asking you to identify the most recent price change for each product_id at 2019\u201308\u201316. If for a product, the price only changed after that date, you should assume that the price on 2019\u201308\u201316 was 10. In order to do that, you can apply two concepts introduced in the problems above:", "If asked, remember that UNION ALL is more efficient and fast than UNION and the reason is that the first operator does not check for duplicate values.", "Write a SQL query to find how many UNITS have been ordered in the last 7 days for EACH and EVERY category. Consider seven calendar dates in total, including today. Also consider all categories, even those with zero orders.", "This problem requires to find the total number of units for each and every category, meaning that in this case the items table should be used as a leading table and left joined to orders to retain all the item_category values, even the ones linked to items that were never ordered. In general, when you read the words \u201ceach\u201d and \u201cevery\u201d in real interview questions, it\u2019s likely there\u2019s some action you need to take about the joins and some NULL values that need to be handled in the filters ( OR o.item_id IS NULL )", "Write a SQL to get the cumulative sum of an employee\u2019s salary over a period of 3 months but exclude the most recent month. The result should be displayed by \u2018Id\u2019 ascending, and then by \u2018Month\u2019 descending.", "Being asked to compute cumulative sums is a real classic in SQL technical interviews, so for this problem I have provided two potential solutions.", "In this case, the ROW_NUMBER() function is used to identify and exclude the last salary paid to each employee. Once the last salary has been excluded, a cumulative sum ( SUM() OVER()) is run just on the top three rows.", "In this alternative solution, instead of using a window function to order monthly salaries, the last salary has been filtered out by writing a subquery that finds and excludes the most recent month ( MAX(month) ) a salary was paid for each employee ( WHERE e1.id = e2.id ). The cumulative sum is then computed exactly like in solution 1.", "In this article, I presented 7 fundamental SQL concepts you should master before your next technical interview with FAANGs. I hope you will use the problems above to practice in sight of your next SQL coding screen or timed test.", "The solutions involving date conversions, use PostgreSQL as syntax (to save a bit of typing\u2026) but are easily convertible to MySQL. Also my solution, is just one of the potential solutions to each problem, so feel free to share yours in the comments. Note that all the SQL problems presented in this article were taken from Leetcode with a mix of official problems and questions directly reported by subscribers in the Discussion section.", "A note for my readers: This post includes affiliate links for which I may make a small commission at no extra cost to you, should you make a purchase.", "Your home for data science.
