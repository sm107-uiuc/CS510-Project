There was a major problem with Twitter on July 15 (yesterday while I\u2019m writing this), big accounts were hacked and asked for bitcoin donations promising to double the sent amount. So even though the tweets were real, they contained fake information.", "This is not the first time this happens, and probably not the last. But, can we prevent this? Can we stop this from happening?", "The problem is not only hackers, going into accounts, and sending false information. The bigger problem here is what we call \u201cFake News\u201d. A fake are those news stories that are false: the story itself is fabricated, with no verifiable facts, sources, or quotes.", "When someone (or something like a bot) impersonates someone or a reliable source to false spread information, that can also be considered as fake news. In most cases, the people creating this false information have an agenda, that can be political, economical or to change the behavior or thought about a topic.", "There are countless sources of fake news nowadays, mostly coming from programmed bots, that can\u2019t get tired (they\u2019re machines hehe) and continue to spread false information 24/7.", "The tweets in the introduction are just basic examples of this problem, but much more serious studies in the past 5 years, have demonstrated big correlations between the spread of false information and elections, the popular opinion or feelings about different topics.", "The problem is real and hard to solve because the bots are getting better are tricking us. Is not simple to detect when the information is true or not all the time, so we need better systems that help us understand the patterns of fake news to improve our social media, communication and to prevent confusion in the world.", "In this short article, I\u2019ll explain several ways to detect fake news using collected data from different articles. But the same techniques can be applied to different scenarios.", "I will do it in two ways:", "The data comes from Kaggle, you can download it here:", "There are two files, one for real news and one for fake news (both in English) with a total of 23481 \u201cfake\u201d tweets and 21417 \u201creal\u201d articles.", "All the data and codes can be found in this GitHub repo:", "First, we load the data into Python:", "Then we add a flag to track fake and real:", "Now let\u2019s concatenate the data frames:", "We will shuffle the data to prevent bias:", "Removing the date (we won\u2019t use it for the analysis):", "Removing the title (we will only use the text):", "How many fake and real articles?", "Most frequent words in fake news:", "Most frequent words in real news:", "The modeling process will consist of vectorizing the corpus stored in the \u201ctext\u201d column, then applying TF-IDF, and finally a classification machine learning algorithm. Pretty standard in text analytics and NLP.", "For modeling, we have this function to plot the confusion matrix of the models:", "I got an accuracy of 98.76%. The confusion matrix:", "I got an accuracy of 99.71 %. The confusion matrix:", "I got an accuracy of 98.98 %. The confusion matrix:", "We have a pretty good model with Python. Now it\u2019s time to do the same (or as much as possible) without coding. Again, we will be using a system called LEAPS for that. There\u2019s a lot of things to do with it, and I don\u2019t want to copy 15 screenshots on how to do it. So I\u2019ll only put the most important pieces.", "Important: To be able to use some of the functions you will need to select at least one column of the dataset. If you want to know more about how to use the platform check their free courses here.", "This is what I got for the \u201cfake\u201d articles:", "And this for the \u201ctrue\u201d articles:", "Pretty similar to the Python results.", "and for the \u201cfake\u201d articles I got:", "Again pretty similar to what we got in the Python part.", "This will tokenize and then use TF-IDF as a weighting metric. This is the result:", "You will get a new column with the results for your model. It\u2019s very simple. You can now download the final dataset with the model if you want to get the metrics in Python or somewhere else. The same process can be done for other models like:", "and more! You can even compare the models with the Compare Text Classification Models. Also, you can test other models like sentiment analysis, text clustering, Word2Vec, and more.", "Text analytics and NLP can be used to work with the very important problem of fake news. We have seen the big impact they can have on people\u2019s opinions, and the way the world thinks or sees a topic.", "We\u2019ve built a machine learning model using sample data for detecting fake articles, but the process is very similar to detect fake tweets or anything like that. You will need first to collect the data, and if you are interested in how to do it with twitter I created an article on that last year:", "We also saw that building the model with Python is simple, if you know to code, that I think we should all learn, but if you don\u2019t know, platforms like TreasureHunt LEAPS can help you solve the problem with no much effort and for free! You can even share your solved problems and built-in code with others, collaborate, learn, and much more", "Thanks for reading this, hopefully, it can help you with your current job or investigations and understanding of data science.", "Your home for data science.
