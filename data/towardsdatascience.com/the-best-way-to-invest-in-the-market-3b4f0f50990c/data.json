Since I\u2019m well aware that I have no chance of consistently beating the market, I respond with the same three words every time, \u201cBuy the SPY.\u201d For those unfamiliar, the SPY is an exchange traded fund that tracks the S&P 500, so buying one share of SPY for around $300 is like buying a very small fraction of every stock in the S&P 500. This answers the \u201cwhat\u201d.", "Next comes the \u201cwhy\u201d. For brevity, the main advantage I will mention is diversification. Buying shares of the SPY is a very cheap way to get a diversified portfolio, which allows one to put all of his eggs in many different baskets to cut down on idiosyncratic risk.", "Everyone knows the \u201cwhen\u201d: Buy low and sell high. History has shown that few, if any, can actually predict the peaks and troughs of the market, so today is virtually as good as any other day to invest.", "At last, we arrive at the \u201chow\u201d. The two strategies of investment I will compare in the article are lump sum investing and dollar cost averaging (DCA).", "Lump sum investment is when one takes her money and invests it all at once, while dollar cost averaging is breaking up that money into evenly sized amounts and investing those in regularly spaced intervals. For example, let\u2019s say we have $10,000 to invest. If an investor makes a lump sum investment, she invests all $10k on one date as represented by the single, red dot in the first chart below. When she is dollar cost averaging over a year, however, she invests $10,000/12 = $833.33 every month for twelve months as represented by the 12 blue dots in the second chart.", "Lump sum investing gives the investor more exposure to the market sooner, but can be much more volatile than dollar cost averaging. That being said, I was curious to see if one strategy outperformed the other over the history of the stock market.", "We can test how the two strategies did historically by simulating both a lump sum and and a DCA investment strategy on every trading day in the past, and comparing what they would return today. To do this, I first needed to pull historic SPY prices using DataReader. Note, these are adjusted prices which take into account dividend yields and stock splits.", "These prices look accurate and clean, so the next step is to simulate a lump sum investment. I\u2019m using a round $10,000 investment and tracking how much that would have grown to today, so we read the chart below by saying a $10k investment made on Jan 3, 2006 (the date on the x-axis) would have grown to about $33,000 (the y-axis value) today. It\u2019s interesting to see that investing at the absolute peak before the \u201808/\u201909 recession would still leave one with ~$15k today, a testament to Jeremy Siegel\u2019s Stocks for the Long Run.", "Now onto the dollar cost averaging simulation. This is slightly more nuanced, since I am spreading the $10k investment into 12 blocks each 1 month apart, and some of these dates do not fall on a day in which the market was open. Thankfully Github user, Elucidation, has a solution using Panda\u2019s .searchsorted() method to get the next closest valid investment date. With a list of valid investment dates, I\u2019m able to use my previous lump sum investment function to simulate investing $10k/13=$833.33 on each date. For starting dates less than 1 year ago, I hold the uninvested blocks of money in cash and simply add to the present value at the end.", "It\u2019s immediately apparent that this strategy is much smoother than lump sum investing, but is it necessarily better?", "Below I plot the difference between the two strategies with positive, green values representing times when lump sum results in more money today than DCA. Red, negative values represent times in which a DCA strategy returns more money today than a lump sum investment. In times leading up to recessions, the slow and steady DCA strategy triumphs, but after large market drops, lump sum investment gains a lot of ground.", "Looking simply at which strategy yields a higher amount of money today for every day over the past 25 years of data, we see that lump sum investment beats dollar cost averaging 76.48% of the time and, on average, leaves the investor with $1,324.84 (based on an investment of $10k) more in her pocket! The market\u2019s general tendency to go up over long periods of time appears to give lump sum investment the advantage over dollar cost averaging.", "As a final note, I should mention that the difference between these two strategies is relatively small compared to the ability to keep a level head and not to panic sell during bad times or over-invest in bubbles. More risk-averse investors may favor a DCA over lump sum, but the key to both of these strategies is to buy into the market without emotional influence and hold onto your investment over time.", "Huge credit to Github user, Elucidation, whose original lump sum vs. DCA analysis served as the main reference for this analysis.", "Thanks for reading and the full code can be found here.
