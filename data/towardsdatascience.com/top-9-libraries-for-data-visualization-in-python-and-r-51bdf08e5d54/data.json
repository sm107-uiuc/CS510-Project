Data-driven decision making is making its way to the top and we need to make sure to stay upbeat with the tools for the art.", "Having said that, this week I have compiled the top libraries that I have used, discovered, or heard about for great data visualizations and a bonus! Let\u2019s get right into knowing these libraries, in no particular order.", "The OG Python library, to create stories with data. Another library from the SciPy Stack, Matplotlib plots 2D figures mainly.", "When to use? Matplotlib is the quintessential plotting library for Python that provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into project files or applications. I find a close resemblance of Matplotlib as MATLAB embedded in Python programming language.", "Histogram, bar plots, scatter plots, area plot to pie plot, Matplotlib can depict a wide range of 2D visualizations. A bit of effort and tint of visualization capabilities, with Matplotlib, you can create just any visualizations:", "Matplotlib also facilitates labels, grids, legends, and some more formatting entities with Matplotlib. Basically, everything that can be drawn!", "Created by: John D. HunterWhere to learn more: matplotlib.org", "When you read the official documentation on Seaborn, it is defined as the data visualization library based on Matplotlib that provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. Putting it simply, seaborn is an extension of Matplotlib with advanced features.", "Then, what is the difference between Matplotlib and Seaborn? Matplotlib is used for basic plotting; bars, pies, lines, scatter plots and stuff whereas, seaborn provides a variety of advanced visualization patterns with less complex and fewer syntax.", "Plotly is again a graph plotting library for Python. Users can import, copy, paste, or stream data that is to be analyzed and visualized.", "Each data viz library in Python varies from one another while also overlaps on some features. Plotly has many overlaps with matplotlib in terms of the range of viz available and seaborn for the advanced features.", "When to use Plotly? You can use Plotly if you want to create and display figures, update figures, hover over text for details. Plotly also has an additional feature of sending data to cloud servers. That\u2019s interesting!", "The Plotly graph library has a wide range of graphs that you can plot:", "Think of visualization and Plotly can do it!", "Created by: Plotly, available in ModeWhere to learn more: https://plot.ly/python/", "One more from the Python family as I would like to term it as the library for interactive data visualization \u2014 Bokeh allows building complex statistical plots with simple commands real quick.", "The reason of Bokeh\u2019s popularity and its place on my list is because Bokeh makes the data visually appealing, forcing the focus on a particular area of the visualization. Bokeh also works well with D3.js to create interactive visualization with high interactivity quotient for very large or streaming datasets.", "Fun fact: The word Bokeh (also \u201cboke\u201d) comes from the Japanese language, which translates to blur.", "Created by: Continuum AnalyticsWhere to learn more: http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/", "geoplotlib, a toolbox primarily for creating maps and plotting geographical data can be used to create a variety of map-types, like choropleths, heatmaps, or dot-density maps. Since most Python data visualization libraries don\u2019t offer maps, it\u2019s nice to have a library dedicated solely to them and not look up to Tableau for external viz.", "One feature in particular that I most liked was the colormap \u2014 that converted real values to colors.", "I do not have what can you do with geoplotlib because it is essentially a map plotting library.", "When talking about data visualization, how can we not talk about D3.js, the dominant tool for SVG vector graphics! With SVG, no matter how deep you zoom, the graphics never look pixelated \u2014 the best sell for a report out.", "D3.js empowers a data wiz with a variety of graphics. D3 is a framework to load information into the browser and generate reports based on data elements. D3.js does not suggest a particular type of graphic but rather a way on how to create visualizations (per my best understanding).", "D3.js offers an extensive range of visualizations, more of which can be explored here.", "R\u2019s rich ecosystem has numerous famous packages for making beautiful graphics but one of the majorly popular and commonly used visualization packages is ggplot2.", "ggplot2 is the Python implementation of the Grammar of Graphics of R programming language to build layered, customization plots. I do not find ggplot2 of the Tidyverse with as extensive plot collection as seaborn, but for R, ggplot2 makes the most robust data viz libraries (atleast to what I\u2019ve had experience with).

Plotly in R creates interactive web-based plots using the plotly.js library as a base. The advantage here is that it can build contour plots, candlestick charts, maps, and 3D charts, which cannot be created using most packages in R. In addition, I found around 30 repositories available! Plotly also gives an opportunity to interact with graphs, change their scale, and point out the necessary record \u2014 show it to the executive in the eye. The library also supports graph hovering, somewhat similar to Tableau. Moreover, it is easy to add Plotly in knitr, R Markdown, or Shiny apps.", "pygal is again a Python module that creates SVG graphs/charts. I haven\u2019t used Pygal but have read it to be a highly customizable, low code module yet also extremely simplistic.", "Like Bokeh and Plotly, pygal also offers interactive plots that can be embedded in a web browser. The key difference among them all is its ability to output charts as SVGs. As long as you\u2019re working with smaller datasets, SVGs will do you just fine. The con here though creeps in when working with large datasets with thousands of data points, they\u2019ll have trouble rendering and become sluggish.", "That\u2019s it from my end for this blog.
