There are definitions and clear explanations wherever technical terms are introduced.", "Deep Learning is a machine learning field concerned with utilising Artificial Neural Networks(ANNs) to solve computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and pose estimation.", "Various configurations of ANNs such as convolutional neural networks(CNN), recurrent neural networks(RNN), deep neural networks(DNN) can extract features from various data formats such as text, images, videos etc.", "The word \u2018deep\u2019 in Deep Learning refers to more than one layered neural network architectures.", "As a deep learning practitioner, LeNet-5 and AlexNet are probably neural networks that you\u2019ve encountered before.", "The LeNet-5 convolutional neural network was introduced in 1998 by Yann LeCun et al. in the paper \u201cGradient-Based Learning Applied To Document Recognition\u201d.", "LeNet presented the utilisation of convolutional neural networks for the computer vision task of image classification.", "In 2012 AlexNet, a convolutional neural network architecture introduced the composition of consecutively stacked convolutional layers. The creators of AlexNet trained the network using graphical processing units(GPUs).", "The introduction of CNN, larger datasets, efficient computing resources and intuitive CNN architectures led to the rapid development of efficiently performant solutions to everyday computer vision tasks.", "Researchers discovered that an increase of layers and units within a network led to a significant performance gain. But increasing the layers to create more extensive networks came at a cost. Large networks are prone to overfitting and suffer from either exploding or vanishing gradient problem.", "The GoogLeNet architecture solved most of the problems that large networks faced, mainly through the Inception module's utilisation.", "The Inception module is a neural network architecture that leverages feature detection at different scales through convolutions with different filters and reduced the computational cost of training an extensive network through dimensional reduction.", "Some readers of this article might prefer to read the article below on the Inception Module before carrying on with GoogLeNet.", "The GoogLeNet architecture consists of 22 layers (27 layers including pooling layers), and part of these layers are a total of 9 inception modules(figure4).", "The table below depicts the conventional GoogLeNet architecture. Have a quick review of the table before reading more on the table\u2019s characteristics and features.", "At its inception, the GoogLeNet architecture was designed to be a powerhouse with increased computational efficiency compared to some of its predecessors or similar networks created at the time.", "One method the GoogLeNet achieves efficiency is through reduction of the input image, whilst simultaneously retaining important spatial information.", "The first conv layer in figure 2 uses a filter(patch) size of 7x7, which is relatively large compared to other patch sizes within the network. This layer's primary purpose is to immediately reduce the input image, but not lose spatial information by utilising large filter sizes.", "The input image size(height and width) is reduced by a factor of four at the second conv layer and a factor of eight before reaching the first inception module, but a larger number of feature maps are generated.", "The second conv layer has a depth of two and leverages the 1x1 conv block, which as the effect of dimensionality reduction. Dimensionality reduction through 1x1 conv block allows the decrease of computational load by lessening the layers' number of operations.", "The GoogLeNet architecture consists of nine inception module as depicted in figure 3.", "Notably, there are two max-pooling layers between some inception modules.", "The purpose of these max-pooling layers is to downsample the input as it\u2019s fed forward through the network. This is achieved through the reduction of the height and width of the input data.", "Reducing the input size between the inception module is another effective method of lessening the network's computational load.", "The average pooling layer takes a mean across all the feature maps produced by the last inception module and reduced the input height and width to 1x1.", "A dropout layer(40%) is utilised just before the linear layer. The dropout layer is a regularisation technique that is used during training to prevent overfitting of the network.", "Dropout technique works by randomly reducing the number of interconnecting neurons within a neural network. At every training step, each neuron has a chance of being left out, or rather, dropped out of the collated contribution from connected neurons.", "The linear layer consists of 1000 hidden units, which corresponds to the 1000 classes present within the Imagenet dataset.", "The final layer is the softmax layer; this layer uses the softmax function, an activation function utilised to derive the probability distribution of a set of numbers within an input vector.", "The output of a softmax activation function is a vector in which its set of values represents the probability of a class or event occurrence. The values within the vector all add up to 1.", "Before bringing the exploration of the GoogLeNet architecture to a close, there\u2019s one more component that was implemented by the creators of the network to regularise and prevent overfitting. This additional component is known as an Auxilary Classifier.", "One main problem of an extensive network is that they suffer from vanishing gradient descent. Vanishing gradient descent occurs when the update to the weights that arises from backpropagation is negligible within the bottom layers as a result of relatively small gradient value. Simply kept, the network stops learning during training.", "Auxilary Classifiers are added to the intermediate layers of the architecture, namely the third(Inception 4[a]) and sixth (Inception4[d]).", "Auxilary Classifiers are only utilised during training and removed during inference. The purpose of an auxiliary classifier is to perform a classification based on the inputs within the network's midsection and add the loss calculated during the training back to the total loss of the network.", "The loss of auxiliary classifiers is weighted, meaning the calculated loss is multiplied by 0.3.", "Below is an image that depicts the structure of an auxiliary classifier.", "An auxiliary classifier consists of an average pool layer, a conv layer, two fully connected layers, a dropout layer(70%), and finally a linear layer with a softmax activation function.", "Each of the included auxiliary classifiers receives as input the activations from the previous inception modules.", "The image below illustrates the complete GoogLeNet architecture, with all its bells and whistles.", "The GoogLeNet architecture performed well on the classification tasks in the ILSVRC 2014 classification challenge, where It came first with a top 5 error of 6.67%, without any training on external data.", "Understanding the GoogLeNet architecture is crucial for any deep learning practitioner seeking to understand the development of deep conv networks within the deep learning field. There is vast knowledge to be gained by revisiting research efforts made several years back.", "GoogLeNet is now a staple architecture within most common ML libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch etc. And with the use of transfer learning, you can utilise a GoogLeNet network trained on imagenet without implementing or training the network yourself.", "In a future article, we\u2019ll explore how GoogLeNet is implemented using TensorFlow and Python.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
