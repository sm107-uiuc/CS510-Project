Let\u2019s take an example.", "Suppose we are solving a simple binary classification problem with a logistic regression model. Let\u2019s red points are class A and blue points are class B. Now", "if we try to fit our decision boundary perfectly, there is also a chance that we will also fit the noisy points(potential outliers).As a result the model will not learn proper pattern about the data(and for smaller datasets it will just memorize all the points), which may leads to higher generalization(read test) error.", "To avoid over-fitting in models we add a regularization term, that will help to reduce the generalization error.Let\u2019s list down the various options we have:", "of cost function within a range. The main advantage of using l1 regularization is it creates sparsity in the solution(most of the coefficients of the solution are zero), which means the less important features or noise terms will be zero. It makes l1 regularization robust to outliers.", "2. L2 regularization: In case of l2 regularization we add squared values of", "coefficients instead of absolute values. In both of the methods lambda is a hyperparameter, which is used to tune the regularization. The main difference between l1 and l2 in term of result is, for less important features the coefficients with l2 term will be very low but never be exactly zero.", "3. Elastic Net: When both l1 and l2 regularization terms are used together as penalty, it is called elastic net regularization.", "That\u2019s cool. But How to choose the best regularization for me? That mostly depends on the problem at hand. We can always take the help of cross validation to select better performing one for the particular problem. For large dimensional data l1 provides better feature interpretability by giving zero coefficients for less important features.", "In this article we discuss what is over-fitting and how we can use regularization to minimize the generalization error. Across the broad spectrum of machine learning, you will find it is nothing but a game of bias variance trade off, the well fitted model we have the better result we get.
