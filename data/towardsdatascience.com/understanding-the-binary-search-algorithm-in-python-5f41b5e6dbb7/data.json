In this article, we will cover one such cool algorithm that can be used to efficiently find the location of a specific element in a list or array. We will cover the binary search algorithm in complete detail and try to implement it with python.", "In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation. One such algorithm that we will cover in this article is the binary search algorithm.", "In computer science, binary search, also known as half-interval search, logarithmic search, or binary chop, is a search algorithm that finds the position of a target value within a sorted array. Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array.", "If they are not equal, the half in which the target cannot lie is eliminated, and the search continues on the remaining half, again taking the middle element to compare to the target value and repeating this until the target value is found. If the search ends with the remaining half being empty, the target is not in the array.", "Before we dive into understanding the details of the binary search algorithm, we will cover the linear search algorithm, which will help us understand the importance of the binary search algorithm.", "Then we will understand the step-wise intuition of the implementation of the binary search algorithm. We will then proceed to get our hands dirty with some code, and finally, we will understand the various measures of the binary search algorithm.", "In computer science, a linear search or sequential search is a method for finding an element within a list. It sequentially checks each element of the list until a match is found or the whole list has been searched.", "In linear search, you loop through all the elements in a list in a straightforward way until you encounter the desired value that you are searching for. The code implementation for linear search is quite simple and will be discussed in a later section of this article.", "A linear search runs in at the worst linear time and makes at most n comparisons, where n is the length of the list. If each element is equally likely to be searched, then the linear search has an average case of n+1/2 comparisons. But the average case can be affected if the search probabilities for each element vary.", "Linear search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables, allow significantly faster searching for all but shorter lists.", "The below graphical representation shows why linear search is not implemented in practical scenarios, and instead, a method like the binary search algorithm is used.", "The graph shows that as the number of elements in a list or array increase, the number of comparisons also increases linearly for a linear search algorithm. Hence, for practical problems linear search is never recommended and an alternate method called the binary search algorithm is preferable.", "Let us understand the step-wise intuition of the binary search algorithm along with its implementation in python and finally analyze its performance measures.", "Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items. It works by repeatedly dividing in half the portion of the list that could contain the item until you have narrowed down the possible locations to just one. Let us understand the step-wise implementation of this algorithm.", "Let us consider an example to gain better intuition of the working of the following steps mentioned above. The below diagram is a representation of a sorted array with 17 elements. We are trying to locate the position of item 7. Let\u2019s analyze the step-wise procedure of how this task is performed.", "The above diagram contains a list of 17 elements ranging from 0 to 16. The first step is to divide the list by bisecting it into two halves with the above-mentioned formula of (L+R)//2 which would be (16+0)//2 and would return a value of 8.", "The element at the 8th position is 14, but the desired value is 7. Hence all the elements from the 8th position to the last position can be eliminated. And steps 2 and steps 3 can be repeated again. (0+7)//2 would return a position of 3 and the value of 6. The desired value is greater than the found value. Hence, we can follow the fifth step and repeat step 2 and step 3 again.", "Finally, The value of 4 can be found successfully with this procedure of the binary search algorithm. To understand this in a more algorithmic manner, I would highly recommend the viewers to check out the following explanation from wiki.", "In this section, let us get our hands dirty with some coding. We will start of with the implementation of the linear search algorithm, which is quite simple and can be done in a few lines of code. The following code block can be used to perform a linear search.", "The linear search algorithm is simple to implement, as shown in the code above. You iterate through the entire array until you find the location of the element you are looking for. Once you have successfully found the number, you can print out the position where the item was found. The output \u201cfour\u201d shows that the desired element was found in the fourth location of the array or list.", "Next, we will look at the implementation of the binary search algorithm. There are many methods of implementing this algorithm, like the iterative or recursive way. In this article, we will focus on a simple method of performing this task.", "The same problem explained in the intuition is solved with the binary search algorithm, and this can be done from the code block shown below.", "The implementation of the binary search algorithm in the above code block is exactly as explained in the previous section of the article. The code is a representation of the exact step-wise implementation of the procedure for the binary search. The output \u201cfour\u201d shows that the desired element was found in the fourth location of the array or list.", "I would highly recommend checking out some of the articles in the reference section at the end of this article to gain a better understanding of the implementations as well as gain more knowledge on the coding of each of the methods of the binary search algorithm.", "In terms of the number of comparisons, the performance of binary search can be analyzed by viewing the run of the procedure on a binary tree. The below diagram is a representation of the following.", "The root node of the tree is the middle element of the array. The middle element of the lower half is the left child node of the root, and the middle element of the upper half is the right child node of the root.", "The rest of the tree is built in a similar fashion. Starting from the root node, the left or right subtrees are traversed depending on whether the target value is less or more than the node under consideration.", "Average Case Scenario = O(log n)", "Worst Case Scenario = O(log n)", "Binary search runs in logarithmic time in the worst case, making O(log n) comparisons, where n is the number of elements in the array. Binary search is faster than linear search except for small arrays. However, the array must be sorted first to be able to apply binary search.", "There are specialized data structures designed for fast searching, such as hash tables, that can be searched more efficiently than binary search. However, binary search can be used to solve a wider range of problems, such as finding the next-smallest or next-largest element in the array relative to the target even if it is absent from the array.", "Binary search requires three pointers to elements, which may be array indices or pointers to memory locations, regardless of the size of the array. Therefore, the space complexity of binary search is O(1) in the Word RAM model of computation.", "Although the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky", "In the modern day, the binary search algorithm has a function of its own in almost every major programming language and can be implemented easily by making use of such functions. Python provides the bisect module for performing the binary search algorithm with more ease.", "In this article, we discussed the procedural implementation of the binary search algorithm which is one of the basic algorithms in computer science. It can efficiently find an index of an element in a sorted list by repeatedly halving the search range until the element is found, so its running time is a logarithm of the list size.", "We also got our hands dirty with some additional python code and briefly understood how it works in a scenario in a list of sorted elements. After its implementation in Python, we covered some of the other essential topics related to its performance, such as space and time complexity, which is a useful measure in the field of computer science to validate the working of the models.", "If you have any queries related to the content in this article, then feel free to hit me up below, and I will make sure I get back to you with a response as soon as possible. If you want to add any additional points of your own to this post, then feel free to do so.", "Check out some of my other articles that you might enjoy reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end.
