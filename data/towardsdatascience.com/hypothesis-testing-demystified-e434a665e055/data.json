It is the point where you get to the conclusions, where you (can) find answers to the questions you were searching answers for. These should be in the form of simple yes/no questions. Hypothesis testing is the stage of a statistical study in which you are translating math into English.", "Hypothesis testing is, most probably, what your boss wants from you if you are in the role of a statistician. If you go to him and just say something like: \u201c\u00b51 = 135 and \u00b52 = 140\u201d, then he/she may say: \u201cOK. But\u2026 what do these numbers mean for my business? Is it good? Is it bad?\u201d. It would be much better to tell him something like: \u201cI found statistical evidence that your new marketing strategy brought us more profit than the previous one\u201d.", "At this point, of hypothesis testing, it is time for you to turn all those nasty numbers obtained so far from your dataset into easy to understand statements about your problem of interest.", "Hypothesis testing has some similarities with one of the simplest methods of proof from mathematical logic: Proof by contradiction. Hypothesis testing can be thought of as being the probabilistic counterpart of proof by contradiction.", "Let us refresh our memories first about this method. How does proof by contradiction work?", "Let us say we want to prove a statement, call it A. When we use proof by contradiction, we start by assuming the opposite of A (denoted ~A or not A) as being true, and then we try to reach to a contradiction (a statement that is always false). If we reach a contradiction, then this means that our assumption that ~A is true, should be false, and therefore A should be true.", "The idea of hypothesis testing is similar to that of proof by contradiction, but this time ~A is called the \u201cnull hypothesis\u201d and denoted by H0, and A is called the \u201calternative hypothesis\u201d and denoted by H1. Reaching a contradiction (that is, obtaining a result that cannot be true) is now reaching a result that can be true with low probability. How low this probability should be? An often-used value is 0.05; this threshold value is called a significance level and is denoted by \u03b1. So, if the probability of your observed data given the null hypothesis is \u2264 \u03b1, then you consider this probability being too low for H0 to be true; so, you will reject H0 and therefore accept H1. In the case of hypothesis testing, instead of proving H1 (that is, with 100% confidence; this is the case for mathematical logic proofs), you are 1-\u03b1 confident that H1 is true.", "Note that we can accept only H1, not H0. Just because we may fail to reject H0 sometimes, this does not mean that we accept it. As in the case of proof by contradiction, just because we may not have a good idea of how to reach a contradiction once we assumed ~A to be true, this does not necessarily mean that ~A is true.", "Concluding that H0 is true based on the initial assumption that H0 is true would be a paradox, therefore we can only reject H0.", "For doing hypothesis testing we need to make some assumptions first: we assume our observations X1, X2, \u2026, Xn to be i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) with a probability distribution P\u03b8; where \u03b8 is a fixed but unknown parameter (it can also be a vector of more scalar parameters) belonging to \u03f4 (capital theta; the set of all possible parameters for P\u03b8 family of probability distributions).", "In the context of hypothesis testing we want to make statements about the parameter \u03b8. For that we take 2 disjoint subsets of \u03f4: \u03f40 and \u03f41, and then consider the following 2 hypotheses:", "By convention, H0 is the one that should be rejected, and H1 is the one that we want to accept.", "As an example consider the following scenario:", "You want to study if university graduates end up having the job they wanted before applying to university, or they tend to change their mind? For that, you go out there and collect some data about randomly selected people that graduated more than 5 years ago and for each of them you write down a 1 if he/she has the job they wanted before university, or a 0 otherwise. Then you consider this data as being i.i.d. Bernoulli(p) and want to test whether p > \u00bd or not. So, we have these hypotheses:", "So, how do we decide whether to reject the null hypothesis or not? We use a random variable to make this decision. This r.v. (random variable) is a function of our data that outputs only 0 (do not reject) or 1 (reject). For a fixed parameter \u03b8, this r.v. has a Bernoulli distribution. This r.v. that we use for making the decision is called a test, and is denoted by \u03a8.", "A test has usually one of the following forms:", "Where: \u03a8 is a function of the observed data X\u00ad1, \u2026, Xn, and the notation 1{.} is an indicator random variable that takes value 1 when the expression inside braces is true, and 0 otherwise. Tn is a random variable called a test statistic, and c is a constant.", "The first form is called a one-sided test because the test is 1 only when Tn is on the right side of the constant c. The second form is called a two-sided test because the test can be 1 when Tn is on both sides of c; either Tn > c or Tn < -c will result in the test being 1.", "As you can see above, our test depends on the data that we observe, which is random and we model it as r.v.s X1, \u2026, Xn. So, the result of our test is, well \u2026, random. We have no guarantee that it will always give us a 1 when we should reject H0, or that it will always give us a 0 when we should not reject H0. Whatever test we may choose, it can give us some errors.", "There are 2 types of errors that may occur in hypothesis testing:", "Type I error occurs when we reject H0, but in reality, it is true. Type II error is when we fail to reject H0, but it is actually false.", "The probabilities of both type I and type II errors depend on the true parameter \u03b8, so they are functions of \u03b8.", "Probability of type I error, denoted by \u03b1\u03a8:", "This is the probability that our test indicates 1 when the true \u03b8 belongs to \u03f40. Each different \u03b8 from \u03f40 can give us a different probability of type I error.", "Probability of type II error, denoted by \u03b2\u03a8:", "This is the probability that our test indicates 0 when the true \u03b8 belongs to \u03f41. Each different \u03b8 from \u03f41 can give us a different probability of type II error.", "We want our test to have a small probability of error. So, we want to choose the test statistic Tn and the constant c in such a way that minimizes the probability of each of these 2 types of errors. But minimizing both types of errors at the same time is a hard problem. In the worst case in which the true parameter \u03b8 is at the boundary between \u03f40 and \u03f41, the probabilities of the 2 types of errors are complementary; when one is small, the other is large and there\u2019s no way we can make both of them small.", "What we do instead is to prioritize type I error. We set an upper bound on the probability of type I error such that we also get a reasonable type II error.", "Why we prioritize type I error? Type I error is when H0 is true and we reject it. In hypothesis testing, rejecting H0 is the thing that leads to \u201cdiscovery\u201d, to proving our initial guess (H1). A big type I error means that we prove many false things. And we do not want that. We prefer to conclude H1 less often, but when we do so, to be pretty confident that what we concluded is actually true.", "The upper bound that we fix for type I error is called the significance level of our test, and is denoted by \u03b1, therefore:", "The smallest level \u03b1 at which the test \u03a8 rejects H0 is called the p-value of the test \u03a8.", "This may sound a little confusing at first. What is the difference between \u03b1 and p-value? \u03b1 is a number that you choose, you fix it ahead of time. You can choose \u03b1 before collecting any data or doing any experiment. A p-value is computed based on the observed data, it is the smallest number that you can fix for \u03b1 so that you are still able to reject H0 after you compute the test based on the observed data. The smaller the p-value, the more confident you are to reject H0.", "Based on the formula of a test that we showed previously:", "we may be tempted to think that what we discussed so far applies only when we want to compare a parameter of a single sample to a constant, and that Tn should be some kind of an estimator for that parameter.", "What if we do not want to test how the parameter of some sample compares to a constant, but instead test how it compares to the parameter of another sample? Do we need to come up with another formula for a test? No. We can use the same formulation of a test and keep valid all we discussed so far. The only thing that we should do is to impose a particular form on Tn:", "Where Un and Vn are computed based on different samples. By using this Tn, we can test if Un is greater than Vn. If you are interested only in the absolute difference between Un and Vn, just put them in absolute value and use a 2-sided test.", "So far, we discussed hypothesis testing just in general, without describing a specific way of doing it. In the formula of a test that we have shown, Tn can be any random variable. Any weird and non-intuitive random variable that is based on our data and can reject H0 with at most \u03b1 probability of error will be a good candidate for a test statistic.", "However, a commonly used approach is to use Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to do hypothesis testing. If we use an average of i.i.d. random variables (our data) as an estimator of the parameter that we want to test, then CLT implies that this average will have a normal distribution as the sample size n \u2192 \u221e. Then we take this quantity and standardize it (subtract mean and divide by standard deviation) and consider this as our test statistic Tn. A Tn computed in this way will have a standard normal distribution. This is a well-known probability distribution that we can then use to determine the constant c that we need for our test in order to meet our chosen level \u03b1.", "Below is an image of this in the one-sided case:", "The constant c is the threshold value between the rejection region (colored in blue) and the non-rejection region. If Tn > c (Tn falls in the rejection region) we reject H0, otherwise we fail to reject. That c is computed based on the chosen value for \u03b1; it is calculated so that the area of the rejection region is \u03b1. We can find c either by using a table or a calculator/software package.", "A p-value, in this case, is the area of the region to the right of the value we obtain for Tn. We can also test for Tn < -c, in which case things would be similar, but the rejection region would be to the left of -c.", "Below is illustrated a two-sided test:", "In the case of a 2-sided test, things would be similar, but \u03b1 is now split between the 2 sub-regions: Tn < -c and Tn > c. Each one of these 2 regions has an area of \u03b1/2.", "If you have a large enough sample size (say, of a few hundred), then your test statistic Tn will be very close to a standard normal distribution, and the sample variance will be very close to the true variance. Therefore, this method is one of the easiest and best ways to do hypothesis testing.", "The downside of approximating Tn by a standard normal is that it will be inaccurate for small sample sizes.", "There are mainly two sources of errors in the case of a small sample:", "So, what we can do if we have a relatively small sample size?", "One method that we can use to overcome the problem of estimating the variance is the Student\u2019s t-test. Student\u2019s t-test is a test in which Tn follows a Student\u2019s t-distribution (the name Student comes from the fact that it was first published under the pseudonym \u201cStudent\u201d by William Sealy Gosset in 1908).", "The t-distribution is similar to a standard normal one, but it has as parameter something called a degree of freedom (df), which is just the sample size minus one (df = n-1). When df is large (in the order of hundreds) a t-distribution is pretty close to a standard normal distribution. As df gets smaller, the bell-shaped curve starts flattening a little and letting more probability under its tails. As a consequence, when we have a small sample, we need a bigger value for Tn to reject H0 in order to account for the errors that may arise from variance estimation.", "Theoretically, for Tn to have a t-distribution, the random variables X1, \u2026, Xn need to be normally distributed. But, in practice, the t-distribution should model well-enough the test statistic Tn if n > 30 (the rule of thumb in CLT) or if X1, \u2026, Xn are close to a normal distribution.", "T(n-1) is the t-distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.", "Let us come back to an example stated a little above: \u201cWe want to study if university graduates end up having the job they wanted before applying to university, or they tend to change their mind?\u201d", "We will model our data as n i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables with parameter p. Each one of these variables will have a value of 1 if that person has the job, he/she wanted before university, or 0 otherwise. The parameter p represents the probability of getting a 1.", "We want to conclude that most people change their mind. In terms of our assumed model that is: p < \u00bd. So, we will state our hypotheses as follows:", "For this hypothesis test, we want to use a significance level of \u03b1 = 0.05.", "I do not have any real data for this, so I will just come up with some numbers as an example. Let us say the sample size is 81, sample mean is 0.4 and sample variance is 0.24. For this sample size, we want to use a Student\u2019s t-test.", "Now let us assume H0 to be true. This means that p \u2265 \u00bd. But we need only one value for p to use in computing Tn. We will choose the value of p from the interval [1/2, 1] that can lead to the biggest error: p = \u00bd. We want to be cautious, that is why we assume the worst value of p for our test. In this way, if we reject, we can be really confident of our result.", "Now, let us compute the test statistic:", "To see if this test statistic falls in the rejection region we will use a t-distribution table (like the one here):", "We look in the table\u2019s header (on the line where it says \u201cone-tail\u201d because we are doing a one-sided test) for our chosen \u03b1, in our case 0.05. Then we look for the row with our degree of freedom (80). The value that we find in the table at the intersection of our previously found column and row is the value of our constant c that is the threshold between rejection and non-rejection regions; in our case, this value is 1.664. But these tables are made considering the rejection region in the right. In our problem, the rejection region is on the left side. Because the t-distribution is symmetric about 0 it does not matter that much, we just take the negative of what we find in the table. So, c = -1.664 is our delimiter. If Tn < -1.664 we reject H0, otherwise we fail to reject.", "Our test statistic was Tn \u2248 -1.84 < -1.664, therefore we reject the null hypothesis and accept the alternative hypothesis H1. So, we conclude that p < \u00bd. In English, this would be: \u201cWe have statistical evidence that most people end up having other jobs than their initial thought before university\u201d.", "In our case, the p-value is the area under the t-distribution curve where t \u2264 -1.84. For computing this quantity you can use an online calculator like the one here.", "Our p-value is 0.0347 and this is the smallest \u03b1 for which we could reject H0.", "I hope you found this information useful and thanks for reading!", "This article is also posted on my own website here.
