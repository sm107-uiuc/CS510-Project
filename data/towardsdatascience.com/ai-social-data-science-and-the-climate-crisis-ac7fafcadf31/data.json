The last few days I have been considering how to put together a program that would unite people from different backgrounds to explore the topic of artificial intelligence. Doing so led me into the path of exploring firstly four different modules relating to: AI, science and technology studies (STS) and computer science ethics. To begin with I would say there does not seem to be very fruitful to mesh them together without a thought or regard for each field and their historical connotations, literature, personas and so on. However new practitioners or researchers who increasingly combine an understanding or expertise in social science with the performative skills in programming is edging into the conceived emerging field of social data science. I find this worthy of further exploration.", "There could be a variety of ways to go forward or towards this emerging field, however it would be likely to have a population of social scientists reaching towards the computer science domain or vice versa. In one way I would like to imagine this act of reaching out towards two different fields to be building a bridge.", "Yet there is likely to be a lot of border policing and confusion. Have not political scientists started to use quantitative methods integrating machine learning techniques? It does seem to be the cases in certain environments, although it seems small at least at the University of Oslo.", "Have not economists already taken programming to be more in line with business goals \u2013 shaping the business intelligence sphere or \u2018quants\u2019 with finance combined with maths and computer science. It was these \u2018quants\u2019 that was said to develop into the field of data science \u2014 falling in between. I have described data science several times before, but I keep finding new reasons to repeat it again:", "\u201cData Science is successfully adding value to all the business models by using statistics and deep learning to make better decisions and improve hiring. It is also being used to crunch the previous data and predict possible situations and risk so that we can work on avoiding them.\u201d", "Even what data science is is defined along these lines, here on Wikipedia:", "\u201cData science is a \u201cconcept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods\u201d in order to \u201cunderstand and analyze actual phenomena\u201d with data.\u201d", "In describing \u2018Actual phenomena\u2019, of course I presume they are not referring to philosophical phenomenology:", "Phenomenology is the study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure of an experience is its intentionality, its being directed toward something, as it is an experience of or about some object.", "In that sense the \u2018actual\u2019 phenomenon is \u2018data\u2019 as experienced by someone, then quantified.", "Could there be a balance struck between these \u2018actual phenomena\u2019 and what is actually happening? Methods are being applied with solutions tested and actions taken as feedback on a screen, although UX or UI designers are hired to decipher these, anthropologists as well \u2013 there seems few in between who have a foot in different waters. The UX/UI may be one of the closest and several social scientists dabble in code or go fully into this direction professionally, taking on the title of qualitative researcher or developer.", "If theories from social science were to be comprehensively combined together with technology modules will it simply look like STS or different? Programming modules are getting their introduction in certain STS programs as well, for example in Sweden. There was an article written called Self-Efficacy in Programming among STS Students by Kasper Davidsson, Lars-\u00c5ke Larzon, Karl Ljunggren. Let me borrow a definition borrowed:", "\u201cAlbert Bandura \u2014 a Canadian psychologist known by many as the originator of the theory \u2014 defined self-efficacy as \u201c\u2026people\u2019s judgments of their capabilities to organize and execute courses of action required to attain designated types of performances\u201d", "The study was of a small scale, and they did say it could not be generalised, however I think bringing in this term is interesting. The perspectives of the practitioners or researchers in being shaped by technology is important.", "If the prior is the wish \u2014 to combine different fields into one module it is challenging to see how social data science could be the solution. Social Data Science as stated by the Alan Turing Institute where it is a research area says the following:", "\u201cThe group seeks to address the challenges associated with the vast quantities of new and heterogeneous data that are increasingly becoming available through two primary themes: developing foundational theories of human behaviour at diverse social and temporal scales; and identifying methodological challenges and solutions to enable social data science to deliver robust and credible results in key application domains.\u201d", "Is the social scientist expected to perform as a programmer or the computer scientist expected to enact the social science? If not are they floating in between towards a shared space of \u2018social data science\u2019?", "Striking this balance (or unbalance) becomes an activity that this field has to navigate within. This was done by data science previously, although we should not be quick jumping to historical conclusions in a new direction, we could still examine this reasoning.", "Finding a new for a place in between has a story of sorts, at least how it was popularised:", "\u201cMike Loukides, Vice President of Content Strategy for O\u2019Reilly Media helped to bring Data Science into the mainstream vernacular in 2010 with his article \u2018What is data science?\u2019 In the last few years, data science is increasingly being associated with the analysis of Big data. In the mid-2000s, DJ Patil at LinkedIn and Jeff Hammerbacher at Facebook created data science teams specifically to derive business value out of the extremely large data being generated at by their websites.\u201d", "It was specifically to derive business value out of the extremely large data being generated.", "However data scientists grew out from an unbalance and confusion between being a computer scientist, analyst, researcher etc. according to DJ Patel.", "It became the place in between math & statistics, \u2018hacking skills\u2019 and substantive expertise.", "An R-blogger called GivenTheData posted this diagram likely inspired by the classical conception of data science. I enjoy the bit of confusion in between social science and computer science.", "Data science skills and data-driven computational social science as well as traditional empirical research is of interest.", "Then again one of the most prolific works of computational social science in my opinion is Limits to Growth (1972) which through its simulations introduced the concept of sustainability to the world.", "I think this particularly is the \u2018magic\u2019 or interesting aspect. However that may be me attempting to \u2018historify\u2019 social data science \u2014 make it part of its foundational history. All considered I think I am not completely wrong to say so, I can think of few works of more importance to society that combines social science with computational methods.", "Considering as humanity and realising the limitations of our earth was not groundbreaking at the time. Environmental movements and nature movements had been saying so since the industrial revolution (likely further back). However the novel element of computational capacity combined with social science thinking on behalf of society was \u2014 new and interesting! I quote from page 23:", "\u201cWe have used a computer as a tool to aid our own understanding of the causes and consequences of the accelerating trends that characterize the modern world, but familiarity with computers is by no means necessary to comprehend or to discuss our conclusions. The implications of those accelerating trends raise issues that go far beyond the proper domain of a purely scientific document. They must be debated by a wider community than that of scientists alone. Our purpose here is to open that debate.\u201d", "I can think of few greater problems than the climate crisis and the amount of attention it now holds for children and youth is immense. For me it holds a ravaging truth that shakes my very being into want for more action. This is thanks in part to these realisations of findings that combine different type of expertise enabling an understanding of a situation.", "Data science on its own cannot do this, or perhaps it can\u2026 I am uncertain because I hear so few data scientists speak of these ailments or issues. Data science was created to: \u201c\u2026derive business value out of the extremely large data\u2026\u201d however that is not likely what it means for everyone. The general narrative goes in this direction for large companies or small companies wanting to \u2018turn their raw data into gold\u2019 into \u2018oil\u2019 or another conceived product for business value.", "It was a very strange feeling when I searched for \u2018social data science\u2019 on Wikipedia. Getting back that it: \u201c\u2026does not exist. You can ask for it to be created,\u201d well I am \u2014 asking for it to be created.", "Considering where this approaches have contributed previously at least in some cases I may mildly suggest that we continue moving into this direction especially in regards to artificial intelligence.", "If we manage to combine concerns about the environment, inequality, diversity together with computer science then perhaps we could make valuable contributions to understand the implications better (although they seem obvious). One often mentioned saying needs a line of extension which historically it used to hold, as a compliment:", "Jack of all trades, master of none,though oftentimes better than master of one.", "In the argument for multidisciplinary approaches I want to mention one of those who is considered amongst the founders of the field of artificial intelligence, Herbert A. Simon . His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science.", "Then again it could be said that he was not a master of none, he was a master of several fields. However we may need other type of social scientists or those in between to map out what went wrong or understand the context and the solution in a more comprehensive manner.", "If we return to the social sciences in the intersection of computer science and quantitative methods I think there is much of interest to be gleamed. With insights from sociology, human geography, anthropology, development, law, politics, linguistics, history and education we may gain more. When I say gain more I think it is worth mentioning that \u2018gainful\u2019 must work both for humanity and the ecology that humans are part of.", "Machine learning techniques in the field of artificial intelligence can be used for much good, however we may generalise too quickly if we believe it should add clear value without understanding society. Developing the solution and the prototype has spun out in applications of great consequence for social life. I have seen many great initiatives from data scientists to understand society, yet those who I respect the most recognise the importance of collaboration for responsible use of technology.", "Intelligent people can still be stupid, especially: having or showing a great lack of common sense. The dictionary example brought up when you Google stupid is: \u201cI was stupid enough to think she was perfect.\u201d When we conceive of artificial intelligence many conceive of perfection, or strive for perfection. It is a goal out of reach that we are not likely to reach and if we do getting there will likely be severely damaging to an already decimated planet both in terms of biodiversity and pollution.", "I think honestly that is rather stupid, that so few scientists in the field of AI or Data Science talk of the climate crisis. As well that they have not done so earlier. When I say \u2018they\u2019 my categorisation is of course somewhat misplaced and those who were perhaps the most advanced in terms of prediction has been the scientists working with the climate or predicting the weather.", "In fact Norwegian meteorologist Ragnar Fj\u00f8rtoft performed the first successful numerical weather prediction in 1950 using the ENIAC electronic computer. On the other hand curiously, the Wikipedia article on weather forecasting has no mention of \u2018climate change\u2019 or \u2018climate crisis\u2019, which further illustrates my point.", "We can have data without a common sense or purpose; we can have applications of AI not rooted in an ecological or social understanding of earth. Ahistorical and misrepresented as solutions \u2013 when in fact they are causing further problems.", "This, at least I argue, is why the fields of data science and AI need a more distinct addition of social science and humanities in the broadest sense. Despite failings of fields or disciplines in these areas to tackle issues there is a great chance to learn and get closer to the matter at hand \u2013 striving for a thriving planet where biodiversity and ecological rooted sustainability is of the highest priority.", "This is #500daysofAI and you are reading article 163. I write one new article about or related to artificial intelligence every day for 500 days.", "Your home for data science.
