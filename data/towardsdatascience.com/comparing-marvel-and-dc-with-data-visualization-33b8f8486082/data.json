Here I explain how I created a visualization to compare Marvel and DC universes using data from Wikidata.", "My goal was to define a simple visualization to show differences between Marvel and DC in a clear and fast way. I created a metaphor for each universe and showed them side-by-side as galaxies in a single view.", "You can find how I extracted the data from Wikipedia (easy!) and previous discussions in the other posts of my series on Comics Data:", "You find the final visualization here:", "Visualization techniques such as Bar Charts and Scatterplots are very common but are limited. For a data set with multiple information, a personalized visualization that group different visualization metaphors is necessary.", "When I was designing the visualization for the comics data, comparing two galaxies using suns and planets was the first thing that came to mind.", "In fact, Wikipedia already use the term fictional universes to represent the comics. Here, I simplified things and used the concept of galaxy.", "Besides the connected meaning between comic and galaxy, people are used to the structure of a galaxy diagram. A sun in the center; some ellipses representing orbits; small and big circles representing planets, stars and other bodies.", "I redefined my problem as comparing Marvel and DC\u2019s galaxies, exploring the visual differences the drawing of galaxies might have.", "Below, I show some of my drafts regarding the galaxies\u2019 structure and meaning, their position and shape, and other items related to coding \u2014 React components, class attributes, methods, etc.", "Each fictional universe is here a Galaxy with a sun. The sun represents its brand (Marvel or DC) and bodies represent the fictional characters. The sun has lots of power, doesn\u2019t it? It makes sense.", "The set of metaphors represents the number and importance of characters, their superpowers, and their genders. I also introduced connections that reveal their partners and children.", "These are the attributes that guided the visualization design:", "The closer the characters are to the sun, the more superpowers they have.", "Each orbit (ellipse) represents a range of numbers of superpowers. The first, farthest to the sun, represents 0 superpowers; the second represents 1\u20132 superpowers, and so on.", "Batman is far away from the sun because he doesn\u2019t have superpowers.", "Mister Sinister is close to the sun because he has 7 superpowers.", "With the orbit metaphor, we can see how Marvel and DC compare regarding the use of numerous superpowers.", "Marvel seems to have limited the use of superpowers more than DC.", "In this comparison, note that DC has more characters in the entire galaxy. This could cause a higher density around the sun.", "The bigger the circles are, the greater is the number of works they are present in or the number of derived works (it sums them). The sum of the two is what I defined as importance.", "If a character has importance equals to zero, the body is represented by a purple dust \u2014 circles with the smallest valid radius. When they have importance equals to 1 or more, their size is proportional to it.", "Wolverine is the biggest body in the Marvel\u2019s galaxy because he is present in 53 works (derived works included).", "Using size to represent the importance pops up the most explored characters. By doing so, it is easy to check how galaxies compare considering the number of large bodies and dust.", "While Marvel focused only on Wolverine, DC focused on Superman and Batman.", "Still on importance, I defined that colours would relate to it too. When a character has more works than the average, I color it with yellow; otherwise, it is gray. Purple represents 0 works (dust).", "I grouped genders into two main categories: males and non-males, which represents females, transgenders, and others such as the agender Phoenix Force.", "Excluding characters with undefined gender, 80% of Marvel\u2019s characters and 72% of DC\u2019s characters present in over 10 works are male.", "Those numbers get more balanced when we consider characters that appear in fewer works: 67% (Marvel) and 67% (DC) when considering characters with at least 1 work registered on Wikipedia; and 61% (Marvel) and 64% (DC) when considering characters with 0 or more registered works.", "Giving that representability and diversity are been more discussed these days and because most of non-males are small bodies in the galaxies, I highlighted the non-males using white.", "Yet, we can barely see the white circles. This reflects the gender gap that was being formed throughout the history of comics.", "There are many reasons a Fictional Universe can have this gap; among them is the comic audience \u2014 comics created focusing on male readers may have more male characters.", "Jacques Nyemb wrote an interesting article about this topic with his experience as a comic creator regarding the audience and his characters\u2019 race and gender: Race, Gender and Comics\u2026 Oh My!", "\u201cUse their perspectives to tell stories and include all kinds of people. This inspires people to see more than color or gender but rather the contents of their characters.\u201d \u2014 Jacques Nyemb", "Two types of relationship were extracted from Wikidata and represented by edges, partners in red and children in blue. Partners can be spouses and non-spouses.", "I could not find any particular difference, like one network having more dense hubs than the other. You can see in the images below:", "I didn\u2019t represent direction of the edges (children-edges). They were designed to be highlighted when the user selects one character to be analysed, as presented in the next examples.", "In the image below, I show the result of clicking on Wolverine and Storm. It is a network that allow us to know that Wolverine had many partners and 2 children (registered on Wikipedia) while Storm had 3 partners and 0 children.", "Similar pattern is found in the DC galaxy. In the image below we see that Wonder Woman has 3 partners and no children; Superman has 3 children and 7 partners.", "To show the general usage of superpowers and occupations, I created bar charts the same way I implemented here.", "You can see the distribution of these two attributes and visualize the characters\u2019s names and other details when you put your mouse over a bar.", "Because I wanted to give an additional information on these attributes, I added a third information to define the bars\u2019 colors that compares genders.", "I use the number of non-males and males from each occupation/superpower to highlight the cases where there are fewer males than other genders. Regular bars are in gray; highlighted ones are in orange.", "These are the most used superpowers by Marvel and DC:", "These are the most used occupations by Marvel and DC:", "I implemented all the visualizations using Javascript, React and D3.", "The complete code is in my GitHub repository: https://github.com/heberleh/comics-universe", "I extracted the data from Wikidata in June 2019.", "The complete Comics Series I did explains all the steps from extracting the data to visualizing it. You find all three articles in the beginning of this one.", "Placement/projection algorithm uses the ellipse equation to compute x,y for each node from each orbit with radius a and b. When it is dust (work=0), the algorithm uses a random increment to compute a different x, y. This spread the dust around its original point in the orbit, computed with the ellipse equation, creating an interesting effect.", "If you are a Comic expert and found any gap in the data, consider contributing to Wikipedia and Wikidata by inserting the new information in their system.", "Please leave your comments or private notes about any of the topics.", "Thank you for reading my article!", "Your home for data science.
