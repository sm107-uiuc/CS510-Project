After doing quite a bit of both, I found that the fields have a tremendous amount in common. The process for making a new dish almost directly mirrors the data science project life-cycle. Over time, I have come to use the cooking / data science analogy to explain my work to those not working in the field.", "When a chef is starting out with a new dish, he has to understand what the current menu is missing. He needs to figure out what dish can complete the selection or replace what is being removed.", "As data scientists, we need to start with a question as well. Usually it comes through business understanding. We need to figure out what opportunities can create the greatest value for our organization.", "After the chef has determined what type of dish he would like to make, he goes to the fridge to gather ingredients. If he doesn\u2019t have the necessary ingredients, he takes a trip to the store to collect them.", "As data scientists, our data points are our ingredients. We may have some on hand, but we still might have to collect more through web scraping, SQL queries, etc.", "Much like raw ingredients, data isn\u2019t usually very useful on its own. Once we have combined our data and analyzed it, we eventually find its true value. Salt isn\u2019t generally consumed by itself, but almost every meal would be lacking without it.", "Food can be covered with dirt, pesticides, or other hazardous matter. It is important to wash ingredients before consuming them to avoid bad flavors and illness.", "It is also important to our clean data. Poor quality \u201cdirty\u201d data can produce disastrous results for our models. Admittedly, the way we clean data is a little different than how a chef cleans vegetables. We need to focus on cleaning up data types, imputing null values, and removing outliers.", "Sometimes chefs need to adjust the composition of their ingredients before putting them into their dish. They crack eggs, chop onions, and portion meats before cooking them.", "This process closely mirrors feature engineering in data science. Sometimes we need to change our data so that it will produce the best results for our models. We can group our data, scale it, encode it, or transform it. These changes can help to improve the interpretability and accuracy of our output.", "When cooking from scratch, most chefs taste their food as they go. They need to understand the flavor profile of each ingredient and how the ingredients will likely taste together. After understanding these relationships, they will be able to determine which ingredients to include in the final meal.", "For data scientists, it is also important to explore our data before we build our model. We have to understand the relationships between our variables to avoid multicollinearity (in some models).", "After a chef assembles his ingredients, it is time to choose how to cook the meal. There are many cooking options available, he can choose to bake, broil, boil, sautee, grill, sous vide \u2026 you get the point. Based on what he is cooking, he likely knows which of these options will produce the best result.", "This is not unlike our model selection. We know based on the problem we are trying to solve (regression, classification, or clustering) which models might be best, but we still have to narrow it down from there. It is in our best interest to try a few of them to see which one produces the best result.", "Chefs are not done once they choose a cooking medium. They still have to figure out how long to cook their meal and at what temperature. These variables are integral to the success of the meal.", "This bares resemblance to the model tuning process for a machine learning model. We have to make some tweaks to our algorithms to make sure that we are getting the best result. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t think there is gridsearch for cooking methods\u2026 yet.", "Our chef has finished cooking his meal, but he still isn\u2019t done! He needs to review the results. He wants to make sure that it isn\u2019t just him who finds it delicious. It is important for him to have the other chefs in the kitchen taste the dish. If he caters only to his taste, his meal may not have the broad appeal that he is hoping for.", "This is much like the cross validation process in data science. We want to make sure that our model generalizes well, so we test it on new data and compare the results.", "If the food meets an acceptable standard, it is important to make it appealing when it is plated. Plating the food adds to the sensory experience of the chef\u2019s guests.", "In data science, we have to explain our models to business stakeholders. We have to produce beautiful visualizations that add to the understanding of our work.", "Both plating and data visualization could be considered their own fields because of their tremendous depths.", "Finally, if the chef likes the result and would like to reproduce the meal, he needs to write down a recipe. He should also train the other chefs in the kitchen to produce this same result.", "For data scientists, it is important to document our code and to build systems to repeatedly execute our model.", "In cooking and data science, reproducibility is fundamental for long term success.", "When operating a restaurant, it is important for the process to be extremely simple for the customers. They should be able to order a meal, and the meal should be delivered to them consistently. They don\u2019t have to know how the meal is cooked, what the chefs are doing, or even what is going on in the kitchen.", "This is how a model API endpoint should work in data science. You should be able to send it a request (order), and get a reliable response (meal) without having to worry about how the sausage gets made.", "Your home for data science.
