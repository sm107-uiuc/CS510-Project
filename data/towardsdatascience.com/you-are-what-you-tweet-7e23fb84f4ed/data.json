Depression is the leading cause of disability worldwide and nearly 800,000 people every year die due to suicide. Suicide is the second leading cause of death in 15\u201329-year-olds. Diagnoses (and subsequent treatment) for depression are often delayed, imprecise, and/or missed entirely.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.", "Social media provides an unprecedented opportunity to transform early depression intervention services, particularly in young adults.", "Every second, approximately 6,000 Tweets are tweeted on Twitter, which corresponds to over 350,000 tweets sent per minute, 500 million tweets per day and around 200 billion tweets per year.", "Pew Research Center states that currently, 72% of public uses some type of social media.", "Because depression is an illness that so often requires the self-reporting of symptoms, social media posts provide a rich source of data and information that can be used to train an efficient model.", "The idea was to create a project that works to capture and analyze linguistic markers associated with the onset and persistence of depressive symptoms in order to build an algorithm that can effectively predict depression. To move forward the idea that linguistic markers in Tweets can be used to construct statistical models that can detect and even predict depression in ways that can complement and extend traditional approaches to diagnosis.", "Building an algorithm that can analyze Tweets exhibiting self-assessed depressive features can make it possible for individuals, parents, caregivers, and medical professionals to analyze social media posts for linguistic clues that signal deteriorating mental health far before traditional approaches currently do. Analyzing linguistic markers in social media posts allows for a low-profile assessment that can compliment traditional services and would allow for a much earlier awareness of depressive signs.", "While many previous studies of depression-related social media posts have relied on Facebook, fewer have focused on Twitter content. However, there are key differences between the two platforms that lead to uniquely different content, and Twitter content is uniquely valuable.", "While Facebook users frequently post under their real names to friends and family members, Twitter users often use pseudonyms and are more likely to be connected with users they have never met. This allows for a more anonymous means of communication, which may provide a less biased account of an individual\u2019s thoughts and experiences.", "Twitter also provides a broad population of users who may not ordinarily be likely to participate in mental-health related research as well as a broad spectrum of publicly available information, offering a way to overcome some of the limitations of traditional methods of data collection.", "Changes in language and activity have been consistently correlated with changes in activity on social media. Emotional language and linguistic features used in social media posts have been proven to indicate feelings that characterize major depression. People consistently use social media platforms like Twitter to share their thoughts and opinions in written form.", "Posts on Twitter are particularly useful for analysis because they are most commonly made in the course of daily activities and happenings. This provides a rich and consistent means for capturing behavioral attributes that are relevant to an individual\u2019s thinking, mood, socialization, communication, and activities.", "Over the last few years, there has been growing interest in using social media as a tool for public health, ranging from identifying the spread of flu symptoms to building insights about diseases based on Twitter posts. However, research on using social media for analyzing behavioral health disorders is still in its infancy.", "Park et al. (see below for references), found evidence that people post about their depression and even their treatment on social media. Eichstaedt, et al., found that Facebook language can predict depression in medical records. De Choudhury et al., examined linguistic and emotional correlates for postnatal changes of new mothers and built a statistical model to predict extreme postnatal behavioral changes using only prenatal observations. Reece, et al., developed computational models to predict the emergence of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder in Twitter users. This highlights the potential of social media as a source of signals about likelihood of current or future episodes of depression.", "This project works to expand the scope of social media-based mental health measures and use existing research that has proven the correlation between depression and specific linguistic features in order to build an algorithm that can predict text-based signs of depression.", "The use of linguistic markers as a tool in the analysis and diagnoses of depression has enormous potential. Depression can so quickly be seen in text, even without the use of complex models. Simply by collecting, cleaning, and processing available data, visual analysis alone can illuminate the difference between random Tweets and Tweets that have depressive characteristics.", "Once the Tweets for this project were cleaned, it was easy to see the difference between the two datasets by creating a word cloud with the cleaned Tweets. The differences between the two datasets were clear:", "The potential of linguistic analysis in the arena of mental health cannot be overstated. By analyzing a person\u2019s words, you have a clear and valuable window into his or her mental state.", "Even the simplest analysis of social media can provide us with unprecedented access into individuals thoughts and feelings and lead to substantially greater understanding and treatment of mental health.", "After deciding to look at the connection between mental health and social media, it became apparent that the most effective way to begin this process would be to focus specifically on one area of mental health and one social media platform. Because depression is such a wide-spread issue, it made the most sense to focus on depression and its associated research.", "While Facebook has been studied repeatedly and a wealth of information exists on using Facebook posts to detect and analyze mental health, Twitter seemed to be a more intriguing platform to use. Tweets are fundamentally different from Facebook posts. They are more anonymous, shorter, faster, and more likely to be made quickly throughout the day and night. Additionally, Twitter data is readily available as existing datasets and it\u2019s simple to scrape and even stream, if desired.", "Once deciding that Twitter would be the way to go, finding (or creating) the optimal data was the next issue to tackle. There are existing datasets containing random Tweets and Tweets analyzed for sentiment, but sentiment analysis alone is not the same thing as depression analysis.", "Because there are no publicly available datasets containing \u201cdepressive\u201d Tweets, it was clear that I would have to create my own. One of the first ways that came to mind was using Tweepy, but Tweepy requires a developer account, meaning that a user would need to apply for a Twitter developer account. I wanted to make sure that this model would be easily reproducible to anyone interested in recreating it.", "After further research, TWINT turned out to be the optimal solution. TWINT allows any user the ability to search and scrape Tweets in a variety of ways and collect and store them.", "The question at that point became, what makes a Tweet indicative of depression? A number of research papers exist which look at lexical markers of depression, and they all agree on a number of points. People suffering from depression often subconsciously use very specific linguistic markers that indicate depression. It would be possible to build a dictionary including these terms and give them separate weights, but after reading a number of papers related to depression, mental health, and linguistics, it became clear that depression is something that is most frequently self-reported and, at least initially, self-assessed. Therefore, if a person says that she is depressed, it is extremely likely that she is depressed.", "Additionally, words like \u201chopeless,\u201d \u201clonely,\u201d and \u201csuicide\u201d are consistently associated with people who are suffering from feelings associated with depression, as are people who reference specific medications, even as generally as \u201cantidepressant.\u201d While it would be possible to build dictionaries that include all of the lexical features specific to depression, including specific terms, an increased use of personal pronouns, increased religious references, time-of-day analysis, and so on, it seemed that by scraping Tweets searched by very specific terms, those Tweets might contain all of the lexical features that a good model would need to learn and become both robust and accurate.", "After scraping Tweets using TWINT for a random 24 hour period, the data were combined into a single dataset. The Tweets were manually cleaned (for example, to remove references to economic and environmental rather than emotional depression), then cleaned and processed.", "The next issue involved the choice of classifier. There are a number of ways to analyze the information, but the reality is that mental health, specifically depression, is a subjective and complex topic. While it may be possible to quantify the degree to which one might be depressed based on a Tweet, the only real question that matters for this project is, is an individual exhibiting linguistic markers indicative of depression? Knowing the question and the subjective nature of mental illness, a binary classification model made the most sense for this project.", "While a logistic regression model made sense as a benchmark model, a Long Short Term Memory network (LSTM) model wound up being the most robust for the project at hand. A recurrent neural network allows information to be passed from one step of a network to another, and are ideal for sequences, lists, and other language processing problems. A LSTM is capable of learning long-term dependancies and work incredibly well on a large variety of problems. While RNNs have difficulty with long-term dependencies, LSTMs are explicitly designed to avoid the long-term dependency problem.", "It also made sense to add a convolutional layer. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are well suited for learning spatial structure from data and learns structure from the sequential data which it passes into the LSTM layer.", "Utilizing Word2vec also made the model much more robust. Word2vec is a two-layer neural net that processes text. Its input is a corpus of text and its output is a set of vectors. It turns text into a numerical form that deep nets can understand. Word2vec groups the vectors of similar words together in vectorspace. It\u2019s able to detect similarities mathematically. Given enough data, usage, and contexts, it can make highly accurate guesses about a word\u2019s meaning based on past appearances. These guesses can be used to establish a word\u2019s association with other words.The output of the Word2vec neural net is a vocabulary in which each item has a vector attached to it, which can be fed into a deep-learning net.", "The LSTM + CNN model takes in an input and then outputs a single number representing the probability that the tweet indicates depression. The model takes in each input sentence, replaces it with its embeddings, and then runs the new embedding vector through a convolutional layer. The convolutional layer passes the structure that it learns from the sequential data into a LSTM layer. The output of the LSTM layer is then fed into a Dense model for prediction.", "Once the model was designed and built, the issue then became refining the model to achieve the best results. Initially, the model suffered from overfitting, as evidenced in the graph. However, by decreasing the complexity of the model and increasing the dropout, a much more robust model was achieved and evidence of overfitting was eliminated.", "The data for this model were split into 60% training, 20% validation, and 20% testing sets. The testing set was kept separate until the end, ensuring the accuracy of the model. The final results were analyzed by looking at both accuracy and a classification report.", "The final architecture, parameters, and hyperparameters were chosen because they performed the best among all the tried combinations. The LSTM model takes in the tokenized tweets and feeds them into an embedding layer to get an embedding vector. The model takes in an input and then outputs a number representing the probability that the Tweet indicates depression. The model takes in each input Tweet, replaces it with its embeddings, and then runs the new embedding vector through a convolutional layer, which is well-suited for learning spatial structure from data. The convolutional layer takes advantage of this and learns structure from the sequential data, which it then passes into a standard LSTM layer. The output of the LSTM layer is fed into a dense model for prediction. The model has an embedding layer, a convolutional layer, and a Dense layer and uses max pooling, a dropout of 0.5, binary cross entropy loss, an Nadam optimizer, and a ReLu activation function in the first layer and a sigmoid activation function in the dense layer. Accuracy and loss are recorded and visualized and compared to a benchmark logistic regression model.", "With accuracy of 97%, this model proves to be an accurate and robust model that should prove effective for further development and use.", "Thanks for reading!
