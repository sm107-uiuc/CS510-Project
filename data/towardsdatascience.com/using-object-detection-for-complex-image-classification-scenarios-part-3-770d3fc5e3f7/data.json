Code for the series can be found here.", "In the previous tutorials we outlined our policy classification challenge and showed how we can approach it using the Custom Vision Cognitive Service. This tutorial introduces deep transfer learning as a means to leverage multiple data sources to overcome data scarcity problem.", "Before we try to build a classifier for our complex policy let\u2019s first look at the MNIST dataset to better understand key image classification concepts such as One Hot Encoding, Linear Modeling, Multi Layer Perception, Masking and Convolutions then we will put these concepts together and apply them to our own dataset.", "To train a classification model on MNIST we first need a way to represent our images and labels . There are many ways to represent images as either Tensors, Matrices or Vectors.", "For our first model we will use a vector representation. To do this we will first flatten the images to a long vector, in a manner similar to how one might unravel the thread of a cloth.", "When we apply this process to the image of a \u201c3\u201d below with dimensions of 28 x 28 image pixels, it will result in a flattened array of length 784 pixels.", "Now even though it is easy for us to look at this image and know it is a \u201c3\u201d, computers do not innately know this, we need to train a model to learn the how recognize that there is a \u201c3\u201d in the image. To do so we first need a way of representing the fact that the picture above contains an image of a \u201c3\u201d.", "To accomplish we associate each of our image with a one 1-hot encoded label, where the first index corresponds to digit 0 and the last one corresponds to digit 9.", "When we train a model we use this value as our target. The Keras code below loads the MNIST data", "Now that we have processed the MNIST images and their labels let\u2019s train our first image classification model using Keras.", "Logistic Regression (LR) is a fundamental machine learning technique that uses a linear weighted combination of features and generates probability-based predictions of different classes.", "To train the LR model above on MNIST, we apply the following steps:", "We then repeat this process on every image in our MNIST training set. For each image the weight values are updated so that they can better transform our input MNIST vectors into a value that matches it\u2019s label.", "When we finish running the steps above on our training set that is called an Epoch. After the first Epoch the values are still likely to be poor but after shuffling the dataset and repeating the process for a couple more Epochs the linear model learns linear weights that they converge on the decent representation of our data.", "The Keras code below show the the results of this process.", "One can imagine, that just incrementing and summing weight vector values based on one output is sub-optimal and in some cases unproductive.", "After all, not all data is linear.", "Take the following example for two image classes called spam and not-spam. No matter how we update our weights there is no linear weights we can learn to differentiate between these classes.", "But what if we had a way of combining multiple linear models for better representation power? We could then train a model that could differentiate between the two image classes.", "We can do this with a feed forward neural network such as the Multi Layer Perception.", "For MLPs to work we need a non linear activation function such as RELU for the sake of brevity we will treat this as a black box for more on this topic see the following post.", "The keras code below shows how to train a multi-layer perceptron on MNIST to get even better results than provided by our linear model.", "Notice how much more accurate, yet slower the MLP model was than our simple linear model. When we have images greater than 500Kb to 1Mb it gets increasingly more computationally expensive to process our image as a sequence additionally it becomes much more challenging to detect complex self referential and hierarchical patterns in our sequence data.", "This curse of dimensionality, was one of the key reasons the computer vision field was stalled until the advent of AlexNet in 2012.", "What if instead of passing our full image as vector representation we represented our image as a matrix (28x28) and instead extracted representative features for making a classification decision? That is how computer vision worked until recently. Lets take a deeper look at traditional image feature extraction by trying to use edges as a feature for a model.", "To do this we first we take an image such as the one below.", "Then we take a predefined image mask in this case a sobel matrix that is used to extract edges", "We apply the sobel matrix mask to our image in strides like a filter", "When we visualize the resulting image we get the following edges which we can use as features", "Creating masks such as the Sobel mask by hand is hard work and brittle what if we could learn masks? That is the key insight behind the convolutional neural network or CNN.", "A CNN is a deep neural network comprised of a bunch of layers in such a way that the output of one layer is fed to the next layer (There are more complex architecture that skip layers with dropout we will take this as a given for now). Usually, CNN\u2019s start with alternating between convolution layer and pooling layer (down sample), then end up with fully connected layer for the classification part.", "A convolution layer is a set of filters. Each filter is defined by a weight (W) matrix, and bias (b).", "Once we apply our mask we use pooling to reduce the dimensionality of the previous layer, which speeds up the network.", "There are many different pooling methods max and average pooling are the most common.", "Here an example of max and average pooling with a stride of 2:", "In most CNNs we stack a set of convolutional and pooling layers until we have a representational set of features that we can flatten and use for class predictions.", "The code below shows how to train a CNN on the MNIST images from above.", "In the MNIST dataset we had tens of thousands of training examples what if we have less data like in our policy task? That is where we can use transfer learning. Training a Deep Neural Network from scratch requires tens of thousands of images, but training one that has already learned features in the domain you are adapting it to requires far fewer.", "Transfer Learning, uses a pre-trained model and adapts it to our own problem. In transfer learning we leverage the features and concepts that were learned during the training of the base model. The input to the old and the new prediction layer is the same as the base model, we simply reuse the trained features. Then we train this modified network, either only the new weights of the new prediction layer or all weights of the entire network.", "This can be used, for instance, when we have a small set of images that are in a similar domain to an existing trained model. In our case, this means adapting a network trained on ImageNet images to the task of policy classification.", "The repo and post by Aditya Ananthram was used for inspiration for this section I strongly suggest you check it out.", "For this task, we have chosen to use pretrained MobileNet model as our base model. While there are many classification architectures we\u2019ll use MobileNet since it runs fast on a CPU and provides strong results.", "The code below shows how to train a custom MobileNet model on our custom policy using Keras.", "As we can see below the MobileNet is a really strong model for learning and representing our toy policy.", "However if our policy was more complex it might have been challenging for us to model this way.
