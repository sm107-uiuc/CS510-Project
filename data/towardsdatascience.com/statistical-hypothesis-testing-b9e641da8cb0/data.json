A sample statistic is a summarized/compressed probability distribution; for example, the Gaussian distribution can be summarized with mean and standard deviation. In the view of a frequentist statistician, said statistics are random variables when estimated from data with unknown fixed true values behind them \u2014 and the question is whether groups are significantly different with respect to these estimated values.", "Suppose, for example, that a researcher is interested in the growth of children and wonders whether boys and girls of the same age, e.g., twelve years old, have the same height; said researcher collects a data set of the random variable height in some school. In this case, the randomness of height arises due to the sampled population (the children he finds that are twelve years old) and not necessarily due to noise \u2014 unless the measuring method is very inaccurate (which leads into the field of metrology). Perhaps, different children from other schools would have led to different data.", "Assuming the research question is formulated as \u201cDo boys and girls of the same age have different height?\u201d, the first step would be to pose an hypothesis, though conventionally stated as null hypothesis (H0), i.e., boys and girls of the same age have the same height (there is no difference). This is analogous to thinking of possibly two distributions for the random variable height with fixed means \u03bc and standard deviations \u03c3, generating height values \u2014 however it is not known whether the means for boys (\u03bc1) and girls (\u03bc2) are the same. (Additionally, there is an alternative hypothesis (HA) which is often the negation of the null hypothesis.) The null hypothesis, in that case, would be", "Parameters of probability distributions can be estimated with the maximum likelihood method, i.e., by maximizing a likelihood function; the well-known equations for mean and standard deviation originate from this method. Using these formulas, the researcher computes two sample means, and he might obtain some difference between them. However, how can the researcher be sure that this difference is true and not randomly unequal zero, as (s)he could have also included other (or more) children in this study?", "In Figure 1, a simulation with a random number generator is presented. Samples are drawn from a Gaussian distribution for a random variable x (e.g., height) with \u03bc=156.4 and \u03c3=4.8; in each subplot, n samples are drawn and the sample mean is computed; this process is repeated 1000 times for each sample size, and the corresponding histogram of sample means is visualized. This is essentially the distribution of sample means for different sample sizes, and it becomes evident that this distribution becomes narrower with increasing sample size as the standard deviation of the mean, also known as standard error (s.e.), scales with the inverse square root of the sample size.", "On the one hand, the law of large numbers states that the average obtained from a large number of sampled random variables should be close to the expected value and will tend to become closer to the expected value as more samples are drawn. On the other hand, the central limit theorem states that the sample mean follows a normal distribution with the true mean and standard error.", "In Figure 1, for n=20, some sample means are 154 and others are 160 \u2014 just by chance. Imagine computing two sample means, one for boys and one for girls. If there is a difference, it could be so just by chance, particularly likely for small sample sizes. The \u201ctrue mean\u201d can be located with higher confidence by the calculated sample mean if enough samples are collected \u2014 but what if this is not given? In many studies, the number of participants is often limited.", "This is the origin of the so-called confidence interval. A confidence interval for an estimated statistic is a random interval calculated from the sample that contains the true value with some specified probability. For example, a 95% confidence interval for the mean is a random interval that contains the true mean with probability of 0.95. More precisely, if we were to take many random samples and compute a confidence interval for each one, about 95% of these intervals would contain the true mean, which is visualized by the simulation in Figure 2.", "This way, the distributions in Figure 1 can be approximated with a confidence interval. To compute a confidence interval, the quantiles z from the t-distribution corresponding to the chosen probability 1-\u03b1 (e.g. \u03b1 = 0.05 for 95%) and the degrees of freedom (df) are multiplied with the standard error centered on the sample mean on both sides. (Note how the two concepts of randomness and frequency are ubiquitous in the frequentist\u2019s paradigm.)", "The t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution that arises when estimating the sample mean of a normally distributed population in situations where the sample size is small and the population standard deviation is unknown \u2014 which is quite common. (The t-distribution will be discussed more in detail below.)", "It is of relevance to know the distribution of the random variable for the selection of the appropriate statistical test. More precisely, a parametric tests like the t-test assumes a normal distribution of the random variable \u2014 a requirement that might not be fulfilled. In that case, it is reasonable to use a non-parametric test such as the Mann-Whitney U test. However, the Mann-Whitney U test uses another null hypothesis in which the probability distributions of both groups are related to each other", "There is a whole zoo of statistical tests (Figure 3); which test to use depends on the type of data (quantitative vs. categorical), whether the data is normally distributed (parametric vs. non-parametric), and whether samples are paired (independent vs. dependent). However, it is important to be aware the null hypothesis is not always the same, so the conclusions change slightly.", "Once the assumptions are verified, a test is chosen, and the test statistic is computed from the two samples with sizes n and m. In this example, it would be the t-statistic T, which is distributed according to the t-distribution (with n+m-2 degrees of freedom). S is the pooled (aggregated) sample variance. In addition, it is worth mentioning that T scales with the sample size(s).", "Note the similarity of the t-statistic to the z-score, which is associated with the Gaussian distribution. The higher the absolute value of the z-score the lower its associated probability, which is also true for the t-distribution. Hence, the higher the absolute value of the t-statistic, the less probable that the null hypothesis is true.", "Just to provide some clarification, the t-statistic follows a t-distribution because the standard deviation/error is unknown and has to be estimated from (little amount of) data. If it was known, one would use a normal distribution and the z-score. For larger sample sizes, the distribution of the t-statistic becomes more and more normal as the standard error approaches zero. (Note that the estimated standard deviation is also a random variable that follows a Chi-square distribution with n-1 degrees of freedom.)", "As mentioned above, statistical hypothesis testing deals with group comparison and the goal is to assess whether differences across groups are significant or not \u2014 given the estimated sample statistics. For this purpose, the sufficient statistics, their corresponding confidence intervals, and the p-value are computed. The p-value is the probability associated with the T-statistic using the t-distribution, similar as the probability associated to a z-score and the Gaussian distribution (Figure 4). In most cases, a two-sided test is applied in which the absolute value of the T-statistic is assessed. In mathematical terms, the p-value is", "Hence, the p-value is the largest probability of obtaining test results \u03b8 at least as \u201cextreme\u201d as the result actually observed T \u2014 under the assumption that the null hypothesis is true. A very small p-value means that such an \u201cextreme\u201d observed outcome is very unlikely under the null hypothesis (the observed data is \u201csufficiently\u201d inconsistent with the null hypothesis). Consequently, the null hypothesis is rejected.", "If the p-value is lower than some threshold \u03b1, the difference is said to be statistically significant. Rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true is called a type I error (false positive), and the probability of a type I error is called the significance level (\u201csome threshold\u201d) \u03b1. Accepting the null hypothesis when it is false is called a type II error (false negative) and its probability is denoted by \u03b2. The probability, that the null hypothesis is rejected when it is false is called the power of the test and is equals 1-\u03b2. By being more strict with the significance level \u03b1, the risk for false positives can be minimized. However, tuning for false negatives is more difficult because the alternative hypothesis includes all other possibilities.", "In practice, it is the case that the choice of \u03b1 is essentially arbitrary; small values, such as 0.05 (or even 0.01) are commonly used in science. One critisim of this approach is that the null hypothesis has to be rejected or accepted, although this would not be necessary. For instance, in a Bayesian approach, both hypotheses could exist simultaneously with some associated posterior probability (modeling the likelihood of hypotheses).", "It should be stated that there is a duality between confidence intervals and hypothesis tests. Without going too much into detail, it is worth mentioning that if two confidence intervals overlap for a given level \u03b1, the null hypothesis is rejected. However, only because a difference is statistically significant, it might not be relevant. A small p-value can be observed for an effect that is not meaningful or important. In fact, the larger the sample sizes, the smaller the minimum effect needed to produce a statistically significant p-value. Lastly, the conclusions are worthless is they are based on bad (e.g. biased) data. It is important to guarantee that sampled data is of high quality and whitout biases \u2014 which is not a trivial task at all.", "Your home for data science.
