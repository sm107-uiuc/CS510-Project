Better understand it first before reading this article or you will not understand what\u2019s happening.)", "Naive Bayes Classifier, its name already tells you everything: using Bayes\u2019s theorem to make a classification under the naive assumption, which means features are independent with others.", "To introduce how Naive Bayes Classifier works, here is an example (PS: an example is always good, or at least nothing bad)", "Tomorrow you will meet with your friends to have a football match. The weather today is bad and now you worry if the match will be canceled due to the weather. The weather forecast shows that tomorrow will be windy and rainy. Luckily there will be no thunderstorm tomorrow. The question is will the football match be canceled or not?", "Now you think back how the weather impacted your previous football matches so you pull out your diary (!?) and check back all previous football matches with the weather conditions. You come up with below records:", "For example, when the outlook is sunny, 5 out of 6 matches were not canceled. When the weather is windy, 6 out of 10 matches were canceled (kinda sad). Now it\u2019s time to bring out Naive Bayes Classifier.", "The concept of Naive Bayes Classifier is to calculate the likelihoods of all possible classes under observed attribute values, with the help from the training set. The class for the new instance will be the one with the highest likelihood. In a more layman term, we select the one with the highest possibility to happen under observed conditions.", "Then what is the relation with Baye\u2019s theorem?", "The general formula for Baye\u2019s theorem involving multiple events under the independence assumption is as below", "B is the event that we want to know and A\u1d62 is the ith observed event. In Naive Bayes Classifier, B is the class that will be assigned based on those observed events. If we arrange the formula,", "the second part calculates the probability of occurring all observed events without any pre-condition, which is independent of which class selected. Therefore, the first part of the formula is a likelihood function (if you don't know what likelihood function is, here is the wiki link) to determine which class should be assigned.", "Back to your football match, now you can calculate the likelihood of \u201cCancel\u201d and \u201cNot cancel\u201d based on tomorrow\u2019s weather forecast and historical results.", "Denote A\u2081 is Outlook, A\u2082 is Windy, and A\u2083 is Thunderstorm. Therefore,", "Since the likelihood for \u201cCancel\u201d is higher than \u201cNot Cancel\u201d, the outcome will be \u201cCancel\u201d (too sad).", "In the example, the observed events are all discrete. In the case of a continuous event, the distribution is often assumed as normal distribution and thus the probability can be calculated using the usual normal distribution approach if both mean and standard deviation under each class are known.", "One major problem for the Naive Bayes Classifier is already shown in the above example. Assuming independence for all observed events is often untrue. A thunderstorm often comes with rain and heavy wind.", "Another problem is called \u201cZero-Frequency Problem\u201d which means there is a new observed outcome that has never occurred before. For example, in the past, there was no tornado hitting your neighborhood. And suddenly there will be one coming tomorrow. Then you cannot calculate the probability under any class. This problem can be addressed by additive smoothing (aka Laplace Estimator).", "Because of the simplicity of the Naive Bayes Classifier, it can provide a fast prediction without heavy computation. Hence it uses in some real-time predictions. And it can also use in multi-class prediction without extra effort.", "This is the end of the introduction of the Naive Bayes Classifier.
