Although I recommend you to read the series from the beginning, articles are formed in that way that each one is independent and doesn\u2019t require you to read everything before it.", "Today you\u2019ll read the second article in the series, where the first was dealing with only the reasons why should you even consider Plotly:", "So make sure to check that one out if you\u2019re struggling to choose a data visualization platform or just want to try something new.", "Today, we\u2019ll focus on two very common types of charts:", "The first one you\u2019ll use almost anytime you want to see the difference between categories and the ladder is basically present in any dashboard out there, usually representing time-series data of some sort.", "Without much ado, let\u2019s jump in.", "Imports-wise we\u2019ll only have a few libraries, two of which are present in every data science notebook, and the last two are from Plotly:", "As for the dataset, we\u2019ll declare something random in Pandas, let\u2019s say various bill amounts for different months in a year:", "Okay, we have everything to get started. Let\u2019s explore all the different ways this dataset can be plotted.", "We\u2019ll cover three types of bar charts today:", "You don\u2019t need to know beforehand the differences between those as everything will be explained in the article. The idea is to show you every way you can represent data with bars, and then it\u2019s up to you to choose the most suitable option.", "Okay, let\u2019s plot the Month on the x-axis and Total on the y-axis. As always, you\u2019ll declare a figure object and put data and layout inside. This one is pretty simple and doesn\u2019t need further explanation:", "If you were to execute this code, a plot like this would come out:", "Okay, not bad, but not great either \u2014 here we\u2019re only displaying the total amounts, which isn\u2019t showing us the whole picture. Let\u2019s see how to improve.", "In this one, we\u2019ll be able to visualize each expense and not only the total amounts. Keep in mind, if you have a lot of data and a lot of categories this type of chart might become hard to look at \u2014 but it is just fine for our case.", "And it\u2019s really simple to do so \u2014 we only need to put a go.Bar object in our data array for every category we want to visualize. Here\u2019s the code:", "Executing the above code would produce a nice-looking chart:", "If you ask me, this is a great improvement from what we\u2019ve had previously. Let\u2019s explore another option before concluding this section.", "In most cases this is my favorite option. Takes as little space as your regular bar chart, and displays as much information as a nested bar chart. The code is pretty much identical as the one for a nested bar chart, the only difference is that you need to specify barmode='stack' in the layout.", "Executing the above code would result in a chart like this one:", "Great! We\u2019ve covered bar charts in-depth, let\u2019s now see what can we do with line charts!", "For this part, we\u2019ll only need two Numpy arrays:", "And that\u2019s it \u2014 we can begin exploring.", "As with the bar charts, we\u2019ll cover two options:", "If it\u2019s not clear to you what is meant with the second option, bear with me for a minute.", "Here\u2019s how we can make a basic line chart from those two previously declared Numpy arrays:", "Executing this code will result in the following chart:", "Not the best-looking line chart, we\u2019ll explore how to tweak the visuals towards the end of the article.", "If you don\u2019t have too many data points, sometimes is convenient to show little markers alongside the lines. Code-wise changes are minimal \u2014 as we only need to tweak the mode option, and set it as mode='lines+markers'. Let\u2019s see the code:", "Executing the above-written code will result in this chart:", "Nice. Let\u2019s now see how we can combine multiple lines into a single line chart.", "Let\u2019s now see how easy it is to combine multiple lines into a single chart. Just like with the bar chart, we\u2019ll put multiple go.Scatter objects into our data array.", "To spicy things up a bit, we added a few layout options just to give you a feel of what can be done, appearance-wise.", "Executing the code will produce this chart:", "Awesome! And that will be just enough for today.", "This was quite a longer article than I usually write. But I hope you\u2019ve managed to follow along. We covered a lot of ground today, but there\u2019s still much more to come.", "The following article will cover scatter charts and bubble charts, so stay tuned if that\u2019s something that you\u2019d find interesting.", "Thanks for reading, and as always don\u2019t hesitate to put your questions and comments below.", "Loved the article?
