Before going in detail about ANOVA, let\u2019s remember a few terms in statistics:", "In order to understand the motivation behind ANOVA, or some other statistical tests, we should learn two simple terms: population and sample.", "Population is all elements in a group. For example,", "It is not always feasible or possible to do analysis on population because we cannot collect all the data of a population. Therefore, we use samples.", "Sample is a subset of a population. For example,", "Statistical tests are done to see the results calculated using samples are likely to apply to entire population.", "When we compare two samples (or groups), we can use t-test to see if there is any difference in means of groups. When we have more than two groups, t-test is not the optimal choice because we need to apply t-test to pairs separately. Consider we have groups A, B and C. To be able to compare the means, we need to apply a t-test to A-B, A-C and B-C. As the number of groups increase, this becomes harder to manage.", "In the case of comparing three or more groups, ANOVA is preferred. There are two elements of ANOVA:", "ANOVA test result is based on F ratio which is the ratio of the variation between groups to the variation within groups.", "F ratio shows how much of the total variation comes from the variation between groups and how much comes from the variation within groups. If much of the variation comes from the variation between groups, it is more likely that the mean of groups are different. However, if most of the variation comes from the variation within groups, then we can conclude the elements in a group are different rather than entire groups. The larger the F ratio, the more likely that the groups have different means.", "Let\u2019s go over an example. Consider we have 3 groups with 8 observations:", "We want to perform an ANOVA test to see if these groups are different. I will use R but feel free to perform it on any software package. We start with creating the groups:", "Then stack the groups in the frame:", "Then perform ANOVA with one line of code:", "There are 3 groups and a total of 24 observations. So the first line is 2 and the second line is 22. We can represent the result as:", "What we have done so far is a one-way ANOVA test which compares the means of three or more groups based on one independent variable. There is also a two-way ANOVA test which compares three or more groups based on two independent variables.", "Consider a dietitian wants to analyze weight loss in three different groups. He/she prepares three different diets and each group is fed a different diet. In this case, one-way ANOVA test is appropriate to check the average weight loss if different in the groups. If the dietitian also wants to see if average weight loss is different for males and females within a group, then a two-way ANOVA test is appropriate. Gender and diet types are the factors of this two-way ANOVA test.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
