The next breakthrough on AI will be exactly that \u2014 bringing phenomenology to AI. We can try to define a table as follows:", "Most people be very comfortable with this definition: an object with four legs, made up of wood, with a flat rectangular surface, used primarily for dining or putting things on it. However, things can get complicated if the table has an oval shape, sits on a base (instead of legs), etc. Any imaginable explanation using words is likely to fail.", "If you ever logged in a website with reCAPTCHA (\u201cI\u2019m not a robot\u201d) you should know how hard is for a computer to differentiate objects. The challenge\u2013response test is used to determine whether or not the user is human. A series of images are presented and the user has to click on the corresponding pictures that are associated to the text. \u201cTraffic lights\u201d, \u201ccrosswalks\u201d, \u201ccars\u201d, are some common examples.", "reCAPTCHA uses a very sophisticated set of techniques. The algorithm, however, is not concerned with the intrinsic and objective definition of the objects, but instead, what most people perceive them. What most people click is what the truth is more likely to manifest. In a normal curve, if you are within a certain standard deviation from the mean, you are most likely a human. In that sense, even if the image presented is not a \u201ctraffic light\u201d, but appears to be a \u201ctraffic light\u201d, most people would click on it, reinforcing the learning algorithm.", "Phenomenology was first introduced by Edmund Husserl and seek to reflect on structures and consciousness of a phenomena and create a framework to scientifically study them. One of its most important topics is something called Imaginative Variation. Imaginative Variation tries to deconstruct the embody notion and biases that we have by challenging them. Back to our table example, Imaginative Variation would ask:", "If any of those answers are \u2018no\u2019, then, the definition is probably wrong.", "reCAPTCHA probably focus on traffic-related challenges might give us a hint on what its parent company, Google, will do with the data: upload into autonomous cars. Millions of users train the algorithm every day across the globe. This immense amount of data can help autonomous cars determining what to avoid and what signs to follow. In this case, the algorithm is acting as a human, not knowing exactly what a \u201ctraffic light\u201d is (similarly to the ambiguous table definition) but it knows that it is a traffic light when it sees it.", "Phenomenology works on the opposite direction. While the reinforcement AI algo uses \u201cit is what it is\u201d, Phenomenology tries to study experience and consciousness using systematic reflection. So a traffic light is not simply what you see, but it is a set of conscious experiences such as judgement, perceptions, and emotions.", "A table is not only a table because it appears to be a table to the viewer. There must be something else. If a table would be simply a collection of physical visual attributes, a blind person would not be able to characterize or feel a table. Humans would not be able to reject things that \u2018appears\u2019 to be what they are.", "If you are wondering what the dictionary says a table is \u201ca piece of furniture consisting of a smooth flat slab fixed on legs\u201d[2]. In any dictionary you search, the definition is completely wrong. Google, on the other hand, has a much better dictionary: a binary one. Instead of using a couple of words to define a table, it has terabytes of training data, from millions of users, that defines exactly what a table is and what is not.", "And this is the futuristic dictionary. Words will not be defined by other words, but by a complex set of digital data of emotions, images, and consciousnesses. A simple word such as \u2018table\u2019 would be a massive amount of data which could be rendered to the reader in words (hundreds of pages, explaining what a table is) or several images of potential types of tables.", "Since the rise of AI, philosophy had been a growing convergent area with technology. Bringing Phenomenology to AI can help us better understand how to model and store data. How human perception detaches from AI and how it could be reconciled. Phenomenology is a fantastic field, definitely something that will be a fundamental part of AI.", "Your home for data science.
