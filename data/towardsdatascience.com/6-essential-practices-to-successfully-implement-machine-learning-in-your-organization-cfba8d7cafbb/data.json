What really caught my eye was the comparison done between AI high performing companies versus the rest. According to the comparison done, companies with a clear enterprise-level road map of use cases, a solid cross-functional collaboration between the analytics & business units, a standard AI toolset for professionals to use, an understanding of frequently updating AI models and systematically tracing a comprehensive set of well-defined KPI for AI perform 3.78x better than other players in the market.", "The findings of this survey were extremely consistent with our experience working with multiple companies at MLTrons. I\u2019m glad to say that most of the companies we work with are on a clear track of becoming an AI high performer. In order to achieve the AI high performer status, we have devised six essential practices that have yielded successful results for our clients.", "We\u2019ve seen many executives dive head-first into building a machine learning program from the ground up. But it\u2019s tricky. It requires a lot of upfront investment, minimization of information asymmetry, minimizing inertia, a clear roadmap and alignment of interests.", "The key here is to build a strategy that aligns with your corporate-level goals. Companies need to understand that in order to build a robust data strategy and align it with its corporate-level goals, it needs to bring various stakeholders together and look at empirical data while formulating the strategy. By defining clear goals and understanding the infrastructure required, companies can successfully access the probability of success for such an initiative. This brings us on to the next point.", "Define your machine learning goals up front! Period. Without a clear understanding of what you want to achieve, it\u2019s hard to measure success. For example, a company may want to achieve an increase in overall revenue by 20% or a decrease in cost by 10%. This is a corporate level goal. Now, management can easily decide the use cases that directly impact either revenue or costs, for example, optimizing marketing campaigns to increase overall revenue, or increase returns on your real-estate investment by accurately predicting house prices. By clearly defining a roadmap, the probability of success increases and the risk of failure decreases by more than 40%.", "Here\u2019s a golden rule to remember: a machine learning algorithm is only as good as the data it\u2019s fed. So, to use machine learning effectively, you must have the right data for the problem you\u2019re trying to solve. And not just a few data points. Machines need a lot of data to learn \u2014 think hundreds of thousands of data points.", "Your data will need to be formatted, cleaned, and organized for your algorithm, and you will need two datasets: one to train the model and one to evaluate its performance. So after picking up the use cases, filter out the ones where there is data available and the ones that can quickly generate value across the board. Go for multiple smaller wins and have a clear data strategy.", "Citizen Data Scientist, a term coined by Gartner, refers to a data analytics professional or a data professional that needs or wants to implement machine learning technology.", "These professionals typically are in the form of a data analyst or a BI analyst. They focus on finding trends in data about events that have already happened (descriptive analytics) and express their results in dashboards, static reports, and graphs.", "They typically reside in a line of business such as Sales, Marketing, Finance, or HR, and have deep domain knowledge of the business challenges their department faces.", "With a worldwide shortage of trained data scientists, you need to empower your data analytics professionals and other domain information experts with the tools and support they need to become citizen data scientists.", "Now, however, there are powerful tools that allow them to solve business problems using data with greater depth and breadth than their data analytics professional peers.", "Gartner estimates that more than 40% of data science tasks will be automated by 2020", "Data analytics professionals have deep domain expertise and recognize the core business challenges of their department. They have a good understanding of the available data but cannot often perform some of the data science tasks that distinguish an analyst from a citizen data scientist.", "Mltrons\u2019 simplified & automated machine learning platform replicates the tasks and processes usually performed manually by an expert data scientist, allowing users to implement machine learning solutions quickly without writing a single line of code.", "Citizen data scientists simply upload a dataset and choose a target variable based on the practical business problem they wish to solve.", "Mltrons\u2019 platform automatically applies the best practices for data preparation, preprocessing, feature engineering, model training and validation.", "The platform then automatically selects the best-fit algorithm and uncovers insights, usually unnoticed, while explaining results in simple enough language understandable by all the stakeholders involved.", "Analytics professionals within various departments have the ability to identify the best use cases for machine learning after which they can use mltrons platform to build and implement machine learning models.", "To get the most out of machine learning at your organization, you need the right team with the right mindset. The latter requires a cultural shift that prioritizes and rewards experimentation, measurement, and testing throughout your organization. Generating value from machine learning is a process which requires time and constant monitoring. By having a dedicated team of passionate individuals implementing AI across the board, the probability of success increases dramatically.", "With the increasing size of data and need for deeper insights, organizations need to act now. With machine learning, it\u2019s possible to quickly and automatically produce models that can analyze bigger, more complex data and deliver faster, more accurate results \u2014 scale. And by building precise models, an organization has a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities.", "The competition is increasing and talent is short, therefore if the companies wish to remain relevant in today\u2019s data age they need to act quickly and start building their AI strategy.", "I hope you enjoyed this article and found it informative. We wish you the best with your own AI journey. Follow a structured framework and measure your success, we\u2019re sure your AI initiative will be very successful!", "If you have any questions or queries, please feel free to reach out.
