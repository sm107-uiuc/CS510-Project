Many popular algorithms are dome in recursion. So, it has a lot of importance. If recursion is important, the analysis of the time complexity of a recursive algorithm is also important. In this article, I will explain a widely used method for calculating the time complexity of a recursion. That is the Master method.", "One thing to remember here is, the master method is a method to solve a recurrence. But before that, a recurrence expression needs to be drawn from the algorithm.", "I will start by showing how to draw a recurrence expression from a basic and well-known algorithm. And then will explain how to solve different recurrence expression using the master method with examples.", "For this demonstration, I chose to use a merge sort algorithm. Here is the algorithm, if you need a refresher. Here is the merge sort algorithm:", "I am not explaining how the merge sort algorithm works because this article is actually about solving recursion. I am assuming you already know this algorithm.", "Here is how to derive the recursion expression from the merge sort algorithm:", "Let, n is the length of the input array or list, and T(n) is the running time. If the problem is small enough, say, a constant then the running time will be theta(1).", "Now I will introduce a few important terms:", "Let, \u2018a\u2019 be the number of subproblems that come out of the division. In merge sort, you divide the original array into two parts each time. so, \u2018a\u2019 is 2.", "In the merge sort problem, 1/2 *n is the size of each subproblem \u2018a\u2019. So, both \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 are 2.", "The standard form for a master method is:", "For merge sort algorithm, it has to be:", "Why a and b both are 2, that was already explained. But the second term is O(n) because the \u2018merge\u2019 method in the code has a linear running time. If you notice, the running time of the \u2018merge\u2019 method is O(n).", "The master method is very straightforward. They call it a cookbook method. Just follow the recipe. It\u2019s done!", "There are three solutions for the standard form of the master method:", "Let\u2019s solve the recurrence of merge sort:", "This was the recurrence of the merge sort algorithm:", "Comparing with the standard form of the Master method mentioned earlier, here, a = 2, b = 2, and d = 1.", "So, Case 1 is the solution for the merge sort algorithm. So, the time complexity of the merge sort algorithm is O(nlog(n)).", "Here I have two more examples of the Master method. Please have a look at this recurrence below:", "That means case 2 applies here.", "Let\u2019s solve the last example for the master method. Here is another recurrence:", "So, Case 3 applies here. The time complexity for this recurrence is:", "I hope, you know how to use the master method now.", "But still, it is possible to derive an upper bound and lower bound", "This recurrence does not fall into any of the three cases directly. Please try it yourself.", "But we can find an upper and lower bound using the Master theorem. If we just avoid the \u2018logn\u2019 term, clearly the left-hand side becomes greater than or equal to the right-hand side:", "Using this formula we can find the lower bound. So, let\u2019s solve this.", "So, it falls under case 3. The lower bound of the time complexity will be:", "On the other hand, instead of the \u2018logn\u2019 term, if we add an e term in the power of n,", "Where, e > 0. Because, if the power of n grows that will grow faster than the \u2018logn\u2019 term. By solving this recurrence, we can get the upper bound.", "So, it falls in case 2. The upper bound of this recurrence should be:", "This is how to find the upper bound and lower bound of a recurrence using the master method.", "For example, let\u2019s look at this recurrence:", "Here, a = 6, d = 2, and b is unknown. If it has to fall in case 1,", "As per case 1, the solution is:", "In the same way, if it has to fall in case 2 category of the master method, we need to have,", "As per case 2, the solution is:", "If it has to fall in case 3, it has to be,", "The solution is for case 3 is:", "If you notice, we have a lower bound and an upper bound, even if we do not have b. Analyzing these three solutions,", "I hope this article was helpful in learning the Master method clearly. Though the master method has some limitations. It does not directly work on each and every recurrence. But still, it can be used to derive an upper bound and a lower bound. It can provide an upper and lower even if there is a parameter missing or variable.
