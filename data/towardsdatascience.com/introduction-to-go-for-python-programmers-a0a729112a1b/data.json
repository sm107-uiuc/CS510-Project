Proponents of Go laud it\u2019s simplicity, concurrency, and performance \u2014 having basically been solely a Python programmer for the last few years, I wanted to try to get started with Go myself. Through learning some of the basics, I found it easiest to try find direct mappings between Python and the equivalent operation in Go. Here is just a small introduction to get started with Go yourself.", "To install Go (or golang), you can either visit their website, or use Homebrew, where it is as simple as:", "That was easy! Let\u2019s write our first Go program.", "Let\u2019s start with some basic boilerplate for our Go programs. We can create a folder called go_tutorial where all of our code will live. Let\u2019s start with making a file called main.go for our first code snippet. At the top of our file, we have a package definition. Since Go is compiled, the entry point for our program will be in the main() function of the main package. So, we will have something like this:", "The other thing we need is package imports. For example, to print text to the terminal screen (as we will do in the first example), we must import a package called fmt. After adding package imports, our code will look like this:", "To run our program, we have a couple of options. Since Go is a compiled language, there is a compilation step prior to us being able to run our program. If we want both of these steps to occur with one command, we can use go run:", "Of course we will get no output, since our main() function is currently empty. Another method of running our program is to use go build to create a binary file that we can then execute. If we supply go build without a filename, our binary will be the name of the overall package which is go_tutorial in our case. If we pass the filename main.go to go build, we will get a binary file called main:", "Note that running go run skips the step of saving a binary file and directly runs the program.", "Okay, let\u2019s start writing our programs!", "To print text to the screen, we use a function from the fmt package called Println(). Notice that the function has a capitalized first letter \u2014 in Go, functions that are exposed from packages (called exported functions) must begin with a capital letter.", "Unlike Python, Go is a statically typed language, so the variables must be explicitly declared. For example, to declare a variable a with type integer, we use the following:", "The variable a is now fixed to type integer. If we try to reassign it to another variable type, we will get an error at compile-time:", "When we tried to reassign the a from 5 to hi, we get an error during compilation that says we cannot use a string as an integer.", "We can do the variable declaration and assignment in the same line as well, and Go will infer the type:", "Now, there\u2019s an even shorter way of doing this \u2014 we can use the operator := to also do the declaration and assignment in the same line.", "The data structure most similar to Python lists in Go is a slice. Slices in Go are an abstraction to the array data type that allow for more useful manipulation functions. We can create an empty integer slice as follows:", "We can initialize our slice with the := operator \u2014 additionally we can index our slices exactly as we would do in Python.", "Just as with Python lists, we can append items to our slices:", "To achieve similar behavior to Python dictionaries, we can use Go maps, which are data structures that also map key-value pairs. The map declaration is of the form map[key type]value type, so to create an empty map with keys of type string and values of type int, we use the following:", "Adding key-value pairs to our map is exactly the same as in Python", "In Go, there is only one loop \u2014 the for loop. We can adapt the syntax of the for loop to behave like other loop constructions in Python, like while loops.", "To create a for loop with a specified number of iterations:", "To loop until a condition is met (like a while loop), we do the following, where i++ is the increment operation, like i += 1 in Python.", "Finally, if we wanted to create an infinite loop until a condition is met (like while True), we can do the following:", "If/else statements operate largely the same in Go as they do in Python, with the only exception being explicitly using else if instead of elif in Python.", "Finally, we can declare functions and use them in our main() function as well. This works very similarly to functions in Python, but since Go is statically typed, you must declare the input and return types of your function, like this:", "So if we wrote a function to calculate the factorial of a number, we could do as follows. We can also call our factorial function from main():", "I hope you enjoyed this article and this was enough to get you started on your Go journey! One of my favorite resources is Go By Example \u2014 we have only scratched the surface here but you can learn about some of the other nuances of the language by going there.", "You can see some of my work at my personal GitHub page. I appreciate any feedback, and you can find me on Twitter and connect with me on LinkedIn for more updates and articles.", "Your home for data science.
