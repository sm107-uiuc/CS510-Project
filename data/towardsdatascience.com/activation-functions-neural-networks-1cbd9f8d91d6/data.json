Therefore, it is especially used for models where we have to predict the probability as an output.Since probability of anything exists only between the range of 0 and 1, sigmoid is the right choice.", "The function is differentiable.That means, we can find the slope of the sigmoid curve at any two points.", "The function is monotonic but function\u2019s derivative is not.", "The logistic sigmoid function can cause a neural network to get stuck at the training time.", "The softmax function is a more generalized logistic activation function which is used for multiclass classification.", "tanh is also like logistic sigmoid but better.
