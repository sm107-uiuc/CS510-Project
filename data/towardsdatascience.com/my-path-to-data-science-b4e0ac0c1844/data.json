I finally made the transition that I had been dreaming about for a few years now; I left my job at a large company to become a Data Scientist at a startup.", "This moment was one I had been working towards for almost three years. And while I\u2019d love to say I made the change and never looked back, I couldn\u2019t help but to reflect on my journey and the lessons I learned along the way.", "For those of you who are currently on your journey to Data Science, or are just starting out, I hope this will give you the inspiration to keep pursuing your dream, as well as a few lessons to help you avoid the mistakes I made along the way.", "I started my Data Scientist journey just like most Data Scientists I know \u2014 from scratch. I had been working as a Technology Consultant at a large firm, learning the ropes of core consulting. It didn\u2019t take long before I had the itch to do something different; something more technical. I had studied engineering in undergrad and I constantly felt the desire to use some of the skills I had learned in school.", "After a few months of contemplating what my profession would be, I discovered Data Science. This was it. A way to use math to solve business problems. The only problem was the vast amount of knowledge and skills that I did not have \u2014 computer science, statistics, machine learning, deep learning, distributed computing, SQL, etc. It felt like I was standing at the base of a mountain looking up, and that the climb would take years. I felt completely discouraged.", "After months of contemplating where to start, I finally decided that if I wanted my career to change the only thing I could do is take a first step. In January of 2018 I made the only New Years\u2019 Resolution I\u2019ve ever kept \u2014 I started to learn to code. It first started with late nights \u2014 I would come home from my 9\u20135 and spend 2, 3, sometimes even 4 hours learning to code on my own. There were many nights where my roommates asked if I was ever going to take a break \u2014 telling me that I was working too much. It definitely was a grind, and I can\u2019t say I loved every minute of it, but I had one goal in mind.", "After 6 months of learning to code on my own, I used the skills I had built up to position myself in a new project where coding would now be my 9\u20135 at my current job. I joined a team building custom dashboards in Python. While I was writing Python, I wasn\u2019t building models. It was a step in the right direction, but I still wasn\u2019t a Data Scientist.", "After a few months of this, I felt I had built up my coding skills to a level that was sufficient to move into machine learning and modeling. In January of 2019, I decided I wanted a more formal education in Data Science and Analytics. It was at that time that I decided to pursue my M.S. in Analytics from Georgia Tech, part-time.", "For the next 1.5 years, I spent days working on Analytics projects and nights studying Computer Science, Statistics, and Business. I also fit in a few \u201cextra curricular\u201d projects for work \u2014 including a 6-month long Recommendation System project. This period was high-burn. While I learned the most in the shortest period of time, it came with a cost.", "You can probably guess what happened; I burned out.", "Sometime in the March-August time-frame of this year I was just too exhausted to keep it up. My morale was low. Although I had been afforded many opportunities at work, a lot of what I was doing was considered more business intelligence or analytics than \u201ctrue\u201d Data Science. I had spent over a year and a half trying to break into Data Science but I still felt like I hadn\u2019t realized my dream that I had been working so hard for. On top of all of this, the project I was working on was cut. I now had only a few weeks to find a new project. All of this led to both mental and physical exhaustion.", "It was in July of this year that things changed more than I thought they would. The summer semester for my Masters degree was wrapping up, I was taking the next semester off, and I had found a new project where I would be working as a Data Engineer. Although Data Engineering wasn\u2019t what I wanted to do with my career, I realized there were many aspects of it that would help round my skill set out and provide me with a new perspective. Again, I felt like I was one step closer to my goal, but still had not realized what I truly set out to do.", "What I had not seen, however, was just how close to my goal I was. It was in the next three months where I had began to see all my work pay off; recruiters began messaging me on LinkedIn and connecting me to hiring managers. Interview after interview I saw how each part of my experience enabled me to answer their questions with confidence. The take-home assessments were problems I had seen before or was able to solve with much more ease than I could have even imagined. And finally, on my way to a much needed vacation, I received the call I had been waiting for almost three years.", "Looking back now, I realize there are so many mistakes I\u2019ve made and lessons I\u2019ve learned. I want to highlight three that I think are the most important:", "When I first got that call that I\u2019d been offered a Data Science position at an AI startup, I was filled with pure joy. I thought \u201cWow, I finally made it. All that hard work finally paid off\u201d. And, yes, I was right. But the other side of reality was that my journey was just beginning. I have so much more to learn.", "Thanks for reading!
