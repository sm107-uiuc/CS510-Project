Buildings must be thoughtfully crafted to be beautiful \u2014 bringing together materials in dimensions and proportions that are familiar, warm, and inviting. Exterior building systems must be detailed meticulously to be thermally effective \u2014 keeping the heat in when it\u2019s cold out, and vice-versa.", "The lesson from architecture is that details matter. However, this principle goes beyond designing buildings. Steve Jobs once told us:", "\u201cDetails matter, it\u2019s worth waiting to get it right.\u201d", "The profession of data science should heed Jobs\u2019s recommendation, particularly when it comes to explaining findings from data. Data scientists have a myriad of libraries to more quickly and easily visualize datasets straight out of Python: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Bokeh, the list goes on. Today, we expect instant gratification. I simply click \u201cBuy Now\u201d and my package will be at my doorstep in hours. Or, I simply run one or two lines of code in Seaborn and get a sweet bar plot, right? Well, I ask you \u2014 where are the details?", "A loose hand sketch by an architect may be effective to quickly explain a design idea to another architect. In the same vein, a quick plot might be good for a data scientist to take a quick look at the data, or talk about it with a colleague at the desk. But like architecture, data can be difficult to explain to people outside the practice. Visualizations must be refined, massaged, and carefully curated to tell a clear and beautiful story about the data. Again, details matter.", "But what are the details that we should focus on in data visualization? I think we can break it down into 3 categories:", "When it comes to data visualizations, most say that the best rule of thumb is to tell the story of the data as simply as possible. One way to make the data simple to navigate is by employing hierarchy in the graphic.", "Hierarchy means \u201cto rank\u201d. And so, by breaking the information into \u201cranked\u201d elements, we can give certain elements in our data visualizations more or less weight. Hierarchy gives readers the structure to quickly navigate the content, and find what piques their interest. Hierarchy shows the reader how to engage and flow through a data visualization from the big findings, all the way down to the finer details.", "We can provide a hierarchy in many ways \u2014 for example, titles, headings, annotations, and smaller details. Furthermore, text can offer hierarchy through text size (12pt vs. 24pt), weight (bold, vs. light), and other emphases (italics vs. underlining). Color can also offer hierarchy and call attention by highlighting certain elements of a graphic.", "There are two main types of fonts in our lives: serif, and sans serif.", "Serif should be used for projects with long lengths of text, like books and articles. Throughout history, many have claimed that serif type helps with long lengths of text because they help the eye move smoothly along a line to make the reading easier and faster \u2014 especially if the lines of text are long. Consider serif fonts like Garamond, Georgia, or Times New Roman.", "Sans Serif should be used for projects with short lengths of text. Sans serif is an excellent choice for captions, credits, column headings, text in charts and graphs, etc. Sans serif characters are simpler and easier to distinguish at any size. This can help when your data is distributed to readers with visual impairments or readers that are still learning English. Consider sans serif fonts like Avenir, Futura, or Helvetica.", "Contrast is also important to distinguish text. You never know how your data findings will be used. Imagine your plot is shown in a presentation via a video projector, and the projector washes out all of your soft grey text on your stark white background, and no one can read any of it! That would be such a shame. To ensure legibility in any setting, a minimum ratio of at least 4:1 is recommended.", "Choosing color is hard. Ever heard of the RGB color system? It generates all possible colors from the combination of Red, Green, and Blue. The numerical input to tell the computer to define the intensity of each color ranges from 0\u2013255. So for example: if R = 0, then there is no \u201cRed\u201d in the color. If R = 255, G = 0, and B = 0, then the color is pure \u201cRed\u201d. So in theory, you could combine R, G, and B into 256*256*256 = 16,777,216 possible colors. So how do we choose a few colors to visualize our data in the clearest, most accessible way? First, we have to understand the fundamental elements of color.", "Color all comes down to three elements: hue, value, and saturation.", "Hue describes the color itself. Hue is what we normally think of as describing a color: red, blue, green, and so on. Value is how light or how dark a hue is. For example, blue with a dark value is \u201cdark blue\u201d and blue with a light value is \u201clight blue\u201d. Saturation is the strength or intensity of the hue. Low saturation means duller, grayer colors, and high saturation means more intense vibrant colors. For example, blue with low saturation would look like a cloudy sky, while blue with a high saturation would look like a clear sky.", "In certain cases, combinations of hue, saturation, and value can help to visually show a pattern or trend in the data. However, the audience will be able to understand your data faster if it\u2019s kept as simple as possible. If quantitative values are important in your graph, it\u2019s better to display findings with monochromatic bars or dots. If you must, you can use colors to show different categories on the same graph.", "We can use hue, value, and saturation to give data more clarity. We can use color to show a scale \u2014 i.e. increasing or decreasing gradations of value. One idea is to use a gradient palette to incorporate opposing hues (purple and yellow, red and green, or orange and blue) on a wide value and saturation range. In particular, a wider range of values makes the color palette accessible even to colorblind people.", "For continuous data, you use color gradients, and for categorical data, you use distinct colors.", "\u201cI am a quantity that may be higher or lower than another color around me.\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ve got nothing do to with all the other colors around me.\u201d", "Gradients can be used when the data tells a story about \u201clow-to-high\u201d trends. When using a gradient to display data, the gradient should fade as much as possible from light to dark in equal steps. The gradient should read clearly both in color and black and white.", "Intuitively, people understand light colors for low values and dark colors for high values. If using a gradient, limit the number of hues to one or two colors max. For example, light grey to dark blue, or light yellow to dark blue.", "If comparing data that may be above or below an average or baseline quantity, then a diverging palette is a good choice. Good examples to use this palette might be for showing average salary by county, or average temperature by state. A light grey is recommended at the center of the gradient, with dark value, complementary hues on either side of the gradient (purple and yellow, red and green, or orange and blue).", "The more color-neutral your plot is, the easier it is to use color to highlight data. Grey is a great choice for background data, annotations, or just to keep the plot as minimalist as possible. To keep a little bit of liveliness to the plot, the grey can be a subtle shade of a warmer color, like red, orange, or yellow.", "Use intuitive colors for your data! For example, we all know that red means \u201chot\u201d and blue means \u201ccold\u201d. In nature, we all associate the color green with trees, and the color blue with bodies of water. In the United States, we all know that Republicans are typically shown as red, and Democrats are shown in blue. When it comes to traffic, behavior, or performance, from a young age we are taught that red means \u201cstop\u201d or \u201cbad\u201d, while green means \u201cgo\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d.", "Remember \u2014 at the end of the day, the one tangible thing that we data scientists have to show the world, are our plots. It seems a shame to put all of one\u2019s effort into a Jupyter Notebook that only you might see while spending very little time on the plot output that is shared with people. So put the principles of hierarchy, text, and color at your disposal to make your data visualizations easy to read and beautiful to look at. Get at it!", "Your home for data science.
