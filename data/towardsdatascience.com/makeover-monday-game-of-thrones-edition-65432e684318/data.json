Murphy painstakingly collected all on-screen death data and created a dashboard that had bits of his personality and brand tied in with design elements from the Game of Thrones franchise.", "Note: This dataset and original dashboard is from Makeover Monday\u2019s Week 27, 2019.", "In this blog post, I\u2019m going to walk you through the design decisions I made when I re-designed David Murphy\u2019s dashboard. But first, let\u2019s go over some context behind the source data.", "As I mentioned earlier, this data was collected by the original author. This is obviously prone to minor mistakes and has subjective elements, such as Allegiance (e.g. Does Jorah Mormont have Allegiance to the Mormont house or the Targaryen house since he was in Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s service for the whole series?). Regardless, this is a treasure trove for data-enthusiast-GoT-fans like myself.", "Here are some useful tidbits you should be aware of regarding the data\u2026", "Now that that\u2019s out of the way, let\u2019s talk about the dashboard makeover.", "Murphy\u2019s dashboard does a lot of things very well. I actually kept quite a few visualizations that he created. Specifically, I liked his use of Bar Charts, Running Kill Counts, and Episode Breakdown (all highlighted below).", "I love that his dashboard has GoT-themed elements, like the headers as scrolls, the font, and the pictures of the characters. In my dashboard, I chose to remove these elements because I wanted my dashboard to feel a bit more modern and minimalist.", "I also strongly feel that treemaps and bar charts do a far better job of showing categorical data to the user than packed bubbles (which were used in the \u201cTop Methods\u201d section). Additionally, I wanted my dashboard to be able to answer more questions about the series, like how Houses compare to one another, which methods were used most, and which House was killed the most.", "The main goal of my redesign can be summed up with the following problem statement: How can I better understand differences and trends between characters and heroes in a cleaner and crisper dashboard?", "The dataset is very limited in terms of number of features captured, but a lot of information can still be provided. Let\u2019s go through all the questions the redesigned dashboard can answer\u2026", "My dashboard is organized into three parts, and each part answers different sorts of questions\u2026", "Overall, the new dashboard does away with all the extra GoT-themed design elements, and it should look a lot cleaner. There are a lot more visualizations, so it\u2019s definitely more complicated and dense, but it can answer many questions.", "There are a few more tuneable parameters that a viewer can modify (season/episode views and particular houses), and some of the visualizations better facilitate comparisons (line chart for house vs. house comparisons or bullet chart for character vs house comparisons).", "I\u2019m also a big fan of summary tiles (Part 2: Overall Totals) because they can deliver important information very quickly and succinctly.", "Finally, formatting-wise, I love color-coordinated tooltips and titles that highlight the dynamic aspects of each visualization. For example, all text in maroon changes depending on your parameter selections. Additionally, if you hover over each visualization, the same maroon highlighting method is used.", "I don\u2019t claim my dashboard to be better or worse than the original. Makeover Monday is all about personal preference, inspiration from others, and creativity.", "Finally, a big shoutout and thank you to David Murphy for the inspiration and data source.", "Your home for data science.
