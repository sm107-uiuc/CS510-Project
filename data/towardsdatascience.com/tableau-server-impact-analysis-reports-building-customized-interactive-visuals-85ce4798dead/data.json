What you make is heavily dependent on the raw ingredients you have available. Spoiled meat isn\u2019t going to make any award-winning dishes, and spoiled data won\u2019t win you much popularity among your Tableau users. Similarly, just as you add flavor to your food with salt and spices, you can amplify the value of your data visualizations with formatting and careful presentation.", "Now that we have placed that analogy in front of you, I want to clarify what we\u2019re doing in this article. This is not a beauty contest. We are not cooking some exotic top chef dish here, and we are not building sexy and wildly experimental data visualizations. While design and crafting beautiful visuals are valuable skills, this series is primarily functional in nature and in this article we will build interactive visuals that serve our needs.", "My goal here is to walk you through reports that I was able to build very quickly, and which showcase the core interactive elements of Tableau so that you see how easy it can be to build upon our previous milestones and build dashboards that add enormous value to your operational teams. In future tutorials we may focus more on making visuals pop, but today we focus on building a tool that gives us the information we need so we can move on with our lives.", "Having said that, let\u2019s dive in!", "Before we build anything, we need to connect to the Hyper extract we published in the previous milestone.", "We can do this by opening Tableau Desktop and establishing a data connection to our extract. In my case, the extract lives on Tableau Server and so that\u2019s where I\u2019ll look:", "Here\u2019s how my data pane looks after getting connected. While this is a topic for another tutorial, I consider it a best practice to organize my calculated fields by folder rather than leaving the data pane a disorganized nightmare (yep, I\u2019m full of opinions here).", "As a crash course in how I organize my data pane, I like to toss all of my raw fields into folders named like \u2018/ Original / <description>\u2019.", "I typically never use any raw fields. After consulting heavily in the Tableau space for years, you learn how to protect yourself from things like data source swaps or pointing a data source from a table to a view, etc. I like to save myself the headache of having to fix broken data source field references and so I tend to never use the original field in my visuals. Instead, I create other calculations which reference those fields so that all of my more advanced calculations are not married to the original \u2018raw\u2019 field references.", "If that\u2019s confusing, let\u2019s just move on! You can always reach out for more info.", "Every Tableau dashboard is built on the shoulders of giants. Sheets are the unsung heroes, so let\u2019s sing a quick song for them.", "Let\u2019s throw together some simple sheets that are useful on their own, even without being part of a dashboard. Once we have these sheets built, we can combine them in a dashboard and Tableau\u2019s native support for interactive visuals will make them even more useful.", "My test environment doesn\u2019t have a super diverse array of database tables, but we do have a few. Even if you have hundreds or thousands of tables feeding your Tableau environment, this same visual can quickly provide you information on exactly how many assets your tables impact.", "In my test environment, it looks like the TMDB_TRAIN Snowflake table feeds into about 15 visuals. It\u2019s clearly the most impactful database table, in terms of number of visuals.", "Looking at the number of views is just one side of the story, though. We can add the count of views by users onto \u2018color\u2019 on the marks card to see things from a different angle, such as how many times users viewed assets related to those database tables.", "For this particular visual, the user views are aligned with the number of visual assets. For other visuals, we will see this is not always the case.", "Let\u2019s build a separate worksheet that shows how our visual assets are distributed across our various Tableau projects.", "The \u2018Default\u2019 project houses the most visuals. Does this visual change at all if we add user interactions (views) as the driver of our color gradient?", "It\u2019s subtle, but a close look reveals that the \u2018Test\u2019 project has fewer visuals and more user interactions than the \u2018Test Alt\u2019 project.", "Let\u2019s build out a couple more basic visuals so we can bring them all together into a dashboard.", "Here\u2019s the vanilla version of this visual.", "And below we see the version with user interactions (views) dictating the color gradient. I know I\u2019m lingering on this point, but I feel it\u2019s important. Especially once we bring our visuals together in an interactive dashboard, introducing subtle visual elements can completely change the story your dashboard tells, and accomplishing this without adding unnecessary clutter is more of an art than a science.", "Now while this visual is structured the same as the one without a color gradient, this new perspective tells us something we couldn\u2019t get from the original: just because something is associated with more visuals doesn\u2019t necessarily mean it is more important. You might have 100 workbooks impacted by a backend table, but what if those 100 workbooks only have 5 user interactions? Are those 100 workbooks more or less important than a single workbook with 894 views?", "The visual above shows us that some data sources fuel a relatively low number of visual assets, but those assets sometimes drive relatively high volumes of user traffic.", "With that, I\u2019ll lay the argument for smart use of color gradients to rest. One thing I often encounter in the wild and do NOT recommend is coloring by the same metric that dictates the magnitude of the bar. For example, the visual below does not add any new information and the color gradient is simply a distraction rather than a value-add:", "This visual is now colorful, but to no purpose. As someone who has violated every visual best practice at some point in my many years of consulting, learn from my mistakes.", "Do not randomly grab tools from your data visualization toolbox just because they are available. Be smart about the tools you use, and my recommendation is that you always try to be minimalistic. Don\u2019t be the pie chart with 1,000 slices that nobody can read. Be the bar graph that immediately tells people what they needed to know.", "There\u2019s nothing new here, but with this visual we now have four sheets that together will provide us a fairly comprehensive understanding of how backend data assets impact our Tableau visualizations!", "I\u2019m a big fan of the z-pattern when building dashboards. That is, place whatever your user should interact with first in the top-left section of your dashboard, and then trace their interactions in a z-pattern (top-left -> top-right -> bottom-left -> bottom-right) so that their final interaction is in the bottom-right section of the dashboard.", "In this simple impact analysis report, I\u2019m going to prioritize worksheet placement based on what I will refer to as the hierarchy of information. I want the highest-level information (the top of the hierarchy) to be at the top-left, and I want the most granular information (the bottom of the hierarchy) to be at the bottom-right.", "With that in mind, I have decided to place my list of database tables at the top-left, my list of Tableau projects at the top-right, my list of datasources at the bottom-left, and finally my list of workbooks and views at the bottom-right.", "Like I said before, this dashboard isn\u2019t winning any design contests. But I\u2019ll be damned if it doesn\u2019t tell me what I need to know, especially after augmenting it with some interactivity!", "This was also built in less than an hour, so there is always that tradeoff to consider. I\u2019m sure we could make this dashboard suitable for a fine art museum if we spent a month prettying it up, but is the juice worth the squeeze? As my experience grows, I find myself favoring practicality over looks. But that\u2019s a personal preference. I drive a Toyota for similar reasons.", "I\u2019ve taught hundreds of Tableau training courses, and I always kick things off by building an interactive dashboard in front of the audience in the first few minutes to showcase how easy it is to build something dynamic in Tableau to answer your questions, and perhaps even spark more important questions that you hadn\u2019t considered.", "One of the best tools in your toolbox for interactivity in Tableau is the action filter (technically it\u2019s \u2018filter action\u2019, but everyone I know says \u2018action filter\u2019).", "Why are these so great? They allow you to click on an item in one sheet, and then Tableau auto-magically filters other sheets to reflect data relevant to the item you clicked on.", "Here\u2019s how easy it can be to add an action filter:", "One click, baby. You are one click away from making your dashboard fully interactive.", "After clicking that button, let\u2019s see what happens as we click on something in that sheet:", "Now we know what would happen if we were to remove the TMDB_TEST table from our data ecosystem. As far as Tableau is concerned, that would impact (a) our \u2018Test Alt\u2019 project, (b) our \u2018TMDB_TEST (PUBLIC)\u2019 datasource, and (c) our \u2018twb_live_snowflake\u2019 workbook.", "It looks like at most 10 users would be heartbroken by this, but between you and me\u2026 I\u2019m the only person who uses my test site and all 10 of those user views were me.", "So, this is your crash course in how to use what we built in the previous milestones to stitch together an interactive impact analysis! Before we call it a day, let\u2019s take a closer look at the action filter we created.", "Look, action filters aren\u2019t very complex. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you they are. We clicked one button and an action filter came into existence. If you want a little more control over what your action filter does, what fields it filters on, or which sheets it filters, then this section is right up your alley.", "Even though we clicked a button to auto-generate our action filter, we could have built it from scratch.", "From our Tableau dashboard, we could click on \u2018Dashboard\u2019 and then \u2018Actions\u2026\u2019 to see what was built for us behind the scenes (or to build it ourselves from scratch).", "Here\u2019s what was generated for us: \u2018Filter 1 (generated)\u2019", "And if we take a look inside by clicking on \u2018Edit\u2026\u2019, we find some details about how this filter behaves.", "So here we can see that the source (the trigger) of the filter is the \u2018Database Tables\u2019 sheet and the target of the filter is everything on the dashboard. The filter is executed by a \u2018select\u2019 action (a click) on the relevant source sheet.", "That\u2019s pretty much all there is to it. If you want to customize how your sheets filter each other, just edit those relationships here! You could build several action filters (ahem, filter actions) and specify different rules for each.", "Just to prove that I\u2019m not a bot programmed to only build bar graphs, let\u2019s demo one other visual I threw together. I like this one because it gives you the ability to see which visual assets have been interacted with recently.", "Part of the impact analysis process is identifying what gets impacted, but that eventually turns into questions about whether or not the assets that are impacted are important. One proxy for importance is: has this thing been used in the past month? How about the past six months? How about\u2026 ever?", "Here\u2019s one approach to answering some of those questions:", "Ouch. It looks like I created a lot of content that my cherished users (me) never used. I blame it on the winter months!", "In this article, we tapped into the data we generated in previous milestones and started building out interactive data visualizations that can help answer various what-if scenarios.", "What if that one table were to go down? How many visual assets would be impacted? Which projects? Which data sources? How popular are those impacted views? Are those visuals even used anymore, or are they ancient relics from a lost civilization?", "This is by no means a stopping point. This is meant to be an inspiration for you to take what you\u2019ve seen and adapt it to your own environment. I strongly believe that no company\u2019s impact analysis reporting should be the same. Every team has unique circumstances and unique workflows, and the tools they use to make their decisions should reflect that.", "Thanks for tuning in! See you next time.", "Milestone 5 (ETA is 5/20/2020): demonstrate how you can pull Metadata from ALL sites. In Milestone 1, we extracted data from the Metadata API. By default, that data is specific to the site you are authenticated into. Using the REST API, we can iterate over all available sites and extract Metadata for the entire server.", "Milestone 6 (ETA is 5/27/2020): explore Tableau\u2019s new \u2018metrics\u2019 feature, which opens the door for convenient KPI analysis. We\u2019ll take a look at a KPI analysis approach to viewing our impact analysis data.", "Your home for data science.
