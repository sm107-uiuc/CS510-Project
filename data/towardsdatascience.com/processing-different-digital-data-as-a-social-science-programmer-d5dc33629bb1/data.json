I have not quantified the amount of social scientists who do either or beyond. Yet, this is an impression that I have as far as I have currently seen. It may seem more immediate to work with number data if you are an economist, and it may be possible that through collaboration laws are processed particularly if there are political interests involved combined with political policy considerations (that can be the case). For example if one considers tax policy.", "There might be an easy explanation to why audio, image and video data have occurred less, as far as I have seen. During the educational experience that social scientists go through they are often taught to communicate through text. I cannot in a rapid way think of a social science education that to a very great extent makes use of training within images, video or audio. These are surely mediums of expression, and venues in which to communicate or disseminate research. Therefore it seems strange perhaps that they are not taking into consideration to greater extent in research and education.", "A few questions arise connected to this discussion. In order of appearance:", "As they appear in my mind I will try to turn to answer these questions briefly, provisional of course, to spark possible discussion.", "I think the last question may be easier to answer first. The way research is being done and the methods involved \u2014 the material research is of interest to a research community. It can also say something about overall research methods or approaches within a scientific discipline.", "This seems nearly impossible. If one were to do this then one may have to first. successfully classify millions of documents to then attempt to trace parts of the documents in the media. It is highly doubtful that one could say if a research project by any virtue remained in the format it was designed and never spread to other formats. This becomes a question of whether one should consider only the material that was gathered or the format the research was communicated in. Is it likely that most research that has been performed list other type of performances/documentation/expressions of work? That is a different question that would be challenging to answer.", "According to Britannica: \u201cThe social sciences include cultural (or social) anthropology, sociology, social psychology, political science, and economics. Also frequently included are social and economic geography and those areas of education that deal with the social contexts of learning and the relation of the school to the social order (see also educational psychology).\u201d If one were to conduct such a study (if it was possible), then it would be possible to look at these disciplines or a few of these disciplines. There would have to be an understanding in the process that others may have a different definition of what is considered to be within the scope of social sciences.", "This seem challenging to answer. It does not seem to be a productive question either. On the one hand, why should one attempt to gather all the possible knowledge in the field from a stretch of years. On the other hand it would be problematic if one should limit this to the largest five journals within each field over the last five years. It could be a start, and it seems more possible if one should decide. What surfaces as a thought in this context is the difference in data types, or even foundational notions of data.", "In what different way does a political scientist, an economist and an anthropologist think of data. The understanding may not be common, yet categorising it simply as text, image, video and so on could be confusing/unproductive. If one were to find articles that specifically worked with \u2018digital\u2019 data \u2014 studying what is considered \u2018digital\u2019 within each field could be one way of categorising. The data from the study may follow certain standard within different fields at least within the most common narratives. It may be typical, to some extent, that gathering large amounts of information and categorising simply reinforces narratives or biases. Maybe it would be more constructive to ask how social scientists that are interested in digital methods to a larger extent can work with different types of data. As well, how these types of explorative studies could combine with existing methods or practitioners in the field. Is categorisation useful enough that it warrants a vast gathering of studies to then attempt a categorisation?", "Yes, it is possible. I see that it can be done. Researching how researchers research is interesting. Another aspect is the change in governance of an overall knowledge production that is guided or managed through search patterns \u2013 citation patterns. Search patterns have seemingly changed, and the way research is managed is important to consider. I wrote about this earlier, as the way research is being performed is changing and will inevitably to some extent be influenced by a vast series of different algorithms.", "The immediate thought when I spoke to my fellow student was that it could be interesting to work more with analysis of video data, then a large looming question of \u2018how\u2019 struck me. How can it be done in a practical manner? What social science topic could be explored in a better way through combining video data with other sources? What ethical questions would surface?", "PS: when I mention social science programmer it relates to a discussion of programming as social science. Increasingly more social scientists are not only studying those who do programming, but learning programming languages and integrating it within their methods.", "This is #500daysofAI and you are reading article 459. I am writing one new article about or related to artificial intelligence every day for 500 days.", "Your home for data science.
