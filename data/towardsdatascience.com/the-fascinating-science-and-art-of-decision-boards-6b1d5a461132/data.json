Effective decision-boards are elemental in establishing control over the business at hand and augmenting the decision-making process. With a blend of heart and practical wisdom, this piece is meant to enchant you into the world of dashboarding and deliver a win if you happen to design it in your line of work.", "Businesses exist to make a profit. They do so by either selling a product, service, or experience. Decision-boards help monitor the performance of a business, by visually displaying the most important metrics to assess the health of a business or an aspect of it. And helps the owner make an informed decision more quickly.", "Think of a decision-board as a miniaturized abstraction of reality, where KPIs quantify a certain aspect or objective(s) of the business. These KPIs are arranged into a neat compressed view so that the business owner can quickly eyeball it and get a sense of how the business is performing.", "Corporate folklore has it that the 2001 Enron Scandal catapulted the dashboard as a way for CEOs to keep shareholders placated, and also distribute accountability down the hierarchical ranks. Decision-boards have occupied a permanent place in businesses since. With the democratization of technology, where the next disruptive idea is always lurking around the corner, the need to stay competitive and relevant has only peaked. Business and product owners of today must have well-designed and robust measurement systems in place to be aware of their situational realities and observe the effect of historical business decisions.", "The sophistication of metrics in a decision-board depends on the analytical maturity of the organization. Let\u2019s take the business of a Disney World theme park business to understand variations in the metric complexity.", "A well-designed decision-board eases the monitoring process at the bare minimum, and clearly calls-out Descriptive metrics (\u201cWhat has happened\u201d). For example for the Disneyland theme park, this could be the total profit that was generated last month.", "In analytically mature environments, they also serve additional value, which also requires a higher resource and time investment:", "There are two important considerations that influence the choice and layout of metrics while creating a decision-board: Target Personas for whom the decision-board is being designed, and Establishing a flow to the metrics within the decision-board.", "Each decision board is eventually meant for a target audience. Hence it is important to keep these target personas and their business objectives at the center of the design process. It\u2019s important to get clarity on:", "While being in harmony with the target audience will allow faster iterations, we also need some construct to formalize and cycle through the iterations. Design Thinking is a popular method to enable that. The principles on which it is based originated from the best practices in engineering, architecture, and software design. We can borrowing from Design Thinking principles, to establish an execution framework for decision-board creation. The stages of Design-Development-Review can span over a weeks or months (depending on the suite of dashboards being created), to land a winning outcome.", "Competitive differentiation is no longer in the creation of analytics, but in the consumption of analytics \u2014 Dhiraj Rajaram (Founder, Mu Sigma)", "A standing design can never be perfect for eternity. Any lasting solution requires someone to care about it enough to keep it relevant to the times. These are some ideas to help:", "To maintain brevity, as the reader is used to on Medium, this will be addressed in a subsequent article. The intent would be to provide an overview and examples of the structures and design elements that can help you design decision-boards at scale. And deliver a win in terms of expectations (operational vs strategic target audience), parallel design & development in agile squads, and setting guidelines to maintain consistency.
