That\u2019s okay, the fact that you are reading this puts you above other companies in the search for a Data Scientist.", "Data Science is an ocean as deep as it is wide. A Data Scientist is somebody who can:", "That list is in my priority order. Machine learning is the least important aspect of Data Science in industry, though it\u2019s still fundamental.", "The above is a big ask. The title Data Scientist currently represents the jobs :", "Here I will go over some of the common red flags that show me you don\u2019t know why you are hiring a Data Scientist.", "The industry is currently divided between Data Science as a product, and as research. A few rare companies join these teams.", "A team focused on research and creating new novel solutions to problems has the need for Ph.D. holders.", "According to Indeed, 20% of Data Scientists have a Ph.D., of those a minority have a Ph.D. relevant to the field. It is not the Ph.D. that makes these data scientists useful but their scientific approach. By requiring a Ph.D. you are saying no to 80% of the Data Scientists that currently have experience. Scientific reasoning has a place in Data Science. I would choose industry experience over a Ph.D. every time.", "Machine Learning is foundational to Data Science. Without good communication Machine Learning never delivers value. Without the ability to deploy a model to production you are creating work for a DevOps team.", "Unless Data Science is the core product of your company you are going to find value applying third party products. Google, Amazon, and Facebook all offer tooling that requires skill to install. There is no need to reinvent the wheel. Machine Learning ability is useful for answering questions about a model's validity.", "Some companies will not allow Data Science to be part of the tech arm of their business. Data Science is a technology role. Good Software Engineering practices will make your Data Scientist\u2019s products a pleasure to integrate.", "In Data Science both the company and candidate have high expectations. Machine Learning is a popular dream industry. We aren\u2019t hiring Machine Learning specialists, we are hiring Data Scientists.", "As described above, a Data Scientist is somebody who is doing many jobs. My graduate Data Science salary was \u00a325,000, the same pay any graduate software engineer got. If you want somebody as multi-faceted as a Data Scientist you need to put your money where your mouth is. Even more so if you are expecting Ph.D. holders.", "For your first hire, you need a top Data Scientist to build up the business function. For this type of person, you are looking at around \u00a360,000 in Manchester. This Data Scientist will have the role of Business Transformation added to the pile. Their job is to change perspectives on how the business can use data.", "What I often recommend is to hire either one senior or two juniors that fill in the gaps in each other's skillset.", "Failing to support the Data Scientist", "When you build a team of Front End Developers, they are supported by:", "When the Data Scientist comes in they are sometimes seen as a member of the marketing team. They don\u2019t have access to IT resources and take on a lot of siloed responsibility. Data Scientists may be expected to manage their own deployments and long term storage. Make sure you are ready to support a new function within your business.", "It is common to see job descriptions asking for many years' experience in particular tools. Software Engineering and Data Science in particular enjoy new, developing tools. Some of the best solutions right now will not be the ones you require while writing up a job description. Each Data Scientist will have their own preferences and unless there is an architectural reason for a choice it isn\u2019t appropriate to force a tool. You should be able to tell an individual's skills during the interview process. If you can\u2019t do that you should pay somebody who can.", "Asking for a certain number of year's experience in an industry is discrimination.", "First, we need to define the problem we hope a Data Scientist can help us with.", "Depending on the context of your businesses current problems I would want an applicant with the following skills:", "I was recently contracted to perform a Data Science health check and write a job description for a role for a local company. If this sounds interesting to you get in touch with me on LinkedIn. Below is what I came up with, context redacted.", "I break the job description down into five parts:", "Salary \u2014 being upfront about salary expectations save us from wasting time on candidates with unaligned expectations. The point here is not to put anything you wouldn\u2019t be willing to pay. A small range shown as salary lets people place their expectations within yours.", "Context \u2014 An honest description of the current state of Data Science at this company. How fundamental it is and what we gain by hiring a data scientist.", "Responsibility \u2014 The responsibilities a candidate will have.", "Foundations \u2014 These are skills that are essential for this role, you will need these in week one of the job.", "Desired \u2014 These are extra skills that although not necessary will set you apart from the other applicants.", "As a note, Machine Learning is the core product of this company, as such Machine Learning is important to this role.
