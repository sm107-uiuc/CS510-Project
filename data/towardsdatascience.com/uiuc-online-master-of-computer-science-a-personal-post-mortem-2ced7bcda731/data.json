A once-in-a-century pandemic aside, there is a multitude of other reasons for which one could contemplate enrolling in an online program. Namely, being a working professional with limited time, being a parent with children to juggle or simply not having access to a world-class university at your doorstep. Any combination of the aforementioned grounds can render an online degree as an enticing option or even as a sole resort.", "My story began in early 2018. Having delved into the fourth year of a post-graduation career, I realized that the next logical step would be acquiring a masters degree. Given the competitive industry that I work in (research & development) and the ever changing landscape of the job market, I knew I had to sustain more brain damage to remain relevant. While my bachelors had been in mechanical engineering, my work as a Development Engineer at the time solicited that I develop data mining and data visualization software. As a result, I had acquired a wealth of exposure and affinity towards objected-oriented programming, data structures and algorithms. This coupled with the realization that data science was going to be as ubiquitous and impactful as the internet itself, convinced me to pursue it without hesitation.", "Having a full-time job and not having access to a university offering a masters in data science in my vicinity, I was directed to scout the internet for online programs. While I had reservations at first regarding online degrees, mainly due to the negative connotations and stigma associated with them, I promptly realized that such impulses were ill-founded and that there is in fact a quickly growing community of successful professionals who have completed their degrees online with tangibly positive results. Mind you, not all online programs are accredited or even legitimate, therefore due diligence is strongly advised.", "At the time there was only a handful of online data science programs, as opposed to the current rapidly expanding list. Given that I was not actually going to travel to any of the campuses, location was obviously not a factor that I took into consideration. My main concerns were the institution\u2019s reputation in computer science, student reviews and tuition fees. The only shortlisted candidate therefore, was the MCS-DS program offered by the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Given UIUC ranking fifth nationally in computer science, it\u2019s positive reviews and affordable tuition fees ($600/credit hour at the time which was a fraction of on campus fees), I looked no further and applied for admission for the summer semester. While UT Austin\u2019s Online Master of Science in Data Science program did not exist at the time (first offering \u2014 Spring 2021), it would have been a very difficult decision to make had I been faced with both options. Perhaps there would be a subtle leaning towards UT Austin due to its considerably lower tuition fees (~$300/credit hour).", "Much to my disappointment however, I was rejected after several weeks. Upon enquiry, I was given a relatively generic response stating that applicants with insufficient background in object-oriented programming, data structures, algorithms and linear algebra would not be suitable candidates for this program unless they were able to prove otherwise. Admittedly, receiving a rejection made the whole program even more enticing to me; call it psychology if you will, but I was more resolute in gaining admission after that. Therefore, I decided to enrol in several short MOOCs in each of those four areas and to reapply for the fall semester with the certificate links included in my application. That seemed to have done the trick and I was delighted to receive a very late admission (~4 weeks prior to the start of the semester) for UIUC\u2019s MCS-DS Fall of 2018 cohort.", "Academic advisors were supremely helpful and responsive with the enrolment, course selection and other logistics that pertained to the administrative side of things. What I am specifically grateful for, is that they often increased capacity to allow students to enrol in classes they wanted to and always increased capacity to allow students to take the classes they needed to graduate on time.", "As with any university, the academic rigor and quality of education vary from course to course. With MCS-DS, the curriculum and faculty offering it are virtually the same as the on campus version. Some of the subjects studied were exhaustive while others were at an introductory or intermediate level. As far as assignments and projects went, the level of challenge was quite intense; boilerplates were unforgiving to programmatic or syntactic errors and project submissions were graded strictly. Similarly, reports of students slacking off on team projects were taken seriously, and no one was offered a free pass to graduation. The same cannot be stated about the quizzes and examinations however. It felt as if it were too easy to pass the quizzes \u2014 some courses allowed multiple retakes and given that most questions were multiple choice, passing a quiz was sometimes a matter of trial and error really. Exams were more arduous with no retakes permitted, yet again most questions were multiple-choice which meant that the level of understanding being tested was somewhat shallow. Perhaps the program directors should create exams with a format that more rigorously gauges a student\u2019s grasp on the subject matter.", "Coursera served as the focal point between all of the cloud infrastructure that was used to offer the program. Overall, the integration between MCS-DS and Coursera was fairly seamless and user friendly. Assignments could be submitted with ease, boilerplates worked just fine and the content was organized in a highly structured manner. However, a quandary that persisted from the first semester right until the last, was the delay (up to one week) with which enrolled classes were added to the Coursera platform at the beginning of each semester. While I do not know who to blame for this inconvenience, it was rather odd that it was never solved.", "The most blatant issue that exhibited itself with MCS-DS was the limited number of courses offered each semester. Options were generally limited to two in each core area or even one in the case of the machine learning breadth coursework at the time. Consequently, I had no choice but to withdraw one entire semester (Fall of 2019) and graduate a semester later. I understood that this was to be expected from a program in its infancy and have noticed that as it has matured, additional courses have been added.", "Piazza was used effectively as a virtual classroom where students, TA\u2019s and professors could interact. Unlike Coursera, courses were always set up and ready to join right at the beginning of the semester. Similarly Slack was used as a more informal forum mainly for students to interact in separate channels for each class and one overall channel for the entire program. Team projects were conducted using both tools which were highly effective in facilitating communication and enriching the overall experience.", "Exams were conducted by ProctorU which charged students separately and offered flexible times for students to sit their examinations online. Their proctors were professional, assistive and tech savvy, which made it an overall positive experience. Prior to each test, the proctor would connect remotely to your computer, would then turn your microphone and webcam on and would ask you to thoroughly show them your immediate environment so as to mitigate the possibility of cheating. There are those who consider the integrity of an online exam to be a sham, but honestly, it would probably be way easier to cheat on campus than it would be online. ProctorU had its fair share of technical glitches that sometimes resulted in exams being started late or even being entirely missed and having to be rescheduled. I hope they can even out these issues in the future as online tests become ever more present.", "The workhorse of MCS-DS is, yes you guessed it \u2014 the much-beloved Python. Most courses were available only in Python while others permitted the use of C++ and Java. The main packages used in Python were: Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly, Pandas, OpenCV, Scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCY and SciPy. Where necessary, other courses provisioned programming in Java, Javascript, R and SQL but only for a few select assignments. In addition, Docker, Jupyter Notebooks, Anaconda and GitLab were used from time to time.", "An online degree is somewhat of a surreal experience. It goes without saying that you\u2019re really missing out on that invaluable student-professor interaction. Luckily the faculty in the MCS-DS program largely made up for that by engaging regularly with students. Correspondence was rarely ever done through email and instead, Piazza and Zoom were used routinely to answer questions and to hold live sessions. If anything, I actually felt that I was encountering my professors more often than an on campus degree. There was also a great deal of empathy; professors frequently accommodated to the busy schedules of students in the program upon request.", "Probably the best experience in my four semesters in MCS-DS was interacting with the TA\u2019s. UIUC assigned one TA per fifty students which honestly was more than enough given that most of our assignments were graded with boilerplates and TA\u2019s were mainly there to answer students\u2019 questions. The program coordinators were even kind enough to allocate additional TA\u2019s whenever courses had been over-enrolled in, which I found to be very responsible of them and an indication that they were not willing to compromise on the quality of the education. TA\u2019s were super smart, with many of them being well acclaimed researchers in the same fields themselves. They often went out of their way to assist, with staggering average response times of under one hour (verified by Piazza) in many cases.", "The personal sacrifice made was a defining characteristic of the program. Weekends were mostly non-existent and you can expect to dedicate an average of ten hours a week to each course (more towards the end of a semester). I was on a sprint to finish in four semesters, resulting in me taking two semesters with two classes, one with three and another with one. For any working individual such as myself, I would not recommend taking more than one class per semester, assuming that you also enrol in summer semesters to graduate on time (you must graduate within five years). Pace yourself out and try to schedule exams well in advance to avoid getting slots filled up and having to book an unfavorable time. Familiarize yourself with the curriculum and if you are taking multiple courses a semester then try to avoid herculean subjects (of which there are a few).", "As I obviously cannot review the courses that I did not take, I highly recommend listening keenly to other students who have taken a subject before you enrol in that same subject. A poor start to a degree can be a fast way to grow disillusioned. All courses are four credit hours, however some feel more like three or even two credit hours. There are generally two tracks one can follow in this program, namely, cloud computing and data mining. I selected the latter but in retrospect I wish I had chosen the cloud computing track as it is more relevant to my work.", "This is one of the subjects offered in the data mining track and can be used as a pre-requisite for the Data Mining Capstone. You gain an introductory level of exposure to document ranking, natural language processing and text mining algorithms \u2014 all of which are highly practical and ubiquitous techniques used industry wide. The level of difficulty is moderate and the culmination of the class is a project that binds several of the learnt concepts together.", "This subject is actually offered by the School of Information Sciences and not the Computer Science Department. It is definitely one of those subjects that feels more like two credit hours and only scrapes the most abstract-level concepts with regards to the provenance, schema and lifecycle of data. This course was a stroll in the park in terms of difficulty and in a reincarnated life I would probably think twice about taking it.", "This is another subject in the data mining track which felt like the logical successor to Text Information Systems. It provides great depth and focus on several key concepts such as frequent pattern mining, supervised/unsupervised learning and Na\u00efve Bayes classifiers. You get the opportunity to immediately apply learned concepts with programming assignments and even an online contest. The level of difficulty is moderately hard and the acquired knowledge can be a treasure trove.", "This is obviously one of the cloud computing track subjects and is arguably the easiest one in the track (the other two being Cloud Networking and Cloud Computing Concepts). You are given valuable insights into IaaS, MapReduce, Hadoop and Apache Spark amongst many other big data frameworks, but the main drawback is that this course sacrifices depth for breadth. At times you feel overwhelmed by the multitude of topics you are learning, while you\u2019re not really developing much prowess in any of the individual areas. In addition, several of the tools were outdated by the time they were being taught and this subject was in need of a major overhaul which I understand it has received since.", "Probably one of the most useful subjects in MCS-DS. You quickly delve into SQL, Regex and OpenRefine which all turned out to be vital tools for me at work and I genuinely appreciate the relevance this course offered. The entire class was composed of programming assignments and one final project that were all relatively simple and enjoyable.", "This was the optional capstone for the data mining track and can only be taken after completing two courses within the track. Honestly, it was a big disappointment given the high expectations that I had. Assignments were very open-ended recycles of earlier programming assignments taken in Text Information Systems and Introduction to Data Mining that were applied to a large Yelp dataset. There was also one literature review task and a project that required you to deploy a data mining app to the cloud which was probably the only useful task. Everything was peer-graded and therefore it felt more like a MOOC (which it actually was) than a credit course.", "This was one of the best subjects in the program where you were acquainted with Tableau, D3.js, DOM and Vega. At the time, Data Visualization was mandatory as there was no other option in this core area and it was only offered in the summer semester \u2014 this was not ideal for many but then again it can be expected from an infant program. The final project required you to develop and deploy an interactive dashboard to the cloud which was probably the single most impactful assignment in the entire MCS-DS program.", "Due to Applied Machine Learning not being offered in the Spring of 2020, we were given the choice of enrolling in Computational Photography as a substitute or delaying graduation by a year. I can\u2019t say many were happy when they realized that they would be completing a program in data science without taking a single machine learning course, but luckily for me I had already taken an ample amount of it in Introduction to Data Mining earlier. This class was unique in the sense that it focused on a very narrow topic in computer vision but went into extreme depths of it. We were taught how to apply photographic stitching, morphing, texture synthesis and blending. This was perhaps the most difficult subject for me in MCS-DS and the learning curve was quite steep. It was not very relevant to my line of work, but I\u2019m sure many would be able to utilize this in other areas.", "For those of us who are still contemplating whether an online degree can be a worthy substitute to an on campus education, I must say that there is no one size fits all solution. In other words, there is no such thing as the best university, but there is such a thing as the best university for YOU. Given one\u2019s circumstances, there simply may be no other alternative than an online education. Granted that the networking opportunities present on campus are not really available online and that in itself is a deal breaker for many. For me personally, UIUC\u2019s MCS-DS made all the difference in the world; even before graduating, I was astounded to see the influx of recruiters contacting me on LinkedIn when I added the program to my profile. And in my final semester, I was able to line up a new job that I immediately began upon graduation, solely because of this degree. I\u2019m grateful for the doors it opened up to me and I often find myself recommending this program to family and friends. Online degrees are becoming increasingly prevalent and I hope that UIUC can maintain the same level of quality and rigor in the future.", "P.S for those who lack substantial exposure to the required competencies for admission, the following (affiliate linked) MOOCs can help bridge the gap: objected-oriented programming, data structures & algorithms, statistics, probability, and linear algebra.", "In addition, feel free to subscribe to Medium and explore more of my stories here.", "Your home for data science.
