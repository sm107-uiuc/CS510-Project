There are two main prediction methods for time series data:", "1- Statistical tools: ARMA ARIMA SARIMA [more]2- Intelligence tools based on Neural Networks like RNN and LSTM [more]", "We have reviewed data from Europe download from here.

Many fuzzy studies then attempted to use this method as a theoretical framework, which is widely used in the research fields of natural sciences and social sciences, obtaining good study achievements. The fuzzy time series is also an analysis method derived from the concept of fuzzy sets. Fuzzy sets, presented by Zadeh, have numerous presentations, such as fuzzy sets, fuzzy decision analysis, and fuzzy time series.

These methods provide simple, easy to use, computationally cheap and human-readable models, suitable for statistic laymen to experts. Github.", "By a linguistic variable, we mean a variable whose values are words or sentences in a natural or artificial language. For example, Age is a linguistic variable if its values are linguistic rather than numerical, i.e., young, not young, very young, quite young, old, not very old and not very young[2].", "We have defined 10 variables \u201cA0 \u2014 A9\u201d, which A0 is the lowest Infection and A9 is the highest one. Then we do fuzzification that means set each record to a fuzzy set by maximizing method.", "This part describes the rules which have been generated considering Precedent \u2192Consequent logic, for example, after A0 Precedent, we moved to the A0 and the next timestep (t+1) A1. so here we have:", "In generating fuzzy rules, overlaps between classes need to be resolved. There are two ways to resolve overlaps: one is to generate fuzzy rules without considering overlaps and then to resolve overlaps by tuning fuzzy rules, and the other is to resolve overlaps while generating fuzzy rules. We call the former static fuzzy rule generation and the latter dynamic fuzzy rule generation [more].", "According to patterns we discussed above, rules of timesteps movement can be generated.", "The rules above are showing precedent and consequent on each linguistic variable and generating rules. i.e any data that happened in A0 have a consequence of A0 and A1 which means we have no data that comes A2 after A0.", "Fuzzification is to divide the continuous quantity in the fuzzy domain into several levels, according to the requirement, each level can be regarded as a fuzzy variable and corresponds to a fuzzy subset or a membership function [more].", "The methodology in ARIMA time series forecasting can forecast the average error. We can find the average error using the formula in the fuzzy time series. The error values of the fuzzy time series is less than the ARIMA time series error values.
