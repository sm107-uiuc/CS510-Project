My task was writing an algorithm to predict someone\u2019s next job title given their CV (see here for details). Although my algorithm did not include company recommendations, I was curious as to how these might be included. I quickly realised that this was a really difficult problem, confirmed by others in the company who I spoke to.", "From looking through many of the CVs, it was apparent why. The same company can be written in multiple different ways. Someone who works for Barclays Bank could enter any one of \u2018Barclays\u2019 / \u2018Barclays Bank\u2019 / \u2018Barclays Capital\u2019 / \u2018BarCap\u2019 / \u2018Barclays PLC\u2019 and so on their CV. But that is only the start of the problems. How to deal with subsidiaries? How to deal with companies whose brand name is different to their limited company name? What about abbreviations?", "In a similar way, a while later I was working for a large manufacturing company who wanted to use machine learning to help with their lead generation. As I was looking down their list of existing customers, I realised that exactly the same problems applied.", "The best way of analysing companies in any downstream machine learning task is to create a company vector embedding. But what is a vector embedding?", "An embedding is a mapping of a discrete \u2014 categorical \u2014 variable to a vector of continuous numbers. So, for example, the word \u2018book\u2019 could be represented by the vector (1, 2, 3). This is tremendously useful as it enables up to do 3 main things:", "So when might a company vector embedding be useful? Below is a number of potential use cases (there are certainly a lot more).", "To help solve this problem, I developed a python package to generate a company vector embedding \u2014 see here for the package and detailed instructions on how to use it.", "In most situation in which you might want to use this, I reckoned that all you would have is a company name. Given all the problems with abbreviations / acronyms etc, the package uses a search API (which is free for up to 1000 requests per month) to find the company website given a company name. The package then conducts a broad and shallow scrape of the website using scrapy. The scraped text is then combined with a pre-trained GloVe vector embedding to create a company embedding.", "The package can be used in two ways. Firstly, there is a \u2018quick start\u2019 function which can be used to quickly experiment with the package. If you want to use it at scale, there is a Klein web application and a Dockerfile (as an aside, Klein had to be used rather than Flask because of the multi-threaded way in which scrapy works). This can be used to containerise a web app which can then be deployed on the cloud.", "However, this package certainly isn\u2019t perfect and is a work in progress. It will work less well in the following situations:", "It is also worth bearing in mind that if much of the text on the website is updated frequently, then the embedding will change every time the package is run, affected your downstream analysis.", "If you are a data scientist and have struggled to analyse companies effectively in the past, hopefully you will find this useful. Do let me know what you think and do contribute to help develop the package going forward!", "Your home for data science.
