Let us give them two pseudonyms, Sofi and Alec.", "Since this is not an article on data cleaning, we will focus on writing a few functions to see how collaboration and version controlling works. We will be working with a used car dataset. Download the dataset from here.", "This article demonstrates the EDA for the project. The tasks for this project are built based on the EDA report. We will only look at three tasks in this article.", "Sofi creates a project folder (\u2026/autos) with two files, auto.csv, and autos_analysis.ipynb.", "In software engineering, version control (also known as revision control, source control, or source code management) is a class of systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs, documents, large web sites, or other collections of information.

Instead, every developer \u201cclones\u201d a copy of a repository and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or \u201cclone\u201d) has all of the metadata of the original.

All the preceding work on different branches gets merged to master.", "Head: Shows the current working branch. The above image head is pointing to master, which means the current working branch is the master branch.", "To understand this concept further, refer to this blog post.", "At this stage, Sofi decides to add another file, autos.py, to her working directory. Please note that this file will not be staged and will appear as an untracked file. To add it to the repository, run git add autos.py.

A detailed explanation is given here.", "To get a copy of an existing Git repository run the below command in the terminal.", "This command creates a directory named \u2026/autos, initializes a .gitdirectory inside it, pulls down all the data from the latest version for that repository.
