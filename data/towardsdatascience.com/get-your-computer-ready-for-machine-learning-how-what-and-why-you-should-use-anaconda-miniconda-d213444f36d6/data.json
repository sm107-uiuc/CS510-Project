However, when you want to create or write your own, such as, building a machine learning project, it\u2019s important to set your computer up in the right way.", "Let\u2019s say you wanted to work with a dataset of patient records to try and predict who had heart disease or not. You\u2019ll need a few tools to do this.", "One for exploring the data, another for making a predictive model, one for making graphs to present your findings to others and one more to run experiments and put all the others together.", "If you\u2019re thinking, I don\u2019t even know where to start, don\u2019t worry, you\u2019re not alone. Many people have this problem. Luckily, this is where Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda come in.", "Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda are tools which help you manage your other tools. We\u2019ll get into the specifics of each shortly. Let\u2019s start with why they\u2019re important.", "A lot of machine learning and data science is experimental. You try something and it doesn\u2019t work, then you keep trying other things until something works or nothing works at all.", "If you were doing these experiments on your own and you eventually find something which works, you\u2019ll probably want to be able to do it again.", "The same goes for if you wanted to share your work. Whether it be with a colleague, team or the world through an application powered by your machine learning system.", "Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda provide the ability for you to share the foundation on which your experiment is built on.", "Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda ensure that if someone else wanted to reproduce your work, they\u2019d have the same tools as you.", "So whether you\u2019re working solo, hacking away at a machine learning problem, or working in a team of data scientists finding insights on an internet-scale dataset, Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda provide the infrastructure for a consistent experience throughout.", "Anaconda and Miniconda are software distributions. Anaconda comes with over 150 data science packages, everything you could imagine, whereas, Miniconda comes with a handful of what\u2019s needed.", "A package is a piece of code someone else has written which can be run and often serves a specific purpose. You can consider a package as a tool you can use for your own projects.", "Packages are helpful because without them, you would have to write far more code to get what you need done. Since many people have similar problems, you\u2019ll often find a group of people have written code to help solve their problem and released it as a package.", "Conda is a package manager. It helps you take care of your different packages by handling installing, updating and removing them.", "These aren\u2019t the only ones. There\u2019s Pip, Pipenv and others too. But we\u2019ll focus on Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda. They\u2019ll be more than enough to get you started.", "Another term for a collection of tools or packages is environment. The hardware store is an environment and each individual workbench is an environment.", "For example, if you\u2019re working on a machine learning problem and find some insights using the tools in your environment (workbench), a teammate may ask you to share your environment with them so they can reproduce your results and contribute to the project.", "Your main consideration when starting out with Anaconda or Miniconda is space on your computer.", "If you\u2019ve chosen Anaconda, follow the Anaconda steps. If you\u2019ve chosen Miniconda, follow the Miniconda steps.", "You can think of Anaconda as the hardware store of data science tools.", "Download it to your computer and it will bring with it the tools (packages) you need to do much of your data science or machine learning work. If it doesn\u2019t have the package you need, just like a hardware store, you can order it in (download it).", "The good thing is, following these steps and installing Anaconda will install Conda too.", "1. Go to the Anaconda distribution page.", "2. Download the appropriate Anaconda distribution for your computer (will take a while depending on your internet speed). Unless you have a specific reason, it\u2019s a good idea to download the latest version of each (highest number).", "In my case, I downloaded the macOS Python 3.7 64-bit Graphical Installer. The difference between the command line and graphical installer is one uses an application you can see, the other requires you to write lines of code. To keep it simple, we\u2019re using the Graphical Installer.", "3. Once the download has completed, double click on the download file to go through the setup steps, leaving everything as default. This will install Anaconda on your computer. It may take a couple of minutes and you\u2019ll need up to 3 GB of space available.", "4. To check the installation, if you\u2019re on a Mac, open Terminal, if you\u2019re on another computer, open a command line.", "If it was successful, you\u2019ll see (base) appear next to your name. This means we're in the base environment, think of this as being on the floor of the hardware store.", "To see all the tools (packages) you just installed, type the code conda list and press enter. Don't worry, you won't break anything.", "What you should see is four columns. Name, version, build and channel.", "Name is the package name. Remember, a package is a collection of code someone else has written.", "Version is the version number of the package and build is the Python version the package is made for. For now, we won\u2019t worry about either of these but what you should know is some projects require specific version and build numbers.", "Channel is the Anaconda channel the package came from, no channel means the default channel.", "5. You can also check it by typing python on the command line and hitting enter. This will show you the version of Python you're running as well as whether or not Anaconda is there.", "To get out of Python (the >>>), type exit() and hit enter.", "6. We just downloaded the entire hardware store of data science tools (packages) to our computer.", "Right now, they\u2019re located in the default environment called (base), which was created automatically when we installed Anaconda. An environment is a collection of packages or data science tools. We'll see how to create our own environments later.", "You can see all of the environments on your machine by typing conda env list (env is short for environment).", "Okay, now we know we have Anaconda installed, let\u2019s say your goal is to get set up for our project to predict heart disease with machine learning.", "After doing some research, you find the tools (packages) you\u2019ll need are:", "If you\u2019ve never used these before, don\u2019t worry. What\u2019s important to know if you\u2019ve followed the steps above and installed Anaconda, these packages have been installed too.", "Anaconda comes with many of the most popular and useful data science tools right out of the box. And the ones above are no exception.", "7. To really test things, we\u2019ll start a Jupyter Notebook and see if the packages above are available. To open a Jupyter Notebook, type jupyter notebook on your command line and press enter.", "8. You should see the Jupyter Interface come up. It will contain all of the files you have in your current directory. Click on new in the top right corner and select Python 3, this will create a new Jupyter Notebook.", "9. Now we\u2019ll try for the other tools we need.", "You can see if pandas is installed via typing the command import pandas as pd and hitting shift+enter (this is how code in a Jupyter cell is run).", "If there are no errors, thanks to Anaconda, we can now use pandas for data manipulation.", "10. Do the same for NumPy, Matplotlib and scikit-learn packages using the following:", "This may seem like a lot of steps to get started but they will form the foundation of what you will need going forward as a data scientist or machine learning engineer.", "Using Anaconda, the whole hardware store of data science tools is great to get started. But for longer-term projects, you\u2019ll probably want to create your own unique environments (workbenches) which only have the tools you need for the project, rather than everything.", "There are several ways you can create a custom environment with Conda. For this example, we\u2019ll download Miniconda which only contains the bare minimum of data science tools to begin with. Then we\u2019ll go through creating a custom environment within a project folder (folders are also called directories).", "It\u2019s a good idea at the start of every project to create a new project directory. Then within this directory, keep all of the relevant files for that project there, such as the data, the code and the tools you use.", "In the next steps, we\u2019ll set up a new project folder called project_1. And within this directory, we'll create another directory called env (short for environment) which contains all the tools we need.", "Then, within the env directory, we'll set up an environment to work on the same project as above, predicting heart disease. So we'll need Jupyter Notebooks, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib and scikit-learn.", "Doing it like this allows for an easy way to share your projects with others in the future.", "Once it\u2019s downloaded, go through the setup steps. Because Miniconda doesn\u2019t come with everything Anaconda does, it takes up about 10x less disk space (2.15 GB versus 200 MB).", "When the setup completes, you can check where it\u2019s installed using which conda on the command line.", "2. Create a project folder on the desktop called project_1. In practice, we use this project folder for all of our work so it can be easily shared with others.", "To create a folder called project_1 on the desktop, we can use the command mkdir desktop/project_1. mkdir stands for make directory and desktop/project_1 means make project_1 on the desktop.", "3. We\u2019ll change into the newly created project folder using cd desktop/project_1. cd stands for change directory.", "4. Once you\u2019re in the project folder, the next step is to create an environment in it.", "The environment contains all of the foundation code we\u2019ll need for our project. So if we wanted to reproduce our work later or share it with someone else, we can be sure our future selves and others have the same foundations to work off as we did.", "We\u2019ll create another folder called env, inside this folder will be all of the relevant environment files. To do this we use:", "The --prefix tag along with the . before /env means the env folder will be created in the current working directory. Which in our case, is Users/daniel/desktop/project_1/.", "After running the line of code above, you\u2019ll be asked whether you want to proceed. Press y.", "When the code completes, there will now be a folder called env in the project_1 folder. You can see a list of all the files in a directory using ls which is short for list.", "5. Once the environment is setup, the output in the terminal window lets us know how we can activate our new environment.", "In my case, it\u2019s conda activate Users/daniel/desktop/project_1. You'll probably want to write this command down somewhere.", "This is because I\u2019ve created the env folder on my desktop in the project_1 folder.", "Running the line of code above activates our new environment. Activating the new environment changes (base) to (Users/daniel/desktop/project_1) because this is where the new environment lives.", "6. Now our environment is activated, we should have access to the packages we installed above. Let\u2019s see if we can start up a Jupyter Notebook like we did in the previous section.", "To do so, we run the command jupyter notebook on the command line with our new environment activated.", "7. Oops\u2026 We forgot to install Jupyter. This is a common mistake when setting up new environments for the first time. But there\u2019s ways around it. Such as setting up environments from templates (or YAML file). We\u2019ll see how to do that in the extension section.", "To install the Jupyter package and use Jupyter Notebooks, you can use conda install jupyter.", "This is similar to what we ran before to setup the environment, except now we\u2019re focused on one package, jupyter.", "It's like saying, 'Hey Conda install the jupyter package to the current environment'.", "Running this command will again, ask you if you want to proceed. Press y. Conda will then install the jupyter package to your activated environment. In our case, it's the env folder in project_1.", "8. Now we have Jupyter installed, let\u2019s try open a notebook again. We can do so using jupyter notebook.", "9. Beautiful, the Jupyter Interface loads up, we can create a new notebook by clicking new and selecting Python 3.", "Then to test the installation of our other tools, pandas, NumPy, Matploblib and scikit-learn, we can enter the following lines of code in the first cell and then press shift+enter.", "10. To stop your Jupyter Notebook running, press control+c in your terminal window where it\u2019s running. When it asks if you want to proceed, press y.", "11. To exit your environment you can use conda deactivate. This will take you back to the (base) environment.", "12. To get back into your environment run the conda activate [ENV_NAME] command you wrote down earlier where [ENV_NAME] is your environment.", "Then to get access back to Jupyter Notebooks, run the jupyter notebook command. This will load up the Jupyter Interface.", "In my case, the code looks like the following:", "This seems like a lot of steps and it is. But these skills are important to know.", "Ensuring you have a good foundational environment to work on will help save a lot of time in the future.", "Imagine working in your toolshed but everything was misplaced. You might know where things are but as soon as someone else comes to help, they spend hours trying to find the right tool. Instead, now they\u2019ve got an environment to work with.", "The steps we took setting up a custom Conda environment (these steps will also work for Anaconda):", "It\u2019s important to remember, both Anaconda and Miniconda come with Conda. So not matter which one you download, you can perform the same steps with each.", "Where Anaconda is the hardware store of data science tools and Miniconda is the workbench (software distributions), Conda is the assistant (package manager) who helps you get new tools and customise your hardware store or workbench.", "The following are some helpful Conda commands you\u2019ll want to remember.", "If you\u2019ve done all of the above, the next place you\u2019ll want to go is how to share your environments as a YAML file. A YAML file is a common file type which can be shared easily and used easily.", "To export the environment we created earlier at /Users/daniel/Desktop/project_1/env as a YAML file called environment.yaml we can use the command:", "After running the export command, we can see our new YAML file stored as environment.yaml.", "A sample YAML file might look like the following:", "Your actual YAML file will differ depending on your environment name and what your environment contains.", "Once you\u2019ve exported your environment as a YAML file, you may want to share it with a teammate so they can recreate the environment you were working in. They might run the following command to create env2 using the environment.yaml file you sent them.", "Once env2 has been created, your teammate will be able to access the tools within it by activating it using conda activate env2.", "There\u2019s much more you can do with Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda and this article only scratches the surface. But what we\u2019ve covered here is more than enough to get started.", "If you\u2019re looking for more, I\u2019d suggest checking out the documentation. Reading through it is what helped me write this article.", "Don\u2019t worry if you don\u2019t understand something at first, try it out, see if it works, if it doesn\u2019t, try again.", "A big shout out to the following for helping me understand Anaconda, Miniconda and Conda.", "Your home for data science.
