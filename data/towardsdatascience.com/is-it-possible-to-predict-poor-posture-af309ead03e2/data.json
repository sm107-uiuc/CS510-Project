It\u2019s likely. Whether you\u2019re leaning over your laptop, slouched on your couch, or just have your chin slightly tucked towards your phone, most of us will open this article in a far from ideal reading position.", "We all know posture is important. It conveys confidence (or lack thereof), affects our overall health, and can alter our mood. But too few of us take the necessary action to correct the increasing poor posture our digital era has brought.", "There is already a lot of research available about posture and back pain, so why do we still find ourselves still so hunched over? When I created PocketPosture.com, I set out to learn why people don\u2019t change their posture habits. Is it too complex? Is poor posture too interwoven into the ways we work/study/relax? Are we too busy to worry about it? Or maybe we are all simply too lazy?", "To solve the posture puzzle I began by laying out a handful of questions.", "I reached out to a fellow Y Combinator alum, Doug Hoang\u2019s company focused on posture improvement \u2014 BackAlerts. BackAlerts is a sensor that rests on your back tracking your posture and gently reminding you when you slouch. They also provide posture targeted exercise programs, definitely check them out.", "Even with great tools like Back Alerts, the general population is currently not doing anything to improve their posture.", "Why is it still so difficult to gain lasting proper posture?", "I didn\u2019t find any public data relating lifestyle habits to posture so I opted to make my own data via a survey. To learn more about that messy collection process, read my other article that goes into detail here.", "The survey was conducted via Google Forms which outputs pre-made charts that we can peruse for anything that immediately jumps out.", "Most people spend a majority of their time sitting at work and there is a variety of different commute times. Nothing extremely surprising.", "Looks like the responses are almost perfectly symmetrical for how people rate their posture with a slight skew to people perceiving worse posture, and many respondents are concerned about their posture. Most people chose a level of 3 for posture as well, this may point to people not being completely aware of their posture or how to properly evaluate it (purely speculation).", "It looks like the pain frequency and severity spread out a bit moreover the responses. Fortunately, it also appears there are fewer people with severe pain than those with poor posture. Again, nothing radical here, but a bit surprising the number of people in pain given many of the respondents were in their early 20's.", "I decided to look at the same questions, but subset the charts to see if there are any glaring patterns. Below are some of those ggplot charts. Remember, respondents rated their posture from 1\u20135, 1 being \u201cHorrible posture\u201d and 5 being \u201cAmazing posture\u201d.", "We again see that more people spend their day sitting and sleep on their side, but no immediate patterns pop out to me. There may be a slight pattern with highly active people having better posture ratings.", "I also looked at the relationship between exercise frequency (activity level) and whether the respondent was concerned about their posture.", "Here there appears to be a relationship between being more active and worrying about your posture more, but still not obvious.", "I then spent some time attempting several clustering methods (k-means, k-modes, and k-prototypes in python). However, the mixture of categorical, continuous, and ordinal variables made the results not very helpful as it was difficult to adequately evaluate the clusters. [See discussions on k-modes/k-prototypes here, here, here, here, here, here, here, and here\u2026 phew, I had a lot of tabs open for a long time]", "Either way, we definitely cannot say anything definitive about the data yet. So I dug a bit deeper\u2026", "Fortunately, the data didn\u2019t need much manipulation. There were only a couple free form answers (country, and city) in the survey. I created a basic regex to standardize the responses for those locations. For example, \u201cUS\u201d, \u201cUSA\u201d, \u201cunited states\u201d, \u201cu.s.a.\u201d, etc all became \u201cusa\u201d for easier grouping.", "Next, I created custom dummy variables for categorical features that could have multiple answers and ordinal variables for questions that had a scaled response. Then I used pd.get_dummies to create dummy variables for the remaining categorical values.", "Now that the data was in a friendly format I was finally ready to begin answering my questions:", "Question #1: Is it possible to predict if someone has poor posture?", "Question #2: Is it possible to predict whether someone has back pain? And, if so, can we predict where they will have that pain?", "Question #3: What factors are important in making these predictions?", "I broke them down into binary classification problems and tested 3 different models, over a 70/30 training/test split, for their predictive capabilities with this data set (Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, and KNN classifier).", "Is it possible to predict if someone has poor posture?", "To answer this I set people\u2019s posture rating (scale from 1 to 5, 5 being great posture) as the target variable and ran multiple models. Early on in my testing, for any of the models, the results were not great \u2014 fewer than 55% of the test set was properly classified. Consequently, I took the ordinal feature and made it binary. I assumed that people who rated their posture as a \u20183\u2019 or less had \u2018poor posture\u2019. There are inherent subjective biases with using self-reported posture levels; however, I did not have the time to study each of the 300 participants\u2019 individual posture. More importantly, my underlying questions revolve around why people do not take posture correcting action which is fundamentally based in one\u2019s own perception of his or her posture and not necessarily a clinical diagnosis. Note: there are ways to \u201cmeasure\u201d posture that require multiple people and more effort on the participant\u2019s end. This may be explored as a data collection method moving forward.", "With the refactored target variable I was able to get more interesting results! Below are some of the best for each model after parameter tuning.", "All three models had similar accuracy ~75%, but the logisitc regression model had a significantly higher precision and a more favorable ROC. See here for research on why logisitc regression would outperform random forests.", "Which features were important in the prediction?", "I extracted a ranking of variable importance using the RFE package from the logistic regression (seen below).", "Since the random forest performed relatively close to the logistic regression I was curious to see which features were important for both the logistic regression and the random forest:", "Looking at the actual coefficients of the reduced logisitc regression model, we can stretch our interpretation of the feature\u2019s importance a bit more.", "Is it possible to predict whether someone has back pain? And, if so, can we predict where they will have that pain?", "Similar to predicting poor posture I found the best results by tweaking my target variable from ordinal to binary. Additionally, I dropped the KNN entirely as it continued to under-perform. Once I had a binary classification of \u201cback pain\u201d and \u201cno back pain\u201d I ran the models. After parameter tweaking, the best results for each are below:", "Again, both models perform similar in terms of overall accuracy, but the logistic regression model out performs the random forest again when looking at false positive rates.", "Which features were important in this prediction?", "I wasn\u2019t surprised that the important features for predicting back pain were almost the same as the those for predicting poor posture. With the exception of age playing a more meaningful role in predicting back pain than poor posture and commute duration playing less of a role in back pain.", "Predicting where the person had pain (lower back, shoulders, or neck) was more difficult and my results were inconsistent.", "After looking at the primary questions I tested predicting sleeping position, sleep satisfaction, when someone experiences back pain (while moving, sitting, standing, sleeping, etc), and their activity level. The only one that came close to meaningful results was predicting sleeping position (on back, side, or stomach) with an accuracy of 60%. However, a majority of participants (65%) report sleeping on their side and our classifier tended to classify almost everyone as such. Hence, there were no interesting findings with these other predictive models.", "Using the models, I created a quiz that will help determine if you are at risk for poor posture and/or future back pain. It uses the weighted feature importance and provides you with a personalized posture recommendation!", "The majority of people surveyed are not satisfied with their posture and more than 50% have some type of frequent back pain. Moreover, we\u2019ve seen that:", "One question on the survey that we have not yet discussed:", "\u201c What do you like least about finding back pain/ posture relief?\u201d", "37% of people said treatment was time consuming and another 30% they didn\u2019t like doing stretches and exercises. People are seemingly \u201ctoo busy,\u201d a less than satisfying answer.", "While there are still no definitive answers, this exploration is a first step into understanding the role posture plays in our life and why we so many of us have poor posture, something that has a radical impact on our mind and body.", "There is a lot left to be done. Collecting more responses is a start, and more detailed responses that include questions about \u201cscreen time\u201d and other lifestyle habits would be better. Ultimately working towards a map of the best tools to give people to improve their posture.", "To view my Jupyter notebooks, see my github.", "For comments and questions, email me at john@johnlague.com", "Your home for data science.
