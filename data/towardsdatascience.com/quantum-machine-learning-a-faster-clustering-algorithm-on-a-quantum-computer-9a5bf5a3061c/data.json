As Iordanis Kerenidis (my PhD supervisor) would put it: it is \u201cthe most overhyped and underestimated\u201d topic in quantum computing. This rather young research field aims to develop quantum algorithms that perform machine learning tasks, such as the billion dollars market of classifying cats vs dogs. You don\u2019t need to know anything, I\u2019ll explain.", "Now you may ask : what is a quantum algorithm? It is just a series of commands as any usual algorithm, but this time it\u2019s a circuit made of quantum gates. What is a quantum gate? It\u2019s like a classical gate, as OR, AND, NOT, that acts on qubits instead of bits. What is a qubit? Well it\u2019s a quantum bit : instead of being 1 or 0, it can be a bit of both. For instance, in layman\u2019s terms, it can be in the superposition state 25%|0> + 75%|1>. We use the notation |0> and |1> to remember these are quantum states now. More generally, the state of a qubit is \u237a|0> + \u03b2|1>, where \u237a and \u03b2 are complex numbers called the amplitudes. With 2 qubits you can have the four combinaisons |00>, |01>,|10> and |11> at the same time. 8 combinaisons with 3 qubits, and so on, always existing in parallel. That\u2019s quantum physics ! Accept it, even if it\u2019s not usual in our perception of reality. For instance, a qubit can be an atom, a photon, an ion, or any quantum system that can have two states. Like a tiny Schrodinger\u2019s cat.", "So the input of a quantum algorithm is made of qubits. If you have n qubits, you have simultaneously 2^n configurations. You are not impressed ? With 300 qubits you have 2^300 states, this is number of atoms in the universe !", "Another important fact : if you measure a set of qubits, you won\u2019t see the whole superposition (you\u2019re not quantum), but just one of the configurations, at random, with a probability related to the amplitude of this configuration.", "There are several basic quantum algorithms that are used as building blocks for long term quantum machine learning (QML). These would be algorithms for finding the eigenvectors of a matrix, performing matrix multiplication or inverting a matrix, estimating the inner product or the distance between two vectors. Bear in mind these important quantum concepts : we can recover a classical description of a quantum state by multiple measurements, and most importantly we require to be able to load a vector, or a set of vectors, in a single quantum state. All these subroutines allow to perform linear algebra tasks with proven speedup, often exponentially faster in the size of the matrices or vectors, and quantified error guarantees.", "Note : There is a lot of research on different methods called \u201cquantum machine learning\u201d, which are based on parametrized quantum circuits. We hope that they might be very useful and powerful in the short term, however they don\u2019t reproduce analytically machine learning algorithms with proven guarantees in terms of speedup or accuracy. Our approach is more a computer science and long terme one .", "This is the key part! Given one vector v of dimension d, we can encode it by using each of its component as quantum amplitudes of states representing the standard basis . And this can be done using only log(d).", "We can now define the quantum encoding for a set of N vectors v_1,\u2026,v_N of our dataset. We want to start in superposition of the N vectors, each in dimension d. Each vector is given by its index i so we create a superposition of all indices using log(N) qubits.", "Let\u2019s talk briefly about classical machine learning. A fundamental difference is made between supervised and unsupervised algorithms : the first ones learn from inputs and their labels (I tell you these are cats, and that these are dogs, now learn), whereas the second ones learn without indication (I just tell you to find two different groups of animals).", "The k-means algorithm is one of the most basic unsupervised learning algorithms. It aims to find clusters in a dataset, by finding the k ideal centroids. Then, each point has a label, corresponding to its cluster !", "At each iteration, for each vector (dot), we calculate their distance to each centroid (black star). So there are k x N distances to calculate. It\u2019s a lot if you have a several millions data points.", "One iteration of the algorithm does two simple things : 1) We update the label to each vector, by looking at its current closest centroid. 2) We update each centroid by averaging the vectors in each cluster.", "In our paper, we have developed a quantum analogue of the k-means algorithm, called q-means. The steps are really the same, but everything is done in quantum superposition.", "1 - We start in a quantum superposition of all vectors in the dataset, and we compute simultaneously all distances to each one of the k centroids.2 - We can then label all vectors simultaneously by choosing their closest centroid. All labels are written in a quantum state, in superposition too. 3 - We then measure the label qubits. Quantum physics tells us that we will randomly see only one label : it means that the remaining quantum state is a superposition of all vectors with that label ! That\u2019s a purely quantum trick.4 - Using quantum matrix multiplication, we can obtain a quantum state describing the new centroid.5 - We perform tomography to retrieve the classical version of the new centroid6 - We redo the last steps until we have the k new centroids.", "Analysis : Because the N vectors were always used in superposition, the time to run this algorithm depends logarithmically in N ! The dependance to k and d is almost similar to the classical k-means, which is linear in N.", "Bear in mind that this is purely a theoretical algorithm that has not yet been tested on an actual quantum computer nor a classical simulator! Please go ahead if you\u2019re interested and try to implement it!", "An important question arises : how can we test the quality and the convergence of our quantum algorithm? There are 3 options :- Run the circuit on an actual quantum computer, but this is not feasible for now. - Run the circuit on a classical emulator of quantum circuits, which is feasible but limited in the number of qubits.- Since q-means follows exactly the same steps than k-means, we can classically implement a version of it (in python) by combining k-means with additional \u201cquantum\u201d errors, such as randomness and noise in the estimation of centroids, to mimic q-means.", "With the quantum subroutines for linear algebra described above, in particular the inner product estimation, we are now able to imagine quantum algorithms for several other ML cases : Quantum Neural Networks, Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks, Quantum Gaussian Mixture Models, maybe Quantum Spectral Clustering. It is exciting and everything will have to be rewritten.", "No.Let\u2019s face it, these algorithms are far ahead of us. They require a lot of good qubits with error correction, but they also require a quantum RAM (QRAM), needed to create the initial quantum vector encoding, which might also be difficult to build.", "Why bother then? First, if there is a chance that these algorithms might be used one day, we should look at them and see where it leads us. We should not wait to study algos, and we must start with the basics to catch up on more complex techniques. Classical ML is super fast growing field and some state of the art ideas could help QML. This is why having a QML paper at NeurIPS 2019 was a great opportunity!", "Moreover, it is already very important to draw a map our future possibilities. We should explore now what we could or couldn\u2019t do with a quantum computer in the long term. It is also important for people building quantum computers to know what kind of fundamental requirements are necessary in QML algorithms, what kind of state initialization we need to ensure a speedup, how we will be doing linear algebra, what level of precision is required, and so on.", "[1] S.
