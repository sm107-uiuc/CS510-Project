As one can imagine, we then need some data to be able to analyze. In its original form, that data was the survival of people from their birth to their deaths.", "It originated in the 17th century as a decision support tool. Firstly, for determining whether population growth in a particular area would justify opening a shop or not, and secondly, to assist in the determination of annuities.", "The two early data science pioneers that were responsible for these innovations were John Graunt and Edmond Halley. This fact is particularly valid for Halley with his improved version since it effectively signaled the birth of actuarial science.", "Survival analysis originated in the actuarial and medical world. It can, however, be used for the study of any two pairs of related events about the same subject, with said subject being part of a population. For example, the time from which as we commission asset until a particular failure mode occurs, or the time at which a subscriber first joins a service and the day she finally cancels, or churns.", "So when we say asset, we mean anything that produces income for an organization that needs to be maintained or retained, including but not restricted to physical assets, staff, and subscribers.", "In this article, we look at some theoretical background, a well as the analysis of some real-world asset failure data to gain specific insights.", "The definition of the survival function S is given by,", "with time, T the time of the event of interest. In the case of asset reliability, we speak of the reliability function.", "Reliability is defined as the probability that an asset or part will perform its intended function for a given amount of time under certain conditions.", "The survival function is the complement of the cumulative distribution of the event of interest in the case of reliability engineering, its failures, and in the case of subscription cancellations.", "Since the entire population or cohort will per definition survive until the beginning of the chosen study, analysis or reporting interval, and none will persist indefinitely, we can in general claim:", "The exact survival probability as a function of time for a particular population can be learned from data. This can be done using both parametric and non-parametric methods, as we see later with a real-world example.", "The density function of failure times, per definition, is", "The hazard rate or instantaneous failure rate function is described below:", "Remember that we earlier showed that per definition f(t)=-R\u2019(t).", "For more background on the survival function, please visit Wikipedia here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function, and on failure rates and the hazard function here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_rate.", "To apply survival analysis techniques to event data, like assets being commissioned and failing or subscribers joining and canceling, data need to be massaged into the usual format.", "In this practical example, we consider assets being installed in specific functional locations and replaced on failure. An individual\u2019s \u2018life\u2019 is defined as the time from the first installation until the first replacement or the interval from one replacement to the next. This interval can be defined in many different ways. It\u2019s vital that for a particular study or decision support production system that it\u2019s done clearly and consistently. It\u2019s also critical to make sure that the data engineering is efficient and correct.", "In the graph below, each line represents an asset location, each initial dot the first installation, and each subsequent dot a replacement event. The two vertical lines represent the start and end of the \u2018study\u2019 or \u2018experiment. The first line represents the initial data, and the second is today. The dots and inter-replacement times represent our sample.", "We re-arrange our data as a life or survival data set. Each replacement time/failure before the end of the study/report represents an event, and each asset that is still in use at the end of the period represents a \u2018censored observation.\u2019", "The survival data can be represented in table format, as illustrated by the table below.", "Event=1 indicates that a failure occurred, that is, the lifeline ends before the current observation period, and Event=0 means that the event of interest will happen at some unknown time in the future.", "Our customer suspects that some of their asset classes are suffering from infant mortality and would like to understand the situation better. They have recently started a reliability data quality initiative and can supply us with recent failure observations. The data is probably not enough to do comprehensive survival analysis and construct a full life table and bathtub curve. However, it should be enough to garner some insights around infant mortality and build a partial life table.", "As is often the case, we start with the Kaplan Meier estimator. As with Graunt and Halley centuries earlier, Kaplan and Meier made a fundamental contribution to survival analysis and actuarial science. This achievement happened when they published this innovative non-parametric method to estimate survival curves in the presence of censored data in 1958.", "The subset of the engineered data set for this example can be found here: https://drive.google.com/openid=1QW9b0MDjMoDPPO9iIBcL2xvKIQrjjreM", "The use of summary here gives us a life table for this asset class.", "The unit for time is years. It represents the interval valid for the remainder of the variables. The number of events at the time is given by n.event, and the probability of survival by survival.", "The ggfortify library allows us to plot an excellent visualization of the estimated reliability/survival function based on the input data using only a single command.", "We are also interested in looking at asset reliability per operating area.", "Note that this could also be per manufacturer, amp-hours (obtained from IoT or other instrumentation), capacity class, or any other factor of interest.", "As we can see below, two area seems to stand out in terms of reliability \u2014 one above the norm, and one below.", "For an asset class generally expected to last 15 years or more, having more less then 60% last four years seems to be a reason for concern. From here, one can launch an investigation into the root cause of the problem. These could include things like under-design, operating conditions, or quality issues with a manufacturer that mostly supply the region.", "As mentioned earlier, we can also analyze the failure event time data set with parametric methods.", "This is illustrated below, without going too deep into the theory involved. As can be seen in the subsequent graph, the parametric Weibull survival curve fits the non-parametric one reasonably well.", "We can also derive and plot the Hazard function:", "The Hazard function and the left-hand side of the bathtub curve", "The Hazard function plotted above is also the left-hand side of the bathtub curve.", "In this case, there is not sufficient data to determine if the probability of failure increases for this population as members age. Therefore a complete bathtub curve cannot be constructed.", "We can, however, conclude from the very high initial and then rapidly declining failure rate that the population suffers from high infant mortality. This gives us a further clue as to how we should investigate ways to improve asset reliability.", "The application of actuarial methods in asset management is a broad and exciting field. I hope you enjoyed this brief introduction. Other applications include forward risk profile calculation, inspection prioritization, and remaining useful life estimation.", "Your home for data science.
