Just over one month ago, Facebook\u2019s AI Research team published a paper outlining their results for a superhuman AI capable of consistently outplaying the world\u2019s top poker players. On its own, this is an amazing achievement for AI, but looking past that, it\u2019s set to deliver a devastating blow to the almost $4bn industry of online poker. In the coming months, millions of players worldwide and massive online tech companies will begin to see the effects as these AIs pop-up in online play. A major shift is required in the industry if it is to stay alive.", "The paper released by Facebook is a culmination of decades of work into the first AI to beat humans at a game with more than two teams. The AI coined \u201cPluribus\u201d beat world champion poker players consistently in a format identical to six-player online poker. Not only this, the AI was trained with less than $150 of resources, meaning such a system can be created by almost anyone.", "Importantly, the paper doesn\u2019t describe an exact winning formula, rather it outlines the approach used. This means that we won\u2019t be seeing duplicates of Pluribus tomorrow, but we might next month, or next year. Now that it\u2019s shown to be possible and the guiding light is there, various people or groups will work to recreate the AI as closely as possible. All it needs is one success and the AI can be shared instantly around the world.", "With the current level of scrutiny, it will be simple for any person or syndicate with such an AI to immediately start to win money in online poker. Initially, this isn\u2019t a problem for online poker companies, but for the humans who play it. As the poker tables become saturated with AI, the chance of any one human winning a game will drop to 0 as will their bank account. This will drive them out of the system at which point it becomes a problem for the online poker companies as their main source of revenue dries up. There may be some ongoing wars between AIs, but the quantity and volume will not be anywhere near the current levels.", "To avoid such a hit to the market, stricter security measures may be required. Though it\u2019s true it may be easy to catch such systems if they\u2019re winning every game, a good fraudster \u2014 and let\u2019s go with that term here, fraud \u2014 will be smart enough not to play so well as to trigger an alert, but rather play well enough across multiple accounts to make significant earnings. So some good approaches taken from other industries would be increased id checks to ensure accounts can be properly tracked as well as \u2018live playing\u2019, where users are recorded using web cameras while playing to ensure authenticity.", "Eventually, all these systems can be gamed and the only true way to detect such an AI is to be able to understand its play style and how it differs from that of regular humans. Such a system is not easy to build, itself is an AI, but one likely worth investing in.", "Online poker is a unique industry that still has large amounts of money being passed around based on a relatively simple game between a few people. It\u2019s likely that the industry won\u2019t disappear overnight, rather fizzle out slowly as consumers lose trust and interest in a game dominated by machines. But poker isn\u2019t the endgame, it\u2019s just the first step. Another high value industry with multiple players is the stock market itself. We\u2019ve already seen countless AI here which have failed to outperform humans, but with research like this, it\u2019s only a matter of time.", "Your home for data science.
