The more relevant challenge is being able to determine which tools fit the need cases of your organization.", "The valuable lesson was structuring the source control process using tools already familiar to data scientists.", "The final toolset we ended up with was:", "The below sections cover the thought process and implementation details needed to land on the final product. The specific system architecture may not extrapolate to all organizations, but this case study can provide a useful thought exercise in how to think through the selection of the right tools and comparing architecture tradeoffs.", "The design process for building out this platform started with establishing the right guiding questions that primed the architecture discussion. This helped with framing which tradeoffs to favor during the technical build.", "After putting out an Architecture Decision Record (ADR) proposal that laid out the problem scope and an initial architecture, the team and I landed on a rough plan for how to approach the POC.", "With the higher-level questions on tools and key features determined, I spent a few months refining a minimum viable product on this framework. This was my first time building a machine learning platform from scratch, so plenty of unanticipated implementation challenges arose that required some decision-making throughout the coding process.", "The first step is to determine how we know when we\u2019re done. For laying down the initial infrastructure and integration testing, we set a goal of deploying a neutral first launch that disregarded machine learning model performance. The idea is to keep the first model simple and get the infrastructure right. This idea was inspired by Google\u2019s rules formalizing effective machine learning frameworks.", "The first few models deployed will likely be high-value, low-hanging fruit that don\u2019t need complex and fancy features for training and deployment.", "The goal is to start with simple features:", "Make sure that the infrastructure has unit tests and integration tests, and that the learning parts of the system are encapsulated to allow fixtures and stubs to mock runtime conditions.", "Enabling and managing machine learning initiatives is a probabilistic endeavor. It is very difficult to predict which problems may be easy or difficult to solve and which approaches and model configurations will produce the optimal model. Developing a good model will often necessitate many sub-optimal iterations along the way and the pace of development is non-linear. There may be cultural gaps between machine learning and engineering teams due to different backgrounds, development styles, and values.", "A key metric for success on these projects is to focus less on the number of models deployed to production and more on the number of iterations of test models that were executed. Enabling fast and lightweight experimentation is more valuable in a machine learning product space than building out complex, feature-heavy R&D models.", "Model portability and easy configuration of simple, lightweight ML models are consequently higher value initial goals than investing in complex, high-effort R&D algorithm support like Tensorflow, Pytorch, or Spark frameworks.", "Key steps in deploying a model as an API web service for real-time inference:", "Beyond the work needed to simply stand up an ML API endpoint, there are additional considerations around how to accelerate developer productivity when building out new models.", "There are three typical issues that degrade the performance of deployed ML models.", "During my exploration of ML resources and frameworks, I came across these amazing blogs, articles, and presentations that helped guide my journey.
