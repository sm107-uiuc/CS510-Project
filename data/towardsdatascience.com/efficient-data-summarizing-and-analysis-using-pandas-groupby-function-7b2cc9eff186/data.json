This is very good at summarising, transforming, filtering, and a few other very essential data analysis tasks. In this article, I will explain the application of groupby function in detail with example.", "For this article, I will use a \u2018Students Performance\u2019 dataset from Kaggle. Please feel free download the dataset from here:", "Here I am importing the necessary packages and the dataset:", "Groupby function splits the dataset based on criteria that you define. Here I am showing the process behind the groupby function. It will give you an idea, how much work we may have to do if we would not have groupby function. I will make a new smaller dataset of two columns only to demonstrate in this section. The columns are \u2018gender\u2019 and \u2018reading score\u2019.", "Let\u2019s find out the average reading score gender-wise", "First, we need to split the dataset based on gender. Generate the data for females only.", "In the same way, generate the data for the males,", "Using females and males dataset above to calculate the mean reading score for females and males respectively.", "The mean reading score of females is 72.608 and the mean reading score for males is 65.473. Now, make a DataFrame for the mean reading score of females and males.", "Now, let\u2019s solve the same problem with the groupby function. Splitting the data based on gender and applying the \u2018mean\u2019 on it with just one simple line of code:", "This small piece of code gives the same result.", "I will use the original dataset \u2018df\u2019 now. Make groups of \u2018race/ethnicity\u2019.", "It returns an object. Now check the datatype of \u2018race\u2019.", "So, we generated a DataFrameGroupBy object. Calling groups on this DataFrameGroupBy object will return the indices of each group.", "Have a look at the output above. Groupby function splits the data into subgroups and you can now see the indices of each subgroup. That\u2019s great! But only the indices are not enough. We need to see the real data of each group. The function \u2018get_group\u2019 helps with that.", "I am showing the part of the results here. The original output is much bigger.", "Find the size of each group", "Calling size on the \u2018race\u2019 object will give the size of each group", "You can loop over the groups. Here is an example:", "In all the examples above, we only grouped by one variable. But grouping by multiple variables is also possible. Here I am grouping by \u2018race/ethnicity\u2019 and \u2018gender\u2019. This should return the number of data of each race segregated by gender.", "This example aggregates the data using \u2018size\u2019. There are other aggregate functions as well. Here is the list of all the aggregate functions:", "Please try them out. Just replace any of these aggregate functions instead of the \u2018size\u2019 in the above example.", "The way we can use groupby on multiple variables, using multiple aggregate functions is also possible. This next example will group by \u2018race/ethnicity and will aggregate using \u2018max\u2019 and \u2018min\u2019 functions.", "The aggregate function worked on each column here.

Also, use two aggregate functions \u2018min\u2019 and \u2018max\u2019. Let\u2019s make a DataFrame that contains the maximum and minimum score in math, reading, and writing for each group segregated by gender.", "Different aggregate functions on different columns", "Group by \u2018race/ethnicity\u2019 and use max and mean on math score and median and min on reading score.", "Cool, right? But the column names are not that nice and clear. They should be clearer and nicer. We can change the column names like this:", "Exactly the same DataFrame, but a lot more organized.", "Use the aggregate function on nominal columns", "In all the examples above, we used aggregate functions on numeric columns. Apply aggregate functions on some nominal columns such as \u2018lunch\u2019 and \u2018parental level of education\u2019.", "As you can see in the code above, the syntax was different for nominal data. Just as reminder mode is the data that appears the most.", "Calculate how many kids \u2018parental levels of education\u2019 is the high school level.", "If you are not used to using lambda, please check out this article:", "Cut the \u2018math score\u2019 column in three even buckets and define them as low, average and high scores", "If you want to set the cut point and define your low, average, and high, that is also a simple method.", "Generate a new column in the DataFrame \u2018df\u2019 and add a column that contains the difference of each math score from the mean math score.", "Look at the DataFrame above. There is a new column at the end named \u2018Distance From the Mean\u2019.", "You can filter out the data based on certain conditions to make the data more meaningful. Filter the group or race that has less than 100 rows of data.", "The code above says that keep the groups that have a length of more than 100. Check the length of the original DataFrame \u2018df\u2019 and the filtered DataFrame \u2018df_n\u2019.", "The length of the original DataFrame is 1000 and after applying the filter the length of the DataFrame becomes 911.", "Map the mean reading score of each group and generate a new column.", "Look at this DataFrame. There is a new column named \u2018New\u2019 at the end, that is containing the mean reading score of the corresponding group.", "As we all know, a picture says a thousand words. Here is some demonstration of visualization techniques in groupby. Make a bar plot of the parental level of education.", "Please try making a pie plot. You just need to use \u2018pie\u2019 instead of \u2018bar\u2019 in the code above. If you do not pass any \u2018kind\u2019, the plot will be a simple line plot. Let\u2019s plot the mean math score of each group.", "In this article, you learned to group and summarize the data in many different ways.
