Now there are so many deep learning frameworks available that the average deep learning practitioner probably isn\u2019t even aware of all of them. With so many options available, which framework should you pick?", "In this article, I will give you a tour of some of the most common Python deep learning frameworks and compare them in a way that allows you to decide which framework is the right one to use in your projects.", "I have purposely bundled these two frameworks together because the latest versions of TensorFlow are tightly integrated with Keras. Keras serves as a high-level programming interface that uses TensorFlow as a backend. This means that if you use Keras, you are effectively using TensorFlow as well.", "TensorFlow was released in 2015 by the Google Brain Team and is arguably the most popular deep learning framework as of 2020. However, because of the steep learning curve involved in the graph programming model for TensorFlow, a researcher at Google named Fran\u00e7ois Chollet created Keras to provide a more intuitive and high-level interface for interacting with TensorFlow.", "It\u2019s very clear from the list above that Keras is easy to use, yet scalable and flexible enough to solve a wide range of deep learning problems.", "PyTorch is a deep learning framework that was created and initially released by Facebook AI Research (FAIR) in 2016. It is similar to Keras but has a more complex API, as well as interfaces for Python, Java, and C++. Interestingly, several modern deep learning software products were created using PyTorch such as Tesla Autopilot and Uber\u2019s Pyro.", "Caffe, which stands for Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding, is a deep learning framework that was developed and released by researchers at UC Berkeley in 2013. It was originally developed in C++ but also features a Python interface. Caffe was designed with expressibility and speed in mind and is geared towards computer vision applications. However, as of 2020, it is outdated as a standalone framework since Facebook created Caffe2 to extend the capabilities of Caffe and then later merged Caffe2 into PyTorch.", "Apache MXNet is a deep learning library created by the Apache Software Foundation. It supports many different languages and is supported by several cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Amazon also chose MXNet as the top deep learning framework at AWS.", "The two frameworks that are the most popular (and for good reasons) are TensorFlow/Keras and PyTorch. Overall, for deep learning applications in general, these are arguably the best frameworks to use. Both frameworks offer a balance between high-level APIs and the ability to customize your deep learning models without compromising on functionality. I am personally a fan of Keras and if I had to choose between PyTorch and Keras I would choose Keras as the best overall deep learning framework. However, PyTorch is definitely not far behind and MXNet is also a decent option to consider.", "Keras is easily the best framework for beginners to start with. The API is extremely simple and easy to understand. There is a reason why Fran\u00e7ois Chollet, the creator of Keras, used the phrase \u201cdeep learning for humans\u201d to describe his library. If you are a beginner just getting started with deep learning or even an experienced deep learning practitioner who wants to quickly put together a deep learning model in just a few lines of code, I would recommend starting with Keras.", "In advanced research involving deep learning, especially where the goal is to design new architectures or come up with novel methods, the ability to improvise and create highly customized neural networks is extremely important. For this reason, PyTorch, which offers a large ecosystem of additional libraries that support it as well as the ability to extend and customize its modules, is gaining popularity in research. Consider the graph below in which PyTorch achieved a 194 percent increase in arxiv.org paper mentions in the given period from 2018 to 2019. Compare this statistic to the 23 percent increase in mentions for TensorFlow and it is clear that PyTorch is growing faster in the research community. In fact, this data is a year old and PyTorch may have already surpassed TensorFlow in the research community as of 2020.", "Your home for data science.
