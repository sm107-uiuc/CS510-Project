Here\u2019s the Difference.", "description": "The similarities and differences between data analytics and data science in interviews: data scientist and data analyst: Python, SQL, Tableau, supervised."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "anchor_text": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "paragraph_index": 14}], "all_paragraphs": ["Many of the readers here on Medium are looking to be a data scientist or data analyst, and are therefore interested in the interview process for each position. In my experience, I have interviewed with several companies for both roles. Below, I will detail the process for both roles and highlight where they are similar and where they are different.", "Data scientists can expect to automate manual processes at their company. Using machine learning packages from libraries like sklearn and TensorFlow, a data scientist will ingest data, clean it, train and evaluate a model, and output suggestions or predictions for an end-user. Some of the process focuses on coding and algorithms, while the other part of the process focuses on soft skills like developing the business problem and explaining the results to an end-user. You will work with tools like Jupyter Notebook and programming languages like Python and R (sometimes SAS).", "A data scientist interview can be daunting and overwhelming to prepare for, but with the steps that I will outline below, I hope to shed some useful light on the process that will make you more confident in your next data scientist interview.", "Overall, the process includes phone screens by the recruiter and hiring manager. Then, meeting with the team for a conceptual and coding interview (some interviews do not include coding, but will instead, require a take-home evaluation of a common business problem that you would be likely to encounter at the company in the future). Next, you will explain your findings to either another data scientist or an upper leadership member like a senior product manager. Lastly, you will summarize all that you learned from the previous interviews, as well as compile reasons as to why you are the best fit for the role.", "A data analyst can expect to query database tables, perform joins, subqueries, and report on data requests. You will work with several stakeholders to gather requirements for each request. You will work with tools like SQL and PostgreSQL or other querying platforms, along with Tableau, PowerBI, and other dashboard tools.", "The data analyst interview will share quite a bit of similar steps, especially in the process overall. However, the differences and uniqueness lie in the concepts and coding challenges of the interview. You will expect to have phone screens with your recruiter and hiring manager. Then, you will meet with other data analysts on the team to go over key concepts like databases. After that, you will perform a coding challenge, usually entailing common SQL questions that will require you to join and sub-query. Next, you will explain results to another data analyst or a stakeholder like a customer success manager. Lastly, you will discuss your previous interviews and what you thought about the team to the hiring manager, as well as outline the reasons as to why you should be a data analyst at that company.", "As you will see below, both data science and data analytics interviews share a similar process. While the process may be similar, the details of the process may differ, which I will refer to later. Here are the commonalities of the steps in the interview process:", "common tools: SQL, Tableau, and Jira (ticketing platform)", "While the process is the same, the main differences lie within the specialist part of the process, usually.", "As you can see, there might be surprisingly more similarities between these to roles and their respective interview processes than you would have expected. A lot of the similarities stem from the interview process as a whole, and some common tools like SQL. Other similarities are the soft skills you will need to know as you develop new projects and have to meet with different stakeholders. Not surprisingly, there are key differences in the specialties of the roles like more complex SQL querying and reporting with Tableau for data analysts, and for a data scientist, a focus on the theory of common machine learning algorithms like decisions trees and times series, as well as coding in Python some typical functions and for loops you would use in your future role.", "If you would like to read about the data scientist interview process, feel free to check out my other article here [3]:", "I also have more articles in general regarding data science and data analytics on my Medium profile [4]:", "I hope you found this article useful and interesting.
