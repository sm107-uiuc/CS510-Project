I\u2019m going to show you how to analyze the Word Happiness Report and visualize it using Power BI without any line of code.", "But first a little introduction into the World Happiness Report:", "The World Happiness Report is an annual publication of the United Nations Sustainable Development Solutions Network. It contains articles, and rankings of national happiness based on respondent ratings of their own lives, which the report also correlates with various life factors. \u2014 Wikipedia", "If you want to learn more about the report there is an official website that gives you tons of insights.", "We\u2019re using the 2017 data of the World Happiness Report in .csv format. While there is newer data available this one is far from outdated and does have well structured and complete data.", "You can download the .csv from my Github repository. If you\u2019re not experienced with Github and git don\u2019t worry there is a download option available. Click Clone or download and choose Download ZIP. Extract the data somewhere on your computer. Let\u2019s start analyzing.", "Microsoft Power BI Desktop is a free download and available from the Windows Store. Those of you who prefer a standalone installer instead of downloading from the Windows Store can take it from here.", "Now we\u2019re ready to get our hands dirty on the analysis and Power BI Desktop. To do so we\u2019re following the general procedure of extract, transform, load (ETL).", "Start Power BI Desktop and feel free to sign up or click the Already have a Power BI account link below the registration form.", "From there you can sign in or create a Power BI account and try for free.", "Now click Get data from the Getting Started window and choose Text/CSV as the data source.", "Find the data-2017.csv file you\u2019ve downloaded before.", "Next, we select Do not detect data types from the Data Type Detection drop-down list and click Transform Data.", "Why not auto-detect the data types? Mostly auto-detection is of help but sometimes data types are detected wrong and cause issues in the analysis process. Besides that, we\u2019ll learn how to do this important step manually which is an important skill in your data analysis toolbox.", "Now that we extracted our data from the .csv file we\u2019re going to transform it.", "As you might have spotted immediately the first row of our data contains the actual headers (also called features in data analysis). To use the first row as headers we apply our first transformation step by clicking Use First Row as Headers on the command ribbon.", "Notice how the first row gets promoted as headers for our data.", "In fact, this action actually applied two steps: You can observe this in the Applied Steps panel on the right side. Besides the Promoted Headers step, Power BI tried (again) to infer the data type of each feature and didn\u2019t do a good job in my case.", "Why do I get the wrong data types? There are many reasons why the detection of data types can go wrong. The most common ones are the regional settings of the device you\u2019re working on. If your device has regional settings different than English (United States) or English(United Kingdom), it\u2019s worth changing the regional settings in Power BI to match your data. In my case, I had to switch from English (Switzerland) \u2014 which is a very uncommon setting \u2014 to English (United States). It is very easy to do so and you can follow the advice here.", "To undo the Change Type step that Power BI applied simply click the X icon next to it.", "We\u2019re learning a very important concept of Power BI here: All the transformation you did can be seen as a series of steps that are applied one by one to the underlining data. This way you keep the original data as-is (unmodified) and add/remove transformation steps on the fly. Remember this behavior as it makes data transformation very powerful and flexible.", "Can I see what each step did to my data? Yes, you can jump back and forth between your transformation steps by simply clicking a single step in the Applied Steps panel. This way you can monitor what your transformation step actually did with the data.", "Now it\u2019s time to manually define the data types. Select the overall Happiness Score feature and observe its current data type. This feature should be of data type Decimal Number but is currently assigned to data type Text. This is indicated by the little ABC icon next to the feature name or the value on the Data Type control.", "Let\u2019s change it by clicking the Data Type control and choosing Decimal Number.", "See how the data in the column changed (according to your regional settings) and how the 1.2 icon indicates the new data type.", "Repeat this step for every feature in our data and set it to the corresponding Power BI data type according to the list below.", "Now that we have set the right data types we can go ahead and clean up the data a little bit. A typical task in data analysis is checking for missing values like empty values, NaN values or n.a. values.", "Power BI already gives you a nice visual indication if the data contains missing values. You can spot such an indication on the Job Satisfaction feature. Hover the indicator and click Remove Empty to clean the missing values from our data.", "What are the missing values in our data? There is no Job Satisfaction data available for North Cyprus and South Sudan as indicated by NaN values. By removing this data we remove the complete entry for both countries. In other words: These countries will not show up in our analysis.", "As our last step click Close & Apply and feel free to save your work using the Save icon.", "Now that we transformed and cleaned our data we\u2019re ready to visualize it and answer our main question: Are you living in a happy country?", "We are going to visualize the top 10 happiest and bottom 10 least happy countries. Also, we\u2019re going to use the Power BI QnA visual to answer additional questions about our data.", "Let\u2019s add a Stacked bar chart visual by clicking the icon from the Visualizations panel.", "While the visual is still selected check the Country and Happiness Score field from the Fields panel. This will add Country as the Axis value and the Happiness Score as Value giving us already a view on all countries sorted by Happiness Score.", "Let\u2019s narrow it down to the top 10 Countries. Select the visual, expand the Country is (All) Filter on the Filters panel and select Top N from the Filter type drop-down list. Set it to Top 10 under Show items.", "To much? See the screenshot below for details.", "Finally, drag and drop the Happiness Score field from the Fields panel to the By value pane of the filter and click Apply filter.", "Repeat these steps once again to add a second visual for the least happy countries. This time you choose Bottom 10 instead of Top 10 as the filter.", "Set the title for both of your visuals accordingly. To do this select the visual, click the Format icon and set the Title text to Top 10 happiest Countries and Bottom 10 least happy Countries.", "To sort the result ascending, click the little \u2026 icon on the visuals right top corner.", "As the last step, we add the Map and QnA visual to our page. For the Map visual check Country in the Fields panel just like before.", "We\u2019re done designing our first data report! Your final view should look similar to the screen below.", "Let\u2019s ask Power BI QnA! I\u2019m living in Germany so I want to know the Happiness Rank of my Country.", "Click into the Ask a question about your data box and simply phrase something like Happiness Rank of Germany.", "This immediately gives me rank #16. So Germany is not within the top 10 but it has a quite decent rank. How is your Country doing?", "Let\u2019s share your analysis with friends or colleagues by exporting it to a PDF file. Go to File and click Export to PDF.", "Congratulations! You\u2019ve extracted the data from a .csv file, transformed the data, cleaned the data and finally visualized it to give insights on it and answered our initial question.", "Your home for data science.
