By comparison, the world had produced just 1.2 zettabytes of data by the year 2010. That represents explosive growth of 3,000% in a single decade. Obviously, this presents both opportunities and challenges.", "In The Lean Startup, Eric Ries explores how innovation leaders use data to support experimentation. A strong data infrastructure allows an organization to validate hypotheses about customer values. Data provides a common language across business functions, allowing the organization to move collectively towards empirically derived truth.", "The very existence of an organization can be threatened by poor data quality.", "So says Joe Peppard, Principal Research Scientist at MIT. Data strategy helps an organization mitigate risk and protect their stakeholders, including customers, suppliers, and employees.", "As discussed in The Data Management Body of Knowledge, The Aiken Pyramid outlines core Data Strategy concepts in a structure that illustrates how these functions build upon each other. At the pinnacle of the diagram, Data Science activities shouldn\u2019t even be attempted until these other structures are in place and proven to be functioning effectively.", "Here are six core topics that we\u2019ll discuss in this writeup:", "It\u2019s important to begin a Data Strategy effort with a conversation about the mission statement and strategic aims of the organization. Connecting data to business outcomes will drive the motivation to sustain Data Governance efforts. The team can then document this motivation in the Data Governance Charter, which should include a clear vision of the organization\u2019s future state when it comes to data.", "As we turn to talking about the organizational structures required to support Data Governance, I want to emphasize that Data Governance is a process not a project. There isn\u2019t a set end date. Therefore, it\u2019s important to maintain continuity by setting up Roles & Responsibilities that will outlast any specific individual contributor.", "Organizational structures to support Data Governance:", "How to get started: here are three practical initial steps for a Data Governance initiative:", "Setting up Data Governance definitely requires time and energy, but it\u2019s foundational to improving the organization\u2019s data infrastructure. It\u2019s truly the key to unlocking other potential data-related initiatives, including Data Science.", "Data Governance is an ongoing process, not a project", "The DMBOK identifies nine dimensions related to Data Quality: Accuracy, Completeness, Consistency, Integrity, Reasonability, Timeliness, Uniqueness/Deduplication, Validity, and Accessibility.", "Data should be fit for a purpose. It should meet the requirements of its authors, users, and administrators.", "This area represents the transformation of business needs into technical specifications. Architecture describes the current and future state of data infrastructure. The Enterprise Data Model and Data Flow Diagram are key tools that form the backbone of Data Architecture.", "An Enterprise Data Model is a holistic, enterprise-level, implementation-independent Conceptual or Logical data model that provides a common, consistent view of data across the enterprise.", "A Data Flow Diagram defines the requirements and master blueprint for storage and processing across databases, platforms, and networks. Here is an example Data Flow Diagram presented as a Matrix. A matrix provides a clear overview of data interchange. You could add more detail to this layout, such as comments indicating storage system.", "How to Get Started with Data Architecture:", "Modeling provides a blueprint for how data is connected.", "Once the modeling process is complete, the team may choose to undertake a process of reverse engineering from Physical Model, to Logical Model, to Conceptual Model, in order to ensure requirements are met.", "At large enterprises, there\u2019s often a tendency to jump right into Logical Model and skip the Conceptual Model entirely. However, this is a mistake \u2014 there\u2019s significant value in starting with the Conceptual Model as it is a significant aid to creating a common understanding across the team of data entities and relationships.", "How to Get Started with Data Modeling:", "This was one of the concepts that I was most unfamiliar with when I started reading the DMBOK. So I\u2019ll hope to provide you with a more intuitive understanding of what this area entails.", "Master Data is information about business entities. It is collected and preserved as a \u201csource of truth\u201d and a resource across the entire organization. This reduces variation in how critical entities are defined and identified, and allows for data to be shared across business functions and applications. It promotes standards of shared data models and integration patterns.", "Similarly, Reference Data refers to data that should be shared across the organization. It\u2019s often gathered from external sources, and it\u2019s used to provide context to the organization\u2019s functions and activities.", "Master and Reference Data provide a common language and emphasize that data is a shared asset across the organization.", "The data warehouse is a specific infrastructure element that provides data consumers, such as analysts and data scientists, with access to data that has been shaped to conform to business rules and is stored in an easy-to-query format.", "The data warehouse typically connects information from multiple \u201csource-of-truth\u201d transactional databases. The contents of a data warehouse have been restructured for speed and ease of querying. This serves to increase performance by partitioning, indexing, and decreasing the complexity of table joins.", "Business intelligence is typically represented by reports and dashboards that provide insight to business stakeholders.", "The only sins that ever get addressed interrupt the flow of money.", "I really like this quote from business intelligence consultant Rob Collie because it illustrates the fact that business intelligence will often reveal all the data quality issues that persist in a business. Just because a data quality problem isn\u2019t interrupting the cash flow, that doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t insidiously impeding the organization\u2019s strategic objectives.", "This is why it is so important to start Data Strategy efforts by creating governance and promoting data quality that then will flow into effective advanced analytics like business intelligence and data science projects.", "How to Get Started with Data Warehousing:", "How to Get Started with Business Intelligence:", "These elements of Data Strategy sit toward the top of the Aiken Pyramid, where we are starting to get into activities such as advanced analytics and machine learning that might be one step more complicated than BI.", "Like Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs, Data Science actualization cannot be attained without first achieving the physiological and safety needs of Data Governance, Data Quality, and Data Architecture at the foundational levels of the Aiken Pyramid.", "Understanding Data Strategy transforms a data scientist from being simply a consumer of data into an empowered advocate for better data management practices at their organization.", "I\u2019m happy to answer any questions you have at this point \u2014 just be forewarned: as a statistician, I don\u2019t have to be right, only close.
