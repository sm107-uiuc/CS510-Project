However, What if the analysis you have is wrong? What would it be then \u2026", "As a matter of fact, data validation is a critical process of any data operation ranged from reporting, dashboard, and modeling. If you crunch the flawed data, you cannot expect any right action from it. And you also feel miserable if anyone uses it to make a decision.", "I once made a mistake in the analysis during my working life. Luckily, I had a chance to fix it", "But maybe you are not as lucky as me.", "That\u2019s why I conclude what I have faced before by myself on those data quality topics to guide you guys through any analysis. Keep it in mind before you miss it out.", "Once you get the data, you can start any analysis with a simple business question. After that, you can do the exploratory data analysis on the data as much as you want. It\u2019s easier when you only have a single data set.", "But, what If you have to join several data set together. The unit of analysis plays an important part here.", "Let\u2019s start with the simple example; you have customer data that each row represents each customer. You want to know how many credit cards each customer is holding. You need to join the customer data (1 row per customer) with membership credit card data (1 row per card).", "One thing to keep in mind is that 1 customer can hold many credit cards. When we join both data sets together, you need to keep up on track with the row number carefully. Because your data set will not remain at the customer level anymore, it will be on the credit card level instead. No matter you do Left, right, inner, or outer join. This will leads to your conclusion of the analysis.", "The example seems like there is nothing to be concerned about as long as you can track each data set's level and know what you are doing. If you have so much time to understand the unit of analysis for each data set, It might not be a problem.", "However, If you have to do the ad-hoc analysis within 3 hours to present to the high-level manager. Also, you never take a glance at the data set at all.", "That\u2019s when problems arise, and It could happen to you at any time. Trust me; I have to go through a lot of unexpected ad-hoc with a limited time.", "Nowadays, this is the first thing I have to keep in mind when I slice and dice the data. Many people make a mistake on this, and it\u2019s a thing that everyone has to know before presenting your analysis to other parties.", "Missing value can be anything ranged from blank, non-space, NULL, NaN, etc. The possibility is limitless based on your data set and the tool (pandas, spark, excel, etc.) you use for data analysis. Sometimes it\u2019s already encoding by a numeric value such as -999, 9999999, etc.", "This makes you have a headache if you are not familiar with the data set or system you deal with. You can make a simple assumption for those blank value to be the missing value in some cases. But, for the encoding one, you can guess what it should be or ask the data source person about the meaning of those weird values.", "The worst case is that you don\u2019t have anyone to ask for. And, Sometimes, no one even knows about it.", "Besides, If you pass the first step of missing value validation, the missing value can still lead you to the wrong conclusion.", "For example, If you use the Pandas library to crunch the data, there is a \u201cvalue count\u201d method that I usually use a lot during the analysis. The default behavior of this method is not taking into account the missing value.", "This is what you need to understand before using any tools thoroughly. You may report the number of each distinct value, but you forget to report that around 80 % is missing in that column.", "This leads to a different conclusion in the end.", "Also, for the modeling task, you need to choose what to do within because many of the implemented algorithms don\u2019t support the missing value in the data set. And, your treatment of it could lead to prediction bias in some cases.", "I wrote an article about the kind of missing data in the past. Please feel free to take a look at it. There is no easy answer to fix this problem. It would be best if you made it clearer by asking and validating with others. Consensus between the analytics team and user could be reached for this topic.", "The data acquisition can be varied depending on the business operation process.", "How the source system captures the data could lead to duplication.", "Suppose you process the data without the count distinct method. You will never know about it at all. The duplicate can occur on different levels. The duplication level depends on how many columns you have and the unit of analysis you want to do.", "Let\u2019s say you want to check the duplication in the credit card level. It would be best if you dropped the duplication on both customer_id and credit_card_number. But if you are only interested in customer_id, there is no need to bring the credit_card_number in.", "I have just faced data duplication by myself recently. I received the data set of car parking in my working building. Due to the source system, the raw data will be captured both the entrance and exit transactions.", "However, the entrance transaction seems to be a mock-up. The duplication has been introduced here.", "There is no useful information on the entrance transaction, and it can lead to double the number of real transactions in the building. I am lucky to have benchmark data that the operation team used in the past to compare with. I can reach a similar result after dropping those rows.", "Unfortunately, no one tells me when I received the data that there is such a duplication inside it. I have to re-check it by myself, and I am fortunate in this case.", "Imagined that I report the number without knowing that the duplication is inside the data. That would be a very terrible thing to happen in my working life.", "Curiosity is the important part here. You should always ask yourself during the analysis. Is this number make sense to you based on the other numbers?", "For instance, you have a parking seat around 2,000 slots, but you have a membership of around 4,000 customers. Would it be possible? It would, or wouldn\u2019t. You are the one who has to find the answer.", "Data analysis is the task that you have to go back and forth among several parties. Each party has its own understanding of the data. They see it from a different perspective. Most of the time, they have a familiar number about the data in mind. Your responsibility is to link those numbers together. And make a big picture out of every piece of information.", "The hard thing about it is you may not be familiar with the usual number of the data. That\u2019s why I raise the issue here about is the data make your sense?", "I suggest that you should always be suspected of whether the number is right all the time. From the previous example in data duplication, you can see that it may not be right 100 % even if the number seems right to you at first sight. You will never know if the value is right or wrong until you ask yourself a question.", "I saw that the number could make some sense to you but not for the other parties.", "The business team is the one who works closely with the operation. They have to track the metric number on a daily or weekly basis.", "I recommend that you check the number of each conclusion with the operation team first before finalizing it to the management team for every data analysis.", "I once trust the data and further analyze it until I had a chance to discuss it with the business team. Then, the fact hit me hard that my conclusion is impossible. This scenario should not happen in the real operational process. Thus, It took me to investigate more on what was happening with the data.", "Even everything seems right in the end. But, It may be wrong from the start.", "Often ask yourself a question about the number, and don\u2019t assume anything big by yourself. Your curiosity and communication with others are necessary here.", "I once submitted the analysis to my lead. And 2 weeks later, he returned to me and asked what the current number of the analysis. I re-ran the analysis and reported the updated number. However, I got the question.", "Why has this number changed that much in 2 weeks?", "The simple question that took me several days to solve it. The problem is that after the day, I submitted the analysis. The data engineering team had patched the table in the data lake. This resulted in a number change in some rows, which lead to a different number of my updates.", "But what is the right number for this analysis? The answer is that it depends on the day you query the data. The data were valid at that time 2 weeks ago, But now there has more valid data.", "The truth about the data can be changed over time", "You are the only one who suffers from this problem because you have to guarantee your analysis's validity. If you save the query data separately, you may reproduce the result to prove your credibility. Sometimes, the business team won\u2019t understand this point and lead to less trust in your future analysis.", "Then, how to solve this problem?", "There is a best practice for designing the data lake based on this issue. You can find it in A Beginner\u2019s Guide to Data Engineering \u2014 Part II, written by Robert Chang. It\u2019s called Enforce Idempotency. I really recommend you to take a look at the article. It\u2019s on the superb level of explanation and solves those problems we talked about earlier.", "But if you don\u2019t have a data engineering team to take care of this issue. I may suggest that you have a backup of your data source. It\u2019s just to make sure that you can reproduce the number back from the past. Sometimes, It will save your creditability.", "We have gone through many topics here. In each part, I share what I have done wrong in the past. There is a solid way to solve some issues, but you need to keep in mind and remark it yourself for some. Data analysis is a task that needs your attention so much.", "One mistake in your code can lead to a dreadful result.", "Creditability is an important factor when you deal with others. If you keep up your credit at a high level, It will make others feel comfortable deciding based on your report.", "However, If you have made a mistake, you need to be brave enough to admit and fix yourself.", "That\u2019s a part of how you will grow up to be a senior or a higher position in career life. You take responsibility for what you are doing! We can learn by falling over. Everyone has grown up from their own mistake, like the famous quote in history.", "The only man who makes no mistakes is the man who never does anything.\u201d \u2014 President Roosevelt.", "Don\u2019t be afraid to do it!", "Your home for data science.
