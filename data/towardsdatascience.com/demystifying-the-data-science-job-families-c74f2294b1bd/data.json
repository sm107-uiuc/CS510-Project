Every industry has geared up for the race to embrace A.I. as an indispensable tool to pursue new avenues in strengthening or diversifying their existing offerings. This new adventure has, therefore, led to massive hiring of people with relevant A.I. skills. However, given the huge demand and supply gap combined with the hazy requirements from different organizations, the expectations from a data scientist and similar roles are largely misunderstood.", "Recently, with the hype around Data Science, the market has been floating several fancy roles that further fuelled confusion among the new entrants into the field. For aspiring enthusiasts, understanding where to start from and which job family to pursue is indeed overwhelming. This blog post aims to delineate the differences among the various job families within data science and help you understand how each role is different and what skills are required to pursue each of the respective job titles.", "I presume you understand the fundamental meaning of the terms A.I., Machine Learning and Deep Learning. In case, you are still a tad bit confused, please feel free to refer my earlier post that sheds light on the aforementioned complicated terms.", "Here is a summary of the distinct fields that we will deal with \u2014", "The 3 fields can be defined using a Venn diagram as shown below-", "Additionally, here a few other terms that we would reference directly or indirectly.", "If we look at the Data Science field wholistically, it encompasses every field we listed above. In a nutshell, we would need data engineering, data visualization, business intelligence, and A.I. to deliver data science solutions of any scale and complexity. The following illustration helps in understanding how these distinct skills stack together under \u2018Data Science\u2019", "To simplify things from an organization\u2019s data team perspective, there are at least 3 separate teams focussing on Data Engineering, AI and BI to achieve a shared goal. Also, when a data-science based role is defined, there is a definite overlap of skills between the 3 fields. We will explore this further soon.", "Before moving ahead, I wanted to help you understand the separation of skills as a natural course in any domain (as it is not restricted to data science). Since most data science enthusiasts flocking are from a software background, it would be worthwhile to take a known situation within the tech field and compare with AI.", "Similar to Data Science, the Software Engineering field is also an umbrella term, that encompasses a variety of different skills. A web developer, Front End Engineer, Full-stack developer, Big Data Engineer, UI Engineer, Data Engineer, etc. are all tagged as Software engineers. Though each of the aforementioned role outline distinct skillsets for a tech outcome; the wholistic definition will still fall under software engineering.", "Akin to Software Engineering, Data Science is also an umbrella job family that encompasses several distinct job roles within.", "Let us now explore the high-level responsibilities expected from a job family within the data science ecosystem.", "We will start with the base role \u2014", "Core Skills \u2014 SQL, ETL, Big Data (Hadoop, Hive, Pig, Spark, etc.), Cloud Ecosystem for Big Data (say, AWS EMR, Redshift, Dynamo, Aurora or Azure/GCP related services)", "Core skills \u2014 SQL, Data Visualisation (say, Tableau, SpotFire, etc.), business acumen, Reporting (Dashboarding)", "Core Skills- Machine Learning and or Deep Learning, one or more ML friendly programming language (Python/R/Julia), Scripting, Data Visualization, Business Acumen, Data Engineering", "Core Skills \u2014 Machine Learning, (limited programming proficiency)", "Core skills- Machine Learning, Software Engineering", "The 5 aforementioned roles may not always exist within an organization. More specifically, most organizations don\u2019t need 5 distinct roles within the data science job family. A significant majority of aspiring AI companies are still in a very early stage of adopting AI. In such organizations, most business needs can be fulfilled with 2 or at most 3 different data roles from the above list.", "However, as an organization scale and the data culture matures, the AI sophistication also matures and gradually demands people with distinct and more niche skills within each role. To summarize and easily interpret the differences between various data science roles, we can stack together all the relevant roles within the Data Science job family as shown below.", "The objective of this article was to help you distill the differences that exist among various roles within a data science job family. The above 5 job roles may not be the exhaustive ones but will definitely help you understand a broad categorization of relevant skills. As the data culture and AI adoption scales, this matrix is bound to fragment further into more specific and niche roles.", "In case you are interested you can explore my other post relevant in this context \u2014 Why do we need AWS Sagemaker?", "The article walks through at a high-level about how does the service supplement the required Data Engineering and Software Engineering skill for a Data Scientist to deploy ML experiments and prototypes into large scale fully functional and elastic APIs services.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Artificial Intelligence professional and published author of books on Machine Learning, Deep Learning and IoT.
