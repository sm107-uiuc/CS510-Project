He discovered the linear algebra method that carries his name through his work as a late 19th century map maker, but it continues to be an efficient trick that fuels many machine learning models. This article will discuss the mathematical underpinnings of the method, and show two applications to linear regression and Monte-Carlo simulation.", "I\u2019ll try to keep the linear algebra short, but it\u2019s unavoidable: appreciate that linear algebra is simply a method for solving systems of equations efficiently, and also appreciate that advanced linear algebra methods are core to machine learning. Apologies aside, let\u2019s dive in.", "Cholesky decomposition reduces a symmetric matrix into a lower-triangular matrix which when multiplied by it\u2019s transpose produces the original symmetric matrix. If that made zero sense, this is how it looks:", "The guts of this method get a little tricky \u2014 I\u2019ll present it here, but this would be the part of the post to skip over for the feint of heart \u2014 the fun stuff (applications) is below). We\u2019ll use A[1,1] notation to refer to row = 1, column= 1 in matrix A.", "Cholesky decomposition is an iterative process. I\u2019ll stick to systems of equations notation below, but you\u2019ll see when we get to the third row that notating this using linear algebra would make a lot of sense. This write-up does a good job of explaining the matrix-algebra notation. Note that there are other methods for finding the Cholesky decomposition \u2014 Wikipedia explains several. All follow a similar type of flow.", "Okay, so what? Now the cool part: using Cholesky decomposition we can solve systems of equations of any size in 2 steps. Suppose we want to solve for a, b, and c: remember that this could also be written as a system of 3 equations.", "Ordinarily we\u2019d stack the 3 equations on top of each other, solve for one variable dependent on the other two, plug it in, etc. Using Cholesky decomposition, we have a much more efficient method available.", "A 3x3 matrix is a little underwhelming, but we can already begin to appreciate the efficiency of this method on a very large matrix.", "A linear regression takes the form Y = X * \u03b2, where Y is a vector of dependent variables, and X is a vector of independent variables. Least-squares regression refers to finding the vector \u03b2 where the squared differences between the predicted and actual Y values (i.e. RSS = \u201cResidual Sum of Squares\u201d or \u201cSum of Squared Errors\u201d) are minimized.", "If that doesn\u2019t make sense, focus on this one take-away: the Cholesky decomposition is roughly twice as efficient as other methods for solving systems of linear equations.", "I saved the coolest application for last. Imagine that you want to generate many correlated normal random variables, but don\u2019t want to deal with a massive multi-variate normal. Cholesky decomposition allows you to simulate uncorrelated normal variables and transform them into correlated noraml variables \u2014 cool!", "Assume 3 Normal(0,1) random variables we want to follow the covariance matrix below, representing the underlying correlation and standard deviation matrices:", "We find the Cholesky decomposition of the covariance matrix, and multiply that by the matrix of uncorrelated random variables to create correlated variables.", "Consistent with the correlation and standard deviation matrices presented above, columns 0 and 2 have a strongly positive correlation, 0 and 1 slightly negative, 1 and 2 slightly positive. The standard deviation of variable 2 is contained, while 0 and 1 are much wider.", "Note that this does not work in the same way for non-normal random variables. In the above example, our correlated variables maintained a normal distribution. If we apply this method to gamma-generated random variables we see that the process does not hold.", "Uncorrelated Gamma(1, 5) \u2014 everything looks good.", "Here we see that the variables are no longer gamma distributed \u2014 this is most obviously clue is that variable 1 takes on negative values while the gamma distribution is strictly positive. There is an easy back-door approximation that involves simulating correlated random variables, finding their inverse, and then drawing from the desired distribution using the inverse-correlated-normal values. This is not exact, but can get the job done. Exact methods tend to be fairly exotic.", "Cholesky decomposition is a neat trick that underlies many machine learning applications, two of which were featured here: least-squares regression and Monte-Carlo simulation using correlated normal variables. While linear algebra can be a little scary, it\u2019s important to remember that it is just an efficient method for notating systems of linear equations, and that a high-level understanding of linear algebraic methods is crucial to understanding current machine learning algorithms.", "Your home for data science.
