Since the world of fashion evolves with time, recommenders we design must adjust to the changing tides as well.", "In this article, we will consider how we can factor in the seasonal outfit subtleties into our Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using temporal weights.", "Our imaginary eCommerce company, HappyPanda Co., is expanding globally and will like to launch Seasonal Collections. The product requirements are:", "From the deep fashion data, I select outfits suitable for each of the four seasons. For example, in winter, most people will don on a heavier jacket for warmth. On the other hand, spring and summer is the time to enjoy some time under the sun with lighter clothes. Temperature thus plays a significant role in influencing what people wear. For instance, if we consider the average temperature across the year in a particular city, Madrid (Spain), we can place our selected outfits across time to observe the relationship between outfits and temperature.", "More importantly, the transition between the seasons takes place over weeks, and our model should be able to adjust the recommendations over time, helping our users transit into the next season gradually.", "Of course, in the real world, we will have access to a richer set of time series data. For example, customers\u2019 view/purchase trends over time, hot sellers, or fads like Korean Kpop Fashion. Weather data here is an illustration of the potential of incorporating time series data and not the definitive nor sole data solution for the problem.", "Before we dive into the code, let us take a look at the input/output of the model to gain intuition on the problem and proposed solution.", "Madrid\u2019s weather transits in a gradual manner from Winter to Spring from January to May. Seasonal Collections can generate a new collection for the transition period by blending the features of winter (coat, long sleeves, full-length wear) with features from Spring (lighter materials, colorful wear, less layering) into a new \u201cSpring is coming collection\u201d. The ratio we use here is 50\u201350, so both Winter and Spring have equal weight in the final blend (we will explore this concept in the code section).", "In contrast to Madrid, Melbourne\u2019s Summer transits to Autumn rapidly, with temperatures falling several \u00b0C every week. Thus, we need to aggressively introduce elements from the Autumn collection to match our customers\u2019 requirements for warmth. Using a blending ratio of 25\u201375, we assign a higher weight to the Autumn collection, allowing our model to pull out essential attributes such as layering, long sleeves, and thicker materials to keep our customers warm.", "We can see the importance of localization; to tune the model for different cities across different periods. There is no one size fits all solution for RecSys, especially when we want to recommend across temporal data.", "Link to code on Colab (you just need a free Google Account to run the code on GPU in the cloud).", "Seasonal Collections is built on Convolutional Neural Networks, with transfer learning from ResNet and approximate nearest neighbors. I will not dive into the individual theories as they have been well covered in many articles:", "Instead, I will focus on the core logic of Seasonal Collections:", "The command to get the list of outfits for the Melbourne example above is this line of code:", "We can intuitively incorporate seasonality and time-series data into RecSys by tweaking the ratio to blend the different collections. However, it is not easy to determine this ratio in the real world. We will need to conduct a lot of AB testing, and gather feedback from users, domain experts, product teams. Furthermore, we will have to localize the solution across different geographies and markets to cater for the difference in fashion trends and even the weather.", "Your home for data science.
