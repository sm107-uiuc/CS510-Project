These days there are many excellent text books on the market, including Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, the Elements of Statistical Learning, Deep Learning and etc. However, it seems that those authors like to jump directly to the conclusion for an algorithm and skip step by step explanation and illustration. Therefore, those book are not easy to digest for freshman. Also, those books do not cover how to realize algorithms in statistical software such as R or Python. I think that to have a good command of statistical models and algorithms, theory and mathematics are important, so is implementation. Thus I want to build up a bridge between theory and practice.", "After years of learning, I think that all those methods are connected, not isolated. When a traditional method shows some limitations, then a new methodology is introduced to cover that limitation, therefore making an improvement. For example, traditional linear regression is difficult to handle multicollinearity, so LASSO and Ridge regression were invented to solve this problem. Another example is that Bagging and Boosting were introduced to improve stability and accuracy for single tree model. Nowadays you can also see more and more methodologies involving knowledges from different areas. The idea of moving average in the time series is applied in the gradient descent in deep learning to gain faster convergence and reduce oscillation, which is called gradient descent with momentum. Thus, first I want to show the relations between methodologies in this blog and then I would like to write additional blogs to explain each topic separately. You can click on the link to read topics that you have interest in.", "This blogs will be updated from time to time and more contents will be added in the future.", "Figure above shows the relationships between traditional statistical models and deep learning models. Terminology in green is the algorithm used to generate corresponding model.", "Before deep dive into Neural Network such as ANN, CNN or RNN, let\u2019s start our journey from single layer Neural Network. The idea of single layer neural network is first to have weighted linear combination of input variables and then apply activation function to have a non-linear transformation. Classic single layer Neural Network includes Logistic Regression and Perceptron. The difference between Logistic Regression and Perceptron is that, sigmoid function is applied as activation function for Logistic Regression, meanwhile sign function is applied for Perceptron.", "For Logistic Regression, please read my blog:", "For Perceptron algorithm, please read my blog:", "Both Logistic Regression and Perceptron use gradient descent to get final model. For gradient descent, please read my blog:", "The limitation for Logistic Regression and Perceptron is that the decision boundary for those two models can only be linear. When we have a more complicated classification problem, like figure below, we may expect a more advance method, so neural network is introduced.", "If you want to build up a Neural Network with plain NumPy and get deeper understanding of this fancy algorithm, please read my blog:", "Classic Linear Regression provides another perfect angle to introduce machine learning. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) is used to estimate coefficients for linear model. However, there are several assumptions that linear model need to follow and they are essential to the success of model and accuracy of prediction. The table above shows the assumption, testing method and solution for each assumption.", "Bayes statistics also play important role in machine learning. One paradigm of Bayesian statistics is Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier, which can be trained easily and fast. Bayesian statistics is also used in unsupervised learning, such as Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The formula of Bayes is shown below:", "In the formula, p(y|x) is posterior probability; p(x|y) is likelihood; p(y) is prior probability and p(x) is evidence.", "For Na\u00efve Bayes Classifier, please read my blog:", "In Frequentist Statistics, the parameter of a distribution is a certain number and Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) is used to make an estimation; In Bayestian Statistics, the parameter of a distribution is also a random variable and Maximum A Posterior (MAP) is used instead. The comparison between MLE and MAP is shown in the blog:", "Let\u2019s move from linear model to non-linear model. One paradigm for non-linear model is Decision Tree. Decision tree is a tree based algorithm used to solve regression and classification problems. Regression Trees are used for dependent variable with continuous values and Classification Trees are used for dependent variable with categorical values. Trees have a very different flavor from the more classical approaches such as Linear Regression or Logistic Regression model.", "In particular, Linear Regression assumes a model of the form:", "whereas Regression Trees assumes a model of the form:", "where R1,\u2026,Rm represent a partition of feature space and the expression of Cm:", "Which model is better? According to No Free Lunch Theorem, no model can work best for all possible situation. Therefore, the method we choose depends on the problem at hand. If the true decision boundary is linear, shown in the two figures (below) at top. Linear Model will outperform the Tree Model. Meanwhile, if the true decision boundary is rectangular, shown in the two figures (below) at bottom. Tree Model can fit the data better than Linear Model. Besides the goodness of fit, Tree Model is preferred for the sake of interpretability and visualization.", "The details for Decision Tree can be seen in the blog:", "[2] Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, (2017) An Introduction to Statistical Learning", "[3] Christopher M.
