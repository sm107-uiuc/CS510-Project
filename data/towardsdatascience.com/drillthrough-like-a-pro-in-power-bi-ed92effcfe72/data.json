Every month (or even less, like in these April and May Power BI Desktop update), they are going above and beyond and introducing fantastic new features.", "In March 2020, Microsoft announced Page Navigation as an action for buttons as generally available and at the same time introduced Drillthrough action for buttons as a preview feature. It sounded really appealing to me since I have a lot of users who are not aware of \u201cright-click\u201d Drillthrough capability, so I had to create different workarounds, such as tooltips, in order to engage users to use Drillthrough in the reports.", "With new Drillthrough action for buttons now generally available, let\u2019s try to make full use and offer our users unforgettable experience\u2026", "As usual, I will use the Contoso sample database for demonstration. Before proceeding further, another very interesting feature related to buttons is that now you can customize button for Disabled state (until now, you were able to customize button for Default, On Hover and On Press states).", "Let\u2019s see how this works in reality:", "I\u2019ve added a blank button and formatted it for Disabled state (grey color).", "Next thing I do, because I have multiple Drillthrough pages within my report, I am giving my users a possibility of what kind of details they would like to see. In my example, they can choose to see \u201cSales Amount per Brand\u201d or \u201cSales Amount per Color\u201d.", "To achieve this, I need to create a new table which will hold data about drillthrough pages. Go to Enter data under Data ribbon and simply enter names of your drillthrough pages (it is of key importance that values in the table exactly match your drillthrough pages\u2019 names). I\u2019ve also added a column for ranking, just in case I want to sort pages in a different order than alphabetically.", "Now, just drag slicer on the canvas and put Page name column in the Field value. One more little trick to improve user\u2019s experience: depending on the user\u2019s selection, we want to dynamically adjust the text on the button which will be used for Drillthrough action.", "Therefore, I\u2019ve created a simple DAX measure, which captures the user\u2019s selection:", "This will dynamically change the text on the button:", "To achieve that, under formatting options of the button, choose Button Text and select option on the right:", "Choose to format by Field Value and select our newly created measure, Selected Page.", "The next step is to instruct our button on what to do, depending on the user\u2019s selection. Go to Action property of the button, again choose the option on the right and select Page under the \u201cBased on field\u201d dropdown menu and leave default First as Summarization type. Since we defined user selection to one value exclusively within a slicer (by turning Single Select ON), we don\u2019t need to worry \u2014 whatever user selects, this will be first (and only) selection\u2026", "One last thing to do is to format button Fill property, so the user can recognize when it is ready for drilling down. As I mentioned previously, the button is greyed out in the Disabled state. But, as soon as I choose a single data point from my table, look at what will happen!", "Our button becomes blue and now the user can interact with it and click on it in order to be navigated to a drillthrough page, which contains details about the Sales Amount for June 2009. How cool is that!", "Once we go back to the main page and select Sales Amt Color under Drillthrough Page slicer, the button goes back to Disabled state and we will be informed that we need to select one single brand if we want to drill through to a page which contains data per brand color.", "So, let\u2019s check how it works:", "I\u2019ve chosen the Adventure Works brand within Sales Amt by Brand Name visual and my button is ready for action again! Once I click on it, I will be navigated to a page which displays data per product color for Adventure Works brand:", "Same as in the previous example, as soon as I\u2019m back on the main page, the button again becomes greyed out.", "To summarize, here is the complete behavior of our button:", "With dynamic formatting of the buttons and tweaking actions to enable usage of different drillthrough pages, you can really create an awesome user experience for your Power BI reports, avoiding the complexity of working with multiple bookmarks.", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Subscribe here to get more insightful data articles!", "Your home for data science.
