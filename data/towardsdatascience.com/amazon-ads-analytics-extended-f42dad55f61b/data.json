In 2020, Amazon\u2019s ad revenues in the United States are projected to amount to 12.75 billion U.S. dollars (compare to 10.32 billion U.S. dollars in 2019).", "With this increase in activity, one could expect certain improvements in seller\u2019s tools, such as ads analytics, so I decided to use this topic for my data science capstone project at Galvanize bootcamp.", "I got access to data from several advertising campaigns of big consumer brands on amazon.com, with a goal to look for potential ways to improve ads ROIs and predict future sales.", "The data was stored in 13 tables, which mirror Amazon statistics. More details about the data, as well as the code I wrote you can find at my GitHub page.", "My goal was to analyze each keyword performance dynamically, and forecast the future demand.", "First, I used Plotly library to show the performance for each search term across all campaigns. Below is a \u2018hand sanitizer\u2019 example.", "To extrapolate future sales, I used Prophet time series. This graph predicts sales coming from the keyword \u2018hand soap\u2019.", "Each black scatter plot point represents actual daily sales in US dollars, and the model prediction is showed as a blue line, with two months forecast.", "We can see overall trend for sales from this keyword, as well as weekly fluctuation component. The overall trend predicts growing demand for hand soaps. Weekly fluctuation component shows that the day of a week plays a big role in hand soap demand \u2014 most sales happen on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday.", "I grouped data by ASIN and looked into each product performance.", "For this example, I chose hand sanitizer because it was such a hot product this year due to COVID. A company that sells hand sanitizer could benefit from ad analytics that provides some insight into a volatile future.", "This chart shows a funnel for hand sanitizer:", "I also created some high-level analytics of data for each product, grouped by campaigns (chart below) \u2014 to see which campaigns are performing well, and which need improvement.", "Similar to keywords, I did time series analysis to look at product performance in dynamic and forecast future sales.", "Using Prophet time series, I build sales forecast for each product. The graph below shows the two-week hand sanitizer sales forecast, overall trend, and weekly fluctuation component.", "Finally, I wanted to look into factors affecting product sales. To do that, I built a ML model (Random Forest Regressor from Sklearn), and used SHAP values to visualize features importance.", "I used the following features to predict sales:", "Each feature has different affect on the outcome (sales). A high-level view can be drawn from the model itself, by plotting these feature importance parameters.", "This graph shows \u2018number of clicks\u2019 and \u2018money spent\u2019 are the most important features (which makes sense), but how exactly do they affect sales? To understand the model behavior better, I looked into SHAP values.", "SHAP summary plot shows the positive and negative relationships of the predictors with the target variable (sales) for each factor. Each dot represents one observation of training data.", "If you are not familiar with SHAP values, this awesome medium post will help you better understand what the SHAP values are, and this one explains each graph\u2019s meaning.", "With SHAP, we can look in depth into each feature\u2019s behavior. For example, we can see how \u2018cost per click\u2019 affects our sales.", "For each observation (each day, in our case), we can look into all features force plot. This image shows our 12th observation. On that day, total sales were $70.99. The model\u2019s base value (average) is $54.44, and the major factor that pushed the sales up were clicks \u2014 we had 7 of those.", "The plot below shows simple interpretation of all feature importances and effects for the sales of one product (hand sanitizer).", "The red color means a feature is positively correlated with the target variable. In this model, high clicks, CTR, CpC and daily budget will increase sales.", "High impressions and certain portfolio types lower the sales down; this discovery led me to look into campaigns targeting settings.", "It turns out Sponsored Product ad type generates high impressions, but low sales for hand sanitizer, while Sponsored Brand does the opposite. Adjusting the ad settings should improve ads ROIs.", "The original code and other details of my projects are here: GitHub.", "Feel free to reach out to me at LinkedIn if you have questions or need help with my code implementation on your projects.", "Your home for data science.
