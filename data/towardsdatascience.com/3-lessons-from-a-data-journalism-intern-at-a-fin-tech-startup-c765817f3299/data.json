How did I end up at ZestFinance? I applied online and the recruiter found my experience interesting, went through the interview process, and eventually accepted the offer to come out to their office for the summer as one of 12 interns.", "My goal is to share some of the key lessons that I learned from this memorable experience.", "The company\u2019s mission is to make fair and transparent credit available to everyone. According to the company website:", "\u201cThe multi-trillion-dollar lending industry still relies on aging scoring techniques that oversimplify the view of a borrower\u2019s finances. As a result, millions of deserving borrowers get rejected all the time. Some 46 million Americans are either \u201ccredit invisible,\u201d with no file at one of the three major credit bureaus, or \u201cunscorable,\u201d with insufficient information to generate a credit score. This is a failure of the modern credit system.", "Machine learning-based credit models can generate more profitable underwriting by drawing deeper insights from more data, especially unused data banks already have. ZestFinance was one of the first companies to deploy machine learning models for lending, and we know it works.\u201d", "More specifically, I spent my summer working on ZAML, Zest\u2019s proprietary automated machine learning platform. ZAML enables lenders to analyze non-traditional data, including data they already have in-house, such as customer support data, payment histories, and purchase transactions. The platform can also take into account traditional credit information and nontraditional credit variables, such as how a customer fills out a form, how they navigate a lender\u2019s site, and more. While the black box problem has slowed the adoption of machine learning in consumer finance, ZAML is able to fully explain data modeling results, measure business impact, and comply with regulatory requirements.", "As a data journalist, I was a proud member of the Data Science team. More specifically, my responsibilities entail: (1) Unearthing trends and insights from large and small datasets to tell data stories, (2) Leveraging internal and external data sources for analysis, modeling, and visualizations and translating them to topical narratives, reports, and white papers, and (3) Evangelizing data science research initiatives while working cross-functionally with the Marketing team to quantify their growing impact and relevance.", "Now that you know a little more about the team and my role, let\u2019s dive into a handful of the main insights that I took away from this internship.", "This concept from an excellent article by Conor Dewey is one that I kept coming back to throughout the summer (check out my Datacast interview with him as well!). The post talks about the concept of Minimum Viable Analysis, meaning that data scientists can make incremental progress and don\u2019t assume that stakeholder needs the most complex solution available.", "The process of producing an MVA is quite straightforward: (1) Understand the business problem at hand clearly, (2) Produce fast and superficial insights to address the problem, (3) Communicate the results back to the stakeholders and get their thoughts, and (4) Wrap up the analysis or dig deeper.", "By keeping this framework in mind, I was able to churn out a lot of different iterations for the data stories/technical reports/blog posts that I was working at the time. The stakeholders in my case were other data scientists in the team as well as several executives in different functional departments.", "I was very fortunate to be in a position where I can interface with colleagues from multiple functions, including data science, marketing/design, legal, business analysis, product management, and software engineering. This allows me to tap into what I call cognitive diversity \u2014 differences in perspective or information processing styles. In other words, it\u2019s how individuals think about and engage with new, uncertain, and complex situations.", "Given a hypothetical example of implementing a machine learning model to determine whether a loan/credit applicant gets rejected or approved, here are a couple of mental models to address that:", "If there\u2019s one takeaway I am truly grateful for, it was the sheer amount of mental models that I was able to develop. By learning to listen to different opinions and speak/write in the language of my colleagues in a manner they understand, I honed my muscle to think multi-laterally \u2014 the ability to solve problems using indirect and creative approaches via reasoning that is not immediately obvious.", "I have pretty much no knowledge about credit underwriting before doing this internship with ZestFinance. But after the summer, I know plenty about this age-old industry:", "Over the course of the internship, I gain substantial domain knowledge on how banks and financial institutions make decisions on credit applicants, how machine learning is being adopted by them, how to build explainability and fairness into model design, and how to ensure a correlation between a model\u2019s predictive performance and its ROI value for the business clients.", "Most importantly, I truly enjoyed ZestFinance\u2019s mission-driven culture to build a world that gives more people the opportunity that comes with credit. I have nothing but warm feelings toward the company and highly recommend you check out their blog and openings for new content and job opportunities.", "The internship has definitely reaffirmed my passion for Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning and I am grateful that my works did leave some traction for future works. The rapid analysis and iterative experimentation phase, the communication skills required to talk to different stakeholders, the massive potential application to solve problems in a wide variety of business domains have all contributed to my interest in this field.", "I couldn\u2019t be more grateful for the opportunity to spend the summer using data journalism to create value for an incredible product in an emerging industry. I accomplished a lot, made plenty of mistakes, and most importantly, learned more than I could\u2019ve ever anticipated thanks to an awesome team and a diverse group of mentors. I hope that I was successful in communicating at least a few of those lessons to you. Thank you for reading.", "If you enjoyed this piece, you can find more of my writing and projects at https://jameskle.com/.
