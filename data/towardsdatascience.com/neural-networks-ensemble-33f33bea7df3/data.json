Different algorithms are built on this mechanism. Only to cite the most famous, random forests used to combine a variable number of decision trees. In general terms, an ensemble can be considered a learning technique where many models are joined to solve a problem. This is done because an ensemble tends to perform better than singles improving the generalization ability.", "The way an ensemble can be carried out doesn\u2019t know any limit. The same is true for the number and the types of models considered. The habit to keep in mind is to choose components with low bias and high variance. This is possible simply choosing models with variegated structure and format.", "In this post, we apply the ensemble mechanism in the neural network domain. More precisely we present various ways to combine deep learning structures efficiently. We make an example in the image classification domain where it is common to meet very deep models. The same reasoning and procedure can be also translated easily in other applications.", "We collect our data from Kaggle. The Garbage Classification Dataset contains 6 classifications: cardboard, glass, metal, paper, plastic, and trash. The split into train, validation, and test is also provided.", "We aim to try to classify our images correctly following a neural network ensembling approach. More in detail we present 3 different approaches. All our methods follow the same structure as depicted in the image below.", "There are N network classifiers which are combined at the top in different ways. In this example, we select 3 different classifiers to operate ensemble. They are pre-trained models on a different dataset but that we reuse in our task. As we well know, this is a common approach in the image classification domain, where large models are fitted on very huge datasets in order to freeze their knowledge and reimport it in other scenarios. The advantage of transfer learning is exactly to initialize our new train in the correct direction adapting the previously learned information to obtain better results. This is possible operating fine-tuning on our specific data. In our context, we operate ensembling applying the fine-tuning on our N ensemble components while we are merging them.", "In all the approaches presented, we operate the ensemble using VGG16, VGG19, and RESNET50 as base models. We operate fine-tuning on them allowing the retrain on their respectively last convolutional blocks. The ensemble is operated on 2D dimensionality. We pass from 3D to 2D operating global pooling. The dimensionalities are equalized for all the networks passing the pooling outputs in dense layers with a fixed dimensionality.", "The concatenation is the most common technique to merge different data sources. A concatenation ensemble receives different inputs, whatever their dimensions are, and concatenates them on a given axis. A drawback, of attaching information side by side, can be the dimensionality explosion. More the networks in the ensemble or greatest are the dense dimensionalities and bigger is the output of the concatenation. This operation can be dispersive, not allowing the final part of the network to learn important information or resulting in overfitting.", "Our concatenation ensemble achieves 89% accuracy on our test data.", "The averaging ensemble can be seen as the opposite of concatenation operation. The pooled outputs of our networks are passed through dense layers with a fixed number of neurons in order to equalize them. In this way, we can compute the average. The result is an output that shares the same dimensionality of each input but that is the average of them. As intuitively understandable, the drawback of this approach can be the loss of information caused by the nature of the average operation.", "Our average ensemble achieves 89% accuracy on our test data.", "A weighted ensemble is a special form of average operation, where the tensor outputs are multiplied by a weight and then linearly combined. To each input, coming from our models is assigned a weight. These weights determine the contribution of every single model in the final result. The particularity is that these weights are not fixed and previously imposed but their values can be optimized during the training process. The only constraint is that the weights must sum up to 1, but this is easy to achieve applying a softmax on them. With this type of ensemble, we can also retrieve the contribution of each model simply extracting the ensemble weights.", "Our weighted ensemble achieves 89% accuracy on our test data.", "In this post, we introduced some types of ensemble techniques for neural networks ensemble. The greatest potentiality is the possibility to easily extend them with other operations. We also apply them with very huge models on a classification problem, but nothing prevents us to apply them in our scenario with our custom models. We also develop ensembles during fine-tuning operations but also here the procedure can be divided into sub-tasks. The greatest benefit of all these methodologies is to add diversification in order to build models that can generalize better.", "Your home for data science.
