It is voted on by media members based on a relatively open-ended definition of value. It\u2019s purposely subjective to incite conversations (and heated arguments) between fans and media members about what value truly means in the game of basketball.", "Through the years though, the two dominating narratives have been \u201cbest player on the best team\u201d (i.e. 2018: James Harden, 2016: Steph Curry) or having \u201chistorical numbers\u201d (i.e. 2017: Russell Westbrook, 2014: Kevin Durant). Using these two narratives as the criteria, I set out to create a statistical model to evaluate a player\u2019s value based on their contribution to team wins and overall individual output.", "My goal was to build a model that could accurately award the MVP from the past 10 seasons (my training data) in order to make a reliable prediction for 2019. The ultimate purpose isn\u2019t to create an objective truth on value, but rather look at the MVP race through a consistent statistical lens that reflects the same criteria year-over-year.", "As mentioned above a player\u2019s overall value is based on an even average of their win contribution and total stats.", "Note: This not a statistically-tested model. 50/50 weights were a theoretical starting point. As I loaded and tested the model on more MVP races, I tweaked the weights to see how it would affect results. Ultimately, I ended with 50/50 weight in order to maximize model accuracy across the decade.", "Win Contribution = Level of Impact * Quality of Impact", "First, I wanted to gauge a player\u2019s level of impact (high or low) on his team\u2019s wins through games and minutes played, and usage rate. Mathematically, the most important number here is team wins. All other variables serve as rates to assess a player\u2019s impact to those wins.", "Usage may seem controversial here, but I wanted to measure how much a team relies on a player in possession in comparison with his teammates. For example in 2016, the Golden State Warriors won a record of 73 regular season games. Their 3 best players were Steph Curry, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, each of whom played approximately 80 games and averaged 34 minutes a game. Usage rate serves as the key differentiator of impact between teammates in this situation.", "While the stat is generally skewed towards guards and ball-handlers \u2014 90% of the top 20 usage rate this season were non-centers, elite big men like Joel Embiid, Anthony Davis and DeMarcus Cousins (pre-achilles injury) consistently rank in the top 10 of usage rate due to their tremendous skill. More on this issue later.", "Next, I wanted to measures a player\u2019s quality of impact (good or bad) when on the floor. This was by far the most difficult aspect of building the model. Unlike baseball, there is not one comprehensive statistic that\u2019s widely accepted by the basketball community to measure a player\u2019s quality of impact. As a result, I used weighted values of multiple advanced statistics that are accessible to the public. Below is a quick summary of what they mean.", "Win Share and VORP were used because to distinguish between a player\u2019s contribution relative to that of his teammates (Win Share) and to the rest of the league (VORP). Net Rating was included to distinguish players\u2019 overall output when on the floor, and help adjust the equation in favor of players with lower minutes, which VORP and Win Share penalize against.", "The value of the weights are somewhat arbitrary and were determined after a series of trial-and-error to maximize the model\u2019s accuracy. Although, the reason Net Rating has a lower weight because it\u2019s heavily biased towards big-men and part of its calculation (defensive rating) is also used to calculate Defensive Win Shares, which is a part of Win Share.", "I wanted to keep this output as simple as possible, and borrowed the weights from fantasy basketball. Couple of tweaks I added are multiplying true shooting % (TS%) against points scored. This allowed me to exclude stats like field goal, free throws, 3-Point attempts and makes. While these stats are considered by people when evaluating MVP, I felt that (Points * TS%) was a compact way to measure scoring output against efficiency. The last unit of 25 was a scalar I used to make the final value be close to the win contribution value (also chosen in order to maximize overall model accuracy).", "I want to come back to usage rate here because when evaluating total stats, it\u2019s heavily skewed towards bigs (same for net rating but that\u2019s more attributed to a center\u2019s role in anchoring a defense). In 2019, Rudy Gobert and Andre Drummond finished 5th and 6th, respectively, in individual output over players like Paul George (9th) and Damian Lillard (14th). This is another reason why I kept usage in the win contribution formula to balance out the big-men bias in total stats.", "Before predicting the 2019 MVP, I wanted to assess the model\u2019s results and inherent biases based on the past 10 seasons. It\u2019s a fun trip down memory lane and shows a general change in league-wide perception and acceptance of analytics with time.", "(Note: all data is sourced from Basketball-Reference)", "\u2026and finally for the prediction of this year\u2019s race (and likely what most readers were looking for)", "The model shows James Harden as the predicted winner based on higher level of impact (more games played, more minutes played, higher usage rate) and higher total stats (36 points/game, 8th highest scoring season in league history behind only Wilt Chamberlain, Elgin Baylor and MJ, 5th highest Total Stats in the decade). The results are similar to Russell Westbrook\u2019s 2017 win where he beat James Harden despite having less wins, but better total stats", "However, I think Giannis is likely still the favorite to win the MVP due to 2 factors, narrative and defense. In terms of narrative, Giannis is the proverbial \u201cnew kid on the block\u201d beloved by the media and fans (similar to Derrick Rose in 2011), while Harden, the incumbent winner, can suffer from voter fatigue and overall negative sentiment towards his playing style.", "In terms of defense, there are examples of Kawhi Leonard in 2016 and Joakim Noah in 2014 (both winners of Defensive Player of the Year) being undervalued. This year, Giannis is also in contention of the award (2nd in the league in Defensive Box Plus/Minus and 3rd in Defensive Win Shares). While both of these statistics are incorporated in the model\u2019s calculation, it\u2019s not hard to imagine the public perception of Giannis\u2019s defensive impact and overall narrative pushing him over Harden.", "The creation and testing of this model was an interesting thought-exercise that tested both my statistical and basketball views. It was fascinating juggling between my preconceived notions of value in basketball, what the model was telling me, and retrofitting that against a decade of results. Below are a few of my closing thoughts:", "Full dataset including player stats from 2019 to 2009 if you\u2019re interested in digging a little deeper", "Your home for data science.
