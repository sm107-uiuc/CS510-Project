There\u2019s a common understanding that AI is a neutral entity, an objective beacon, an unbiased saint.", "Amazon is well-versed in artificial intelligence. They use AI to power many parts of their business, and they even sell AI solutions to clients through their Amazon Web Services. A tech company in nature, Amazon exists in an industry dominated by men. Like many of their peers, Amazon is trying to become more diverse. A big issue in the mission of diversity is that human recruiters and managers are biased. Studies show that humans discriminate against others in the recruitment process. What more, for companies with thousands of applicants, it can be very challenging to determine which applicant is the better choice for any given position.", "For an AI-infused company, a natural step towards gaining a more diverse workforce would be to employ an AI for the recruitment process. After all, human recruiters are biased, whereas machines are known not to be.", "Amazon did just that. They employed an AI to help review resumes of applicants. The dream was to have a robot that could be fed a hundred resumes, analyze them, and recommend the best five \u2014 regardless of their gender or race. Unfortunately, the AI turned out to prefer men over women. The machine learning model had studied a decade worth of resumes. Due to the male dominance of the tech industry, that data predominantly consisted of male resumes. Because AI learns from the data that it is fed, the AI learned to prefer the characteristics of men. For instance, the machine learning algorithm applied great significance to the vocabularies used in the resumes, which turned out to differ significantly between genders. Amazon discovered that men and women use different vocabularies on their resumes. Indeed, men are more likely than women to use verbs such as executed and captured, for example. Since the AI learned from male resumes, it learned to prefer applicants who applied those terms.", "For someone who is not in the field of machine learning, it might sound like a no-brainer to simply tell the AI to ignore gender in the process of selecting applicants. But, as you can tell, it\u2019s not quite that easy.", "This is just one of many correlations. Men and women have studied different subjects, due to years of political agendas steering people into stereotypes. The different sexes have different past-time interests, too. Discovering these correlations is difficult. Very difficult. Correcting them is even harder. For every rule you give the AI and for every attempt at steering it a particular direction, you apply your own bias onto the AI. No matter what you do, the AI will have some level of bias.", "How do you combat this? Do you try to find more diverse data? Well, where do you get it from? Do you buy resumes from your competitors? They don\u2019t have them either. And you can\u2019t fake the resumes; it won\u2019t work. You need real data.", "And for this entire segment, I have only just discussed discrimination between genders. What of discrimination between different races? What if your company is founded in a predominately white country and happens to have a workforce that\u2019s 99.8% white? And even if you do have a solid mixture of data from people of all continents on earth, what if you have an applicant from a country that you have no data of, and the applicant has prio experiences in their CV that your AI has never seen before? Designing fair algorithms for such scenarios that doesn\u2019t take factors such as gender or race into account is not just challenging, it could even be impossible. Balancing constraints to favor diversity is one way, however for every restriction added, some bias is also added to the mix.", "No matter what you end up doing, the AI will be biased.", "In a previous article of mine, I discussed how police forces around the world are using discriminatory AI systems. Indeed, police authorities around the world are now using AI to track and identify citizens. One of the biggest concerns for police usage of AI is discrimination, where AI is amplifying existing prejudice.", "For many decades, police officers have systematically and disproportionately been targeting minorities. There are accounts of police officers planting illegal drugs on innocent minorities in order to reach arrestment quotas, as well as records of police downright falsifying reports. This scary data is now being fed to machine learning algorithms that are in use at police departments around the world. The systems use this data to learn to discriminate in their crime forecasts. In the UK, police officers often found themselves disagreeing with the predictions made by machine learning AI, expressing that the AI in and of itself creates a self-fulfilling prophecy.", "Yet police forces nonetheless welcome AI systems, as they make their lives easier. The AI provides both faster decision-making and a lighter conscience, making it a cherished addition as another tool in the arsenal for fighting crime.", "In many scenarios, it is just not possible to be unbiased. Even if you have the most extensive data pool and the most sophisticated algorithm in the world, an AI that must determine which applicant to pick in a recruitment process is always going to have to make a subjective choice.", "The misconception that AI is impartial probably stems from the fact that traditionally programmed machines indeed are unbiased. Your e-mail client will deliver you e-mails the same way it does to anyone else, regardless of who you are. Your Microsoft Word-document doesn\u2019t care about who you are; it will give you the same features to edit with as it does to anyone else.", "What makes machine learning different, however, is that it learns from data. Since some data is a direct product of human effort, and since humans cannot be unbiased, AI taught on such data also cannot be unbiased.", "Yet despite all this, AI is nonetheless the future for combating bias. My point with this article is to highlight that AI is biased \u2014 not that it is more biased than humans. An AI that is fed a diverse set of data, is given fair constraints, and provided with appropriate weight on variables can nonetheless be much less partial than any human being. Humans will always be biased. Re-programming our brains to be unbiased is impossible (unless we get into some very advanced genetical engineering, mind). The brains of computers are more straightforward to program.", "An adequately taught AI is sure to be less partial than humans. For this to happen, AI implementations cannot be rushed. They need to be trained on diverse data, and they need to be carefully managed and tested.", "Additionally, I want to highlight three rules that one should follow in the implementation of a machine learning AI.", "One. AI must have an explainable log. There must be some mechanism that tells you why the AI made the decision that it did. All too often, an AI makes a decision, and no one has the ability to explain why it made the decision that it did.", "Two. Bias must be mitigated. The AI must be trained on diverse data. If diverse data cannot be found, constraints and proper weights must be applied. I keep stressing constraints and weights \u2014 while they do add some level of human bias, they are necessary to mitigate weak data sets.", "And three. Humans cannot be allowed to over-rely on AI. While AI may often be less biased than humans, it is not flawless. It will make mistakes. Question it.", "While it may be tempting to automate a process altogether using AI, it is sometimes best to start one\u2019s AI journey by using AI as an assistant for guiding decisions. The future no doubt lies in human-AI-collaboration, with machines acting as equals to humans, but we are simply not there yet. In the present day, a recruiter cannot be replaced by an AI, for instance. However, a recruiter\u2019s job can be made a whole lot easier with an AI as a companion. While reading through resumes, an AI can provide summaries and insights, while also clearly showcasing its certainty next to its beliefs. While performing an interview with a candidate, an AI can recommend follow-up questions in real-time, and provide behavioral analysis to the recruiter.", "Take a peek at this article for more details on these rules, along with some terrifying stories of what might happen if you choose to ignore them.", "AI that deals with humans will always be biased.", "It is up to us to make it less so."],
