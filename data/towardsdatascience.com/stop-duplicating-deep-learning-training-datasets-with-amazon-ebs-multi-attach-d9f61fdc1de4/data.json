One of the nice benefits of EFS is that it\u2019s multi-availability zone (AZ), and you can mount the file systems to EC2 instances in multiple subnets in the same region. For higher performance you could consider Amazon FSx for Lustre file system. The nice benefit of FSx for Lustre is that it can be linked to an existing Amazon S3 bucket. If your data lives in S3 to start with you don\u2019t have to move your datasets from S3 to FSx for Lustre and worry about syncing changes, it\u2019s done automatically for you!", "If you\u2019re interested in any of the above approaches, you could try them yourselves following instructions here: distributed-training-workshop.go-aws.com/", "Before you go another small piece of recommendation: always scale-up before you scale-out", "Scaling up is the process of packing more compute on to a single machine. In other words, start with a single EC2 instance with a smaller GPU like a G4. If your experiments are going well, replace it with a more powerful GPU like the V100 on p3.2xlarge . If you want more horsepower, then get additional GPUs on a single instance, and you can get up to 8 with a p3.16xlarge and p3dn.24xlarge. The advantage of scaling-up is that you\u2019re not crossing network barriers to communicate with other CPUs and GPUs which could add to communication latency. Once you\u2019ve reached the limit of scaling-up (8 GPUs per EC2 instance), you can start to scale-out, i.e. add additional instances. As an example, if you need 8 GPUs always prefer a single EC2 instance with 8 GPUs such as p3.16xlarge vs. 2 EC2 instances with 4 GPUs each such as p3.8xlarge.", "Thanks for reading, all the code and examples are available on GitHub here:", "If you have questions, please reach out to me on twitter (@shshnkp), LinkedIn or leave a comment below.
