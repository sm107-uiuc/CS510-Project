It\u2019s simple, free, available to everyone, and completely effortless. Check it out!", "Jupyter Notebooks are one of the best (free!) tools available to help you gain the skills you need to be effective in a ton of data-related fields. They\u2019re the ideal tool for data science, machine learning, deep learning, artificial intelligence, and more. They can hold not just code, but rich text elements like images, figures, links, and way more. This makes them a perfect place to bring together an analysis, your results, and a description of what\u2019s going on.", "As easy as they are to work with, they\u2019re often difficult to get up and running with a cloud-hosted service. There are a ton of people out there who have gotten completely stuck just trying to get their notebooks running with a cloud provider.", "That\u2019s where Saturn Cloud comes in!", "With Saturn Cloud, it\u2019s unbelievably easy to run cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebooks. You click a few buttons and you\u2019re set up. You\u2019re ready to create, run, publish, and even share Jupyter Notebooks. You can even collaborate with other people! It might be the easiest way out there for data scientists to use cloud-based computing for their Jupyter Notebooks. It\u2019s the only way I\u2019ve found that allows you to immediately (and painlessly!) publish and share your notebooks with the world.", "Version control is basically revision control. It lets you manage changes to your code. Each revision is associated with a timestamp and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.", "Did you just completely mess up your model?", "Version control lets you rewind history. You can go back to the place before your Jupyter Notebook became a complete horror show. Version control allows you to revert a document to a previous version. That\u2019s critical for allowing editors to track each other\u2019s edits and correct mistakes!", "For example, when multiple individuals or teams are designing and developing software, it\u2019s pretty normal for multiple versions of the same software to be running in different sites. Different developers might be working simultaneously on updates. Some of these versions might have bugs. Some versions have updates that have introduced new problems. In order to find and fix these problems, you have to be able to grab and run different versions to determine where the problems are happening.", "But, while version control is a vital part of the workflow, Jupyter Notebooks don\u2019t offer a simple way to do this. There are workarounds, but they aren\u2019t easy. That\u2019s where Saturn Cloud comes in.", "Saturn images come with git command line tools and a number of text editors, so you can always use git the way you would with any other UNIX installation. Saturn Cloud also automatically snapshots your project so that users can easily roll back to previous work.", "Saturn Cloud will notify you if you have code to push or pull. You can push from your user branch into the master branch or pull from master into your branch. Saturn provides a Git diff and merge tool that combines viewing and merging Code and Notebooks. Users work in separate branches that are synchronized in the server. Every Saturn project is allocated a Git repository.", "If there are no conflicts between branches, you can click the \u201cFinish\u201d button and complete your push or pull. (If there are conflicts, you can resolve those and then click \u201cResolve.\u201d) Just make sure you click \u201cSave\u201d when you\u2019re done. Of course, you can also resolve conflicts right in the command line. If you want to read all about it, check out the official documentation.", "You just go to your dashboard, click on \u201cCollaborators\u201d and add someone\u2019s username. If you already have a team in place, you can just select the name of the team member you want to collaborate with!", "The billing page has been upgraded! Instead of just seeing an overview of your costs, you can now see each individual machine at a glance. Normally, if your bill is high, it\u2019s easy to assume that your new machine learning model is at fault. Now you can tell at a glance that it\u2019s actually a totally different machine that\u2019s been running for the last three days!", "All you need to do is head over to your dashboard, click on billing, and scroll down. All your information is right there.", "Saturn Cloud just keeps getting cooler. Now that they\u2019re bringing simple version control to Jupyter Notebooks and making collaboration even easier, they\u2019re pretty tough to beat. Add in the easy-to-understand billing, upgraded control of images, and the improvements they\u2019ve made to everyone\u2019s galleries, it\u2019s hard to imagine a better provider of cloud-hosted Jupyter Notebooks!", "I also absolutely have to mention that Saturn Cloud has plans to make their automated version control functionality open source. If opening up this functionality to the Git-verse isn\u2019t the coolest thing, I don\u2019t know what is.", "I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m dying to take a look under the hood!", "Thanks for reading! As always, if you do anything cool with this information, let everyone know about it in the comments below, or reach out on LinkedIn @annebonnerdata", "Your home for data science.
