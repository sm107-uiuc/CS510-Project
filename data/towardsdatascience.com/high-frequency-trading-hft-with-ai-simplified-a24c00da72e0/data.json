It adds liquidity to the markets and allows unbelievable amount of money flowing through it every fraction of a second.", "High Frequency Trading, since it\u2019s inception a few decades ago, has been a source of attraction for stupendous amounts of profits to individuals and corporations alike. It\u2019s like a cake cutting and while the big corporations do get the bigger piece, rest be assured everybody who comes will get cake.", "HFTs is based on something called an order book. This order book contains, at any given moment, the top few bid and ask prices for the product/stock/commodity.", "Let me break it down for you. You interact with the market by placing orders. Every order that you send in has to be either a bid or an ask. A bid is the amount of money you are willing to pay to buy the stocks while ask is the amount of money you want to sell your stocks. If someone is willing to pay more (higher bid) or wants less (lower ask) than you, they are placed above you in the order book.", "But wait, the transaction isn\u2019t over yet!! All you have done is place an order. Someone needs to come and match your price for the transaction to go through. Or you can go and match someone else\u2019s price. Buying and selling at the right times to maximize your profit is basically the name of the game in High Frequency Trading.", "On paper, yes it is. So let\u2019s start trading!! Ohh, but before you do that let me tell you, it won\u2019t work. As I mentioned earlier, it is an algorithmic trading venture, and that\u2019s for a reason.", "Transaction in High Frequency Trading happens in fractions of a second. High Frequency Trading by humans alone is not possible. By the time you read the market trend and enter your bids, the market has already changed its trend!! That\u2019s why we need algorithms that the computers can execute for us and place bids.", "Obviously when it comes to automated tasks, AI is the go to choice. There have been a number of Machine Learning Algorithms and feature creation techniques applied in this field. The most common out of them are SVMs.", "SVM is, crudely speaking, creating a line of separation in the data. Models are trained to recognize features that indicate an upcoming increase or decrease in the market pricing and bid accordingly. They have been so successful that most of the High Frequency Trading companies have integrated such models in their trading modules.", "HFT is a blink of an eye affair. Not only do the models need to be accurate, they also need to extremely fast or their accuracy won\u2019t matter!! Deep Learning methods, while known in general to be extremely successful in terms of accuracy, also carry a curse of heavy computations with them. Because of this, HFT has not seen the gigantic infusion of Deep Learning yet, like other domains.", "However, with the increasing complexity of hardware implementations and processing power provided by GPUs, one can start thinking about trying to incorporate Deep Learning into HFTs. While there have been a few recent papers trying out Neural Networks for price predictions, its still a long way to a successful running model that can actually generate profits.", "HFT is not just about the software. Due to the tremendous amount of importance that time latency gets, HFT has indirectly accelerated and motivated better hardware designs.", "Another very interesting development in the recent years is the incorporation of Reinforcement Learning into HFT. Trying to create an agent that can learn from it\u2019s mistakes and trade for maximum profit seems like an obvious path to go but due to its computational complexities, was not explored up until recently.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
