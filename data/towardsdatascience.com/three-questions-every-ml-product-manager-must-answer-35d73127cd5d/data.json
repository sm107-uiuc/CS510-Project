Unlike software programs, we don\u2019t define a set of rules for ML algorithms. Instead, we define the objective functions, provide training data, and let the neural network learn by itself.", "That\u2019s why ML is particularly useful for problems that are difficult for humans to explain to machines. However, this also means that ML models act like back boxes and we don\u2019t know exactly how they actually work. To address these issues, researches have been looking into ways to explain a black box model before, during, or after it\u2019s being developed.", "However, even if we are able to achieve better explainability, ML still involves more uncertainties and it won\u2019t be a deterministic process of writing rules for machines like software programming. So the more important question for ML PMs is: How do we communicate the uncertainties to our users?", "User Experiences (UX) will be more important than ever in the age of AI", "According to recent industry research, a third of healthcare AI SaaS companies are working on diagnostics. But uncertainty and lack of explainability nature of ML make it more difficult to gain trust from clinicians and families.", "Mike Ng, who leads the product strategy at Remedy, a chronic disease screening startup that leverages interpretable deep learning and reinforcement learning technologies, gave a powerful example of turning ML into a UX problem.", "\u201cInstead of bluntly stating the predictions, we framed it as \u2018this patient is 5 times more likely to have a certain decrease than normal people because of reason A, B, and C.\u201d This way, you present useful information predicted by the models so that the doctor can use to make decisions.", "Because ML is more probabilistic, showing the confidence level of each prediction is also a way of setting the right expectations. Rather than making decisions for users, consider presenting the data and letting users make choices by themselves.", "Allowing users to provide feedback is also critical. Even if 95% of the time the model predicts the right results, there are still 5% of the cases when the model gets it wrong. We need to be able to handle errors gracefully.", "ML can be used to solve a wide range of problems But, to the core, ML is best suited for making decisions or predictions. We can further categorize ML applications into three types:", "As a product manager, you should know what ML can be used for, and more importantly, when you should avoid using ML in products. For example, if your product requires high accuracy or full transparency, you might want to consider using other approaches to address your user problems.", "However, understanding the use cases of ML is just the first step. To actually productize a solution that customers need requires product managers to bridge two groups of people: one that knows a lot of ML but less about customer needs and the other that has tons of domain knowledge, wants to incorporate ML, but doesn\u2019t know where to start.", "These two groups of people don\u2019t speak the same language. As a product manager, you will spend a significant amount of time working with engineers/scientists to understand the potential and limitations of ML. You will also frequently talk to customers to identify their pain points and think about what solutions your team can build to address customer problems. Look for places that your customers are duct-taping and apply ML to that.", "Before we answer that question, what\u2019s your goal?", "If your company wants to publish more papers, then it makes sense to have a pure research team. However, most companies are trying to build products instead of doing researches. If you make it clear that you are focusing on applied science, you will likely attract more people with similar mindsets, people who want to build actual products.", "Secondly, once you have the right people, make sure that they stay connected with the rest of the company so we are all on the same page about what products to build. For example, put your ML researchers in the same team with engineers so the team can build early prototypes to test key functionality and iterate.", "Because of the nature of ML products, we want to give ML scientists more time and space to explore and experiment. But we need to help the team stay focused on what customers need and are willing to pay for. That\u2019s why we need to time-box the exploration and encourage the team to test the models early and frequently from end to end.", "Another interesting point that was brought up in the panel discussion is that ML requires not only technical but also organizational changes. As an ML PM, you can help other stakeholders understand why building ML products is challenging and help address potential conflicts.", "Like I mentioned in my previous article \u201cRecognize the differences between developing ML and software products. There\u2019s no one size fits all process. Adjust your sprint process, planning, or organization whenever needed.\u201d", "For example, defining the data strategy is not the responsibility of data scientists. It\u2019s a strategic decision that PMs and executives need to agree on even before building ML products. Does your company have a defensible advantage in getting proprietary data required to train models against your competitors? Or are industry giants already dominate most of the data?", "It\u2019s not enough for the engineering and product team to understand the problem. Does your PR or marketing understand the nature of ML products? The pros and cons? And the trade-offs we are making? What are the consequences and costs of making a wrong prediction? Is the company prepared to answer all these questions?", "Our next event will take place during the first week of March.
