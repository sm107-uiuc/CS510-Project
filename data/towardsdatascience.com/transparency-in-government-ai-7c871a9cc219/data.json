But what does that look like in reality?", "Thinking about the potential harms or concerns about machine learning and artificial intelligence in the hands of the government can call to mind stories like Orwell\u2019s 1984 or Spielberg's Minority Report.", "I believe this is because humans are uncomfortable with the idea of someone predicting what we will do with any sense of accuracy. I think this discomfort is significantly heightened when it is done by an entity with power over us making decisions based on these predictions such as the government.", "I\u2019ve written before about the potential impacts and harms, but there are also plenty of stories and concerns to be found in other articles and communities online.", "Transparency is a hallmark of a liberal democracy. This is because transparency in government data, government decisions, and government rules provides some of the tools needed for citizens and nongovernmental organizations to question the government. It also empowers these organizations to act as a check on the government, building the base of knowledge required to lobby and engage with elected legislatures to change existing laws or enact new ones.", "In the United States, transparency of government decisions and rule making are enshrined in the fifth and fourteenth amendments but also in several other pieces of legislation. The fifth and fourteenth amendment generally provide for due process of government decisions, especial those which impact a person\u2019s civil liberties.", "The United States also passed the Government in Sunshine Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Administrative Procedures Act, and the Paperwork Reduction Act. These acts combine to provide significant information to the public about government reasoning, decisions, and internal processes.", "Transparency is limited though. Legal scholars have shown that the courts will intemperate these laws to provide less than full understanding of the inner workings of government agencies when making decisions or implementing programs. The Freedom of Information Act for example has nine exemptions where government agencies can exclude or deny information requested. These can be interpreted fairly broadly.", "But while these laws provide the government with broad exemptions and caveats, from the release of certain information, there are still mechanisms by which to triangulate on many issues.", "There has also been a renewed sense of agency through the discussion of transparency of machine learning after the passage and implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the EU. However, as scholars have pointed out the promises of the \u201cright to explanation\u201d are over optimistic at best for several reasons.", "First, there is concern that the government will be unable to provide the level of service that would be necessary to allow individual information about each instance of a ML prediction.", "Additionally, the idea that these algorithms will be fully under control of the government agencies is still an open question throughout the world, as many government agencies rely on private companies for these skills and technologies.", "Secondly, as we see in the GDPR \u2014 and is likely to be considered in other regulations \u2014 individual consent by citizens can be an exemption from the data processor to engage in transparency.", "In the private sector, this has been shown to be nearly absurd as a control. In the public sector, this is yet to be researched, but could fall along the private lines or be different when individuals know that the government is going to use this information and account for impactful decisions.", "However, the concern that convenience will motivate most individuals to consent without an in-depth review of the terms is real and we can expect that this will also be ineffective in the government decisions.", "Thirdly, we know that machine learning is not always comprehensible to individual citizens. This is either because the level of knowledge and skills required to understand which is not commonly held by citizens, or because the nature of the model itself defies the ability to be explained by the designers and practitioners.", "Useful Explanation. In some research there has been the idea of how to make machine learning \u201cexplainable\u201d to individuals. There are two approaches as described by Edwards and Veale, a Subject-Centric Explanation (SCE)or a Model-Centric Explanation (MCE).", "In a MCE, the trained machine learning model needs to be explained to an individual. This requires deep understanding of the inputs, training data, the parameters, and the type of model. It also requires the ability to explain how the model sorts and makes decisions about the individual predictions. This could be useful on the group level basis, but difficult to be descriptive on an individual basis.", "Additionally, an MCE might require full release and transparency of the entirety of the machine learning algorithm, training and testing data, and outputs. This would endanger private rights of companies, but also potentially introduce gaming into the system\u2026basically nullifying the potential benefits of machine leaning in this instance.", "A SCE on the other hand can help individuals understand how their situation will impact the decisions or outputs made about them without opening the \u201cblack box\u201d. This could also provide them with ways to understand how their actions can positively and negatively impact their future and prove them better understanding the decisions and agency about the future.", "One example of an SCE is when a credit rating company allows users to manipulate individual situations (job, number of delinquent accounts, household size, ect.) and see a hypothetical output based on these changes.", "Reasoned Explanations. Another alternative involves transparency of government ML programs through reasoned explanation rather than fishbowl transparency. Fishbowl transparency is a concept akin to current ideals of a \u201cright to an explanation\u201d where everything the government does in relation to an ML process would be available for public consumption and review.", "In a reasoned explanation, the government agency would only be required to present the input, outputs, and theory behind the ML model to describe how it is designed and what it aims to achieve. For example, it could be as simple as explaining the data inputs and the purpose of looking at criminal behavior and predicting future crimes.", "This is not unlike some instances of government regulations in the United States currently. In these instances, the government agency is required to explain how they will make an adjudication and their theory of causality, factors considered, legal standards of the decisions, and the reasoning used in these decisions. The standard is not that they are always right, but rather that they provide the public with in-depth information about their reasoning.", "Government Accountability. Cintron and Pasquale proposed a process of auditing government ML algorithms to help ensure they do not contain biases that are unacceptable to their purposes and decision.", "This independent audits would act as a way to confirm the reasoned explanations have integrity by providing a third party review.", "It would also act a a mechanism and repository of the ML algorithm which can guard against fears or allegations that government agencies modified or even substituted ML programs without public notice.", "In the case of a citizen litigation or legislative oversight, the audited algorithm could be compared the one which is currently deployed or used in a particular instance, to affirm there have been no significant changes.", "In conclusion, the public sense of caution or fear in government use of ML is not unfounded. But the proposals currently debated calling for full transparency are not likely to mitigate or provide meaningful checks to these concerns.", "Instead of transparency in the typical sense, I agree with some of the researchers who are attempting to identify meaningful types of transparency in government ML programs which will allow adoption and implementation in government adjudications, but will not limit due process and oversight of the government either.", "Allowing the government to provide public notice and review of ML programs which do not either propose un-achievable requirements nor under-cut their ability to use ML altogether in the first step.", "Allowing for SCE can provide citizens with an actual way to understand how the ML model made a decision about them and what actions they can take to effect future decisions.", "And providing a platform of independent audits can build on these steps to provide additional trust in the ML programs and to ensure constitutional due process and oversight.", "We should think carefully about the ideas behind traditional transparency and a \u201cright to an explanation\u201d as viable mechanisms to mitigate government ML concerns.", "Your home for data science.
