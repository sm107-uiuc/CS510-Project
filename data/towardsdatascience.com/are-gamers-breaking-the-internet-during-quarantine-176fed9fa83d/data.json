I agree with most of them. The problem with this statement is the suggestion to \u201cplay at reasonable times\u201d.", "Playing at different times won\u2019t help, to prove it we\u2019re going to look at why playing online is just a small fraction of the bandwidth needed for gaming.", "The majority of replies to that tweet were quoting this chart in defense of gaming:", "This problem is this chart compares apples to oranges. When streaming videos the only bandwidth you use is loading the webpage and streaming the video content. Unlike videogames, where you download:", "Then to play the game you sometimes stay entirely offline (using no bandwidth at all), or at other times you may:", "The chart above shows what is probably the smallest part of videogames' Internet consumption.", "We\u2019ll use Fortnite for our game example because data is easy to find around it, but it has much larger consumption than most games due to its popularity.", "The other thing we\u2019ll have to consider is that most of these factors don\u2019t happen hourly, so I\u2019m going to roll the metrics up to the monthly level to make them more comparable to Netflix.", "Both of these writing choices make the data less accurate, so keep in mind that my points are purely rough generalizations.", "At the time of writing (March 22, 2020) the Epic Games client is a 41.8MB download and a fresh install of Fortnite is 35.3GB download. These are only downloaded by new players, existing players just have to keep downloading the latest updates.", "So how many new players are there? According to Statista, there were around 50M new Fortnite players that joined in March 2019 alone.", "Once playing, the original chart posted above says Fortnite consumes 70MB/hr while playing online and players average 6\u201310 hours per week. For simplicity, we\u2019ll round this down to 30 hours per month.", "In the final quarter of 2019, Netflix had over 167 million paying streaming subscribers worldwide as well as over 4.6 million free trial customers. \u2014 Statista", "So Fortnite acquired almost 11 times (4.6M versus 50M) more monthly new users in March 2019 than Netflix acquired during Q4 of 2019.", "Netflix users average 47 hours of streaming per month or 2 hours per day. Many sources disagree on this metric but we do know that it dipped in late 2019 and is likely surging right now (due to COVID-19 quarantines).", "Each hour of streaming on Netflix consumes about 3GB in HD or 7GB in 4K.", "So here are our estimations for monthly Internet consumption by new users:", "The last Fortnite update was around 3GB, and according to Gamepedia, these updates usually happen every Tuesday. So roughly 3GB a week in updates.", "These estimations are very similar to the ones above, with the userbase numbers changing and the initial download for Fortnite being removed.", "Despite the massive data consumption found in other areas of gaming, Netflix still takes the cake with 10x the consumption of Fortnite.", "Disclaimer: These are incredibly rough calculations, almost all of which have been rounded and gathered from news sources that may or may not be trustworthy. Please take this all with a grain of salt!", "If you included game-streaming (both on the watching and the broadcasting side), voice/text chatting, and multiple other video games then you might see a closer competition. Most gamers own and play multiple games.", "I\u2019d like to think that the sheer scale of Fortnite makes up for a lot of these uncalculated factors. Most other games have a fraction of the monthly users that Fortnite has and get patched less often.", "The point I wanted to make is simply that gaming takes up much more bandwidth than we realize, and so does Netflix.", "If Netflix is the big offender here, are they the ones hurting your Internet speeds?", "Not quite, here\u2019s a quote from Benedict Evans latest newsletter this week:", "The EU asked Netflix to reduce stream quality to avoid overloading networks: it complied, but most actual telcos say that though traffic is up this isn\u2019t really a problem, since what\u2019s actually happening is that the evening peak now extends into the day, rather than the peak being higher.", "He references this source which says the following, my own emphasis added.", "Since Tuesday this week, as people started to work from home more extensively, we\u2019ve seen weekday daytime traffic increase 35\u201360% compared with similar days on the fixed network, peaking at 7.5Tb/s.", "This is still only around half the average evening peak, and nowhere near the 17.5 Tb/s we have proved the network can handle.", "All in all, the increase in daytime traffic has also reduced the peak night time traffic. We\u2019re still well within the ranges of what these networks were built for.", "This isn\u2019t just true in the UK, here are more network reports if you\u2019re interested: Cloudflare, Nokia, Verizon, Spain", "If you\u2019re truly seeing slower speeds at home, it\u2019s most likely your in-home router being unable to handle the new increase in usage.
