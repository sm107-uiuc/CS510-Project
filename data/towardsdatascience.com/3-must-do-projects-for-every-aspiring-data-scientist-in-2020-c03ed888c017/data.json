Recruiters and hiring managers want to see that real hours have been put into solving real-world problems that could possibly make an impact on the business and the world. Nowadays, the business world leverages data science for a wide variety of purposes \u2014 Finance, Retail, Manufacturing, Transportation, etc. Possessing both the technical and actual practical skills is one of the most important criteria that sets you apart from other data scientists. You must be able to understand how to identify which business-relevant problems can best be solved by using the particular skills you have. That is why having done projects that are as close to the real world is important. I have listed the 3 projects that are very much closely related to the real-world environment and how you can build a solid impactful personal skills portfolio using these.", "The 3 projects below aims to tackle some of the core fundamentals of being a Data Scientist:", "Statistics and Probability, Mathematics, Predictive and Logistic Modelling, Data Wrangling and Preprocessing Skills, Data Visualisation, Machine Learning, Neural Network, CNNs and more.", "The COVID-19 global pandemic has provided an excellent opportunity for fellow Data Scientists to put some their noble work to actually help out with the ongoing situation. The CORD-19 dataset is prepared with the collaboration of the White House and a coalition of leading research groups of over 140,000 scholarly articles, including over 65,000 with full text, about COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2, and related coronaviruses cases.", "Your Goal? \u2014 Develop a robust data and text mining tool to aid the medical community to answer high priority scientific questions", "There are currently 18 tasks that would require a comprehensive solution to accurately answer some of the burning scientific questions from National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine\u2019s Standing Committee on Emerging Infectious Diseases and 21st Century Health Threats (NASEM\u2019s SCIED) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to aid in the pandemic.", "The CORD-19 is a huge 13.3Gb dataset which includes over 114k files and 3000+ columns with 8 different target tables \u2014 population, patient descriptions, materials, diagnostics, therapeutics interventions, risk factors and models to accurately provide the relevant answers to some of the key scientific questions regarding this pandemic. To date, there are over 1.78millions views and 73k downloads for the CORD-19 datasets. Much of the important fundamentals such as predictive modelling, time-series analysis and visualisation are put to the test to develop the final tool. It\u2019s truly a worth giving this project a try.", "Imagine this. You are studying your monthly credit card statement and you notice a $150 charge at a nearby grocery store. Problem is, you haven\u2019t shopped at the store in months. That suspicious charge could be a sign that- you\u2019ve been a victim of credit card fraud. Detection of frauds in credit card transactions is a huge topic in financial research, of profound economic implications. Further on, detecting unauthorised credit card transactions is an extremely complex problem \u2014 as features are seldom useful if taken individually.", "Your Goal?\u2014 Predict and analyse if any particular Credit Card transaction is a fraudulent one", "Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles (ULB) has kindly provided the 143Mb dataset which is the transactions in 2013 made by European cardholders. It contains 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions and 28 anonymous features that have undergone Principle Component Analysis (PCA) in-order to protect user identities and sensitive features. Handling imbalanced/skewed data, anomaly detection, logistic regression, etc. are some of the problems that you would face in this project which is truly beneficial if thoroughly analysed.", "With the rise of online companies such as Youtube, Amazon, Netflix and many other such web services, recommender systems have taken more and more place in our lives without us realising it. A recent study has indicated that Netflix has over 1,300 recommendation clusters on all its users to accurately deploy the right movies in front of the right users based on their watching behaviours \u2014 genres, watch-time, interest, etc. Recommendation systems are currently deployed for a variety of tasks at large internet companies and businesses, including ad click-through rate (CTR) prediction and rankings. The systems sometimes are critical in some industries as they can generate a huge amount of income when they are efficient or also be a way to stand out other competitors in the market.", "Your Goal? \u2014 Develop a customer-item based recommendation model using TensorFlow", "The recommendation model is simply an algorithm developed to put the right content in front of the right user. There are quite a number of them that are used in building the model such as Collaborative Filtering, Content Filtering, Neural Network, etc. Collaborative filtering is most widely used systems as they are different from content-based methods in that they do not require large information about users or items, and they make accurate recommendations based only on the interaction information between users and items such as clicks, browsing and rating. Each of these algorithms scales up in complexity as the user information becomes more and more abundant. The project primarily focuses on the implementation of current algorithm in addition to visualisation, statistical analysis, data processing and others to build a robust recommendation model.", "Further on, recommendation models are also currently being researched to use deep Neural Networks. In a paper proposed by the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences in 2017, the authors demonstrated the implementation of Recommendation Models based on Deep Neural Network", "The DNN approach is gaining large traction that even Google has a mini-course using TensorFlow on how build, test and deploy the system.", "Recommendation models are still one of the most important pillars in Data Science looking at the positive benefits that it brings to the business and the economy as a whole. As mentioned, the effectiveness and implementation details of applying the DNN model to content based recommendation system also are researched actively alongside with primitive algorithms in the Machine Learning domain.", "The projects stated above provide a real impact on the current economy we are in. From providing real value in a pandemic to identifying cashless fraud, I believe that not only new skills are learned, but ultimately pushing the boundaries on what problems can be solved using Data Science and Machine Learning.", "If I have managed to retain your attention to this point, please leave a comment if you have any advice for this series as it would greatly increase my knowledge and improve my way of writing. Prem Kumar is a selfless learner that is passionate about the everyday data that revolves us. Please connect with me on LinkedIn mentioning this story if you would want to speak about this and the future developments that await.", "Your home for data science.
