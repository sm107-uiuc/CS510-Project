From the drawings on caves depicting a primitive way of life, to Charles Minard\u2019s infographic about Napoleon\u2019s March, visualizations have been used to communicate abstract ideas and times in history and turn them into tangible and viable concepts. It\u2019s an integrative process that carries the limitations of only being useful as long as our eyes can decode it and our brains can reach out and understand it. So, what is it about these that makes the human mind instantly connect to the insight presented?", "Data visualization is a form of external cognition- something that aids internal cognition to do better and pushes it to see the patterns. The brain loves patterns because it is the \u201cseeing\u201d of relationships in information presented. So, when Jacques Bertin first introduced the idea of graphical encoding or as we know it now, data visualizing, he put it aptly by saying that it is \u201ca system of signs that convey meanings.\u201d They strive to help communicate and jump through three levels of information using eight variables of visual encoding.", "These three levels of information are:", "1. Elementary Information \u2014 understanding a single data point", "2. Intermediate Information \u2014 understanding a set of data points", "3. Overall Information \u2014 looking at the bigger picture where you are able to conjoin to form the pattern of all the data points", "Understanding and being able to manipulate the data through these levels of information involves adapting a process. In the case of a transition between elementary and intermediate, you can use a processing routine. Applying a processing routine is where you are able to process and understand the information from the elementary level, by discerning all of the information presented to you one after another to build onto it, thereby opening up the intermediate level of information. After this, data visualizations can be formed through the usage of the 8 variables of visual encoding mentioned below. This enables one to answer questions presented through the visual analysis process where one can identify a problem or an objective and then structure the data accordingly to process it and simplify without destruction. This process that uses the power of information and Bertin\u2019s eight variables of visual encoding creates the conditions for apt cognitive processing of data for the purposes of communication.", "Bertin\u2019s eight variables of visual encoding are:", "1. X and Y (2 variables) which translate to position", "So, when one can process these to create a visualization without destruction of the data and patterns, it causes for an arrangement of ideal cognitive conditions where the brain works towards decision-making and/or identification of relationships within the image.", "Let us discern some patterns from the data to understand how to answer the question of \u201cWhich disasters might be affecting Conoco-Phillips Refineries around the country?\u201d This will help us see how the human mind can work through the data with the help of this external cognition tool.", "First, one would have to work through the raw data to eliminate anomalies and null values so that you are able to create a viable data file that processes the information without creating outliers. Here, I was able to do that with a dataset of disasters around the United States. Then using the awesome visualization tool of Tableau, I created a map where you can see the different disasters as points all over the map- this level of information works in an almost top-down processing manner where you see the overall picture of all disasters and in definition could include all locations of where the refineries can be and which disaster might affect them. Take a look at the visualization I created below. You will be able to see that I am using the variables of position, size, as well as hue/color within the visualization.", "These values are represented within the continental United States to present a beginning of a narrative process in visualizing where you set the story of what is happening and where it is happening. After this, I further processed the visualization to open up information pertaining to the specifics of my questions. I introduced the locations of the refineries of Conoco-Phillips around the United States while in a sense graying out different disasters to draw the attention of the viewer to the position (x, y) of the refinery locations. This serves to aid in the process of visualizing by letting the human mind focus on one piece of information at a time, creating a focal point.", "Now, I am going to bring the cognition to focus on just the states where these refineries are located and I will also add the disasters from the dataset around them. This calls for me to use variables of position, size, color/hue, while also labeling the refineries to help the viewers mind register the precise locations through the usage of the tooltip attribute given within Tableau.", "Finally, there must be a resolution to the conflict in the narrative visualization process. So, as we first called to define an objective/problem, we will now call to answer the question through the steps we have been taking. With the visualization I presented, I tried to answer the question of which disasters might be affecting Conoco-Phillips refineries. After working through the above steps, I took one additional step to rank these disasters according to the frequency of their occurrence within these states. This was made possible through the use of a calculated field with Tableau. The results were not surprising but within the narrative visualization process, along with the usage of the levels of information and Bertin\u2019s eight variables of encoding- it calls to take the seat of a resolution. I created the resolution that would be easier for the mind to sort through and analyze. Using color/hue, this external cognition aid of Multi-Maps for visualization kickstarts the internal cognitive process. It allows for the brain to make sense of science and data in the form of an image. Here is the resolution to the conflict seen throughout the article.", "With this, the cognitive process instantly recognizes which disasters are affecting the Conoco-Phillips refineries throughout the states they are situated in. It recognizes the pattern that we\u2019ve been trying to discern all along from the very beginning visualization. So, just like the adage goes, \u201ca picture is worth a thousand words\u201d, this process of creating and breaking down the visualization to answer a central question is literally worth a thousand data points!", "In conclusion, walking through the visual analysis process and narrative visual analysis, one can easily identify that the three levels of information and eight variables of visual encoding come together to build the foundations for any data visualization. They are essential and intricate in nature where they employ each other to give the bigger picture. They are the spark-plug that kickstarts the internal cognitive processing of the infinite and unquantifiable organ inside our cranium. In a world where technology is at the forefront of knowledge and imagination- creating the ideal form of chaos, these data visualizations are of special importance to the human mind. They\u2019re like a superhero that swoops in to save the day with organization and processing of patterns. And you see, the brain loves patterns and in turn loves visualizations. So, imagine the excitement of the human cognizance when presented with a pattern embedded piece of external information that literally helps make the decision-making process easier. It\u2019s like taking a little kid to the candy store but in this scenario, the candy is statistical data representation to create different types of visualizations. And the best part? They all serve a common purpose to the human mind- they communicate the incommunicable and have been doing so since the beginning of time.", "Bertin, Jacques.
