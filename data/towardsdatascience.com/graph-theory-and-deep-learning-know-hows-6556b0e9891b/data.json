One of the ways we are reaching for the next step is with a new form of deep learning; Geometric Deep Learning. Read about the inspiration and ideas here. The focus of this series is on how we can use Deep Learning on on graphs", "The two prerequisites needed to understand Graph Learning is in the name itself; Graph Theory and Deep Learning. This is all you need to know to understand the nature of, and build a high-level intuition for these two ideas.", "A graph, in the context of graph theory, is a structured datatype that has nodes (entities that hold information) and edges (connections between nodes that can also hold information). A graph is a way of structuring data, but can be a datapoint itself. Graphs are a type of Non-Euclidean data, which means they exist in 3D, unlike other datatypes like images, text, and audio. Graphs can have certain properties, which limit the possible actions and analysis that can be performed on them. These properties can be defined.", "First let\u2019s cover some definitions, brought to you by the easiest Photoshop job of my life.", "In computer science, we talk alot about a data structure known as graphs:", "Graphs can have labels on their edges and/or nodes, let\u2019s give Graham some edge and node labels.", "Labels can also be considered weights, but that\u2019s up to the graph\u2019s designer.", "Labels don\u2019t have to be numerical, they can be textual.", "Labels don\u2019t have to be unique; it\u2019s entirely possible and sometimes useful to give multiple nodes the same label. Take for example, a hydrogen molecule:", "Graphs can have features (a.k.a attributes).", "Take care not to mix up features and labels. An easy way to think about it is using an analogy to names, characters, and people:", "a node is a person, a node\u2019s label is a person\u2019s name, and the node\u2019s features are the person\u2019s characteristics.", "Graphs can be directed or undirected:", "A node in the graph can even have an edge that points/connects to itself. This is known as a self-loop.", "Roughly speaking, graphs can be vaguely described as either", "Graphs can be made to look neater by turning them into their planar form, which basically means rearranging nodes such that edges don\u2019t intersect", "These concepts and terminology will come in handy as we explore the many different methods currently being employed in the various GNN architectures. Some of these basic methods are described in:", "There are a host of different Graph structures available for a ML model to learn from (Wheel, Cycle, Star, Grid, Lollipop, Dense, Sparse, etc.)", "In this case, we\u2019re traversing an undirected graph. Obviously, if the graph was directed, one would simply follow the direction of the edges. There are a couple different types of traversals, so be careful of the wording. These are a couple most common graph traversal terms and what they mean:", "Building on the concept of traversals, one can also send messages across a graph.", "All of Sam\u2019s neighbors are sending him a message, where t stands for the timestep. Sam can choose to open his mailbox and update his own information. The concept of propagating information throughout a network is super important for models with attention mechanisms. In graphs, message passing is one way we generalize convolutions. More on that later.", "Having learned all this, you now have a basic understanding of graph theory! Any other concepts important to GNNs will be explained as they come but in the meantime, there is still one last topic concerning graphs that we need to cover. We must learn how to express graphs computationally.", "There are a couple ways one can turn a graph into a format that a computer can digest; all of them are different types of matrices.", "The Incidence Matrix, commonly denoted with a capital I in research papers, Made up of 1s, 0s, and -1s, the incidence matrix can be made by following a simple pattern:", "The Adjacency Matrix of a graph is be made of 1s and 0s unless it is otherwise weighted or labelled. In any case A can be built by following this rule:", "The Adjacency Matrix of a undirected graph is therefore symmetrical along its diagonal, from the top left object to the bottom right:", "Adjacency matrices of directed graphs only cover one side of the diagonal line, since directed graphs have edges that go in only one direction.", "An adjacency matrix can be \u201cweighted\u201d, which basically means each edge has an associated value attached to it, so instead of 1s, the value is put in the respective matrix coordinate. These weights can represent anything you want. In the case of molecules for example, they may represent the type of bond between two nodes (atoms). In a social network like LinkedIn, they can represent 1st, 2nd, or 3rd, order connections between two nodes (people).", "This concept of weights for edges is an attribute that makes GNNs so powerful; they allow us to take into account both structural (dependent) and singular (independent) information. For real world applications, this means we can consider external as well as internal information.", "The Degree Matrix of a graph can be found by using the concept of degrees covered earlier. D is essentially a diagonal matrix, where each value of the diagonal is the degree of its corresponding node.", "Notice that the degree is simply the sum of each row of the adjacency matrix. These degrees are then placed on the diagonal of the matrix (the line of symmetry for the adjacency matrix). This leads nicely to the final matrix:", "The Laplacian Matrix of a graph is the result of subtracting the Adjacency Matrix from the Degree Matrix:", "Each value in the Degree Matrix is subtracted by its respective value in the Adjacency Matrix as such:", "There exist other graph matrix representations like the Incidence Matrix, but the vast majority of GNN applications on graph type data utilize one, two, or all three of these matrices. This is because they, and the laplacian matrix in particular, provide substantial information about the entities (an element with attributes) and relations (a connection between entities).", "The only thing missing is a rule (a function that maps entities to other entities via relations). This is where neural networks come in handy.", "If you need a bit more insight regarding graphs and their representations, I highly recommend a look at this in depth medium article.", "Now let\u2019s do a quick run down of the other half of \u201cGraph Neural Networks\u201d. Neural networks are the architecture we talk about when someone says \u201cDeep Learning\u201d. The neural network architecture is built upon the concept of perceptrons, which are inspired by the neuron interactions in human brains.", "Artificial Neural Networks (or just NN for short) and its extended family, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Recurrent Neural Networks, and of course, Graph Neural Networks, are all types of Deep Learning algorithms.", "Deep Learning is a type of machine learning algorithm, which in turn is a subset of artificial intelligence.", "It all starts with the humble linear equation.", "If we structure this equation as a perceptron, we see:", "Where the output (y) is the sum (E) of the bias (b) and the input (x) times the weight (m).", "Neural networks usually have an activation function, which basically decides if a given neuron output (the y) should be considered as \u201cactivated\u201d, and keeps the output value of a perceptron within a reasonable and compute-able range. (sigmoid for 0\u20131, tanh for -1\u20131, ReLU for 0 OR 1, etc.). This is why we attach an activation function at the end of the perceptron.", "When we put a bunch of perceptrons together, we get something that resembles the beginnings of a neural network! These perceptrons pass numerical values from one layer to another, with each pass bringing that numerical value closer to the target/label that the network is trained against.", "When you put a bunch of perceptrons together, you get:", "To train a neural network, we need to first calculate how much we need to adjust the model\u2019s weights. We do this with a loss function, which calculates the error.", "Where e is the error, Y is the expected output and \u0176 is the actual output. At a high level, error is calculated as actual output (the NN\u2019s prediction) minus expected output (the target). The goal is to minimize error. Error is minimized by adjusting each of the layer\u2019s weights using a process known as back propagation.", "Essentially back propagation distributes the adjustments throughout the network starting from the output layer to the input layer. The amount that is adjusted is determined by the optimization function which receives the error as input. The optimization function can be visualized as a ball rolling down a hill, with the ball\u2019s location being the error. Hence when the ball rolls to the bottom of the hill, the error is at its minimum.", "Additionally there are some hyperparameters that must be defined, one of the most important of which is the learning rate. Learning rate adjusts the rate of which the optimization function is applied. Learning rate is like the gravity setting; the higher the gravity (higher the learning rate) the faster the ball rolls down the hill, and the same is true in reverse.", "Neural networks have many different macro and micro customization that make each model unique, with varying levels of performance, but all of them are based off of this vanilla model. Later we will see how this is true especially for Graph Learning. Operations like convolutions and recurrences will be introduced as needed.", "To tie up everything we\u2019ve investigated and put our knowledge to the test, we shall address the elephant in the room. If you\u2019ve been paying attention, you might have noticed a subtle but glaring fact:", "Artificial Neural Networks are actually just graphs!", "NNs are a special graph, but they have the same structure and therefore the same terminology, concepts, and rules.", "Recall that the structure of a perceptron is essentially:", "We can think of the input value (x), the bias value (b), and the sum operation (E) as 3 nodes in a graph. We can think of the weight (m) as an edge connecting input value (x) to sum operation (E).", "The specific type of graph that NNs most resemble are multipartite graphs. A multipartite graph is a graph that can be separated into different sets of nodes. The nodes in each set can share edges between sets, but not within each set.", "Some neural networks even have fully connected nodes, conditional nodes, and other crazy architectures that give NNs their trademark versatility and power; here are some of the most popular architectures:", "Each color corresponds to a different type of node, which can be arranged in a multitude of different ways. Propagating data forward or backwards through the network is analogous to message passing in graphs. The edge or node features in a graph are similar to the weights in a neural network. Notice some nodes even have the self-loops we mentioned earlier (native to RNNs \u2014 recurrent neural networks).", "Neural networks aren\u2019t the only machine learning models to have a graph-like structure.", "are all structured like graphs themselves, or output data in a graph structure.", "The implication therefore, is that Graph Learning models, can be used to learn from these machine learning algorithms themselves. There is a potential application in hyperparameter optimization. This is exactly what the authors of this amazing paper did.", "The possibilities are only just beginning to surface as we learn more about generalizing deep learning on geometric data.", "We covered alot but to recap, we took a dive into 3 concepts", "With the prerequisites in mind, one can fully understand and appreciate Graph Learning. At a high level, Graph Learning further explores and exploits the relationship between Deep Learning and Graph Theory using a family of neural networks that are designed to work on Non-Euclidean data.", "There are many key takeaways, but the highlights are:", "Now you have all the prerequisites needed to dive into the wonderful world of Graph Learning. A good place to start would be to look into the varieties of Graph Neural Networks that have been developed thus far.", "Follow me on LinkedIn, Facebook, Instagram, and of course, Medium for more
