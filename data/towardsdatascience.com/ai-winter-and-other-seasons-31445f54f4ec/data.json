The course was fascinating. The lecturer delivering it was really passionate about it, showing us live demos of self-organising maps adapting their topology in response to a given input, and discussing the biomedical studies that had inspired some of the networks that we were studying. He was also clearly frustrated about the lack of interest and credit those methods were getting. He would show examples of neural networks solving tough problems, just to conclude that it was not being applied because \u201cwe cannot prove that it works\u201d or \u201cit is too hard to explain\u201d.", "Thinking about it now, when neural network-based AI is everywhere and praised for all the miracles in the world, feels surreal.", "Back at the time when I was taking that neural network course, whatever the branch of AI you worked on, you would have been frustrated by how much the general public and the industry was not taking you seriously. Many people in the field were reluctant to even use the words \u201cartificial intelligence\u201d, to avoid potential risks to their credibility. If you worked on neural networks, not even the other branches of AI were taking you seriously.", "Quite a few years earlier, however, AI was the next big thing. Expert systems were going to solve all sort of problems, starting with revolutionising medicine. What happened? An AI winter came and all of that went away until the next big trend and the next big wave of disappointment.", "Today, we are back there, at the top of the hill, still revolutionising medicine and every other aspect of life. The sun is shining, the temperature is high, but for how long?", "This kind of cycle is obviously not unique to AI. Trends appear and disappear all the time. There is, however, underneath the general trend of ups and downs, of winter and summer, another one which might be driving it: The opposition between two types of AIs. On the one side, we have what I would call the cognitive AI. The kind of AI that deals with explicit representations of knowledge, rules and reasoning. The symbolic AI. The one that was driving the expert systems of old times, and is still at the basis of things like IBM Watson and Apple Siri today. On the other side is the more biological AI, most prominently represented nowadays by artificial neural networks and connectionist approaches. The one that you can be sure someone is talking about when they say \u201cmachine learning\u201d. The one of my university lecturer.", "Both have interesting properties, and more importantly, both have huge issues. Cognitive AI is cumbersome, often lacks in creativity, is subject to the frame problem and is often not very scalable. Bio-inspired AI is low level, obscure, unprovable and unexplainable. It requires vast amounts of data, and still, it often struggles to generalise. Each of those AIs feeds off the other\u2019s issues, and compete with the other for a dominance that might not be achievable.", "To start looking at the reality of how those two AIs have been confronting each other, a great source of data is the proceedings of the longest-running academic conference on AI: IJCAI (the International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence). IJCAI has been running bi-annually since 1969, and annually since 2015. As can be seen in the figure below, from a rather small number of papers at the beginning, it grew quickly for a few years, and then plateaued until the early 2000s, when it started growing exponentially again.", "The data used to obtain those numbers has been extracted from the DBLP service: DBLP provides information about a large number of academic publications in computer science, including papers published in IJCAI, though a web interface and an XML dump of its database. Using this, I could extract metadata about 10,638 articles published as part of the proceedings of IJCAI from 1969 to 2020. Interestingly, all of those papers are available in PDF from the website of IJCAI.", "You only need to pick one or two papers from the early years of the conference to realise that AI was a very different thing in the past. In fact, picking papers the late 1990s would likely give you a feeling that what we call AI now is not what was called AI back then. Are the topics considered, and the trends so different? Maybe not as much as it might appear.", "Looking at the 10 most frequent terms (1-, 2- or 3-grams) in the titles of papers each year (having removed stop-word and words irrelevant to AI), it is evident that what was discussed at IJCAI during the first few years was not quite the same as what was considered a hot topic during the latest editions (only very few terms are shared between the first 3 editions, and the last 3). It is also clear however that some things have a long history of being of high interest to academic research in AI, and keep coming back from relatively early years to present times. The most obvious one is \u201clearning\u201d which, from its first appearance in 1979 as a top-10 word, quickly shot to the 1st place and stayed there since 1997. The term \u201cknowledge\u201d is another interesting one which appears across almost the whole history of IJCAI, sometimes dropping out of the top-10 but always coming back, often bringing with it \u201cfriends\u201d such as \u201creasoning\u201d or \u201csemantics\u201d. Other terms were less consistent. The \u201cexpert systems\u201d that are often said to represent the era of \u201cold-fashioned\u201d AI seem to only have been a \u201cflash in the pan\u201d, making an appearance in 83 and 85, never to be heard of again after that. \u201cLogic\u201d was a constant throughout the 80s, 90s and 2000s, but seems to have disappeared in recent years. \u201cConstraint\u201d also often made an appearance in the 90s and 2000s, but disappeared recently. \u201cGraph\u201d is a very recent addition, but seems to be following an upward trajectory. Interestingly, \u201cneural\u201d and \u201cdeep\u201d made their appearance as top terms at IJCAI only in 2016, having quickly moved to dominate the top places in the last three editions together with \u201clearning\u201d and \u201cnetwork\u201d.", "Several of those keywords are strong representatives of the two kinds of AI we talked about earlier, the cognitive/symbolic AI, and the biological/connectionist AI. It is also evident from the list that some editions of IJCAI were more focused on one rather than the other. Attaching to each of those terms the labels \u201ccognitive AI\u201d, \u201cbiological AI\u201d or no label (in case it is ambiguous) gives us a general trend of how those two sides of the coin have co-evolved in the last 50 years.", "By looking at the relative frequency of keywords representing each type of AI, we can immediately see that it was rarely a balanced relationship. After a slow start when the academic community in AI was still defining itself, from the 70s to the mid-2000s the cognitive/symbolic side of AI was undeniably dominating. Around 2005, things switched very dramatically. Biological AI, especially based on machine learning and neural networks shot and pushed cognitive AI out of the top topics of IJCAI. Of course, it has not entirely disappeared, but the winning side is quite clear.", "Looking a bit closer, we can see however how this opposition between the two AIs was already visible earlier. After shooting up dramatically until the mid-80s, cognitive AI dropped significantly, while biological AI got a significant boost. This happened again in the mid-90s. It is possible that every time cognitive AI takes a hit, it boosts biological AI.", "So maybe the notion of AI winter only applies to cognitive AI. After all, the term came about when it was the dominant form of AI and is mostly based on public perception and funding. Biology-inspired AI was often presented as a solution to the challenges raised by cognitive AI, and when the high expectations it had raised turned out not to be fulfilled, the community turned the other way.", "More worrying however is the other interpretation: AI winter comes after a big hype in AI, and cognitive AI was the one creating those hypes before. Connectionist approaches now have had their big break and created the longest and most intense hype in the history of AI. The higher you climb, the harder you fall. Are we setting ourselves up for a very cold winter? One from which cognitive AI might rise again?", "I started talking about my lecturer in neural networks at university. One thing he used to say is that the real question is not \u201cwho is right?\u201d Very simple biological processes at the level of brain cells lead to complex cognitive processes. How does that happen? How are those two completely different ways of thinking about intelligence connect? How do we fill the gap between emerging behaviours and knowledge-based intelligence? Is the main issue for AI to find a balance between the two, so that they can complement each other, rather than compete?", "If you are interested in AI techniques that are not so much in the spotlight lately, you might want to look at some of my other posts, including:", "Your home for data science.
