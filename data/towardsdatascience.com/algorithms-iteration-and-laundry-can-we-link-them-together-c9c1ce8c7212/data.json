Now, I must point out that laundry is one of those everyday tasks I truly struggle\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["I strongly believe that if you can understand laundry, you can understand algorithms and multi-level iteration.", "Now, I must point out that laundry is one of those everyday tasks I truly struggle with. I have a particularly hard time with its evil cousin, ironing. It\u2019s practically impossible for me to get it right, which is why I am very happy that we are entering sweater weather in the northern hemisphere (nobody notices a wrinkled shirt when you\u2019re wearing a not-so-wrinkled sweater over it).", "While looking for motivation for the art and science of laundry, I started to realize that it works kinda like algorithms and iteration do, and what\u2019s even better, if we could only get ourselves to think of laundry as we do of those data science concepts, maybe we could get better at them. So, here\u2019s my attempt to bring some common sense to a very common data science problem.", "Disclosure: before we begin, keep in mind that my goal here is not to give a full technical explanation of algorithms and iteration. If that\u2019s what you\u2019re looking for, this is not the place for you. There are a gazillion articles/books/videos that offer that and much more, so I kindly invite you to stop wasting your time here. If, however, you are interested in unexpected connections between data science and everyday life, read on.", "Ok, now that we got the legal stuff out of the way, an algorithm is \u201ca set of instructions used to solve a problem\u201d. On the other hand, iteration is \u201cthe process of doing something again and again\u201d. OK that\u2019s nice, but the problem is that these are just textbook definitions and (by definition) those are almost never useful in real life. They tend to be just abstract ideas that university courses like to throw at you so they can then charge a bunch of money. So let\u2019s turn to laundry instead.", "I want you to imagine that you haven\u2019t done your laundry in a really long time and procrastination has reached its limits. You must face the harsh reality that you can no longer use the same shirt to go out and you MUST take care of your dirtiness, so you throw all your shirts in a huge basket. I also want you to imagine that you have a magical computer that does laundry for you (I\u2019d pay big money for that) and you use it to take care of your dangerously accumulating pile of dirty shirts.", "Let\u2019s start by clearly defining what we have here. Let\u2019s say you only own green, blue and yellow shirts:", "And you want to wash, dry and iron them, so the basic instructions for your magical laundry computer are:", "Pretty straight forward, huh? But the thing is, you\u2019re trying to keep your laundry process organized, so you want to wash, dry and iron the shirts by color. This is conceptually what you would instruct your magical computer to do:", "And you\u2019re done. You have successfully washed all your shirts by color. All you did here was execute the instructions on three separate iterations, one for each color.", "Ok now I want you to think that you also have shirts with and without sleeves:", "Sticking to what we said in the previous example, these shirts can be green, blue or yellow. Again, being a very organized laundry person, you want to wash your shirts by color, but you also want to do sleeves first and then no-sleeves. These are the instructions for your magical computer:", "Now, notice that we have only washed our green shirts (both with and without sleeves), but we haven\u2019t yet touched the other colors. In other words, we maintained the circle \u201cfixed\u201d to the green square, as we iterated on the sleeve variable. So to finish the job, we repeat the procedure for blue shirts:", "Again, notice how the circle is \u201cfixed\u201d to the blue square as we iterate on the sleeve variable. Finally, we take care of yellow shirts in exactly the same way:", "And that\u2019s it. Basically, you did two different \u201clevels\u201d of iterations in the following way:", "And just like that, you finished your laundry.", "Just because iterations and algorithms are so much fun, let\u2019s assume you also have shirts with and without buttons, which can be of any of the three colors, and can be with or without sleeves (personally, I\u2019ve never seen a sleeveless shirt with buttons but hey, no judgment here).", "So, let\u2019s see what the instructions would look like this time:", "If you\u2019ve been following along here, you will realize we have only taken care of our green shirts. So we repeat the process for blue ones:", "The same logic of fixing the circle applies here, only we are now talking about three levels instead of two. Actually, this is kinda the whole point of the article, so let\u2019s expand on it and call it the \u2018Laundry Principle\u2019 of iterations and algorithms.", "So why the heck have you been reading an article about laundry for the last few minutes?", "Well, it turns out the above examples help to make iterations and algorithms easier to understand, since they uncover a simple yet very useful idea that we shall from now on call The Laundry Principle.", "As we saw at the very beginning, algorithms are just a set of instructions that are passed to a computer to solve a particular problem. But the sequence in which these instructions are executed is what makes algorithms so useful. As we saw above, the instructions are executed in a specific order that allows to tackle problems in a structured an efficient way, and this is where iterative thinking kicks in.", "The Laundry Principle: \u201cBottom-up\u201d beats \u201cTop-down\u201d every day of the week.", "The main idea here is that you must always think of multiple-level iterations from the bottom up. Let\u2019s see this in three levels, just like our laundry example. You start with all levels fixed on their first object, except for the last level, which is the one you will shuffle through with your instructions. Let\u2019s call this process A:", "Once all objects on the last level are exhausted, you activate iteration on the middle level and repeat process A for each object there. We\u2019ll name this process with the letter B and keep in mind this is a compound process. In other words, process B consists of:", "Once all objects are exhausted on the middle level, you activate iteration on the top level and repeat compound process B for each object there:", "And if you have more levels, well, you keep going on and on for all eternity (or until your iteration levels run out).", "It\u2019s important to note that these examples are made very simple with the goal of communicating the idea clearly. As usual, real life is not so gentle, so you will definitely still freak out every now and then when you try to understand someone else\u2019s code. For example, some code snippets will have instructions executed only on specific iteration levels (as opposed to our examples, where instructions were always executed at the bottom), and some iterables might be quite long. However, the principles remain the same.", "What did we learn here? Well, several things:", "So next time you\u2019re stuck trying to understand some dense code on Kaggle, be thankful that at least you\u2019re not doing laundry.", "Your home for data science.
