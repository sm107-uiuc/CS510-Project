This note examines, through observations and data analytics, the similarities and differences between pandemic experience in NH in various countries and regions around the World. It follows, some findings made during a first analysis leading to a former article touching this very topic in Quebec, which had the worse Nursing Homes situation during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic in Canada:", "What was observed in May, and reported in the previous article, is currently even more relevant while cases are on the rise in America and restarting in some European regions. Now, more than 40% of the 130,000+ U.S. coronavirus deaths have been linked to nursing homes, according to a recent New York Times analysis released on June 27th. Indeed, the #NYTimes figure (i.e. 43%) is including confirmed COVID-19 deaths and suspected cases.", "As noted last Friday on Yahoo Finance, experts are attributing much of this failure to the lack of resources that nursing homes across the country are facing, along with their particularly vulnerable population.", "On June 13th, the Dailymail reported that Coronavirus had killed one in 16 of care home residents.", "The Government has been widely criticised for its handling of care homes across Britain during the pandemic, with figures of the virus spreading rapidly rising since its initial onset in March.", "They were right: Data shows 26,211 excess deaths in care homes since the start of the outbreak. This is among the highest in the world, in a country that had special protections for them. Only one country, Belgium, has a higher share of nursing home deaths in absolute numbers. It\u2019s important to note that Belgium is one of the few jurisdictions that also count suspected deaths from coronavirus in care homes as official cases.", "A similar number of persons died in Nursing Homes in the USA up to May 24th, i.e. more than 26,000 as calculated by the CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services) and reported on MSN early in June. This number is growing every day in many States and counties in the US. Notably, in what is now one of the fastest-growing NH deaths (per capita), the Puma County in Arizona report of June 30th shows that 50% of the Deaths in this County are amongst LTC residents (in that week, it represented a total of 136 deaths out of 263). This trends is similar to the preceding 3 weeks and growing compared to one month ago.", "So, mapping the deaths in the US Nursing Homes using the latest completed CMS data (June 21st) was important. It illustrates the most critical areas in terms of Covid-19 Deaths. N.B. this mapping is just taking account of the \u201cconfirmed\u201d with testing deaths and this figure uses \u201cper million residents\u201d ratio according to CMS mapping. For example, in Massachusetts, the \u201c38,472\u201d means that 3.8% of residents died. Notably, there were 3,012 deaths in this State as of June 21st and 20.1% deaths amongst the Covid-19 NH cases, while in New Jersey 3,416 had died for a ratio of 3.3% deaths amongst NH residents, representing 11.9% of the cases in NH.", "It appeared that Nursing Homes in some states and countries have been particularly vulnerable to the highly contagious virus because of their setup, with elderly, frail residents often living in shared rooms, in close contact with staff who can become infected without showing symptoms.", "That\u2019s why we\u2019ve extended the work on Nursing Homes (NH) to a wider spectrum with new jurisdictions and more comprehensive datasets. In short, the analysis includes more than 23 countries, provinces, states and regions that had sufficient data for reporting.", "Please note that comparisons must be interpreted with extreme caution due to different definitions of NH and LTC and variations across countries in COVID-19 testing and reporting practices. Notably, starting dates for reporting or including (like Belgium and Quebec) or not (like the others) the \u201csuspected\u201d COVID-19 deaths. Nevertheless, any comparison gives another perspective and allows us to learn from diverse experiences. In such an incredible time, no sources of information, comparison or learning should be avoided. Each lives worth it.", "While the ongoing study reported here focuses on COVID-19 deaths in Nursing Homes and/or LTC, it also touches the Policy responses to address the pandemic.", "In a Medium article on June 9th, Tomas Pueyo made a comparison between the Herd Immunity strategy (the so-called \u201cLaissez-Faire\u201d approach) and the Hammer & Dance (\u201cCrush the curve\u201d) strategy.", "Pueyo reported that the first measure Sweden took to protect care homes was to effectively forbid visits, but failed to protect its elderly people. Even if that type of measure still limits contagion, it\u2019s barely sufficient to control infections spreading in care home settings. Sweden\u2019s lead epidemiologist, Anders Tegnell acknowledged:", "We have a hard time understanding how a lockdown would stop the introduction of the disease into the elderly homes. (\u2026) This was not a failure of the overall strategy, but rather a failure of protecting the elderly.", "But, as bad as it looks, the Sweden case is far from being the worst in the failure to protect its vulnerable population, especially in Long-Term Care (LTC) settings.", "As of June 25th, 2020, the number of reported COVID-19 deaths among Nursing Homes and LTC residents varied substantially, from 10 in Slovenia or 28 in Australia to 33,500 in the United States, with more than 5,000 in Belgium and Canada, to more than 10,000 in France, Italy, Spain and the U.K.", "As an example of the wrong strategy regarding Nursing Homes, U.K. emerged at the end of May. Even if a letter sent to care providers from NHS England and the government on 19 March (which aimed to free up hospital capacity) ordered \u201cthe safe and rapid discharge of those people who no longer need to be in a hospital bed, the new default would be discharge home today\u201d. That \u201cdischarge\u201d was contrary to the first(and correct) reflex from the Public Health England (PHE) warned in February that elderly people should not be discharged from hospitals to care homes if there was a serious risk of passing on the virus.", "Many countries made the same mistake as the U.K. In fact, we can find traces of the same in a majority of the main COVID-19 regions in the countries with more than 5,000 Deaths in Nursing Homes. Protecting the main Health institutions (i.e. Hospitals) was likely done to the detriment of long term care homes.", "With an average of more than 5,500 LTC residents deaths in the OECD countries, many of these countries had a high proportion of deaths occurring in long-term care. Notably, Nursing Homes residents accounted for 68% of all reported COVID-19 deaths in Canada (81% for all Canadian LTC), 66% in Spain and 64% in Belgium compared with an average of more than 42% in other OECD countries (with some having less than 10% in Slovenia and Hungary nad less than 20% in Austria and the Netherlands).", "Variation among regions, states or provinces was greater than variation among OECD countries altogether. Differences between Canada provinces were especially explicit on that front. As of June 25th, Newfoundland and Labrador, Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and the territories had no reported deaths in retirement homes and LTC facilities, whereas NH deaths represented over 65% of all COVID-19 deaths in Quebec, Ontario and Alberta. In Nova Scotia, 97% of all deaths are in LTC.", "In the USA, we also see important differences between states. Massachusetts, Connecticut and New Jersey showing the worst results for Nursing Homes in Deaths per million population, while Pennsylvania as the biggest ratio (%) of deaths in NH compared to total COVID-19 deaths. While not as high as the formers states, Arizona is now showing the biggest weekly growth in the death ratio.", "Generally, jurisdictions with lower COVID-19 infection rates in the community reported fewer NH cases and deaths. But there is a wide range of situations. As a proportion of total COVID-19 cases, the proportion of cases in nursing homes ranged from under 1% of total cases in Australia, to 18% in Canada, up to 51% in France and 73% in the U.K.", "The proportion of infected NH residents who died from the disease also varied considerably across countries, from 4% in Slovenia to 83% in Norway. In Canada, the mortality rate for those infected with COVID-19 in NH was about 36% as of June 25th.", "Many countries have reported high rates of infection among health care workers, leading to absenteeism and staffing shortages.", "The new report released in June from the CIHI (Canadian Institute for Health Information): \u201cThe pandemic in the long-term care sector\u201d confirms our findings from the past few weeks. They have highlighted an interesting insight: \u201cCountries that have implemented mandatory prevention measures specifically targeting the LTC sector at the same time as confining and closing public spaces (Australia, Austria, the Netherlands, Hungary and Slovenia) have experienced lower rates of COVID-19 infection and disease-related mortality in SLD.\u201d These are the success story that needs to be reproduced in failing (in Nursing Homes) health systems.", "To maximize chances of success in Nursing Homes includes some preventive measures such as immediate infection control measures, visitors restrictions, acute care and PPE funding, recruitment, training and generalized screening in LTC facilities, the establishment of isolation units to manage case clusters, broad LTC testing, infection control training and audit, rapid response control, prevention teams and additional support for staff. LTC, such as increased staffing, the creation of specialized teams and the distribution of personal protective equipment (PPE).", "Under a \u201cnot so\u201d controlled pandemic, trying to limit infections in nursing homes with visit limits would need to last for months, if not years until there\u2019s a treatment or vaccine. That\u2019s because even when many people have already overcome their infections, the virus is still present.", "Care homes in England that use more agency staff or do not offer sick pay are more likely to have higher levels of Covid-19 infection among residents, according to the Office for National Statistics.", "The Vivaldi study published on Friday, based on responses from 5,126 care homes in England, found that residents in care homes that used bank or agency nurses or carers most days or every day were 1.58 times more likely to test positive for Covid-19 than those in homes that did not use such staff.", "In short, the ONS findings, highlighting how contractual staff (generally on low pay and \u201czero-hours\u201d contracts) may have inadvertently contributed to the spread of the virus, came as the coronavirus-related death toll in care homes in England and Wales rose to 19,394. On the other hand, in care homes where staff receive sick pay, residents were estimated to have odds of between 0.82 to 0.93 of testing positive compared with those where staff did receive sick pay.", "In his June 9th article, Tomas Pueyo reported that:", "The elderly still need workers to take care of them. What will happen with these workers, called shielders? Will they also be quarantined? For years? What about their partners, will they also be quarantined? Will they have to lose their jobs? What about their kids, should they also be quarantined? Stop going to school? If not, what about other kids and their parents? Should they be quarantined instead? All of that\u2019s impossible, so we must assume many care home workers will get infected. How to protect the elderly from them?", "During all this time, as soon as one single person is infected in a nursing home, the virus spreads like wildfire inside. So it means no visits for years if we can\u2019t control the virus with a Green Zone approach or a #go2zero strategy in the general population.", "Some of the \u201cFailing-in-Nursing Homes\u201d governments try to take it the proper way and establish good practices such as in the succeeding countries. On Friday, Dr Horacio Arruda, Quebec\u2019s director of public health announced that all workers in Nursing Homes and long-term care centres, particularly in the metropolitan area, will be offered one test per week to detect people who have the virus but have no symptoms. Although it\u2019s still a small step, this is a significant step because asymptomatic people are important stealth vectors in this pandemic. Belgium has more than 61 509 confirmed cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-CoV-2 infection and 9754 related deaths. In April, the ministry of health decided to implement a mass testing campaign in long-term care facilities. A new study released in The Lancet reveals a cross-sectional analysis of data received from the laboratories between April 8, and May 18, 2020. This analysis of a large number of tests done in LTCFs shows a high proportion of asymptomatic cases (see their \u201cAnnex 2\u201d chart below). It is confirming previous studies in Europe and China that evaluated the proportion of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections were ranged from 20% to 88% of the tested population.", "So, the Bruxelle\u2019s Region in Belgium, in collaboration with the Red Cross, has developed guides and special COVID-19 course for all caregivers in Nursing Homes to make sure that asymptomatic would be kept from spreading more the infection.", "England and Whales also contribute to a vast \u201cImpact of coronavirus in care homes\u201d study that intends to better understand and then allows for corrections in the dire situation in the sector.", "All this raises the question of the state of the social care system in many countries, which have been in desperate need of reform for years. It is often underfunded while the care workers are underpaid. Looking at many countries where nursing home deaths were not as high as those in the \u201cTop-12\u201d jurisdictions in our Covid-19 Deaths in Nursing Home vs Total chart, we can often see a winning pattern. And this is especially true for many of the bottom 10 jurisdictions in the same chart (such as Germany, Portugal, Norway, Israel or Slovenia). Notably, we would see a different system of trained, respected carers, more properly rewarded for their difficult work, and not reliant on multiple agency jobs to earn a living, causing the virus to quickly spread from one facility to the other.", "It\u2019s now more than ever a time to correct the situation. Midway in the last century, Dr Margaret Mead defined one of the characteristics of human civilization. Dr Ira Byock reported it in his book on palliative medicine The Best Care Possible: A Physician\u2019s Quest to Transform Care Through the End of Life (Avery, 2012).", "\u00ab Years ago, anthropologist Margaret Mead was asked by a student what she considered to be the first sign of civilization in a culture. The student expected Mead to talk about fishhooks or clay pots or grinding stones. But no. Mead said that the first sign of civilization in ancient culture was a femur (thighbone) that had been broken and then healed.", "Mead explained that in the animal kingdom if you break your leg, you die. You cannot run from danger, get to the river for a drink or hunt for food. You are meat for prowling beasts. No animal survives a broken leg long enough for the bone to heal. A broken femur that has healed is evidence that someone has taken time to stay with the one who fell, has bound up the wound, has carried the person to safety and has tended the person through recovery. Helping someone else through difficulty is where civilization starts, Mead said. We are at our best when we serve others. Be civilized. \u00bb", "And it\u2019s not just the responsibility of our governments to learn from the failures and to multiply successes. It\u2019s for all the leaders to step up. Leaders in the community, in the city or the region, in the care homes or the family. Such as what was highlighted in an article in The Economist a month ago,", "Covid-19 has demonstrated that the foundations of prosperity are precarious. Disasters long talked about, and long ignored, can come upon you with no warning, turning life inside out and shaking all that seemed stable.", "This insight from Dr Mead is still brilliant and relevant in these pandemic times. In 2020, those who neglect to take care of the vulnerable and those who refuse social distancing, wearing masks, confinement to save lives should think about it.", "So it\u2019s for all of us to participate in the measure that would save lives and distress amongst our most vulnerable. In such a critical time, everybody can contribute. We can all step-up and become leaders in our respective communities, amongst our family and friends. Our health systems, and especially the sectors taking care of our most vulnerable, as well as each of us need to get ready to avoid another failure. We need to get set before the end of the first wave. A second wave might soon jump in the melee. We owe our vulnerable populations to be prepared.", "This article has been prepared by Stephane Bilodeau, ing., P.Eng, PhD, FEC.
