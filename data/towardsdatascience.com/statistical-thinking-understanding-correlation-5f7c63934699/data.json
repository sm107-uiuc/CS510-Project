Even if \u2014 or maybe especially if \u2014 you spend most of your time plugging into ready made libraries and won\u2019t need to build up a machine learning model from scratch, you will benefit from understanding the statistical mechanics underpinning your models. Knowing what sort of statistical work the computer is doing on your behalf when you call on a certain type of model can be key to choosing which model to use for a given situation, for knowing what sort of processing the data will require and for properly tuning your model.", "A student of data science, particularly a mid-career changer going the bootcamp route, may find the nitty gritty of studying statistics a little daunting \u2014 like many complicated fields, statistics has its own terminology and symbols that require learning. For better or worse, many people work as data scientists with only a minimal grounding in statistics, but a certain intuition for statistical principles should be a prerequisite. Having a good internal sense of a handful of principles that don\u2019t even require any math will go a long way. First among these principles is correlation.", "Correlation is perhaps the most important concept to understand for any sort of applied data science or analytics. What does it mean for two variables to be correlated? Simply put, it means that we can tell the variables are related because they move together in some way. Perhaps one rises while the other falls or both rise together. This isn\u2019t the same as a movement in one variable causing the other to rise or fall \u2014 there might be some third, unseen variable that is controlling the other two \u2014 yet knowing the value of one of the variables will still give you information about the second if they are correlated.", "Many people are introduced to correlation in beginning statistics classes with a formula for Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient and a set of graphs demonstrating various levels of correlation like this:", "On the far left graph, there is only a very low correlation between our x and y variables. On the right there is a very high correlation; the two variables seem to move in lockstep, as X increases, invariably Y does as well. The value of Pearson\u2019s Correlation Coefficient reflects the important trends pretty well, with the lockstep relationship on the right represented by a value close to 1 and the low correlation on the left captured by a value close to 0. Of course, variables can also be negatively correlated, where the Y value generally falls as X increases:", "Pearson\u2019s Coefficient, therefore, seems to tell us a lot and is nearly ubiquitous as a measure of correlation (if you come across a reference to the \u2018correlation coefficient\u2019 and it doesn\u2019t specify otherwise, it is safe to assume it refers to Pearson\u2019s). Useful as it is, however, I want to move away from calculating this singular value and focus on what it means for variables to be correlated more broadly. For one thing, new students of statistics tend to mistake the value of a correlation with the magnitude of the association between two variables. This isn\u2019t really how the correlation coefficient works. A coefficient of correlation close to 1 only signifies that the X and Y variables move in tandem: that Y can be expected to go up as X goes up, but not by how much Y goes up as X goes up. Increasing the slope of the line doesn\u2019t actually change the value of the correlation coefficient:", "For another thing, Pearson\u2019s coefficient is actually only one of numerous different measures of correlation. Why would there be different measures for correlation? Well, variables can be related in numerous different ways. Consider this set of points:", "Hopefully, you can see right away that the X and Y variables are related, yet the value of the Pearson\u2019s coefficient between them is near 0. Why would that be? Pearson\u2019s coefficient is a measure of linear correlation and the relationship between these two variables is not linear! The fact that the Y value falls as X increases when X is less 0 but rises as X increases above 0 confuses this metric. Luckily there are other ways to measure correlation. For this particular case, you might consider Distance Correlation. Other measures of correlation also exist that consider variable rank rather quantity.", "In a way, correlation is really the heart of all applied data science. When two variables are correlated, knowing one may help you predict the other. The relationships between variables may be complicated and non-linear, which is why it\u2019s important to think about correlation as being more than just a single coefficient. What\u2019s really important isn\u2019t the value of any particular correlation coefficient, but whether or not the values of two variables appear to be related. Despite having a Pearson\u2019s coefficient of 0, the two variables forming the parabola above are related and knowing the value of the X variable gives you a very good hint at the value of the Y variable.", "In the real world, measurements of variables tend to be noisy \u2014 your measurement may be a little higher or lower depending on how or when you measure it. Relationships between variables can also be confounded, meaning that there is a third, unmeasured variable that independently affects one or both of the variables you are looking at. As a result, it won\u2019t always be easy to tell if two variables are usefully related. A useful relationship can be masked by statistical noise. Much of machine learning is simply clever tools to try to tease out useable correlations even when it isn\u2019t immediately clear what those relationships are.", "\u2018Low correlations\u2019 can still be very meaningful", "Another reason I want to shift focus away from a single coefficient is that a low coefficient doesn\u2019t by itself mean that there isn\u2019t something very meaningful going on. Many intro statistics courses do a good job warning people about the dangers of \u2018spurious correlations\u2019, wherein two variables that have nothing to do with each other appear correlated due to random chance (particularly when the samples are small). You can find many great examples of such spurious correlations, I particularly like those Tyler Vigen has collected:", "Intro courses don\u2019t tend to spend enough time focusing on the opposite problem, however, wherein real relationships are obscured by low correlation coefficients. Low correlation coefficients can be associated with very meaningful effects. If some effect has numerous different, independent causes, the correlation coefficient between the effect and each individual variable might be low, despite the causal links. To illustrate, consider the following 50 points that I generated and have plotted below:", "Does it look like there is a strong correlation between the X and Y variables here? Probably not. Pearson\u2019s coefficient is a negligible .17. Would this X variable be useful in a model that tried to predict Y? Your first thought might be no, but you might change your mind if I explain how I generated these numbers. I simulated rolling 6 dice, half of which were six-sided and the other half of which were twenty-sided, and added up the numbers. The X variable plotted above is simply the first of these rolls.", "Because the total is derived from so many rolls and each roll is independent, the correlation coefficient on any single roll is not likely to be very high. But, as you can see, the individually low coefficients don\u2019t mean that the variables are useless. The x variable I plotted above (along with the other 5 rolls) has real explanatory power. All you need to predict the total with complete accuracy is the results of the six independent rolls and you\u2019ll never get to complete accuracy without this one.", "The next step from finding a correlation is to think about causation. You may have heard the intro stats mantra of \u2018correlation does not equal causation\u2019. Knowing that two variables are linked in some way is not the same as knowing how they are linked. You can tell if X and Y are correlated by simply looking at the data, but there are numerous ways for X and Y to be related. X can influence Y or Y can influence X or some other variable can influence both. You cannot tell which of these is the case from the data alone.", "For instance, numerous studies have found that children who learn a musical instrument do better in school. Frequently these sorts of studies are used as evidence that learning an instrument makes children do better in schools; parents may hear about them and decide their child should learn piano, or argue for increased funding for school music programs. While I\u2019m in favor of school music programs, the relationship here is probably not as simple as \u2018teach a student violin and watch their grades go up\u2019. For one thing, there are numerous confounding factors, not the least of which is socioeconomic status \u2014 families with more disposable income are more likely to be able to afford an instrument and music lessons for an interested child. For another thing, the causality might actually flow the other way \u2014 maybe students who do well in school are more likely to want to learn a musical instrument. The sort of child with the focus and determination to excel in math class might also be more likely to stick with learning an instrument until they see satisfying results.", "The fact that we can\u2019t tell from an observational study what precisely is causing what has important implications for policy. That said, it\u2019s important to remember that you don\u2019t need to know which way causality is flowing for a correlation to have predictive power. Consider a college admissions officer looking at applicants. Knowing that students who have studied music for a long time tend to do better in college, the officer might favor choosing students who play an instrument for admission, all other things being equal. To them, in a way, it doesn\u2019t really matter why that link exists, they don\u2019t necessarily care if the study of music makes students do better or if there is some other factor at play, all they care about is the fact that the existence of the relationship allows them to better predict the future performance of the student.", "You frequently hear talk of things like \u2018random samples\u2019 and that samples that are not random can be biased, but what does it mean for a sample to be \u2018random\u2019? Most processes we deal with (and possibly everything in the universe as well, though that\u2019s a philosophical topic for another time) that seem random are really just deterministic. A coin toss is \u2018random\u2019 in the sense you are unlikely to be able to tell which way it will land, but it\u2019s wholly deterministic in the sense that whether it lands heads or tails is entirely dependent on the coin\u2019s spin and movement through the air which is itself entirely dependent on the angle and force with which the coin is flicked out of your hand. Similarly, computers cannot act in a truly random manner. If you ask your computer to generate random numbers or take a random sample, it will generate \u2018pseudo-random\u2019 numbers, which look suitably random but are actually derived from chaotic but ultimately deterministic physical process, arithmetic manipulations or some combination of the two.", "Why do you need random numbers and how can we tell that the pseudo-random numbers are \u2018random\u2019 enough? One of the keys is that the random number (or the sample selected through a random method) is independent and uncorrelated with whatever it is we\u2019re studying. Even if the methods are not truly \u2018random\u2019, selecting a sample by flipping coins or rolling dice works well because the outcome of the coin flip or dice roll is not going to be related to the items in the sample and vice versa.", "I bring this up because a lot of data science is done using data pools that are not random at all. Companies have, for instance, a lot of customer data they might want to mine for some sort of insight, but, by definition, you can only have customer data about your customers. Frequently this limits the sort of inferences you can reasonably make from the data, specifically because the variable you want to study is correlated with how the sample has been gathered.", "For example, I once worked on a project that looked at people\u2019s satisfaction with their cars. A survey had gone out and people had responded with basic information about their cars (make, model, year, etc.), whether they had encountered certain sorts of problems with the cars and their overall satisfaction. The team had tried to model out how satisfied a person was likely to be with their car and some people were surprised to discover that as vehicle age went up, the model predicted higher satisfaction. Surely, people would be less satisfied with older cars?", "Here was a case were the sample selection method and the target variable (satisfaction) were correlated. After all, if you are really unsatisfied with your car you\u2019re more likely to replace it as soon as you can afford to. People who have driven the same car for fifteen years probably like driving that car. People who hate their car don\u2019t tend to keep it for that long. All other things being equal, you might expect people to prefer newer cars to older ones, but a sample derived by survey is not going to have the intersection of old cars and unsatisfied drivers.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that the survey isn\u2019t useful or that you can\u2019t include the age of the car in your model. Indeed, age ends up being a very useful predictor of satisfaction precisely because of this correlation; if you tell me you\u2019ve driven the same car for a long time, it\u2019s not a bad bet that you\u2019ve done so in part because you like it (or at least don\u2019t dislike it). This correlation does constrain what your model can be used for, however. If you\u2019ve done this analysis and a car company approached you asking how to improve customer satisfaction, it wouldn\u2019t be very helpful to respond \u201cwell, people who drive older cars tend to be satisfied with them, so you should give your customers old cars\u201d.", "Your home for data science.
