So why not spend the remainder of this year to plan for the next? As 2021 approaches, I wanted to plan ahead and think about what I want to learn next year to make myself a better data scientist.", "Below, I\u2019ve identified five areas that I believe will help me become ten times more valuable than right now. For each area, I\u2019ve explained why I\u2019ve decided to dedicate my time learning it and the resources that I plan on using to help me.", "With that said, let\u2019s dive into it!", "It\u2019s becoming increasingly important that data scientists not only know how to build models but how to deploy them as well. In fact, a lot of job postings are now requiring some experience in model deployment.", "The reason that it\u2019s so important to learn how to deploy models is that a model is only as valuable as its ease of use and ease of interpretability. And so, being able to deploy it in a way that anyone can interact with will be extremely useful.", "A model is only as good as its ability to use and interpret.", "I am still very much a novice in this area (I must admit!), but I believe there are several tools that can be used to deploy models like Docker, Heroku, Streamlit, and Airflow so I want to explore the different options and compare where they see fit.", "Similar to how I started learning machine learning, I don\u2019t know what I don\u2019t know. Therefore, I\u2019m going to initially be skimming through a lot of different resources. I\u2019ll most likely be starting with Docker, as it seems to be the most widely used for deployment.", "Below are some initial resources that I plan on going through:", "Deep learning isn\u2019t a new topic. It\u2019s been around for a while now, so why do I want to focus on it this year?", "It\u2019s increasing in relevancy. Deep learning has significantly improved over the past few years \u2014 the techniques in deep learning have been refined, the efficiency of deep learning algorithms have improved, and there\u2019s a lot more support online around deep learning (more open source projects and more educational resources).", "I\u2019ve also noticed that deep learning is becoming a bigger focus throughout the community. An increasing proportion of Kaggle competitions require deep learning, more job postings require experience in deep learning, and more articles are about deep learning!", "I already know what resources I plan on using when I want to dive into deep learning because I\u2019ve had my eyes on these resources for a while. To get an intuitive understanding of neural networks, I plan on watching the first two YouTube videos. Then, I plan on going through the two courses that follow.", "It\u2019s so practical, yet so misunderstood.", "Similar to my reasons for deep learning, time series modelling is one of the most practical data science/statistical concepts, but I also find it one of the most difficult concepts to wrap my head around completely.", "I want to learn it because I\u2019ve noticed that a lot of problems at my work can be solved with time series modelling. Similarly, there are a lot of personal projects that I would like to complete which require knowledge in time series modelling.", "Below are a number of courses from accredited universities. The", "There\u2019s a couple of reasons why I want to have a better understanding of recommendation systems.", "One, like time series modelling, recommendation systems are one of the biggest data science applications because it\u2019s so applicable.", "More importantly, recommendation systems are revenue-generating. Amazon\u2019s 29% increase in sales in 2015 was largely attributed to its recommendation systems all over its website. Also, a little bird told me that Faire, a company like Amazon, became profitable the year after it introduced recommendation systems.", "Thus, having a good understanding of recommendation systems means being more valuable.", "The first video was a video that I already watched, and I highly recommend that it. It does a great job of explaining how recommendation systems work intuitively. Then, I\u2019ll go through the other two links and see where it takes me!", "I started competing in Kaggle competitions this year and I noticed that in order to rank in the top 5%, you need to know about hyperparameter optimization.", "Every single detail matters when you want to be perfect.", "And you have to strive for perfection if you want to create the best machine learning and deep learning models. In fact, if you look at the models created by the top data scientists on Kaggle, much of their success is attributed to hyperparameter optimization!", "Below are several guides that I came across that I plan on going through to further my understanding of hyperparameter optimization!", "I hope this inspires you to plan what you want to learn next year! What you learn next year should depend on where you currently stand in terms of knowledge, so don\u2019t feel like you have to follow this article \u2014 take what you want from it. :)", "This year has been an incredible journey and it\u2019s only the beginning. If you want to embark on this journey with me and learn these topics together, make sure to follow me on Medium.", "Not sure what to read next?
