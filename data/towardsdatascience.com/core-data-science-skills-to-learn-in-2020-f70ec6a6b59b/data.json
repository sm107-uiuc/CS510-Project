It is complex, fascinating, rewarding, and fun, yes fun! To study, experiment, or build a career in. From high-end sophistication of NASA satellite data and the global climate system to daily life dependability on data-intensive applications e.g., artificial intelligence (AI), you are part of the process as it is.", "But that is not sufficient, is it? to go forward with. Especially if you are one of the many aspirants looking to make big in the wide world of machine learning, business intelligence, image processing, or advanced data analytics. No, it is certainly not enough. Data science demands exceptional skills, persistence, and clarity to master the methodology which data scientists employ to draw useful insights by manipulating data.", "Granted, the scope in data science has never been brighter than it is today. Given the explosive demand for data science experts and a huge supply gap, the time is ripe to pursue one of the most in-demand professions. And it is only going to grow further, at least for a decade or two data science is positioned to remain at the epic-center of all the technological advancements. Which begs the question of today\u2019s topic in perspective \u2014 what are the core data science skills to learn in 2020? to be able to stay relevant or even to begin adequately.", "What should be the skill set of an individual who wants to thrive in data science in 2020? That\u2019s the big question we need an answer for. Is it programming alone? Is it mathematics and programming combined? Is it Statistics, Mathematics, and Programming collectively? What should be the right combination one must have to succeed in one of the many data science fields?", "The primary aim of this article is to address these and many other similar questions to help you clear away the dust. We are going to discuss all the interest areas that make data science the multidisciplinary field and weigh its relevancy in the coming years.", "One of the core subject that sustains data science as an all-inclusive field is statistics. Data science is used to extract readable information from data through different procedures. These procedures are systematically applied to model and visualize data in order to achieve the objective. Statistics is the foundation for the analytical models it takes to summate the data. Moreover, when data is visualized for patterns discovery, it requires astute statistical graphics and maps to communicate the information efficiently to a wider public.", "It makes statistics one of the first subjects you need to have a hands-on grip to be able to excel data science in the coming years.", "It is absolutely necessary to have an unconditional command over a minimum of one programming language like Python, SQL, R, Java, etc., to even step in the world of data science. It works through combining advanced statistical with real-world programming ability. Out of many languages, Python \u2014 the high-level, multipurpose language is the most used programming language in data-related fields. Due to its general-purpose nature, Python allows the SQL, TensorFlow, and many other languages, functions, and libraries integration for machine learning and data science altogether.", "There are various stages in the data science project lifecycle such as data gathering, feature engineering, feature selection, model creation & deployment, and result communication. The Python comes with a data-intensive custom library to assist each stage from its large collection of extensions e.g., NumPy, SciPy, StatsModels, Pandas, etc.", "Without programming expertise, you do not stand a chance to establish yourself successfully. If anything, the deeply technical aspect is going to be more pertinent than ever before in the years to come. Which makes programming the core of the core data science skill to learn in 2020.", "The concept of data mining is growing in popularity in the realm of commerce and business activities. Yet, it\u2019s one of the thoroughly misconceived or misunderstood subject areas of data science. Data mining is not data modeling, mugging, analysis, or wrangling, etc.", "Data mining is the process of selecting the right data from the right sources. And then employ the right techniques such as data regression, classification, outlier, or cluster analysis, to help achieve the data sets understanding to build appropriate models. Data scientists, experienced or otherwise spend 80% of their time dealing with different data types to be able to create analytical models and gain valuable insight.", "This is an information and data-intensive era that we are living through. Every day there is more and more data being generated from basic to consequential tasks. For instance, you go to a grocery store and swipe a card. That card swipe set the data downloading into a database in motion. We saw a massive amount of data in the last two years and 2020 was already estimated to reach 44 zettabytes (44 trillion gigabytes) data amount by the end of the year.", "Organizations are storing, processing, and analyzing data more so now than ever before and this trend is going to continue. Data mining is an integral lynchpin for all of this gigantic data present in the world, whether it is in the business sector, healthcare, entertainment, finance & banking, R&D, security, etc. You name an industry, and we will get you its data-driven logistics. Everything today needs strategic and actionable information for varying purposes. Which is not possible without standard data mining processes and experts.", "We are the most affected generation of all the technological transition around us. Along with every other aspect, we \u2014 as a global society \u2014 are living in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) charged times. A lot of people confuse ML and AI to be a singular field, while they have similarities, each of these subject areas is dedicated to separate expertise. Machine learning is the fascinating study of training the machine to auto-learn and self-improve in order to execute required tasks that it was not programmed to do so. Which in a nutshell is the application of AI, to train machines in the specified time, and within certain resources to perform reliably, AI and other cognitive technologies are heavily assimilated in this process.", "All the available as well as yet to come data needs to be structured through different techniques like feature selection and modeling to be fed to machines for automated information extraction. The main purpose of machine learning is to assist auto-analysis of the huge amount of data for critical insights. ML is the fulcrum between today and the automation that we are heading towards. Its relevance in the coming years is of the ultimate significance. It is one of the first skillsets you need to acquire in 2020 in order to claim a stake in the data science revolution.", "Deep learning \u2014 often also regarded as deep neural learning or deep neural network \u2014 is the subclass of machine learning in the artificial intelligence application. Being a subclass, deep learning has its own form of operations, purposes, and techniques. One of the main distinction between deep and machine learning lies in the input data that is fed to the machine. It uses several layers to progressively identify, memorize, and extract highly optimized information from the raw data input.", "Contrary to machine learning, which can make accurate predictions based on any form of data including text, image, audio, or video, deep learning uses neural network models. These models receive input to process the data in concealed layers through weights that are synchronized during the training of the computer system before giving out the required prediction (output).", "Deep learning, unlike machine learning, doesn\u2019t require structured data. It has the ability to learn from unstructured and unlabeled data because it is inspired by the structure of the human brain.", "Today, there are several deep learning architectures such as:", "These structures have successfully been applied to numerous fields with shocking results that in some specific cases have even surpassed human expert performance. Some of the deep learning intensive fields are:", "Deep learning requires more time and resources to train the machine which translates into higher computational cost because it needs graphics processing units (GPU) instead of our regular central processing units (CPU).", "The scope of deep learning is increasingly growing in the field of medicine e.g., neural networks are successfully detecting cancer cells and analyzing MRI images with 100% accuracy and detail. Technology is another area utilizing deep learning knowledge e.g., self-driving cars are now a reality. Look at Apple, Tesla, and Nissan that are rapidly employing deep learning experts to transform their dreams of reliable self-driving cars into reality.", "Following are some of the most demanded skills required to enhance a career in deep learning:", "\u00b7 Hands-on experience with programming languages like Python, C++, R", "\u00b7 Data evaluation and modeling techniques", "Business Intelligence (BI) is basically a subdivision of data analytics that takes a pre-determined set of processes, technologies, strategical architecture in order to transform the raw data into actionable business intelligence (information). BI employs a reverse approach in which the past data is analyzed to solve the current problems. Although, this approach provides tactical reports that contain factual statistics but they cannot predict future events. That is where the distinction between business intelligence and data science begins. In data science, you are supposed to use data in an advancing approach to predict the future outcome to make profitable business decisions.", "Business Intelligence in data science works by combining business analytics, data mining, data visualization, input/output bounds tools, and data infrastructure to augment businesses\u2019 decision-making abilities. BI integrated into data science methods is the faster way of reporting and communicating results through specialized tools such as:", "At the end of the day, all the fields mentioned above and more are businesses in essence. You cannot possibly be an exceptional data scientist for any given organization without having excellent business intelligence. BI is fundamentally that axis that has all other skills connected together.", "So, if you want to excel in the field of business intelligence you must acquire the following few skills:", "\u00b7 Experience with data analysis tools and SQL Programming", "Right this minute, the fact is that data science is going to stay and transform the world as we know it today. There is an abundance of similar prediction and observations from the most credible analysts and global economists to conclude that the future is dominated by data science. You need some serious skills besides being a critical thinker and an overall talented individual with a passion for data.", "All the above-mentioned subject areas collectively make the right combination of the skills you should learn. The basic understanding of all of them is sure to get you a decent enough start but learning should be a continuous process and you should not stop at the basic level expertise.", "Your home for data science.
