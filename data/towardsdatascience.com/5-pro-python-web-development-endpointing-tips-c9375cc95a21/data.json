This can be the outcome that will stop your model dead in its tracks, and make it never see the light of day. This is such a complicated and large problem that I have been on teams where we have changed the model and reverse engineer our work into the new model just to avoid a few deployment bugs.", "Let\u2019s face it \u2014 Data-Scientists aren\u2019t Web-Developers. Though some of us might be more keen on the Unix command-line and know more web-protocols than most, it\u2019s unlikely that you had deploying your own endpoints in mind when you first approached being a Data-Scientist. In a lot of ways, your endpoint is just as important as your model! Without endpoints, many of the machine-learning models we use everyday would certainly not function properly, which is mind-blowing!", "So what do you get when you mix someone who is not a web-developer or a dev-ops engineer with a machine-learning engineer?", "Unfortunately, this is definitely a smaller segment of the job that is often over-looked. Dev-ops is an entire field on its own, and getting really good at it is nearly as in-depth as getting good at Data-Science in your notebook. Fortunately, today I am going to go over 5 tips that I think all Data-Scientists will find useful for deployment and end-pointing, so close those Jupyter-Notebooks and let\u2019s move to the deployment stage!", "There are probably a thousand unique ways to start a server in Python. My personal and professional favorite is probably Gunicorn3. However, while Gunicorn is a great deployment solution for a server, it might not be so perfect for development. Gunicorn has a lot of what I call \u201c output masking,\u201d where instead of getting the error in your own code, you\u2019ll receive Gunicorn\u2019s output which can be misleading or even not legible. Applying fixes to your code is going to be rather difficult if that is the case. Fortunately, there are a few alternatives to using Gunicorn to run your server.", "What\u2019s so great about this server? This server is included in Python\u2019s standard library, and can easily be ran through any Unix (or Python) terminal with one Bash command. Alternatively, you could even use Python to create such a server, which is quite unique because usually servers are only started with Bash. The Python library which contains this server is the \u2018 http\u2019 library. From http, we can import server:", "http.server can also be invoked directly using the -m switch of the interpreter with a port argument.", "This is and will always be the easiest way to start up a development server. I use this all the time when sharing files between my computers or colleagues! Just be sure you have TCP forwarded for your desired port, and you can host for all the world to see! Unfortunately, although this server is easy to use, I would certainly not recommend to deploy anything official on a server like this. However, for debugging, file-sharing, or .PCK \u2014 reading with HTML5 or WebAssembly, it\u2019s absolutely perfect!", "I\u2019ve certainly spoke of Crontab before, and that is for good reason. Crontab is an amazingly simple, yet incredibly versatile tool that is typically used by Dev-Ops engineers to automate scripting tasks in the background according to a specific timestamp on the Unix system. These timestamps are stored in CRON time, which the reading of is something you\u2019ll need to get used to.", "Regardless of its overall unapproachability, I think Crontab is one tool that you simply shouldn\u2019t be living without. It is a quick and effective way to automate essentially anything incredibly easily. I use it all the time for large API pulls and endpoint updating running on the back-end. I\u2019ve also used Crontab to make self-training models that serialize with a script and then are read into an endpoint. Compared to the other way of automating your deployment back-end, Crontab certainly takes the crown for its ease-of-use and venerability. If you\u2019d like to learn how I have deployed a self-training model in under an hour using Crontab, NGINX, Julia, and Julia, I wrote an entire article on doing just that you can check out here! :", "Supervisor, or supervisord is another tool that is quite venerable and well-used in the Dev-Ops world. Supervisor allows a Unix system to execute Bash commands as any user without a real user present. In other words, you can create an artificial version of yourself in a terminal to \u2018 supervise\u2019 the applications that you don\u2019t want to manage yourself.", "Supervisor is an especially useful tool for deploying servers that you still want to monitor but don\u2019t want to have a headless unit running at all times. Using supervisor you can easily expand the reach of your server by allowing it to process a series of applications simultaneously with different privileges. So it\u2019s established that Supervisor is a great tool, but how do you use it?", "Like most Unix applications, especially those meant for servers, supervisor can easily be configured through a configuration file stored in /etc/conf.d. Of course, first you will need to actually install Supervisor:", "Next, you can edit the supervisor configuration with your text editor of choice. I personally like to use GNU Nano.", "Above we see a rather basic supervisor configuration file. The directory part of this configuration will determine what directory we need to run our command in. Next, the command is a Bash command which is typically used to run a script or start a server, in this case the wonderful Gunicorn3. Next we have autostart and autorestart which are both booleans and will determine whether or not the supervisor will start whenever the supervisor service is loaded. The supervisor service is loaded when a supervisor instance is started, reloaded, or if the server restarts for any reason. Next, stopasgroup and killasgroup will determine if the other application configurations in this configuration file will also be killed whenever this service is reloaded. Last, but not least we have the ability to add log files for both input and output, which is useful for debugging.", "Supervisor is an industry standard tool that every Data Scientist should get acquainted with. Not only is it nearly essential for deploying endpoints, but can serve as a great basis for a lot of things when done the Unix way. It is a highly versatile tool that I have really found having knowledge of useful. If you\u2019d like to see a full tutorial on deploying a Flask application with NGINX and Supervisor, lucky for you I have just the article:", "If you\u2019ve ever heard the expression", "\u201c Use the right tool for the job.\u201d", "this concept applies directly to using different Python Web-Frameworks. For instance, a framework like Django is packaged with pre-made tools like 0auth authentication and a ton of others. If you are end-pointing, it makes very little sense to create an entire Django application, rather than from Flask. If you\u2019d like to learn more about web-frameworks and what they are engineered to do, I have written an article containing 5 of my favorite web-frameworks that are both low-level and high-level as well.", "Whenever you create an endpoint, it\u2019s very important to take careful consideration of speed and bulk. There are many web-frameworks that come with dozens of different features, and there is a surprising amount to consider when creating an endpoint or a fullstack application. You certainly don\u2019t want to use something like Django for a simply endpoint. Although Flask could certainly be used for fullstack development, there are a lot of better options for doing so.", "Just because your job primarily involves deploying simple endpoints that return JSON data doesn\u2019t mean that learning how to do authentication and fullstack with Python won\u2019t be beneficial to you. There are hundreds if not thousands of problems that you could encounter, all with hundreds or not thousands of entirely different solutions. In some regard, while you might want to avoid \u2018 putting your carrots in different baskets,\u2019 you certainly don\u2019t want to avoid using deployment skills.", "If you know how to simply deploy a model on Heroku or a similar service, why not try deploying it on a Unix server by yourself? These different skills will certainly benefit you in both employment and personal development. All Data Scientists should know their way around a terminal, even if you can\u2019t deploy your own endpoints with NGINX and Supervisor, you could still be quite a better programmer by just being familiar with the Bash that facilitates such a thing.", "One of the great things about using Python is how many options you might have to solve one specific problem. Having several web-frameworks at your disposal is certainly beneficial, and can make your deployment and development jobs a lot easier. Learning how to use things like Crontab, and different web-frameworks like Tornado and Pyramid will certainly be incredibly beneficial towards your Data Science career.", "Your home for data science.
