The advantage of having a direct VIX exposure are obvious, but in reality VIX is not directly tradable.", "To illustrate the benefits of having exposure to VIX, consider the 2011 U.S. credit rating downgrade by Standard and Poor\u2019s. News of a negative outlook by S&P of the U.S. credit rating broke on April 18th, 2011. As displayed in Figure 1(a), a portfolio holding only the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) would go on to lose about 10% with a volatile trajectory for a few months past the official downgrade on August 5th, 2011.", "In contrast, a hypothetical portfolio with a mix of SPY (90%) and VIX (10%) would be stable through the downgrade and end up with a positive return. Figure 1(b) shows the same pair of portfolios over the year 2014.", "Both earned roughly the same 15% return though SPY alone was visibly more volatile than the portfolio with SPY and VIX. The large drawdowns (for example on October 15th, 2014) were met by rises in VIX, creating a stabilizing effect on the portfolio\u2019s value.", "This example motivates the investigation of trading strategies that directly track VIX and other indices, or achieve any pre-specified exposure with respect to an index or market factor.", "Instead, volatility exposure is achieved through the use of VIX futures or options, and a handful of exchange-traded funds/notes (ETF/Ns). VIX ETF/ETNs are known to fail to track VIX one-to-one and persistently bring negative returns.", "But what about holding VIX futures directly?", "At any point in time, there are a handful of contracts traded in the market, with maturities ranging from 1 to 10 months.", "Here\u2019s a first look at the different return dynamics of a single VIX futures contract vs VIX:", "In our paper, we discuss the price dynamics of VIX futures and the underlying index, and construct static and dynamic portfolios of VIX futures for the purpose of tracking the index. In addition to deriving and implementing the optimal tracking strategies, we examine the effectiveness of the tracking portfolios.", "We begin by analyzing the price dynamics of the VIX Futures with respect to spot VIX. The historical price data for VIX futures are obtained from Quandl. We have validated the Quandl data against that directly from the CBOE. For the spot VIX data as well as the related ETNs, we use Yahoo! Finance.", "After compiling, our dataset consists of the entire closing price history from March 26, 2004 (the 1st day VIX futures began trading) through January 27, 2017. However, we choose to analyze only the period from January 3, 2011 (1st trading date of 2011) through December 30, 2016, which is a 6-year period from 2011 to 2016.", "This amount of data is probably sufficient to avoid overfitting and recent enough to understand the dynamics among VIX, futures, and VXX. Of course, one can follow our procedure with more recent data.", "The entire sample period contains 1,510 total trading days of data. Moreover, on any given day of the sample set there are between 7 and 9 futures contracts available. In particular, there are 15 days with only 7 futures contracts available, 278 days with only 8 futures contracts available and 1,217 days with a full 9 months of contracts available.", "The futures contracts are always consecutive months (starting with the 1-month contract) over this time period. In other words, when there are N futures contracts available for trading, they always consist of the N front months.", "As an example, if the current trading date were sometime early in January (before the January futures expiry), and 7 futures contracts were available for trading, then the maturities of the futures contracts would be the months of January through July, consecutively. These features of the dataset are consistent with CBOE protocol. They state they will currently list up to 9 near-term months for trading. However, in our analysis, we eliminate the eighth and ninth month contract as it is not always the case that one can trade the eighth or ninth month contract.", "This allows us to use the full 1,510 days of data and avoid the need to eliminate the 15 + 278 = 293 days with only 7 or 8 futures for trading.", "We observe the high R\u00b2 values for all futures, suggesting that they are highly correlated with the spot. The futures with shorter maturities have higher R\u00b2 values. This can be explained by", "(i) the fact that futures prices tend to approach the spot price towards maturity,", "(ii) that long-dated contracts are less liquid than the short term contracts.", "The slope coefficients are all statistically significant and less than 1, which is intuitive as futures returns tend to be less volatile than spot returns. The negative intercepts, which are statistically significant, indicate that futures prices tend to fall even if the spot price does not move.", "The reason lies in the term structure of VIX futures, which is typically increasing in time-to-maturity. Even if the spot price does not move, the futures prices tend to decrease to match the spot price towards maturity, contributing to a negative intercept.", "As seen in the picture above, the typical case for the VIX market is an increasing and concave futures curve (left panel). However, in January 2016, VIX spiked as did expectations of future volatility. Spikes like this can cause the term structure of VIX futures to invert, yielding a decreasing and convex futures curve. In early 2009 (right panel) where futures prices are at very high levels and the term structure shows different shape properties.", "When we conduct regressions of futures returns against spot returns over longer holding periods, new patterns emerge. We use disjoint intervals of various lengths when we compute the returns, meaning that for the longer horizons we have fewer data points.", "We plot the regressions of 1-month futures returns versus VIX returns for both 1-day returns (left) and 10-day returns (right), plotted on the same x -y axis scale. The red x\u2019s mark pairs of returns, while the black line is the best t line. One observes that the 10-day returns are much larger and consequently more volatile than the 1-day returns.", "However, for both holding periods, the futures returns are less volatile than the corresponding spot returns. To be precise, we find that the 1-day returns of the spot vary between -26.96% and 50%, while for the 10-day returns they vary between -39.76% and 148.06% (i.e. the longer holding period has more volatile returns).", "In the plot above, the slope is slightly higher for the 10-day returns as compared to the 1-day returns. Moreover, for the 1-day returns the scatter plot is more tightly bound to the best fit line indicating a better fit than observed for the 10-day returns. However, this pattern does not hold in general. There is no discernible pattern in either the R\u00b2 or slope as the holding period is lengthened.", "This can be demonstrated by looking at a plot of R\u00b2 or slope vs. holding period. We omit such a plot here as there is no clear pattern of increasing or decreasing predictive power (as measured by R\u00b2) or leverage necessary to replicate the spot returns in the plot for any maturity contract. (Leverage can be measured by the reciprocal of the slope.)", "On the other hand, if we x the holding period and increase the maturity of the contract, we see a decrease in predictive power and a decrease in slope. (Thus, an increase in leverage necessary to replicate the spot.) We demonstrate this for a number of different holding periods (1, 5, 10 and 15 days) in Table 2.", "In the top half, we give the slope coefficients for the regressions of futures returns against spot returns and in the bottom half, we display the R\u00b2 values. By looking across the rows in either half, one notices a decrease in the reported statistic. This reaffirms our earlier observation that the spot is more closely tracked by short-term futures than long term futures.", "Indeed, over a 15-day period, the results indicate that about 1.6x leverage is required to track the spot with 1-month futures vs. 7.2x leverage for the 7-month futures. These implied leverage values are obtained by computing the reciprocals of the slopes (0.622, and 0.139, respectively). The leverage for the 7-month futures is quite substantial and is likely not be feasible in the marketplace due to trading costs or exchange limits.", "Next, we plot the intercepts for the regressions of returns of 1-month futures (black), 3-month futures (red) and 6-month futures (blue) across many different holding periods (from 1 day up to 30 days). It is quite clear that as the holding period is lengthened, the intercept becomes increasingly more negative.", "All intercepts (as well as the slopes from before) reported here are statistically significant at the 1% significance level. Thus, a statistically significant discrepancy exists and continues to worsen as holding period is lengthened.", "This confirms a property we have already discussed: VIX futures tend to underperform and lose money relative to the spot returns. The more negative intercept indicates that this underperformance worsens over longer horizons.", "T. Leung and B.
