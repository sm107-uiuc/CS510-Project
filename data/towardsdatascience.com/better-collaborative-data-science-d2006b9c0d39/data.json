This is my talk in blog format.", "In my keynote, I shared two things Kaggle\u2019s team has learned about what enables data scientists to collaborate more productively on projects. These two insights have shaped how our community has grown to become the world\u2019s largest online community of data scientists over the past eight years.", "First, in case you haven\u2019t heard of Kaggle, I\u2019ll provide you with a little bit of background. Today, over 2 million Kagglers come to the platform to do data science projects. They participate in machine learning competitions and publish and explore data on our Datasets platform. For both competitions and our datasets platform, users can analyze the data in R or Python and share their work with our free hosted notebook environment, Kernels.", "All of the competitions, open source code shared in Kernels, and public datasets have added up to insights into how data scientists work together to solve problems.", "With that quick introduction, I want to dive right into the two insights, beginning with access to socially validated knowledge.", "We learned early on that our community was highly motivated to share knowledge, even in a competitive setting, but sometimes discovering and improving information and ideas was difficult.", "When each competition on Kaggle ends, users share winning and innovative solutions on the forums; they\u2019ve published over 200 \u201chow I did it\u201d interviews on our blog; and sometimes even publish papers on novel approaches like using WaveNet for sales forecasting or some of the earliest work on diagnosing diabetic retinopathy using convolutional neural networks.", "Now there exists a tradition whenever a new competition launches: competitors immediately scour our website and the internet for bits of insight they can use to kickstart their work on this new challenge. While on the one hand it\u2019s fantastic that this content is out there, it\u2019s a challenge unto itself each time it needs to be accessed.", "Now, I want to contrast this with an example where access to knowledge was not only easy, but easy to build on. To do so, let\u2019s turn to the development of the XGBoost gradient boosting library.", "In its early days, the author Tianqi Chen seeded discussion on competition forums with instructions walking competitors through steps to install and try out his new package. From there, he responded to reports of unexpected behavior and crashes. He was even able to solicit feedback via surveys at the close of a competition. As a result, he made improvements and fixed bugs he knew were important to the library\u2019s users.", "Several years later and XGBoost is one of the winningest algorithms for doing machine learning on structured data thanks to a tight feedback loop with users in the community where knowledge accumulated and improved in quality.", "Returning to the example of the flood of knowledge that\u2019s generated with each competition. Today, we provide tools that help users discover content related to the problems they want to solve.", "For example, one of our users leveraged our public dataset about Kaggle, Meta Kaggle, to create the ultimate master list of all winning solutions organized by problem statement and characteristics using tags like multi-class classification. Now, whenever a competition on multi-class classification launches, for example, users have a one-stop-shop for referencing past work on similar problems.", "In a similar example, another Kaggler used tags and other metrics of popularity to create a data science glossary of all the top open source code shared in Kernels organized by techniques using tags. What an incredible resource to someone beginning a new data project!", "So what\u2019s the lesson our team has learned from examples like this? Our team firmly believes that no one beginning a data science project should start from a blinking cursor.", "This insight is especially critical for new data scientists. Whether that means someone just starting to learn or someone who\u2019s brand new to a team. It even applies when a new business or research question is being asked.", "Using centrally located and searchable knowledge organizable by relevance to the current problem, users should be able to start writing code and answering questions faster. We\u2019ve also learned that knowledge socially validated in our community like the XGBoost example or through availability of usage and popularity metrics is critical to identifying and iterating on good ideas.", "The second insight we\u2019ve learned about collaborative data science is the importance of making your work reproducible. Reproducibility is important not just for your teammates, but also your #1 collaborator: your future self.", "To illustrate the significance of reproducible data science, I\u2019m going to return to a competition which took place five years ago. In this example, a user, with the best of intentions, wanted to get more people involved in collaborating on the problem.", "In this forum post, however, we observe many of the stumbling blocks data scientists encountered when trying to share their work.", "All of these challenges, which we saw repeatedly on Kaggle\u2019s forums in the early days, meant that code, ideas, and results were extremely difficult to reproduce. This a gigantic obstacle to collaboration even when the will (or the necessity) is there.", "Our users\u2019 pain points around collaboration didn\u2019t go unnoticed by our team. We wanted to empower users to easily share their ideas and collaborate, so we built Kernels, our free hosted computational environment for notebooks and scripts. Things changed dramatically from here.", "To illustrate, I\u2019m showing here one of Fran\u00e7ois Chollet\u2019s tutorial kernels demonstrating how to use his at-the-time new library, Keras, to achieve a respectable score on a competition predicting West Nile Virus.", "Fran\u00e7ois Chollet\u2019s starter kernel is a massive contrast with code shared via pastebin five years because Kernels are versioned packages of code, data, and environment. This meant that about 60 users were able to fork his code to make and execute from their own copy.", "At this point I hope you\u2019re remembering an earlier statistic: there are 184,000 public, open source kernels on the platform as of August 2018 that anyone can fork, run, and modify. And all it takes now is the click of a button; no messy installation or data downloading required.", "The ease with which Kernels facilitated reproducibility also had a big impact on the trajectory of Keras\u2019s popularity on Kaggle. As recent as June, over 1500 Python kernels import Keras on Kaggle.", "Finally, it\u2019s not just about the tools and infrastructure. We\u2019ve also observed that Kaggle users adopt best practices for their data projects that tend to fall into these two categories:", "Templatization as a best practice for things like using common directory structure across projects, modularizing code and data, and creating and sharing libraries for code snippets commonly used across a team.", "And then documentation. In addition to documenting code, our users document their data on Kaggle. Top Kagglers that we\u2019ve interviewed also commonly report keeping close logs that include steps to reproduce results, especially if they don\u2019t use Kernels in competitions. They also use \u201clab style\u201d notes to keep track of ideas that they experiment with, hypotheses they test, and their results while iterating on their project. This means ideas and null results aren\u2019t relegated to the file drawer to collect dust, but can be learned from. Plus, they can make a good foundation for using a data project as a portfolio piece.", "So what are the insights we\u2019ve taken from these examples? More people will be able to interrogate, use, and extend good ideas in data science if those ideas are easy to reproduce.", "Reproducible data science projects package together versioned code, data, and environment. They also use best practices like templatization and documentation.", "To conclude, our team has learned that two of data scientists\u2019 biggest needs are access to socially validated knowledge and the ability to reproduce their and others\u2019 work.", "These insights and others have informed how we\u2019ve developed our Datasets and Kernels products to allow users to today collaborate on data projects beyond Competitions.", "If you would like to discover more insights about how data scientists collaborate, I encourage you to check out our public dataset about Kaggle, Meta Kaggle. There are plenty of community kernels to browse and fork from to start your own data project!", "Your home for data science.
