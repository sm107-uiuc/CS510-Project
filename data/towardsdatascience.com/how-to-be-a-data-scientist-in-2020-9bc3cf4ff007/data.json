A successful data scientist needs to be the head for business strategy, can make discoveries and vision through data, and can convince stakeholders through communication and visualization. However, the amount of data nowadays increase exponentially and it makes data science job more sophisticated. Every company starts to understand the importance of data and collect them as much as they can. Data size increases from a few gigabytes to several petabytes. Cloud storage and computing becomes more popular. End-user organizations are adopting cloud storage solutions as primary storage options. Therefore, a data scientist in 2020 needs to have the knowledge of big data and tools associated with it. In this blog, I will introduce the machine learning project life cycle from the AWS\u2019s point of view. After reading this, we will understand what it takes to become a 2020 data scientist.", "The most essential step in creating a machine learning project is detecting business problems. There are many cases where a data scientist got lost in data, wasting time to wrangle with big data, solving a very hard problem that does not significantly improve the business, or even finishing a project and feel like somebody has done it before. Every data science project needs to be planned carefully. Failing to plan is planning to fail. Understanding a business context and possible business action to takes will save a data scientist a lot of time and save your company a lot of money. This is important to attend the business meeting, chat with executive employees, and always put yourself in the stakeholders\u2019 perspective.", "After figuring out the problem, a data scientist needs to obtain data and organize it appropriately. Data gathering can be done internally or externally. Most of the structured data is stored in the relational database. Therefore, It is essential to learn SQL. SQL may be old but is ubiquitous. You can even see SQL in high-performance database systems from FAANG companies or in the non-technology industry.", "The machine learning algorithm on production needs to be tweaked frequently. Consequently, a data scientist needs to find an efficient way of processing high volumes of data and automated this process. Batch and real-time processing are two important concepts in this area. It helps delivers data input to the data warehouse either in a batch (daily update) or live-content. A function of a data science team is to monitor the developing model. Therefore, a data scientist who wants to work with streaming data needs to be familiar with big data tools such as Spark or Hadoop.", "When it comes to gathering data externally, one needs to constantly re-evaluate the relevance and credibility of the data set. There is no formula for determining the best data sources. This is more like the journey into the unknown and is the most interest part of the data science process. Below are a few examples from several projects that I have done to illustrate how fascinating data can lead us.", "Scenario 1: A non-profit company wants to understand how children learn to implement their online curriculum. Collecting data from game-based learning apps such as PBS Kids Measure Up! may be a good idea. Analyzing the player\u2019s linear learning path, their concentration on each subject, and their performance on different assessments can help to improve the teaching methodology.", "Scenario 2: An oil and gas client wants to understand how machine learning can help their oil and gas company. Detecting the US pipeline incident and show them how ML can prevent equipment failure will give the clients some incentive to invest in the project.", "It is also worth understanding how million data points are stored and how we can securely maintain them. Amazon S3 is the most popular cloud services at the moment. Amazon S3 stores the data at multiple locations to provide backup when an accident happens. Amazon S3 has the ability to customize different levels of access for security purposes. You can also control the log history, define alerts, and automate workflows without managing additional infrastructure. The best thing is Amazon S3 connected with many other state-of-the-art machine learning tools and highly comparable with other programming languages.", "How do we know if our strategy is effective? There are two metrics a data scientist needs to consider:", "When thinking about the metric, we often think about accuracy, MSE, F1, kappa cohen, \u2026 However, in this post, I will emphasize the metric that has more business involve. The cost-and-accuracy tradeoff. For example:", "In a binary classification problem, if we want to predict equipment failure, given that the cost of misclassifying a negative sample (Do not aware of fail equipment) is three times more than the cost of misclassifying a positive example (Sending technicians to check good-condition equipment), which model has the lowest cost with at least 60% recall?", "To answer this question, we need to use the confusion matrix and calculate what is the threshold for false positive and false negative. Understanding the cost of each false prediction through communication with domain experts plays an important role in leveraging machine learning.", "KPIs stands for key performance indicators. KPIs should be comprehensive for every business level and predefined before doing as the nascent stage of any project. Some KPIs may include: increasing customer satisfaction over 7/10 or reducing the cost of labors by 20%. Choosing the right KPIs relies upon a good understanding of what is important to the organization. There are many different KPIs, but the two KPIs that we need to know: Business Process (BP) KPIs and Data Science (DS) KPIs. The process of making metrics for a data science project usually starts with BP KPIs first and then translated to DS KPIs. For example, if the BP KPI is to reduce the complaint of spam email by half, then when translated to DS KPI, our goal is to have the false-negative rate at x%.", "Understanding an objective for a project is important for both the project manager and data scientist. A sign for an unsuccessful data science project is the problem is too broad, impossible to solve, does not help business, or takes to long to complete. There needs to be a standard procedure to determine success. One popular KPIs criterion is SMART. This model is widely used by many different industries", "You can also read about Agile methodology here which explains into more details about project management.", "This is the most \u201cdata science\u201d part of the process. There are two main steps that worth mention: data exploration and machine learning.", "Data exploration involves descriptive statistics, visualization, and answering the train of logical questions that occur while analyzing the data. A data scientist should not underestimate simplicity. Many business insight and discovery in this step, quite often, have more benefits than applying machine learning. Data exploration reveals hidden features and opens new ideas for feature engineering. An example of discovery is Walmart demand distribution in the holiday weeks:", "The data is normalized horizontally. The first 3 holidays share the same characteristic. Consumers spend a lot before Super Bowl, Mother\u2019s Day and Father\u2019s day. In contrast, consumers spend more after New Year and Halloween. And finally, there is no sale on Christmas\u2019 eve since all Walmart stores were closed.", "The next step is to choose the correct machine learning algorithm. Generally speaking, the algorithm that you choose need to satisfy the DS KPI and is interpretable.", "Choosing the right algorithm: It is not easy to train multiple algorithms on the big data locally. However, cloud computing makes this task quite easy. One leading tool for the task is SageMaker Auto Pilot from AWS. SageMaker Autopilot automatically inspects raw data, applies feature processors, picks the best set of algorithms, trains and tunes multiple models, tracks their performance, and then ranks the models based on performance, all with just a few clicks. A 2020 data scientist needs to adapt to new technology and SageMaker Autopilot is what you should put in your toolbox.", "Interpretability: After having a very complicated algorithm and high accuracy, the next step to impress the project managers by explaining to them your machine learning algorithms in human language. A data scientist needs to learn how to convince people who decide the life of their project. One way to understand what stakeholders want to see is to imagine what question that you would ask if you were them. Imagine that someone tells you to buy a house. What would they say to convince you? If the person can explain all of the factors such as the number of rooms, year built, location, distance to the nearest supermarket, \u2026 and tell you how these factors affect decision making, will it enough to convince you?. In making machine learning understandable, features importance is the key. Showing how a machine learning model assigns different weights to a feature would enable the audience to understand what happened behind the \u2018black box\u2019. There are three important elements which Parul Pandey has mentioned to bring transparency to an ML model:", "When the model meets the KPI criteria, a data scientist needs to bring it into production. This is necessary to always compare the ML model with the KPIs because various unforeseen factors can affect the outcome negatively. The model needs to be tuned periodically to adapt to the change in data characteristics. Sometimes, catastrophe (such as Coronavirus) may change the trend completely and you have to retrain the model and even repeat the whole process. AWS provides a service where we can monitor the performance and send you an alert when prediction metrics fall under a designated threshold.", "There are many topics in Data Science and a data scientist only needs to know a few for their job. However, the market is competitive and requires adaptability. Understanding the trend of technology and apply them is a good way to be accountable for your project and help you stand out in the crowd. In summary, there are three things I suggest to take a look at:", "Your home for data science.
