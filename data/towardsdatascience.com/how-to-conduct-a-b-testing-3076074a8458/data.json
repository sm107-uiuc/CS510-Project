The way that the software is currently set up, users can download and use the software free of charge, for a 7-day trial. The company wants to change the layout of the homepage to emphasise with a red logo instead of blue logo that there is a 7-day trial available for the company\u2019s software.", "Here is an example of hypothesis test: Default action: Approve blue logo.Alternative action: Approve red logo.Null hypothesis: Blue logo does not cause at least 10% more license purchase than red logo.Alternative hypothesis: Red logo does cause at least 10% more license purchase than blue logo.", "It\u2019s important to note that all other variables need to be held constant when performing an A/B test.", "We should consider two things: where and how we should split users into experiment groups when entering the website, and what metrics we will use to track the success or failure of the experimental manipulation. The choice of unit of diversion (the point at which we divide observations into groups) may affect what evaluation metrics we can use.", "The control, or \u2018A\u2019 group, will see the old homepage, while the experimental, or \u2018B\u2019 group, will see the new homepage that emphasises the 7-day trial.", "a) Event-based diversionb) Cookie-based diversion c) Account-based diversion", "An event-based diversion (like a pageview) can provide many observations to draw conclusions from, but if the condition changes on each pageview, then a visitor might get a different experience on each homepage visit. Event-based diversion is much better when the changes aren\u2019t as easily visible to users, to avoid disruption of experience.", "In addition, event-based diversion would let us know how many times the download page was accessed from each condition, but can\u2019t go any further in tracking how many actual downloads were generated from each condition.", "Account-based can be stable, but is not suitable in this case. Since visitors only register after getting to the download page, this is too late to introduce the new homepage to people who should be assigned to the experimental condition.", "So this leaves the consideration of cookie-based diversion, which feels like the right choice. Cookies also allow tracking of each visitor hitting each page. The downside of cookie based diversion, is that it get some inconsistency in counts if users enter the site via incognito window, different browsers, or cookies that expire or get deleted before they make a download. As a simplification, however, we\u2019ll assume that this kind of assignment dilution will be small, and ignore its potential effects.", "In terms of evaluation metrics, we should prefer using the download rate (# downloads / # cookies) and purchase rate (# licenses / # cookies) relative to the number of cookies as evaluation metrics.", "Product usage statistics like the average time the software was used in the trial period are potentially interesting features, but aren\u2019t directly related to our experiment. Certainly, these statistics might help us dig deeper into the reasons for observed effects after an experiment is complete. But in terms of experiment success, product usage shouldn\u2019t be considered as an evaluation metric.", "Once you determine your null and alternative hypothesis, the next step is to create your control and test (variant) group. There are two important concepts to consider in this step, sampling and sample size.", "SamplingRandom sampling is one most common sampling techniques. Each sample in a population has an equal chance of being chosen. Random sampling is important in hypothesis testing because it eliminates sampling bias, and it\u2019s important to eliminate bias because you want the results of your A/B test to be representative of the entire population rather than the sample itself.", "A problem of A/B tests is that if you haven\u2019t defined your target group properly or you\u2019re in the early stages of your product, you may not know a lot about your customers. If you\u2019re not sure who they are (try creating some user personas to get started!) then you might end up with misleading results. Important to understand which sampling method that suits your use case.", "Sample SizeIt\u2019s essential that you determine the minimum sample size for your A/B test prior to conducting it so that you can eliminate under coverage bias, bias from sampling too few observations.", "A calculator like this one can help you determine the length of time you need to get any real significance from your A/B tests.", "We will now walk you through an example. History data shows that there are about 3250 unique visitors per day. There are about 520 software downloads per day (a .16 rate) and about 65 licenses purchased each day (a .02 rate). In an ideal case, both the download rate and license purchase rate should increase with the new homepage; a statistically significant negative change should be a sign to not deploy the homepage change. However, if only one of our metrics shows a statistically significant positive change we should be happy enough to deploy the new homepage", "Use the link above for the test days calculations: Estimated existing conversion rate (%): 16% Minimum improvement in conversion rate you want to detect (%): 50/520*100 %Number of variations/combinations (including control): 2Average number of daily visitors: 3250Percent visitors included in test? 100% (3250)Total number of days to run the test: 6 days", "Estimated existing conversion rate (%): 2 % Minimum improvement in conversion rate you want to detect (%): 10/65*100 %Number of variations/combinations (including control): 2Average number of daily visitors: 3250Percent visitors included in test? 100% (3250)Total number of days to run the test: 21 days", "For an overall 5% Type I error rate with Bonferroni correction and 80% power, we should require 6 days to reliably detect a 50 download increase per day and 21 days to detect an increase of 10 license purchases per day. Performing both individual tests at a .05 error rate carries the risk of making too many Type I errors. As such, we\u2019ll apply the Bonferroni correction to run each test at a .025 error rate so as to protect against making too many errors.", "One thing that isn\u2019t accounted for in the base experiment length calculations is that there is going to be a delay between when users download the software and when they actually purchase a license. That is, when we start the experiment, there could be about seven days before a user account associated with a cookie actually comes back to make their purchase. Any purchases observed within the first week might not be attributable to either experimental condition. As a way of accounting for this, we\u2019ll run the experiment for about one week longer to allow those users who come in during the third week a chance to come back and be counted in the license purchases tally.", "As for biases, we don\u2019t expect users to come back to the homepage regularly. Downloading and license purchasing are actions we expect to only occur once per user, so there\u2019s no real \u2018return rate\u2019 to worry about. One possibility, however, is that if more people download the software under the new homepage, the expanded user base is qualitatively different from the people who came to the page under the original homepage. This might cause more homepage hits from people looking for the support pages on the site, causing the number of unique cookies under each condition to differ. If we do see something wrong or out of place in the invariant metric (number of cookies), then this might be an area to explore in further investigations.", "Once you conduct your experiment and collect your data, you want to determine if the difference between your control group and variant group is statistically significant. There are a few steps in determining this:", "Do not rely on simple 1 on 1 comparison metrics to dictate what works and does not work. \u201cVersion A yields a 20 percent conversion rate and Version B yields a 22 percent conversion rate, therefore we should switch to Version B!\u201d Please do not do this. Use actual confidence intervals, z-scores, and statistically significant data.", "Changing colours and layout may have a marginal impact on your key performance metrics. However, these results seem to be very short-lived. Product growth does not result from changing a button from red to blue, it comes from building a product that people want to use.", "Instead of choosing feature that you think might work, you can use an A/B test to know what works.", "Despite the fact that statistical significance wasn\u2019t obtained for the number of licenses purchased, the new homepage appeared to have a strong effect on the number of downloads made. Based on our goals, this seems enough to suggest replacing the old homepage with the new homepage. Establishing whether there was a significant increase in the number of license purchases, either through the rate or the increase in the number of homepage visits, will need to wait for further experiments or data collection.", "One inference we might like to make is that the new homepage attracted new users who would not normally try out the program, but that these new users didn\u2019t convert to purchases at the same rate as the existing user base. This is a nice story to tell, but we can\u2019t actually say that with the data as given. In order to make this inference, we would need more detailed information about individual visitors that isn\u2019t available. However, if the software did have the capability of reporting usage statistics, that might be a way of seeing if certain profiles are more likely to purchase a license. This might then open additional ideas for improving revenue.", "Your home for data science.
