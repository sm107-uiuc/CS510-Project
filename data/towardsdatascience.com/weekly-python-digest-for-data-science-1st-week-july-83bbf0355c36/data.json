It implements an end-to-end neural network model that inputs a scene graph and outputs an image. A scene graph is a structured representation of a visual scene where nodes represent objects in the scene and edges represent relationships between objects.", "The input scene graph is processed with a graph convolution network which passes information along edges to compute embedding vectors for all objects. These vectors are used to predict bounding boxes and segmentation masks for all objects, which are combined to form a coarse scene layout. The layout is passed to a cascaded refinement network which generates an output image at increasing spatial scales. The model is trained adversarially against a pair of discriminator networks which ensure that output images look realistic.", "The original code was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 with Python 3.5 and PyTorch 0.4. I tested in my Mac with no issues :)", "I recommend you try this in a virtual environment.

There are many implementations of sorts in the Python standard library that are much better for performance reasons.", "For example you\u2019ll find Machine Learning codes, Neural Networks, Dynamic Programming, Sorts, Hashes and much more.
