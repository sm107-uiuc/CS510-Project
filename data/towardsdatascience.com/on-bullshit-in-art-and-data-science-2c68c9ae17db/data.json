Providing abstract paintings with titles makes them appearing as profound. And with AI-generated titles, they evoke so-called \u201cpseudo-profound bullshit\u201d, especially in those cases when the artist (=curator of own AI-generated artwork) tries to gain \u201csocial advantages\u201d. They are fooling around with innocent viewers, who trustfully hopes, everything was intended:", "Randomly generated pseudo-profound bullshit titles increased the perceived profoundness of computer-generated abstract art, compared to when no titles were present (BSS).", "The study doesn\u2019t only aim to raise awareness against art fraud (low-cost AI-art production for high valuation at the art market), but also scrutinizes the accountability of abstract artists as such:", "Some abstract artists have embraced a radically subjective view toward art, that is to say there is no possible objective standard for beauty or meaning. These artists maintain a goal to impress a sense of depth or beauty, while going further than merely not being concerned about truth, but instead denying that any objective truth could possibly exist (BSS).", "If the world of abstract art does in fact represent an ideal environment for bullshit to be deployed as an effective lowcost strategy for gaining prestige, then one would expect the presence of bullshit to be widespread in this domain.(BSS).", "Therefore, there are several goals this study follows:", "In my opinion, the study walks the thin ice between ignorance of art theory and pseudo-psychological strategies.", "Let\u2019s analyze the study into four aspects.", "Every psychological research needs human statistics. They should be accountable and reliable. If we look at the probands of this study (there are several studies within a paper), we will see some interesting details:", "The study evaluates real abstract artworks (MoMA as source) and AI-Generated images, combined with AI-generated (\u201cpseudo-profound bullshit\u201d) and human-created (\u201cmundane\u201d) titles.", "AI-Generated titles tend for metaphysical ideas (\u201cThe Pathological Interior\u201d), mundane titles are rather visual descriptions of artwork (\u201cColour Mixing\u201d).", "The emphasis of the examination is on the fact whether abstract uncomprehended art is received by probands differently, if with given titles (\u201cAI-generated\u201d vs \u201cmundane\u201d). The setup of this research is surprisingly anti-academic (lack of intertextuality, just referring to subjective reception instead).", "The present study (BSS) tries to use the argumentation of alleged deception by titles for the incrimination of abstract artists.", "There is the continuous concretization of social advantages, significance, and art value \u2014 all components belonging to the Art Market Sector. With no word is the possibility mentioned, that an artist might express himself by his artwork without any intentions for monetarization.", "The Distinguishing, even the juxtaposition between Artwork (as individual artists expression) and Art Market (as artwork monetarization platforms) is not only remarkable, it is inevitable in the light of critical discourses of XXst century about the abrogation of authority in art.", "The main anticonventional Art Disruptors were Dadaists, Surrealists, and Abstractionists \u2014 precisely the target group of exposure in the present study.", "Ironically, if a subjective view of beholders is handled with appreciate respect in this study, the subjective motives of artists are not.", "Plain said, the study wants to prove that giving a title to abstract painting is a Pseudo-Profound Bullshit (especially if all components are AI-generated) \u2014 with further skepticism about the relevance of abstract art as such.", "Let\u2019s look at some artworks and titles of the exposed groups.", "\u201cLe Tombeau des Lutteurs\u201d (\u201cThe Tomb of the Wrestlers\u201d)\u2014 what a pseudo-profound BS title! At first glance. In this title, Magritte quoted a novel by the French Symbolist L\u00e9on-Alpinien Cladel \u201cOmpadrailles, le tombeau des lutteurs\u201d (1879). Behind this caption is \u2014 as always in case of Magritte \u2014 a sophisticated cultural and sociopolitical story, based on letter exchange with New Yorker Lawer and Poet Harry Torczyner about Soviet \u2018tachiste\u2019 painters, about European situation of the 1960ies, etc\u2026", "Magritte was a master of weird titles \u2014 with the exception that the \u201cweirdness\u201d was only \u201cweird\u201d for non-informed viewers.

When he exiled from Nazi Germany to Norway, he kept building Merz-Baus everywhere he lived, without any hope (and also intention) to make this work famous, to monetarize it, or to gain any social advantage. He did it just because he couldn\u2019t stop creating. It was his life.", "The title \u201cCathedral of Erotic Misery\u201d is highly narrative: about his meanderings, about cultural discourses of his time, about political collapses of pre-WWII, about his personal situation. This title was abolished and renamed to Merz-Bau as Schwitters\u2019 \u0152uvre was presented by Nazis in their sarcastic Exhibition \u201cEntartete Kunst\u201d (Degenerate Art Exhibition, 1937). The main task of the exhibition was to juxtapose abstractionists and Avant-Gardists with their (for fellow citizens incomprehensible and quasi-profound) narratives and visuals versus \u201cpure\u201d and politically approved and useful Realism and Commissioned Art by Nazi Regime.", "Limits of Reason (\u201cGrenzen des Verstandes\u201d). Now, this is a perfect pseudo-profound Bullshit, isn\u2019t it?", "No, it is not. In this abstract work, Paul Klee explored in an ironic way the philosophy of Bauhaus. Initially, Klee worked as a lecturer for Bauhaus, but its raising focus on technologic tendencies and utility-fixated rationalism made Paul Klee skeptical about this art school and movement. In this abstract painting, the artist expresses the pathetic idolization of pragmatism by Bauhaus.", "As you see, behind these \u2014 for the first glance, \u201cpseudo-profound\u201d titles \u2014 is always a colossal narrative, which will be fully comprehensible only by viewers who is aware of the background. Here emotional art becomes an intellectual one.", "\u201cWell\u201d, you will say, \u201cbut what about all those dazzlers and copycats, who are generating Art with StyleGAN and other GANs, and applying random metaphysical titles using title generators like this or this. And then sell it on Sotheby\u2019s for big money? Is it Pseudo-profound Bullshit?\u201d", "Well, yes, but only if you don\u2019t buy it (intended pun).", "Because AI-generated content creates new narratives. New genre.
