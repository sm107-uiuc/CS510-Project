Storytelling with Bubbles | by Dar\u00edo Weitz | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Bubble Charts, Why & How", "description": "Why: bubble charts are used to determine if at least three numerical variables are related or share some kind of pattern.

Under special circumstances, they could be used to show trends over time or to compare categorical variables. They are considered a natural extension of the scatter plot where the dots are replaced with bubbles or disks.", "How: a bubble or disk is drawn for each observation of a pair of numerical variables (A, B) positioning, in a Cartesian coordinate system, the disk horizontally according to the value of variable A and vertically according to variable B. A third numerical variable \u00a9 is represented by means of the area of the bubble. You can even incorporate a fourth dataset (D: numerical or categorical) using different colors in different bubbles.", "The story is narrated from the shape that these data points generate as well as from the differences in the relative sizes of the bubbles or discs. There must be appropriate legends for the dissimilar categories represented by the colors and some type of scale that allows us to infer the numerical value indicated by the size of the bubble.", "The graph above shows a direct (positive) relationship between variable A and variable B. The disk indicated in the position (60, 225) is clearly an outlier. Legends for the categorical variable and the scale to infer the numerical value of the third variable are located outside the chart by means of the keyword bbox_to_anchor. With this keyword you obtain a great degree of control for manual legend placement; I strongly recommend placing it at the upper right location (Marplotlib.org, #1).", "Just like scatter plots, three important features of the dataset can be found in a bubble chart: 1.- Outliers, piece of data that are very different from all the others in the dataset and do not seem to fit the same pattern. These anomalous values might represent valuable information to analyze; 2.- Gaps, an interval that contains no data. The visualization of gaps between data justifies an in-depth analysis that explains their presence; 3.- Clusters, isolated groups of data bubbles which can also merit a particular analysis of the reason for their presence in the graph. Previously, it must be verified that the existence of outliers, gaps, or clusters are not due to errors in the data collection methodology.", "The following bubble chart describes the Prevalence of stunting against Access to basic sanitation services across regions in the world. Research shows that poor sanitation contributes to childhood stunting and that the brains of stunted children have fewer neuronal connections than children who are not stunted. As technology is replacing routine jobs, demand is rising for advanced cognitive skills and greater adaptability, even in developing countries. But, stunted children will be at a disadvantage concerning the skills demanded by the future labor market. The prevalence of yellow bubbles in the upper left of the chart indicates that the Sub-Saharan Africa region makes up a clear cluster of countries where millions of children are growing up without future basic life skills. As the size of the disks corresponds to the region\u2019s population, the chart also shows the urgent need to bring safe sanitation to millions of children in South Asia (The World Bank, 2018, #2).", "The most famous bubble charts belong to Hans Rosling\u2019s TED Talks. Rosling (1948\u20132017) was a Swedish physician and statistician, and Professor of International Health at Karolinska Institute. In his TED Talks, he turned immense datasets into visual stories about the world, the economy, and the future of humanity. I highly recommend seeing his first video of 2006: \u201cThe Best Stats You\u2019ve Ever Seen\u201d (#3) and \u201cThe River of Myths\u201d of 2013 (#4).", "** Bubble charts are appropriate when we want to show relationships between three or four variables but not their exact values. For example, in business you can make investment decisions by visualizing in a bubble plot relationships in dimensions such as cost, value, and risk between different business alternatives.", "!! You should always verify that the addition of the third or fourth variable improves the storytelling. If not, try switching to a simpler alternative representation such as a scatter plot.", "!! The main disadvantage of a bubble chart lies in the fact that the comparison between the numerical variables is noticeably difficult because we indicate them with two different types of scales: position and size. The human brain easily recognizes positions but areas are harder to compare.", "!! Always keep in mind that the area of a disc is not proportional to its radius, but to the square of it.", "** It\u2019s not mandatory to start the Cartesian plane x-y at (0,0). You must choose the origin of your coordinate system according to the best story your data can tell (See Fig. 4).", "!! Unlike scatter plots, bubble charts do not improve with the increase in the number of data points. Instead, each piece of information forces the audience to calculate the size of the corresponding bubble, and this becomes even more complicated if we add color to display some categorical variable. Although we can easily grasp the differences in bubble size, not everyone immediately relates that the disk area is proportional to the square of its radius.", "!! They should not be used for the representation of zero or negative values since there are no negative or zero areas. If such representation is essential, it is suggested to use full circles for positive and empty circles for negative values. Always analyze alternatives before arriving at this representation, just like positive values in one color and negative values in a very different color (blue against red such as the following figure). Another alternative is to locate the variable with negative values \u200b\u200bon one of the coordinate axes. Always remember that careless use of negative values with bubbles charts might confuse the audience. For example, a circle for 100 and a circle for -100 will both be the same size.", "** An increase in the number of bubbles may result in congestion and overlapping. In such cases, translucent alternatives provided by the visualization tool should be used. Of course, there is a degree of overlapping above which audiences may become confused, in particular with charts that have large numbers of bubbles or tight clusters of bubbles. At that point it is recommended to use a simpler visualization alternative.", "** To show trends over time with bubble charts you have to put time as a variable in the horizontal axis. An alternative is to use some kind of animation as Hans Rosling did in his TED Talks (#3 & #4).", "!! The need to display the whole graph in a \u201clogical\u201d size does not allow a good comparison of the size differences in the disks. As a result, small differences between them are not easy to visualize.", "Storytelling with Bubbles: quality of a white wine", "Worldwide, 250 million hectolitres of wine were produced in 2017. Spain is the world leader in wine sales, with 22.8 million hectolitres in 2018 (Spanish Wine Market Observatory, 2019). Spain is closely followed by Italy (21.4 million), France (15.4), and, at a greater distance, Chile (9.8) and Australia (8). However, in terms of per capita intake, Portugal is the world\u2019s leading country. The Portuguese, with their more than 51 liters per person per year, consume twice as much as the Spanish.", "Wine is a particular case within the food and beverage sector, as expert opinion, especially that of the so-called gurus, has a major influence on the wine market by generating prototypes or quality models among consumers. The perception of the quality of the wine is linked to the characteristics of the product. The organoleptic properties of the wine (aroma, taste, color, flavor, or tactile sensations) are evaluated by judges, experts, or wine professionals as a single multi-dimensional attribute on a scale with \u201clow quality\u201d and \u201chigh quality\u201d anchors at the left and right ends.", "Since regular wine consumers lack the knowledge and experience of gurus and professionals, it is important to be able to establish quantitative parameters that will help the consumer when making decisions regarding the purchase of a bottle of wine.", "An interesting Kaggle Competition was related to wine quality exploration and analysis of red and white variants of the Portuguese \u201cVinho Verde\u201d wine.", "Data is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality and includes eleven chemical and physical properties of 1500 white wines and 1500 red wines. The purpose of the project was to evaluate which of the following chemical or physical properties influence the quality of the wines: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulfates, and alcohol. The set of wines was evaluated by three experts who provided quality scores between 0 (Bad) and 10 (Excellent) for each wine.", "At the end of the study, there was not clear what differentiates a low-quality wine from a medium quality one, just subtle differences in high-quality wines according to some chemical properties. An important limitation was the absence of a significant number of low-quality wines in the dataset. In conclusion, it was clear that the quality of a given wine is the result of a complicated combination of various chemical properties.", "Nevertheless, we decided to recover the file and use some data visualization techniques to provide some knowledge about such a complex subject. Taking into account that quality was the fundamental attribute of our object under study, after many trials and a lot of charts, we arrived at the following bubble chart:", "Alcohol, represented on the horizontal axis, refers to the alcoholic grade of the wine. This parameter is determined by many factors: the variety of the grape, the time of harvest, and the fermentation processes that take place afterward, as well as, the subsequent treatments.", "The grape contains about two hundred grams of sugars per liter of must and is a mixture of glucose and fructose. When fermented, the sugar largely disappears, leaving what winemakers call residual sugars. The residual sugar content of wines is normally the result of interrupted fermentation (in which the yeast dies or is unable to consume the remaining sugar). Wine bottle labels usually indicate the amount of residual sugar.", "The wine industry uses sulfur dioxide for its antioxidant and antimicrobial properties and to prevent color changes, especially in white wines. The use of sulfur dioxide has become a controversial issue due to the gradual documentation of adverse reactions in consumers, who may have mild allergies to the presence of sulfur dioxide (therefore, the indication of its use on the label has become part of some wine regulations).", "The bubble chart displayed in Fig. 4 clearly indicates that high-quality Portuguese \u201cVinho Verde\u201d wines (indicated by green and blue discs) have an alcohol grade between 12 and 14 % and a residual sugar level lower than 15 g/l. The graph also shows that sulfur dioxide levels (indicated by the disc areas) do not play a relevant role in the quality of the final product.", "So, the next time you buy a bottle of wine try to record the alcohol content, the amount of residual sugar, and the level of free sulfur dioxide. Although it is not an easy task, quantify by means of a numerical scale the quality of the wine. In this way you will get to know the chemical parameters that best suit your palate.
