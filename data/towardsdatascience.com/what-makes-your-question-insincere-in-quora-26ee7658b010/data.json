Sneeze and headache are portrayed as contributing to the flu prediction, while no fatigue is evidence against it. With these explanations, a doctor can make an informed decision about whether to trust the model\u2019s prediction.", "Explaining a prediction is presenting textual or visual artifacts that provide qualitative understanding of the relationship between the instance\u2019s components (e.g. words in text, patches in an image) and the model\u2019s prediction [1].", "LIME is a local surrogate model, which means that it is a trained model used to approximate the predictions of the underlying black-box model. But, it comes with the idea to generate variations of the data into the machine learning model and tests what happens to the predictions, using this perturbated data as a training set instead of using the original training data.", "In other words, LIME generates a new dataset consisting of permuted samples and the corresponding predictions of the black-box model. On this new dataset, LIME then trains an interpretable model (e.g., Lasso, decision tree, \u2026), which is weighted by the proximity of the sampled instances to the instance of interest.", "The dataset of the Quora Insincere Questions Classification task could be downloaded from this link. The training data includes the question that was asked, and whether it was identified as insincere.", "Let us look at two questions of this dataset and the corresponding classes (1 for insincere, 0 for sincere question):", "The preprocessing step consists of splitting the data to train and validation sets, then to vectorizing the questions to tf-idf vectors.", "The black box model is a logistic regression model having as input the tf-idf vectors.", "It is time now to apply LimeTextExplainer function to generate local explanations for predictions. The function needs as parameters the question to explain (of index 130609), the predicted label of the question generated from the black box model (the logistic regression), and the number of features used for explanation.", "The result of the above code is the following:", "The classifier got this example right (it predicted insincere).The explanation is presented below as a list of weighted features using the following instruction:", "These weighted features are a linear model, which approximates the behavior of the logistic regression classifier in the vicinity of the test example. Roughly, if we remove \u2018stupid\u2019 and \u2018earth\u2019 from the question, the prediction should move towards the opposite class (Sincere) by about 0.48 (the sum of the weights for both features). Let\u2019s see if this is the case.", "As expected, the class is now sincere after removing the words, \u2018earth\u2019, and \u2018stupid\u2019 from the instance vocabulary.", "The results can be shown in LIME in different types of visualization.", "Notice that for each class, the words on the right side on the line are positive, and the words on the left side are negative. Thus, \u2018stupid\u2019 is positive for insincere, but negative for sincere.", "You can also get a bar plot of the explanations using the code below:", "LIME is able to explain the predictions of any type of classifier (SVM, neural nets, \u2026) locally. In this post, I applied it to the Quora questions dataset to explain what makes a question insincere in Quora, but it can also be integrated into images and structured data classifiers. You can access to more codes and examples following this link.", "If you have a question, feel free to comment below or ask it via email or Linkedin.
