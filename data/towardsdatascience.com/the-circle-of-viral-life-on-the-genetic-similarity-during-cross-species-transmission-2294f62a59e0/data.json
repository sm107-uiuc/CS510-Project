This is due to the fact that their inner structure is sophisticatedly geared towards generating new mutations as they spread to living creatures (hosts) in a plethora of different pathways: airborne, waterborne, bird migration, feces, and so forth. Inspiringly, the essence of evolution is revealed when mutations in the genetics of viruses provide them with the ability to become sophisticated as they adjust their survival skills over the years. I learned that viruses are not just a bunch of molecules, but actually a unique type of particle named virology, that can only be truly understood within a multidisciplinary context of biology, physics, geography, and even climatology and economics (think of how much power viruses have that they can cause general lockdowns).", "Viral transition is the path the virus achieves among different host species. Animal to human viral transmission is called zoonosis. Zoonotic diseases can be transmitted in any context in which there is contact with or consumption of animals, animal products, or animal derivatives. The following modes may give you a clue: food and water, farming, ranching, husbandry, pets, hunting, live animal market, etc. And these are only a small glance at what is actually going on \u2026", "Within the framework of this research I focused on four viruses of two families: Coronaviridae (MERS and SARS-CoV-2 viruses) and Orthomyxoviridae (influenza A: H1N1 and H3N2 viruses), and discovered the next topics as the best match to the questions that I dealt with:", "Before diving into arithmetics (which is the easy part \u2026), I would like to share my personal concern: I am concerned about us as a nation and our reaction to medical emergency situations caused by worldwide epidemics. Why does the public still suffer from epidemics like the on-going SARS-CoV-2 even though it is not a \u201cbrand new\u201d virus (just a mutation of the previous virus in the coronavirus family)? Is it because we have yet to find a way of preventing transmission? Let me remind you of the following previous epidemic events. A prominent epidemic occurred in 1918 when influenza A was endemic in Homo sapiens (the first case was discovered in 1902 in Gallus). Viruses of the coronavirus family are \u201cold\u201d as well, first being collected from avians in 1941, pigs in 1952, and more recently in Homo sapiens in 2003 (in China). This virus is well known as SARS (and is still active). A similar virus structure was collected in 2008 in Saudia Arabia, known as MERS, which involved the presence of the illness in a large number of camels. More details regarding the geographical locations and host species of the viral genetic sequences are demonstrated in the graphs section below.", "On the one hand, it seems that humanity in the 21st Century has developed technology in every imaginable field to meet almost every challenge: from metal tools to landing on the moon and artificial intelligence. At times it feels as if human ingenuity has no bounds. Yet, on the other hand, we remain reliant on conservative, even extreme methods such as general closures and enforcing the wearing of stuffy masks (has anyone thought of developing a mask with which one can breathe freely ?\u2026). Bottom line, these \u201coff the shelf\u201d solutions are not adequate and in my opinion ridiculous. It means that we were not prepared, despite all the clear red signals and signs.", "In these most difficult times, teams of scientists from varying backgrounds have gathered to \u201cfight back\u201d and \u201csave the world\u201d by developing solutions such as vaccines, medications and large scale data science projects estimating the \u201ctrack\u201d of the epidemic. However, I am doubtful that these heroes have everyone\u2019s lives in mind. When saying \u201ceveryone\u201d I am also referring to nonhuman animals such as camels, pigs, avians and all the living creatures that we as humans keep, tend to, and breed for our own needs (food, clothing, labor, entertainment, and so on). It is my personal desire that all animals should be free. Until then, we should at least learn how to avoid transmission of viruses between their kind and our kind.", "Is the genetic \u201cmechanism\u201d of all living creatures in the aggregate acting as ONE viral system? What are the invariants between hosts in terms of the recreation of the virus structure and the generation of proteins? All of these questions have led me to explore the genetic similarity between multiple host species.", "It turns out that this article is not about a new machine learning technique, but a unique research and perspective. Nevertheless, I assume you have some basic knowledge of neural networks, dimensionality reduction, big data analytics and biology. If the biological part is not clear to you, I recommend reading the literature review section in my blog: Studying the Genetics of COVID-19, and if you are not familiar with neural networks on genetic data, visiting my blog: Bridging the Gap Between Genetics and Neural Networks would be a good start for you.", "In order to perform a large scale machine learning experiment, I gathered the publicly available data of viruses consisting of as much diversity of host species as possible in the National Center for Biotechnology Information NCBI (if you are not familiar with NCBI, read my blog: Hacking the Genetics of Viruses).", "Before performing any calculations on the data, I selected a few informative details about the viruses. I plotted the epidemic scale and proportions without any data manipulation according to the additional sections that are gathered jointly with each genetic sample. The plots present each virus\u2019s geographical location and host species prevalence, normalized and multiplied by 100. As can be seen, Homo sapiens is the first to be diagnosed in all viruses except for the H1N1 virus which was first collected from pigs. Bats are the second to be diagnosed in the coronavirus family. Camels were the most affected species suffered from MERS virus in 2016, while viverrids got first place in 2006, and European minks equalized the amount of Homo sapiens diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 in 2020. As for the geographical locations, H3N2 was first collected in Asia and second in South Africa while H1N1 was involved in all the examined locations in 2009. The fifth graph is focused on Asia in order to distinguish between the locations in which the viruses were first isolated. Notice that the contribution of avians and pigs to humanity in terms of herd immunity as being suffered from influenza A is well demonstrated for either virus.", "Categories that have been extracted and examined by geographic locations and hosts are shown in the tables below:", "How can we prove that a genetic sequence is similar in different host species? I first ran a naive experiment in which I classified genetic sequences of different virus families. After further consideration, I realized that comparing sequences regardless of their lengths is misleading. This may be the reason why sequence alignment is normally the first stage in bioinformatics, before doing any sequence comparison. However, I wanted to examine the performance of neural networks without aligning the sequences (maybe one of the reasons why this experiment is unique) while using about the same sequences lengths (with an epsilon of about +/- 10% and zero-padding the missing data with zeros to complete a full-size matrix). To fit these constraints, I chose to classify two viruses of the same family in each experiment (to perform a binary classification) consisting of as much diversity of host species as possible. The next table summarizes the available protein sequences in NCBI for some host species. Notice that the average length is calculated on different types of proteins. However, in my experiment, I gathered the same types of proteins for every sample. In order to maintain the same level of host diversity in every experiment, I filtered out samples of hosts when their amount in a group exceeded the allowed value.", "Back to theory. The virus generates proteins in the host, but how can proteins of different species be arranged in order to be compared? By re-engineering proteins. Actually, I find this part very exciting because one can create a sequence of proteins which does not exist in nature. The term \u201cre-engineering proteins\u201d represents the process of generating a long sequence of concatenated proteins, a chain. Each chain of proteins is a sample of input dataset, labeled by the virus (for the supervised learning). A chain is analogous to a DNA sequence, but with proteins. Specifically, for the coronavirus, I chose to compare the common proteins named: spike, envelope, membrane, nucleocapsid, ORF1ab and ORF1a polyprotein while for influenza A I chose to compare polymerases, nucleocapsid, neuraminidase, hemagglutinin, matrix and nuclear export.", "The next code snippet shows how to generate protein chains. The code simply \u201csews\u201d in a repetitive order each type of protein per sample. Thus protein chains are aligned in the same order in each sample. According to the maximum chain length of all the samples, all the other samples are zero-padded at their edge (ends).", "In my experiment, these are the maximum and minimum re-engineered sequence lengths. Notice that the same proteins are involved in each sample because of comparable reasons that are discussed above.", "The architecture is quite simple. Two fully connected layers are followed by a softmax layer. A detailed explanation regarding the network can be found in my blog (the model that I use here is the improved model). The way I split the data is the challenging part and stems from the main question that I tried to solve within the framework of this post, which is: the similarity between hosts \u2014 human in comparison with nonhuman. Since each sample is labeled with the virus index, the human and non-human samples need to be split into different categories, such that the test data reveals the similarity that the model has learned. If the model achieves high accuracy \u2014 there is a high similarity between the hosts: human and non-human samples.", "Back to the mathematical definitions: Sn is in the training set if its proteins are taken from a nonhuman species. Otherwise (human), Sn is in the testing set.", "These were the main technical details of the methods I applied. The rest of this post presents the results and conclusions.", "For each virus family, two experiments were tested on sequences of type DNA or proteins. The accuracies of each experiment are shown in the next table. When considering DNA samples the model achieves 98.4% accuracy for influenza A, 92.2% for coronavirus, and when dealing with proteins almost 100% accuracy is achieved for either virus. Notice that I examined two sizes of test data sets. The results show that greater performance is achieved with more samples, perhaps because the diversity in the data is higher in that case.", "The training and validation losses can be seen in the following figures. The behavior is correct, not overfitting nor underfitting, it means that during a training session the validation loss is lower than the training loss. Another observation on this behalf is the learning rate behavior in the coronavirus proteins experiment (lower right) in which a low number of epochs is required to generalize the data (after about 250 epochs the validation stops decreasing and achieves its maximum accuracy).", "The conclusions I think worth mentioning in this framework are first in the technical aspect: the high accuracy that has been achieved means that the DNA and proteins sequence-variance between host species is similar up to 8% misclassified error. In addition, the use of alignment tools is unnecessary if using neural networks and approximately the same sequence lengths (which holds true within most viral families). This is great news, since in many cases \u201cless is more\u201d. Second, the transmission factors are explored in this research and emphasize the need for caution and sanitation when (and if) we handle nonhuman animals. The high densities and poor sanitary conditions which are commonplace in animal agriculture may need to be reconsidered. Moreover, unnecessary contact like using animals for entertainment purposes such as camels wrestling (widely spread in Arab culture) and \u201ceducational\u201d purposes like petting zoos (there is nothing educational about showing the public how to force a living creature to live in a cage without freedom).", "Transforming the way we interact with nonhuman animals may hold substantial moral and environmental benefits, besides the transmission of viral diseases as discussed in this post.", "In any event, my recommendations for further research would be to study how the consumption of products from animals diagnosed with coronavirus may affect the human body, for instance: unpasteurized milk or raw meat. Another question that may arise is how to re-engineer the way we treat farm animals, and re-examine how animals are kept and treated in cowsheds, pig pens, or hen houses.", "As I discussed above, at first I classified virus families in comparison to each other. This experiment was a key factor that led me to understand the significance of the sequence length while proceeding with a genetic classification test. Training sequences from different virus families may mislead the network into reaching different conclusions and the entire research can be missed. My lesson from this experiment is to focus on your research question by finding comparable data, and then testing your model. However, the results achieved high accuracy (misleading \u2026) and can be seen in the loss function below.", "The next table presents additional coronavirus host species and their sequence information. Notice the species diversity: an epidemic can affect almost all species. However, in my experiment I preferred not to use the sequences of those species because their sequence amount is not enough to perform a large scale experiment.", "Genetic samples can be collected in a variety of methods, for instance, the common ones for coronavirus are by feces and oronasopharynx (the upper part of the throat behind the nose). The next table presents the number of samples for each host, classified by the diagnostic tests. Notice that swab tests are commonly used among humans, probably because it is a more expensive test (swabs are not reused).", "The world has become a better place thanks to technology. Happiness is shared nowadays among more people than ever \u2014 it is about time to let other species experience happiness or at least something similar to it, as well. As a Buddhist prayer says: \u201cMay all sentient beings be free of suffering and its causes\u2019\u2019.", "Your home for data science.
