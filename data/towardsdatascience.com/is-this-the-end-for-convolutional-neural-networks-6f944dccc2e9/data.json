However, a new method is being proposed which harnesses the power of transformers to make sense out of images. Transformers were initially designed for natural language processing tasks with primary focus on neural machine translation. The paper, An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale by Alexey Dosovitskiy, Lucas Beyer et. al. from Google Research, proposes an architecture called Vision Transformer (ViT) to process image data using transformers. In this article, I will try to explain how it works.", "Before we dive into the method proposed for vision transformers, it is imperative to analyse the drawbacks and fundamental flaws in convolutional neural networks. For starters, CNNs fail to encode relative spatial information. What we mean by this is that it\u2019s concerned with detecting certain features and does not consider their positioning with respect to each other.", "In the above image, both of them will be classified as a face because a CNN only looks whether certain features are present in the input image and doesn\u2019t care about their arrangement with respect to each other.", "Another major flaw in CNN is that of pooling layers. Pooling layers lose a lot of valuable information such as the precise location of most active feature detector. In other words, it fails to convey the exact location of the detected feature in the image.", "Transformers in essence, use the concept of self-attention. Let\u2019s break it down into two parts, self and attention. Attention is nothing but trainable weights that model the importance of each part of an input sentence. If suppose a sentence is input, it will look at each word of the sentence and compare its position in the sentence with respect to the position of all the words present in the same sentence (including itself) hence the term self-attention. A score is calculated based on these positional clues which is then used to encode the semantics or meaning of the sentence in a better way.", "In the above example we can see that the attention unit in the transformer is comparing the position of the word \u2018it\u2019 to every other word in the sentence including itself. The different colours represent the multiple attention units working independently and simultaneously to find different patterns of these connections. Once a score is calculated by using the above comparisons, they are sent through simple feed forward neuron layers with some normalizations in the end. During training, these attention vectors are learnt.", "If you want a more in-depth explanation of self attention and transformers, be sure to checkout Jay Alammar\u2019s excellent blogpost The Illustrated Transformer or you can also checkout the original paper Attention Is All You Need by Ashish Vaswani et. al.", "Just as regular transformers use words to learn about sentences, Vision transformer uses pixels to achieve a similar result for images. However, there is a catch. In contrast to words, individual pixels do not convey any meaning by themselves which was one of the reasons we shifted to convolutional filters that operated upon group of pixels. Therefore, they divide the whole image into small patches or words. All the patches are flattened using a linear projection matrix and are fed into the transformer along with their positions in the image as seen in the figure above. In their implementation they went for patches of size 16x16 hence the poetic title of their research.", "Now, these embedded patches go through alternating layers of multiheaded self-attention, multi layer perceptron (simple feed forward neural network) and layer normalizations like in a regular transformer. A classification head is attached at the end of the transformer encoder to predict the final classes. Like any other convolutional model, one can use the pre-trained encoder base and attach a custom MLP layer for fine-tuning the model to suit their classification task.", "The authors trained this model on various standard datasets like ImageNet, CIFAR-10/100 and the JFT-300M which is a private dataset owned by Google having a collection of 300 million high-res images. Their model had approximately the same accuracy (even slightly higher in many cases) as compared to other state of the art convolutional models but at a significantly reduced training time (decreased by around 75%) and using fewer hardware resources.", "Another advantage of ViT is that it is able to learn about higher level relationships very early on as it uses global attention instead of local. Even at the very beginning, you can already pay attention to things that are very far away as opposed to a convolutional neural network.", "Apart from being efficient during training, it continues to get better and better as the training data is increased.", "So does this mean that CNNs are outdated and ViT is the new normal? Certainly not! While CNN has its share of disadvantages, it is still very much effective for tasks like object detection and image classification. ResNet and EfficientNet models which are state of the art convolutional architectures still reign supreme for such tasks. However, transformers have been a breakthrough in natural language processing tasks such as language translation and show quite a promise in the field of computer vision. Only time will tell what\u2019s in store for us in this ever evolving field of research.", "Thanks for reading this article and if you like it, don\u2019t forget to give a clap and leave your comments down below if you have any suggestions.
