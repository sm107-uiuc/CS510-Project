The patterns were clear: characters occupying more dense positions were more likely to die, those in sparser positions more likely to survive. In the Lands of Ice and Fire, information and resource access and control based on betweenness appears to trump the trust, loyalty, and cooperation associated with clustering. The \u201cskewed few\u201d \u2014high degree characters who gain influence by virtue of their potential control of information and resource flows across the network\u200a\u2014\u200awere also more likely to be alive at the end of Season 7.", "In this episode of Season 7.5, we turn our attention to a more detailed modeling of how characters\u2019 survival is affected by their positions in the co-appearance network. We\u2019ll use two machine learning classifier algorithms\u2014Na\u00efve Bayes and Decision Trees\u200a\u2014\u200ato predict the most likely outcome\u200a\u2014\u200adead or alive\u200a\u2014\u200afor each main (regular and recurring) character based on key features of their network positions (clustering, betweenness, and degree), as well as their gender and House status (great, minor, common). Then, we\u2019ll apply the predictions to assess the likely fates of key surviving characters in Season 8.", "The Na\u00efve Bayes is a simple algorithm that works as a probabilistic classifier. It predicts the most likely outcome \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 for each character by determining the probability that the character\u2019s attributes are associated with being dead or alive, and assigning the character to the outcome that has the largest probability given their attributes. The Bayes Classifier performs well, correctly classifying the fates of 114 of the 140 (82.4%) characters through Seasons 1\u20137 based on their gender, House status, and network position.", "Let\u2019s begin simply, by considering the most likely outcomes for male and female characters, and also for characters who are members of Great Houses and those who are members of Minor Houses or commoners.", "Figure 1 shows the predictions based on gender and house: males from Great Houses are the most likely to be killed.", "Male characters are over-represented among the dead, accounting for 77% of all deaths, but 70% of survivors, and so roughly 10% more likely to be dead than alive. Women, by comparison are under-represented among the dead, accounting for 23% of deaths and 30% of survivors, and so about 30% less likely to be dead than alive.", "Characters who are members of Great Houses are also over-represented, accounting for 44% of all deaths but 36% of survivors, and so roughly 20% more likely to be dead than alive. In contrast, members of Minor Houses and commoners account for a larger share of survivors (64%) than deaths (56%), and so and are about 15% less likely to be dead than alive.", "Given these distributions, the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier predicts the most likely outcome for male members of a Great House is being killed and for females who are not members of a Great House is being alive.", "Now lets see the probabilities based on key attributes of characters\u2019 network positions \u2014 their clustering, betweenness, and degree.", "Clustering. Reinforcing the graphical analysis in Episode 3, Figure 2 indicates that clustering isn\u2019t good for you. In the Figure, wherever the blue line (density of killed) is above the red line (density of alive), the Na\u00efve Bayes algorithm predicts that the most likely outcome is being dead.", "Characters whose average clustering coefficient is greater than roughly .7 (i.e., 70% of their triads are closed, see Episode 2) are more likely to be killed, while those with lower clustering coefficients are more likely to be alive. Note that the differentials are quite high, with characters with very high clustering being more than twice as likely to be killed, while those with low clustering three or more times as likely to be alive.", "The association of clustering with characters' fates suggests that, by increasing clustering, the collapse the small world structure and folding of the network into a single clique at the end of Season 7 as a result of alliances built to face the White Walkers (See Episode 2) likely lowered the survival chances for many characters.", "Betweeness. Figure 3 shows the classifications for betweenness. Again reinforcing the graphical analysis from Episode 3, betweenness is good for you. Characters whose average betweenness is greater than roughly .02 are more likely to be alive, while those with lower betweenness scores are more likely to be killed. Indeed, characters with betweeness below .02 are more than twice as likely to be killed, while characters with higher betweenness are up to 10 times more likely to be alive.", "In the same way that the collapse of the small world at the end of Season 7 increased many characters\u2019 clustering, this network transition also lowered their betweenness. Given the association of betweenness with the probability of a character being killed, the convergence of alliances likely reduced many characters\u2019 survival chances\u00a0through\u00a0its\u00a0impact\u00a0on betweeneness\u00a0as\u00a0well\u00a0as\u00a0clustering.", "Degree. Finally, let\u2019s look at the classifications for degree. Like betweenness, and again reinforcing the graphical analysis from Episode 3, degree is good for you. Characters whose average degree is greater than about 12 are more likely to be alive, while those with lower degree are more likely to be killed. Characters with degree above 12 are up to 10 or more times as likely to be alive, while characters with lower degree 2\u20133 times more likely to be killed.", "This association between a character\u2019s degree and the probability of the character being killed or alive reinforces the survival advantage of the \u201cskewed few\u201d we saw in the graphical analysis from Episode 3.", "The Decision Tree classifier constructs a hierarchy of splitting rules that separate outcomes \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 based on values of the character attributes. The splitting rules are determined based on maximizing information gain. At each stage the splitting rule selected is the one results in the largest information gain; that is, the most homogeneous branches.", "Figure 5 shows the Decision Tree based on characters\u2019 gender, House status, and the three network position attributes.", "At the top of the tree, the first splitting rule is whether a character\u2019s average degree is greater or less than 29.05. If greater the most likely outcome is being alive (which, in this case, is the only outcome \u2014 the bars on the terminal nodes indicate the distribution of alive (red)/killed (blue) outcomes as well as, by their thickness, the number of outcomes). If below (or equal to) this value, the most likely outcome is more complicated.", "The second split is whether average clustering is greater or less than .495. If below (or equal to) this value, the most likely outcome depends on a further splitting rule: alive if average degree is greater than 10.85; killed if it is below (or equal to) this value. Again, higher degree is associated with being alive. If clustering is greater than .495, the most likely outcome depends on whether betweenness is greater or less than .042.", "If greater than this the most likely outcome is being killed \u2014 high betweenness is not beneficial when accompanied by high clustering. If betweenness is below (or equal to) .042, the most likely outcome depends on a further rule regarding clustering. If clustering is very high (>.679), the most likely outcome is being killed. And, as can be seen by the thickness of bar on the terminal node, this is the set of conditions under which most killing occurred.", "If clustering is between less than (or equal to) .679 (and from the second rule, also greater than .495), gender comes into play, with the most likely outcome for female characters being alive, and for male characters to depend further on degree, House status, and betweenness.", "Now, let\u2019s use some of these results to make some predictions \u2014 what are the most likely outcomes \u2014 dead or alive \u2014 for the surviving main characters?", "The Na\u00efve Bayes classifier assumes that the value of a particular attribute is independent of the value of each other attribute, but we can add the probabilities for each attribute to obtain a joint conditional probability for different combinations the attributes.", "Table 1 shows these probabilities \u2014 of being killed \u2014 for 18 prominent characters. The probabilities were computed in three ways. First, based on network position characteristics averaged over all episodes in which a character appeared during Seasons 1\u20137, second based on averages over all episodes in Season 7, and third based on the network position in the final episode of Season 7. The three probabilities thus enable us to see any trends in the characters\u2019 most likely fates.", "Several characters have consistently low probabilities of being killed; Jon Snow and Tyrion Lannister, for example. With high confidence, the Bayes model predicts their survival (and so, Jon Snow\u2019s resurrection). Others show increasing or decreasing trends over the time frames. For example, Samwell Tarly whose demise is predicted with increasing confidence, and Daenerys Targaryen, whose survival, in contrast, becomes increasingly certain.", "For several characters, the Bayes classifier predicts the most likely outcome over Seasons 1\u20137 is being killed, but having beat those odds, their prospects at the end of Season 7 have improved. For example, the killing of Yara Greyjoy is predicted with confidence\u200a\u2014\u200aand she nearly is\u200a\u2014\u200abut her shifting network position at the end of Season 7 has improved her future prospects greatly. Tormund Giantsbane\u2019s fortunes have been similarly reversed \u2026 should it turn out that he did indeed survive the collapse of the Wall.", "The Lannisters\u2019 fates, show a different trajectory. While Cersei and Jaime\u2019s survival is predicted with confidence, their fates become much murkier by the end of Season 7, with Jaime\u2019s fate effectively a coin toss. Lord Varys\u2019 prospects are equally uncertain, and the fates of Arya and Sansa Stark and Theon Greyjoy shift similarly to Cersei\u2019s.", "Clearly the effect of collapse of the small-world network at the end of Season 7 (see Episode 2) has altered the network positions of the characters in different ways and, as a result, taken their likely fates in different directions. Indeed, by raising clustering and lowering betweeness, this network transition lowered the survival chances of many characters \u2014 although for most, not sufficiently to overturn their predicted fates \u2026 yet.", "The final episode prediction is that Bronn and Samwell Tarly are most likely to be killed\u200a\u2014\u200aand with very high confidence for Samwell. And, additionally, as already noted, that the fates of Jamie Lannister and Lord Varys are highly uncertain. Cersei Lannister and the Stark sisters, meanwhile, would be well advised to assess their network positions carefully\u200a\u2014\u200aand alter them strategically in order to regain their confident predictions.", "In the next episode, we\u2019ll turn our attention to strategic moves the main characters might make in order to seal their own \u2014 and each others\u2019 \u2014 fates.", "New to Season 7.5?
