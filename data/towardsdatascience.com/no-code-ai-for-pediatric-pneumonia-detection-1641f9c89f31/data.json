The WHO reports that most cases of childhood clinical pneumonia occur in regions such as Southeast Asia and Subsaharan Africa.", "Although a majority of deaths attributed to pneumonia in children occur in developing nations, there are still significant healthcare-associated costs related to pneumonia in children living in developed countries.", "Bacterial and viral pathogens are the leading causes of pneumonia (Mcluckie, 2009), but require very different forms of management. Bacterial pneumonia requires urgent referral and immediate treatment using antibiotics, while viral pneumonia is treated with supportive care. Therefore, an accurate and timely diagnosis is of utmost importance. One key method of diagnosis is using radiographic data, since chest X-rays are routinely obtained to identify the cause of these symptoms and can help differentiate between different types of pneumonia. However, rapid radiologic interpretation of images is not always available, in particular in the low-resource settings where childhood pneumonia is most prevalent and has the highest rates of mortality.", "In this article, we create and deploy an AI model to automatically identify pneumonia from chest X-rays images with an accuracy of 98.89%. Everything is developed without writing a single line of code and without needing expert supervision. If the system is given hundreds of unseen images, it will take less than a second to analyse them.", "The web app that we deployed and that can be used to classify unseen images is available here: https://cloud.giotto.ai/ic/pneumonia", "There are multiple methods used to detect childhood pneumonia other than X-rays and blood tests, but they often lack the same accuracy and reliability, or are simply too advanced for this type of disease. These include:", "In countries with relatively poor medical infrastructure, the diagnosis often relies on very basic methods such as respiratory rate (a high breathing rate would often be flagged as a potential sign of pneumonia), or visual signs in the chest cavity while breathing (their lower chest may draw in or retract when they inhale \u2014 in a healthy person, the chest expands during inhalation).", "These methods are often used as a result of lack of a strong medical infrastructure in the region, and lack the efficiency and accuracy of X-rays or blood tests.", "Even where infrastructure is available, medical experts are not always readily available to provide accurate assessments in a timely manner, which is where the presence of an automated system would come in handy.", "The beauty of AI is that it can learn from experts in the field, enabling the spread of technology to communities that may not have access to these professionals or complex tech systems, thus improving the diagnosis and treatment of diseases, and ultimately saving countless lives.", "We aimed to create and deploy an AI image classification model that is capable of identifying pneumonia cases from X-rays with a high level of accuracy in a timely manner. The system needs to be trained on images which have been previously labeled by trained medical professionals, but can afterwards be used to classify new images by anybody with internet access.", "For our task we used the no-code AI platform Giotto, accessible here. Giotto aims to provide state-of-the-art AI technology on an easy-to-use platform accessible to all, without coding skills required. On top of that, the web-app deployment function allows users to share their models with everybody.", "With no-code AI platforms such as Giotto, anybody with an internet connection is a few clicks away from accessing the most performant deep learning infrastructures and GPUs computing systems, and use them for their own purposes.", "If you want to go through a step-by-step tutorial on how to get started on Giotto, you can have a look at our previous blog post, where we explore the platform using an image classification model on a large dataset containing a variety of flowers species.", "For this task, we used data sourced from a study entitled \u2018\u2019Identifying Medical Diagnoses and Treatable Diseases by Image-Based Deep Learning\u2019\u2019 (Kermany et al., 2018)", "In this paper, the team uses transfer learning models to create generalized, high-impact application in biomedical imagery. This dataset consisted of 5'853 humanly labeled images of chest X-rays, split into two classes: normal and characterized as depicting pneumonia. The data can be accessed over here.", "In order to train our model, we uploaded the previously labeled images in two folders, normal and depicting pneumonia. The flow on Giotto is very intuitive and doesn\u2019t require any supervision. After uploading your data, you will be asked to select data augmentation techniques. In the model selection phase, you choose the resNet size and the number of epochs you wish to train it with.", "If you\u2019re unsure at any step along the way, you can always use the \u2018\u2019Automate selection with Giotto\u2019\u2019 option.", "Clinical decision support algorithms for medical imaging often faces scrutiny. The idea of letting a machine dictate the diagnosis of a potentially life threatening disease still leaves many with doubts over its reliability and interpretability. Which is why it is important for us to achieve a level of accuracy that is at least equal, if not better, than that of a medical professional.", "Once fed through our machine learning model, we were able to achieve an accuracy of 98.89% over our test dataset, using a resnet 34 and as little as 15 epochs. By looking at the confusion matrix, we also observe specificity, sensitivity and precision all above 98%. This result would be similar to a team of highly trained radiologists with years of experience in radiographic interpretation. And it only required 30min to teach our machine the minute differences required to differentiate between two sets of lungs.", "Given the complex nature of chest X-ray imagery (namely the relatively large amounts of variable objects, including the large area outside the lungs that are irrelevant in the detection of pneumonia), combined with the impressive accuracy achieved by our model, this suggests that similar models will be able to learn from increasingly complicated images using relatively small datasets, with a high degree of generalization.", "This transfer learning framework presents an interesting opportunity for further exploration and analysis in biomedical imagery, using an intuitive model that can be both easily trained and deployed by people all around the world, regardless of their background and level of expertise in the field. Giotto could therefore be used to differentiate between different forms of pneumonia using similar datasets of X-ray imagery, but could also find further applications for other chest-based respiratory problems, or even different and more complex medical imagery applications.", "Facilitating access to rapid and accurate diagnosis of medical imagery using AI platforms could help to reduce the impact of diseases in both developed and developing nations. It could not only help reduce the financial burden of identifying the illness, but it could also help save countless lives by reducing the time needed in diagnosing the disease, therefore ensuring a more rapid administration of life-saving treatments.", "Reducing the costs associated with human labour, such as trained radiologists and other medical professionals, may also allow governments and NGOs to invest more heavily in medical infrastructure such as X-ray machinery to combat the disease.", "Over time, we can predict a reduction in the cost and an improvement in the deployability of such technology. Combining this with the benefits of a platform like Giotto may indeed have a real positive impact on millions of people around the world.", "Your home for data science.
