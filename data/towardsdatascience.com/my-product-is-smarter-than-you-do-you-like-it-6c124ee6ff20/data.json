I discussed the impact and benefits of each and how it affects your product and the experience of your customers.In this post I would like to discuss another challenge faced by product managers when building AI-based products.", "Control. We all like to have control, yes we are control freaks. We like to have control of our life, control of our resources, control of our time, control of our health\u2026 you get the idea. No one really likes surprises, and by surprises I mean unwanted surprises. $20 million dollars lottery ticket is still a welcome surprise (for most of us).", "Products, and especially good products, provide value by solving a problem or creating an opportunity. They are perceived good because they also give you the control you are looking for. For example, time management products try to give you control of your time, project management products give you control of your resources and the project progress (and thus help you achieve your goals and meet your deadlines). Giving your 8 years old child a smartphone provide you control of their whereabouts.", "Building an AI-based product, a predictive model, can be very promising, but usually the algorithm behind it is a black box. It takes huge amount of data, tries to find correlations and similar behavior to predict what is going to happen next. However, the model usually gives you only the end result, the prediction. So no matter how accurate it is, and sometimes even \u201ctoo\u201d accurate, the users that consume the result of it, don\u2019t understand the rational and what led to that decision. The result may often be that they don\u2019t trust it. Even if they do trust the results, they have a problem to relate to it. From my experience, it is because the control has been taken away from them.", "Machines do become smarter and smarter. They analyze text and speech, they can respond to you, they can make decisions and even complicated ones, but we, the people, the humans, the users \u2014 must still feel involved and in some control of the situation, otherwise it we don\u2019t trust it.", "This is actually not new. 50 years ago people felt weird when machines and robots were too realistic. Masahiro Mori, a Japanese robotics professor, identified this phenomenon in 1970 and called it the \u201cUncanny Valley\u201d \u2014 this is a common unsettling feeling people experience when humanoid robots closely resemble humans but are not quite convincingly realistic.", "Let\u2019s examine some real world products and what do people feel about them:", "Why do people like certain products? Value, of course. But value is not achieved without feeling connected to the product, feeling you understand it and that the product understands you. Personalization is a key factor for a product to know you and answer your specific needs. That way you feel much more emotionally connected but also in control.", "Can they?!Few months ago, the OpenAI project released a long post about their text analysis model called GPT-2. GPT-2 generates synthetic text samples in response to the model being primed with an arbitrary input. The model adapts to the style and content of the conditioning text. This allows the user to generate realistic and coherent continuations about a topic of their choosing. In the post they refer to the bad implications that such technology can be used for, but I want to discuss the psychological aspect of it:", "Another experimental project from lately is the creation of a song for the 64th Eurovision song contest. The song was generated by a machine which composed it based on the best songs written during the years for the competition. Is this how our future going to be like? Lyrics and melodies will be generated by machines? No artist will have to go a heartbreaking separation to write the best love song ever again? How can we even relate to a song that was written by bits and not by blood?", "Let them choose. The need for choosing is required for perceiving control. To choose, is to express a preference. A choice, even the smallest, reinforces the perception of control and self-efficacy.", "The need for control is biologically motivated. Animals and humans demonstrate a preference for choice over non-choice, even when that choice affords no improvement in outcome reward. Although in economic terms this may be considered irrational, exercising control could be rewarding and therefore become rational for maximizing utility.", "I see the need for choosing with my two years old child. Usually when I hand him a sandwich he immediately rejects it. Then, I take the sandwich and cut it in the middle to two identical halves. Now I hold both pieces and ask him to choose which one he wants. Happily he chooses one over the other and eats it. When he finishes he usually eats the second half as well. The outcome for me was the same (he ate the sandwich), for him it was choosing and perceiving control.", "So how do we give back the control? Do\u2019s and Don\u2019ts:", "Let your users believe in the result. Let them feel in control.", "Thanks much for reading!
