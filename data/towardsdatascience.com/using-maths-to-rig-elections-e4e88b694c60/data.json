But for argument\u2019s sake\u2026", "Imagine for a moment that you were not-so-morally upstanding of a person and that you were tasked with making up a set of numbers. You need to doctor these figures in such a way that they represent a favourable outcome, while also not attracting suspicion from anyone that might happen to look at them.", "You decide to pick them randomly \u2014 or even better \u2014 to use a random number generator to remove any kind of unconscious bias that you might accidentally bring in. Snickering with unscrupulous glee, you replace the offending results with more appropriate ones. After destroying the evidence you go to bed that night, safe in the knowledge that there\u2019s no possible way for you to get caught.", "Unfortunately, I may have some news for you.", "Our crooked conspirator above was right in thinking that their randomly selected numbers will be uniformly distributed, in that each outcome is equally likely, and hence patternless. However, they made a mistake: populations, street addresses, the figures appearing in the Financial Times, number of leaves on trees \u2014 any natural population of numbers \u2014 also obey a less intuitive rule that takes more work to fake.", "To illustrate, let\u2019s take the populations of the countries of the world, which range from a few thousand to over a billion. Now, let\u2019s slice the leading digit off of all these numbers. Like so:", "Here\u2019s the important question: how do you think these leading digits will be distributed?", "It might seem logical to think that no digit will occur more commonly than any of the others. Given that there are 9 possible digits, each one should come up about one-ninth of the time, right? Let\u2019s see if this prediction is borne out in practice:", "Now, that\u2019s a bit of a surprise \u2014 the seemingly intuitive conclusion of equal likelihood is, in fact, completely wrong! And this pattern isn\u2019t just observed in populations of people \u2014 you\u2019ll find it in house prices, lengths of rivers, heights of buildings\u2026", "This phenomenon is called Benford\u2019s Law and is to be found in any population that:", "Phone numbers are constrained to start with certain digits (area codes) violating the first point above. The number of washing machines in households does not tend to take a wide range of values, violating the second (sorry if I offend any collectors). The result is that these populations would not necessarily exhibit this behaviour.", "To help you build a bit of an intuition for why this happens, let\u2019s take an example. Consider a uniformly distributed population \u2014 the numbers from 1 to a certain upper limit \u2014 and observe how the probability that a randomly selected number begins with a certain digit varies as the population size is increased.", "At the very left, the population is simply {1}, so the probability of picking a number with a leading digit of 1 is 100%. As the population grows in size, the probability of obtaining a leading digit of 1 decreases \u2014 until it reaches one-ninth, about 0.11, when the population size is 9 and there is one of each digit.", "But then we start counting into the tens \u2014 and obtaining a leading 1 begins to become more likely again! The probability decreases as before as we count up to 99, where each leading digit is equally likely again \u2014 and then the pattern repeats.", "We can observe that when the population size is 9, 99, 999, and so on, each leading digit is indeed equally likely. But for all other population sizes, you\u2019re more likely to get a 1 than any other number. Neat!", "Going back to our example of the populations of the world\u2019s countries, there\u2019s no pattern in the numbers \u2014 some countries are big, like India, and some are small, like Tuvalu. The population of a typical country will be somewhere between 0 and the population of the largest country (China, with 1.4 billion inhabitants) \u2014 and taking the population of a random country will basically like picking a number randomly from 1 to 1,400,000,000. If our graph above extended along to 1.4 billion, we would find that the probability of a leading 1 is 36.5%! In this range, there are more leading 1\u2019s than 2\u2019s, more leading 2\u2019s than 3\u2019s, and so on. This is why we discover the peculiar pattern in the first graph of this article.", "If we plotted a similar curve to the one above for all the different leading digits, we would get something like this:", "We can see that as we go up the leading digits, we have a lower and lower chance of picking it. Poor number 9 has a one-ninth chance at best, while number 1 has a one-ninth chance at worst!", "So what does this have to do with rigging elections again? The reason all of this matters in the real world is that unless they are very carefully prepared, fabricated numbers don\u2019t tend to obey Benford\u2019s Law \u2014 they don\u2019t show this frequency pattern in their leading digits. This gives us a tool to detect figures that have been faked in an attempt to deceive people.. Here\u2019s a few examples:", "It is worth mentioning that Benford\u2019s rule alone is not sufficient to prove whether a set of figures have been faked \u2014 like any statistical analysis, it can only tell us that they are unlikely to be genuine. Despite this caveat, what appears at first to be an amusing and harmless mathematical rule turns out to be a powerful and useful tool for identifying and preventing criminal and fraudulent practices.", "And if you\u2019re reading this from a jail cell because you got caught out telling porky pies in your tax return by a particularly numerically-inclined detective \u2014 better luck next time.", "Andrew Hetherington is an actuary-in-training and data enthusiast based in London, UK.", "Images: Big Ben photo by Daniel H.
