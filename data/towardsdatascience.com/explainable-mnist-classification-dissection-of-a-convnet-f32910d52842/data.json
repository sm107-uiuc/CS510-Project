As a simple example, I wanted to understand how a ConvNet trained on MNIST classifies images of digits and inspired by the trained ConvNet, to build a ConvNet by hand (without training) based on much simpler BBs which would imitate the BBs of the original ConvNet but they would be more constrained and thus hopefully more explainable.", "I started by dissecting a ConvNet trained on MNIST (which I will call SimpleConvNet) where I found that one of the convolutional layers can be omitted altogether because it just replicates the outputs of the previous convolutional layer. I also found the duality of the BBs, i.e. BBs are used both to detect patterns and detect the location of those patterns. After understanding the BBs of SimpleConvNet, I started building a ConvNet by hand (which I will call HandNet) consisting of more constrained (thus easier to tweak than using backprop) BBs. I found that the handmade ConvNet performs much worse but after fine-tuning, its accuracy becomes on par with SimpleConvNet. The advantage of HandNet over SimpleConvNet is that it\u2019s much easier to understand and explain its inner workings.", "In this article, I will explain the dissection of SimpleConvNet in detail.

The convolution will be said to have Cin inner channels and Cout outer channels.", "I will use 1-based indexing throughout this article because it makes the diagrams easier to follow.", "I started by training a ConvNet with a fairly simple architecture shown below.", "I was mainly interested in dissecting the convolutional layers because the fully connected layers are pretty straightforward since they just implement the linear combination. Looking at convolutions, we see that conv2 weights (with shape [64, 32, 5, 5]) for example, will consist of 64x32=2048 grids of size 5x5. This is a fairly large number of grids to label manually, so I decided to reduce the size of the network.", "I iteratively pruned outer channels (see Terminology section for the explanation of outer channels) of conv. layers based on the criteria described below:", "*** I pruned the entire outer channel and not just some inner channels because removing only some inner channels within a given outer channel makes the convolution operation irregular and kind of ugly \ud83d\ude2c.", "After each iteration of pruning, the accuracy of the ConvNet dropped slightly, but retraining the network quickly brought back the accuracy before the pruning, suggesting many weights are useless. The pruning removes useless weights which is essentially noise and it brings the essence of classification closer to the surface. The hope is that there should be just a small number of pathways that are used for classification, the rest is noise.", "Final architecture (after 7 iterations of pruning) is shown below. As you can see, the depth of each layer has been significantly decreased.", "We have 3 conv layers, followed by flattening, followed by 2 fully connected (fc) layers.

However, the difference between them is that the second filter detects the left side of the vertical line, and the third filter detects the right side.

Now, we can\u2019t just look at the weights of conv2 because that would require visualizing 16*8=128 filters of size 5x5 which is a little too much. Besides, a conv2 outer channel (see Terminology section for the definition of the outer channel) is not as simple as just a convolution of a filter with an image (which was the case for conv1), instead, it\u2019s a linear combination of such convolutions (because unlike conv1, conv2 inner channels is not equal to one) which makes it harder to visualize conv2\u2019s mechanism by just looking at the 128 filters. So, for now, we will skip visualizing the weights directly. Instead, let\u2019s start with visualizing the superstimuli (see Feature Visualization for the definition of superstimuli) for each of conv2\u2019s outer channels (there are 16 of them).", "The superstimuli can give a hint of what each outer channel of conv2 is trying to detect.

Actually, if you carefully look at the weight of conv1_4 (shown below), it has a very vague hint that it\u2019s detecting lines with slope 135\u00b0 (highlighted in the figure below). I call these types of patterns secondary functions of conv. filters. I will mostly omit these by concentrating only on the primary ones because they are usually stronger than the secondary ones. But we always have to keep in mind that there might be secondary, or even more patterns that a conv. filter detects).", "We are halfway through conv2_3.

The relative magnitude of a_8 is by far the strongest so it ends up dominating over other contributions to y. And y ends up looking a lot like a_8. y and a_8 will be even more similar after ReLU and MaxPool are applied to conv2. All negative values will disappear after ReLU, so we won\u2019t see the dark spots in y.", "What have we found from dissecting conv2_3? Two things:", "conv2_3 is just one example. We could dissect other outer channels of conv2 on different inputs and you can do so in the Colab notebook. What I found after dissecting quite a few of them is that these 2 findings hold mostly true across other conv2 outer channels as well. For example, see dissections in the Colab of conv2_6 and conv2_9 which detect horizontal lines; and conv2_13 which detects vertical lines.", "What can we conclude about conv2 in general? Based on the 2 findings, there is only one strong contribution from inner channels and that contribution imitates one of the outputs of conv1 (since the inner channel replicates its input). This means conv2\u2019s outer channels\u2019 function most of the time is just to amplify one of the conv1 outputs \u2014 conv2\u2019s total output ends up being just a bunch of amplified conv1 outputs.", "Could we have omitted conv2 entirely? I think yes because conv2 does not add anything new on top of conv1. Surely, it might be beneficial to have an extra layer of redundancy and maybe the conv2 layer detects certain high-frequency patterns that we can\u2019t deduce from the analysis above, but I think for such a simple task as MNIST classification, it\u2019s not necessary.", "Now, we\u2019ll dissect the final convolutional layer. Let\u2019s compare the distribution of weights of conv3 vs conv2. Below you can see a random sample of conv2 weights on the left and random sample of conv3 weights on the right.", "If you carefully observe the weights, you can see that conv2 has a lot of weights (grids) that form patterns like Gabor filters. Some of them are shown below", "However, conv3 has relatively few of these types of filters. Instead, most of the grids of conv3 have \u201cpixel bursts\u201d where there are one or two very bright or dark pixels in an otherwise gray grid of values. Those filters resemble salt and pepper noise. Some examples are shown below", "What could be the purpose of such pixel burst filters? In theory, a filter with a small burst at a particular location in the grid should activate maximally when the input to the convolution has a similar burst at the same location. This could mean that the conv3 pixel burst filters look for activations from conv2 at particular locations within the grid.", "The location of the burst can be described with [\u03b1, d] where \u03b1 is the angle(the direction of clock\u2019s hand below) and d is the distance from the center. Additionally, we can use + or \u2014 sign to indicate whether the burst is positive or negative. For example, the second filter above looks for activations at 7:30 o\u2019clock. Using the notation described above, the filter above looks for +[7:30, 2\u221a2] which means it looks for positive activations at angle=7:30 o\u2019clock and distance 2\u221a2.", "Our hypothesis that bursts are used to select a location of activation is supported by the fact that conv3 input (7x7) is almost the same size as the conv3 weight filter (5x5) (conv3 output size is 3x3). Let me explain how.", "In the most familiar case of convolutions, the input to the convolution operation has a much larger dimension than the dimensions of the filter. You might have input be 28x28 and the filter be 5x5 for example. In that case, the filter sees only a small portion of the input and the filter acts as an equivariant pattern detector. However, in the case of our conv3, the input is almost the same size (7x7) as the filter (5x5). So the filter has the receptive field of almost 100% and when you overlay the filter on the input and think about what the filter is going to do to this input, it kind of makes sense that the filter would look for activations at locations where the filter has high values.", "So when the input size is approximately equal to filter size, the function of the filter changes from pattern detection to location detection. This is the duality of convolutional filters in our SimpleConvNet \u2014 convolutions are used to detect both, the patterns and their locations.", "*** Also, note that there are ReLU and MaxPool (3x3) following conv3 after which the output of MaxPool (1x1) is passed to a fully connected layer. So what\u2019s important about conv3\u2019s output is just the maximum value within the 3x3 grid. The location of the maximum and other negative values are ignored. Although in intermediate steps where the addition c_j=\u03a3 x_k \u2217 w_k is performed, the location of the maximum and the negative values do matter.", "To get some kind of confirmation of conv3 filters\u2019 location selectivity rather than pattern selectivity, let\u2019s look at the activations of a few synthetic inputs.", "On the left are synthetic inputs and on the right are the output of conv3\u2019s 21st outer channel. The same pattern (horizontal line) is presented at different locations to the same outer channel. The outer channel does not respond to the horizontal line equivariantly. The activation of this outer channel depends on the location of the pattern. The activation is the highest when the horizontal line is in the middle of the image. conv3\u2019s 6th outer channel, on the other hand, detects horizontal lines on top of the image:", "We will now focus on conv3_6. Some supporting evidence that conv3_6 looks for horizontal lines on top of the image:", "Now that we\u2019ve seen some evidence that conv3_6 looks for horizontal lines on top of the image, let\u2019s analyze how outer channels implement this location selectivity. We will first dissect the digit 5 because this is the digit from the MNIST dataset that activates conv3_6 maximally. Below is the input and the dissected conv3_6.", "We will look at each row\u2019s weight (using the index as the identifier) and we\u2019ll use the clock notation defined earlier", "Overall there is a big contribution from horizontal lines on top with a big dislike for horizontal lines in the middle and a few small contributions from other patterns at different locations.", "Let\u2019s quickly do the same dissection for digit 7.", "I hope that the 2 dissections above convinced you at least to some degree that conv3_6 prefers horizontal lines on top of the image and it implements this selectivity by overlaying \u201cpixel burst\u201d-style filters (with bursts close to the top of the grid) on top of the input that detects horizontal lines.", "conv3 conclusion: What have I learned from dissecting many conv3 outer channels? One conv3 outer filter does not just represent one pattern at a certain location, instead, it\u2019s a combination of different such location selections not necessarily of the same pattern. For example, conv3_i could be looking for the mix of horizontals at +[12, 2], -[6,2]; and lines with slope 45 in the center and verticals at +[3,2].", "We kind of saw it in the above 2 dissections of conv3_6 as well \u2014 in addition to the main contributions from horizontal lines on top, there were other contributions like vertical lines at 10 o\u2019clock. conv3_6 sums up all these contributions. So conv3_6 is a mix of various location selectivities to various patterns.", "We are done with convolutional layers, now we will look at fully connected (fc) layers.", "Our SimpleConvNet has 2 fully connected layers following conv3: fc4 and fc5.", "We saw that each conv3 neuron detects a combination of various patterns at different locations. We would expect fc4 and fc5 layers to use this information somehow to classify the images. They might combine these features or disentangle each combination into more useful features.", "The thing about FC layers is that they are very straightforward \u2014 just a matrix multiply, but they are very difficult to understand. Essentially one FC layer just takes a vector and produces another vector where entries in the output vector are linear combinations of the entries in the input vector. The quadratic complexity of this operation just overwhelms any attempt to understand the inner working of one FC layer.", "Given that FC layers contain too many parameters, I did not attempt to analyze them further. My hunch is that conv3 layer output already does a great job dividing up the images in high dimensional space into different classes. FC layers just widen the boundary between classes so that it becomes easier to classify the images.", "Another way to think about FC layers is that they are just transforming the basis of location selectivities from conv3. That is, they transform the intertwined combination of location selectivities into the \u201cstandard\u201d basis where useful features lie on the orthogonal axis.", "If we use visualization techniques like PCA and t-SNE on FC and conv3 layers, you can kind of see that indeed conv3 layers already separate the dataset into classes pretty well and FC layers improve the separation further. Below are screenshots of PCA and t-SNE (3D) projections of:", "You can find the interactive 3D version of the projections in the Colab notebook.", "We saw that conv1 just implements a very simple pattern (line) detectors. It only detects lines at various angles. Conv2 tries to amplify conv1\u2019s outputs, so it\u2019s really not adding anything new, we could have just omitted it. Conv3 selects locations for the patterns detected by conv1. This is implemented rather elegantly using the duality of weight filters. After conv3 we have the ability to detect lines with different angles at different locations in the image. But these detections are not disentangled, i.e., we don\u2019t have one neuron (from conv3) that just detects horizontal lines on top of the image, instead, they are intertwined \u2014 each neuron of conv3 detects a mix of such location selectivities.", "It\u2019s the job of the fully connected (FC) layers to disentangle and/or combine these mixes in order to transform an entangled mix into useful features for classification (like horizontal on the top, in the middle, and on the bottom+ vertical at 10 and 4 o\u2019clock make up the digit 5). FC layers likely use the correlation between certain combinations /entanglements to classify digits.", "I believe the black box nature (not being able to explain the decisions) of our SimpleConvNet comes from the entanglement of location selection in conv3. If we could disentangle the location selectivities (like the FC layers do but they are themselves not very understandable), we would get a fully explainable network. My goal in Part 2 is to build such a fully explainable network from scratch.", "In a sense, conv3 chooses the wrong basis where vectors are not nice (they are intertwined) and our job to is to make conv3 explainable by choosing the basis vector where our interesting directions become orthogonal so that location selectivity becomes completely intertwined \u2014 isolated rather than a mix of location selectivities. Is there a matrix that can transform conv3 raw outputs into a nice basis? This is a question that I have not explored yet.", "We will build the network for detecting MNIST digits manually in Part 2. Here, I will briefly outline what Part 2 will be about.", "We build a handmade classifier. We can omit conv2 so we just compose conv1 with conv3 in the handmade classifier. To make the discussion here consistent with the dissection discussion, I will keep using the same numbers for convolutions. That is, conv3 will directly follow conv1 (I don\u2019t rename conv3 to conv2).", "More constrained building blocks. We imitate conv1 and conv3 with very constrained versions of them which will make explaining their decisions easy. They could actually be automated \u2014 no manual inspection required! Constrained versions will be parametric grids of weights \u2014 parametric curves drawn on a grid.", "For example, the figure below shows parametric lines with various slope and sigma parameters. We use these grids as the weights of conv1 layers. When we train conv1, we only allow adjusting the parameters like slope and sigma instead of the free-form adjustments of the entire grid in the usual training. That way we can auto-explain the decisions of conv1 using the parameters.", "We use \u201cparametric bursts\u201d as the weights of conv3 which are also parameterized with a few parameters. Only the parameters are allowed to be adjusted during training.", "Using these constrained versions of weights, we first construct a bunch of conv1 detectors that detect various lines of my choice.
