There are also great works on organizing papers based on their topics such as this.", "In this post, we are introducing a small tool for utilizing natural language processing in unsupervised clustering of topics in these articles, so that we can have a better sense of what is going on in them.", "Every document is composed of different sections, and the section titles are amongst what we do have in the released dataset. Before the words in each article, the smallest entities that preserve semantics are the text segments and sentences. In this post, it is shown how these can be used all in one bucket to help with unsupervised clustering of focus points in these articles. Later on, given the different sections and the inter-section or inter-paper affinity (perhaps even using graph convolutional networks, graph attention networks, etc.) or the topic organization work that was mentioned below, better clustering techniques can be applied to obtain finer results.", "We use Natural Language Processing Toolkit\u2019s sentence tokenizer to break down every article to these atomic segments, and then generate the state of the art representations for them to be used in the later stages of our pipeline.", "Using our word_embedding_warehouse you can easily fetch and process the BERT-based pre-trained representation weights to use in PyTorch or Tensorflow (the documentation is available here).

The motivation for this section is the fact that the current tasks designed on this dataset are the generic tasks such as \u201cwhat do we know about its vaccination?\u201d.

We can start with small number of clusters, and increase them and look for the point of start for plateauing.", "As an example of interpreting the groups, for the case of 296 clusters, the word cloud for every cluster was created.
