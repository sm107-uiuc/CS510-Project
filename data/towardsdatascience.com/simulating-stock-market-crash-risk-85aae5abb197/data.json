Yet that temptation can be a siren song for the unwary because financial market statistics are slippery and treacherous. Oftentimes they seem almost normal (as in distribution), but what appears as solid ground can dissolve swiftly into quicksand, as was seen earlier this year.", "The most important stock market index in the world is the S&P 500 Index (SPX), which is widely regarded as the bellweather of the overall US equity market, and even of the state of the American economy. The SPX suffered a calamitous -33.9% crash over the twenty-three trading days ending on 23 March 2020 as the world tumbled into the grip of the Covid-19 pandemic.", "This -34% drawdown was among the ten largest 23-day declines in the history of the SPX, which was launched in 1926, surpassed only by the volatility that heralded the Great Depression. For many traders, the experience was akin to encountering a mythical monster thought to exist only in ancient folk tales. But such crashes are really a constant risk even in more current times, and the 2020 experience was not far behind in magnitude to the drawdown experienced in October 1987.", "I will attempt to simulate the ex ante probability of extended sell-offs amounting to a ~30% drawdown in the SPX using its long-term historical data from 1928 through 2019. To ensure that it is truly ex ante, no data from 2020 will be utilised. Throughout the exercise, I use the term \u201cstock market\u201d and the SPX interchangeably. For simplicity, I will use simple percentage returns, rather than the log returns that are typical in the academic literature.", "While doing this exercise, I will also demonstrate that stock market returns are not normally distributed, and doing so mostly with pictures. Moreover, I will show how using historical daily returns data can provide misleading inferences about the variance or range of potential stock market returns. A calendar month has 21 trading days on average, and I will compare how returns simulated from distinct months (and quarters) differ from those aggregated up from simulated daily returns.", "The SPX has an almost century-long history though it was only expanded to cover 500 stocks in 1957. Daily returns data is available from late 1927 through Bloomberg subscription. The historical price and returns data I use for this study are from 1 January 1928 through 31 December 2019.", "The charts above show the daily returns (left) and calendar monthly returns (right) over the 1928\u20132019 period. As you eyeball these charts, there are three crucial features to note. First, they show that both daily and monthly returns fluctuate around a mean (of approximately zero for the daily returns), so returns data appear at first glance to be likely stationary or mean-reverting. Second, they show evidence of volatility clustering, namely that large absolute returns tend to be grouped together, as are quieter periods.", "This volatility clustering was first noticed by the great Benoit Mandelbrot in 1963, when he noted that \u201clarge [price] changes tend to be followed by large changes, of either sign,and small changes tend to be followed by small changes,\u201d though it was subsequently ignored by researchers for two decades.", "Third, the volatility clustering phenomenon appears to be less pronounced in the monthly returns data, compared to the daily series. I will return to this highly important volatility clustering phenomenon later.", "The mean daily return from the 1928\u20132019 sample period is +0.0294% while the mean calender month return is +0.6172%. This is consistent with compounding the average daily return by the (approximately) 21 trading days on average in a month. Thus, the aggregation from daily to monthly works out correctly.", "Above are histograms of the daily returns (left) and calendar month returns (right). If you observe closely, the daily returns histogram has a sharper peak and longer left-tail compared to the right-tail, relative to the monthly returns histogram. This is the aggregational normality (or aggregational Gaussianity) phenomenon whereby the distribution of returns becomes more normally distributed as the time scale of returns lengthens. In other words, the distribution of returns at different timescales are not the same.", "The results of formal measures of excess kurtosis and skewness for both the daily and monthly returns series are above. A normal distribution has excess kurtosis and skewness of zero. Normality for empirical data distributions may usually be assumed when excess kurtosis is between +2 and -2, while skewness should be in the +1 to -1 range.", "In this case, we have rather symmetrical data for both distributions with skewness close to zero, but kurtosis is problematic. Kurtosis is a measure of the size of the tails relative to the rest of the distribution. Both distributions exhibit the infamous \u201cfat tails\u201d that are typical of financial market returns data. In statistical parlance the returns distributions are leptokurtic. Moreover, the daily returns show much fatter tails than the monthly series (i.e. excess kurtosis of 17.40 vs 8.16). This is again the aggregational normality phenomenon at work.", "A better way to examine normality through charts is by looking at the quantile-quantile (qq) plot. In a qq plot, the distribution of historical returns are plotted against a theoretical normal distribution. If the set of historical returns lines entirely along the theoretical line, then the returns may be said to be normally distributed. The deviations from the theoretical line denote how the sample distribution deviates from the normal distribution.", "Standardizing the daily and monthly returns series makes them comparable with both having mean zero and standard deviation 1. Above are the qq plots of the standardized daily returns (left) and calendar month returns (right), and they highlight the fat tails in stock market returns distributions relative to the normal distribution represented by the red line. Also important to note is that the deviation from normality is noticeably smaller in the monthly returns data compared to the daily data.", "Finally, let us compare the box plots of the standardized daily and monthly returns. The daily returns are in the left box plot, and the monthly are on the right. We notice straightaway that the daily returns series has further outliers than the monthly series. The standardized daily series also has more extreme outliers on the negative side, compared to the standardized monthly data. This confirms some of the observations from the other charts above, and the key one being that the returns distributions are different between the daily and calendar month series.", "We may thus conclude that stock market returns for both the daily and monthly series are not normally distributed. In particular, the distributions of historical returns have fatter tails and far more extreme values than normal distributions. There is also a left-skew indicating more negative outliers in the daily series in particular. Furthermore, the distributions of returns differ across different timescales. The monthly series, however, appears closer to the normal distribution ideal.", "I will attempt to quantify the extended drawdown risk by using simulations of the historical returns data. Making a probabilistic interpretation of historical data however requires that we are dealing with a sequence of random variables. Statistical randomness in turn demands that the sample is comprised of independent and identically distributed (IID) data points.", "The independence assumption means that the value of a data point drawn from a sample should not be linked to or influenced by another data point in that sample. One way to check for this in time series data is to look for autocorrelation or serial correlation between data points. Autocorrelation occurs when a time series data point exhibits some correlation or similarity with its lagged counterparts.", "The above are the autocorrelation (ACF) and partial autocorrelation (PACF) charts for the daily returns series. As may be observed, and confirming the intuition from the line chart that was discussed at the beginning of this article, daily returns appear to be (weakly) stationary with little or no autocorrelation.", "The ACF and PACF for the calendar month returns series above indicate the same. Based on these charts we may proceed on the assumption that there is little or no linear autocorrelation in the returns series.", "That said, let us bring back that observation of volatility clustering we encountered earlier. The clustering phenomenon suggests that although linear autocorrelation of daily or monthly returns may not be a problem, non-linear autocorrelation remains a possibility. To check for this we need to examine the absolute returns or squared returns time series data.", "The ACF and PACF charts for the daily squared returns above demonstrate the existence of persistent non-linear autocorrelation. Basically, large absolute price changes tend to be followed by large changes, whether up or down, and muted price movements tend to be persistent too on the flipside.", "The equivalent charts for the calendar month squared returns series above show that the non-linear autocorrelation is weaker and less persistent compared to the daily series. In other words, if one had to assume that data points are IID, then it is much more preferable to use the monthly returns data rather than the daily data. The IID assumption is separate from normality, but it does again show that monthly stock market returns are \u201cbetter behaved\u201d from a statistical perspective than daily returns.", "We now turn to simulating future stock market returns, drawing upon the historical returns data through random sampling with replacement. The first function below draws a random sample of \u201cperiod_fwd\u201d size from the historical data. This function is nested in the second function that runs the sampling \u201cn_iterations\u201d times, so as to generate n_iterations arrays of simulated period_fwd returns.", "The first set of 10,000 21-day simulations uses the daily returns data from 1928\u20132019, while the second set draws from a restricted sample of the more recent 1990\u20132019 period. In terms of the code above, it would be period_fwd=21 and n_interations=10000. The simulated daily returns are then aggregated to arrive at a simulated monthly return.", "To be specific, the aggregation is accomplished by taking the cumulative product of the 21 simulated daily returns\u2019 percentage changes, and doing so across all n arrays of simulated returns. The resulting outputs are two distributions of monthly returns built-up from simulated 21 daily returns, and some of their statistics are shown below.", "The more recent 1990\u20132019 data appear to show a somewhat higher mean monthly return (0.61% vs 0.54%) with less extreme negative values in the distribution than the simulated returns drawn from the broader 1928\u20132019 time series.", "We then run another simulation using 1928\u20132019 calendar month returns data. In this case, we only need to simulate one period forward since it is already based on monthly observations, and doing so 5,000 times. There are only just over a thousand distinct months in that entire period, so I didn\u2019t want to overdo the random sampling. Similar statistics from the resulting distribution of simulated monthly returns based on historical calendar month data are presented below.", "All three simulations produced similar mean estimates. In fact, the mean monthly return from both the daily historical data (1928\u20132019) and the monthly data are almost identical (0.54% vs 0.57%). Even the simulated 5th percentile observation is similar across the three distributions, at approximately -8%. This implies that a drawdown of at least 8% is likely to occur in one out of every 20 months on average.", "However, there is noticeable difference as we go further out along the left-tail of the sampling distributions. The 1st percentile (or 1 out of 100 months) and 0.1 percentile observations (or 1 out of 1000 months) diverge significantly between the simulated aggregated daily returns and the simulated calendar month returns.", "The simulations using historical monthly data show much higher expected drawdowns at these left-tail distributional extremities. Based on the sampling distribution taken from historical monthly data through 2019, there was a 0.1% probability of a ~30% or more drawdown over a monthly period. To put this in context, in probability terms it is equivalent to a person\u2019s lifetime odds of drowning, and much higher than the odds of choking. It is a very low probability, but not a negligible one. Otherwise, lifeguards would be out of a job.", "The aggregated monthly returns based on historical daily data produced notably lower drawdown risk estimates by contrast. The minimum monthly return in the sampling distribution aggregated from the more recent 1990\u20132019 dataset was just -19.8%, which meant that it would have totally failed to foresee an extended sell-off equivalent to the February-March 2020 crash.", "Thus, the naive use of daily returns statistics can lead to a significant underestimation of stock market drawdown risk, and the error would have been compounded by restricting the sample to only data from the past 30 years.", "Before we conclude, let us quickly take a look at simulated quarterly returns, again using aggregated simulated historical daily returns (over 63 days) and historical calendar quarter returns. The full 1928\u20132019 time series are used for both simulations.", "So another 10,000 set of daily return simulations were conducted, this time with period_fwd=63. The historical quarterly returns were in turn sampled 2,000 times. Note than there are less than 400 distinct quarters in the sample period. The selected statistics from both exercises are below.", "The simulated mean quarterly returns are similar (1.88% vs 2.16%), but the left-tail percentiles again diverge sharply as we move out to the extremities. The aggregated quarterly returns based on historical daily data produced notably lower drawdown expectations, underscoring the findings from the monthly simulations above.", "Financial markets are a wellspring of quantifiable data, but the data generation process remains a deep mystery. The movements of stock prices arise from the net effect of constant human interaction in an arena dominated by the interplay of fear and greed. After Isaac Newton lost a fortune in the South Sea Bubble, he famously remarked that he could \u201ccalculate the motions of the heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.\u201d", "In this article I highlighted some of the well-known pitfalls of financial market statistics, using SPX returns data from 1928 through 2019. Stock market returns are not normally distributed, and have notably far greater variability in the tails. The distribution of returns at different timescales are also dissimilar (aggregational normality). Moreover, returns exhibit non-linear autocorrelation as a result of volatility clustering, and much more so in the daily returns than monthly series.", "Monthly 1928\u20132019 historical data would have provided higher probabilities of a scenario akin to the February-March 2020 crash, than using historical daily returns data. More recent daily data from the 1990\u20132019 period would have failed to foresee such an eventuality altogether. The naive use of daily returns data can therefore lead to a major underestimation of the risk of extreme stock market drawdowns.", "(The full Python code for this exercise is available at my GitHub page.)", "If you saw value in reading articles like this, you may subscribe to Medium here to read other articles by me and countless other writers.
