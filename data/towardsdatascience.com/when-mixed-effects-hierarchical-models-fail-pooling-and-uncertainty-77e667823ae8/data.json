You\u2019ve been exposed to some of these nested structures since you were young (whether you\u2019ve been aware of it or not). For example, in geography class countries were nested within continents or regions, and states within countries. Similarly, you can think of players within teams, customers within regions, and even departments within a university.", "Given the nature of how we tend to structure our world, we commonly encounter data sets with nested structure in analytics (i.e. observations as members of groups).", "Mixed effects models are simply an extension of regression models that take into account the impact group membership has on an outcome of interest.", "Like any widely used method across disciplines people can\u2019t agree on a common name. These models are referred to as \u201cMixed Models\u201d, \u201cHierarchical Models\u201d, \u201cMultilevel Models\u201d, \u201cRandom Effects Models\u201d, etc. (Why people can\u2019t agree on one name is a mystery to me. \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642)", "Before you\u2019re tempted to think \u201cOh great, another article about linear models\u2026 \ud83d\ude12\u201d let me tell you this: yes, this covers linear models but without disregarding a commonly overlooked point \u2014 when models DON\u2019T WORK and the consequences this can have.", "I focus on linear models for simplicity and will cover generalized mixed models in subsequent publications.", "The following section is based on a subset of the sleepstudy data set . The data comes from sleep deprivation study where the observations are the average reaction times per days of sleep deprivation on a series of tests for multiple subjects.", "Imagine we\u2019re trying to estimate the effect days of sleep deprivation has on the average reaction times of subjects. We can start with a simple linear model to understand this relationship as follows", "where for each observation i the days of sleep deprivation ( Days , i.e. independent variable) affect the average reaction time/delay (react delay , i.e. dependent variable) based on the \u03b2 variables. These \u03b2 parameters are called fixed effects because they are constant for all observations (i.e. the population).", "Note that given linear regression assumes data is normally distributed, we can also define it in distributional form. The equation above can be read as \u201cobservations are normally distributed with mean \u03b20 + \u03b21*Days and population variance \u03c3\u00b2 \u201d(since we assume all observations i have the same variance).", "Now, as seen below, sleep deprivation affects each subject differently so using a model that groups all observations together (referred to as complete pooling) doesn\u2019t make sense.", "So, how could we model differences between subjects? Well, we can use various flavors of a linear mixed effects model.", "We might first want to consider the case where subjects have different baselines but the rate (slope) at which their reaction times increase is the same. In this case we expand our previous model to allow the intercepts to vary by subject subj as follows", "where \u03b20 and \u03b21 are fixed/population effects (constant across all observations) and b0,subj is a random effect that allows the intercept to vary by subject (i.e. to deviate from the population intercept \u03b20). This leads to our first flavor of a mixed effect model a varying-intercept model. In distributional terms, the mean varies for each subject based on b0,subj which is normally distributed with mean 0 and subject-specific variance \u03c4\u00b2_0. (This is why this term is considered to be \u201crandom.\u201d)", "The figure below provides an example of this model. We can see it gives an OK fit but doesn\u2019t account for slope variation across subjects.", "Now, if we thought reaction time increased differently for each subject then we might want to let the slopes vary (by subj ) and keep the intercept fixed as follows", "where \u03b20 is a fixed (population) intercept and the slopes vary according to \u03b21 (fixed slope) + b1,subj (random slope). This leads to our second flavor of mixed effect model, avarying-slope model. In distributional terms, the mean varies for each subject based on b1,subj*Days which is normally distributed with mean 0 and subject-specific variance \u03c4\u00b2_1.", "The figure below provides an example of this model and we can see it actually fits the data worse than the previous one. Can we combine both approaches? Yes, we can. \ud83d\ude42", "Observing the plots above it is reasonable to consider the situation where each subject\u2019s baseline reaction time and rate of increase is different from the others.", "We have both slope and intercept fixed effects (\u03b20 and \u03b21) and random effects (b0,subj and b1,subj ). This leads to our last flavor of mixed effect model, a varying-intercept, varying-slope model. In distributional terms, the mean varies for each subject based on b0,subj and b1,subj*Days but now these two subject-specific random effects are correlated. Thus, the variance component is now a matrix which includes the slope and intercept variances (\u03c4_22 and intercept \u03c4_11), as well as their covariance (\u03c4_21 and \u03c4_12).", "Compared to the previous two plots we can see that this model tends to fit the data more tightly as it improves how subject-specific differences are accounted.", "Note that this has just been a visual guide of one type of mixed models (linear). In order to implement these, you need to understand the question you\u2019re answering, your data and be able to carefully assess model performance / fit with additional methods, some of which I\u2019ll cover in the next section.", "This section is a summary of a more thorough analysis in Github. It uses simulated data based on the following Kaggle dataset. For simplicity the example was coded in R but you can find Python examples in Github as well.", "Imagine your company recently revamped its website and the marketing department would like to know how the website is performing. Specifically, they\u2019d like to know how much longer young customers spend on the website versus older ones.", "To address this question you\u2019ve collected customer \u201cbounce rates\u201d (bounce_time, secs) and age across 8 different locations ( county ), where bounce rates measure the time a customer spends on the website. However, as you can see below, you weren\u2019t able to get the same number of observations for all locations (e.g. one has 150 observations while another has only 7).", "To start, you fit a linear model, given you\u2019re trying to understand the dependence of bounce_time on age. However, before doing so you center-scale your age variable (mean=0, variance =1) to improve model stability and simplify later interpretations (i.e. the intercept is now the average age ).", "This model is considered a complete pooling model given it ignores variation between counties and treats all observations as part of the same group or pool. Thus, it estimates a single slope and intercept (\u03b20=200 and \u03b21=4.69) for all the data. However, given the model shows lack of fit (assessment not shown), you\u2019d like to see if modeling differences at the county level improves performance.", "A quick EDA yields allows you to observe that average bounce_time does seem to vary across locations ( county ) and that the within-county variability isn\u2019t the same for all locations. Thus the independence assumption of a simple linear regression isn\u2019t met.", "Instead you might fit individual regression lines for each county using the lme4 R package. The resulting no-pooling model assumes customers share no similarities across counties and considers each county independently. As a result, we estimate 8 distinct intercepts and slopes (i.e. one per county) as shown below.", "This new model seems to have a better fit (not shown), performs better than the previous one, and visually appears to capture each group\u2019s trend.", "In addition, the slope estimates are much smaller than before, a behavior that is explained via Simpson\u2019s paradox (i.e. trends estimated at the county or group level can be completely different from globally estimated trends). The animation below illustrates changes between the complete pooling and no-pooling model estimates.", "However, concluding that the no-pooling model is best based on a seemingly tighter fit is premature.", "As Gelman describes \u201cwhereas complete pooling ignores variation between [groups], the no-pooling analysis overstates it [and]\u2026 overfits the data within each [group]\u201d. In other words, this model exaggerates the variation between counties and makes them look more distinct when in fact it is plausible (even expected) that customers across counties share some similarities.", "Trying to capture of the similarities between counties you fit a model that falls in between the two extremes (i.e. the complete and no-pooling models). Using R\u2019s lmer function, you fit a linear mixed effects model, again estimating 8 distinct slopes and intercepts.", "However, these are estimated via partial-pooling which, briefly, combines information from the population (fixed) effects of the complete pooling model and county-specific (random) effects of the no-pooling one.", "Looking at the summary output you see some promising indicators. The random intercept seems to account for most of the variability between counties (\u2248195) while still having some population-level variance (i.e. residual). (Having both indicates that there are both fixed and random effects in play, if residual variance were \u22480 then fitting a no-pooling model would\u2019ve been just as good.)", "However, you notice a warning message from the function stating that the model fit is likely \u201csingular\u201d (bottom of output above). You might be tempted to ignore this message, seeing that the model has good fit (not shown) and performs on par to the no-pooling setup.", "So, why not use this model to answer the marketing department\u2019s question about bounce times?", "I\u2019ll tell you why but first let\u2019s take a quickly detour into partial-pooling.", "Partial-pooling is the essence of why mixed effects models are powerful and I\u2019ve found that more often than not people tend to describe what partial-pooling does rather than illustrate it. Partial-pooling represents a compromise between complete and no-pooling models. Let\u2019s explore what that means.", "First, the animation on the left (below) provides a real time example of why partial-pooling is a \u201ccompromise.\u201d We can see how the slope and intercept estimates change across the three models we just covered. With partial-pooling, the county-specific (no-pooling) estimates are drawn towards the population (complete pooling) estimates. But, why do some estimates have larger changes than others?", "We can answer that with the set of equations on the right, which are color coded to match the animation on the left. Simply put, a partial-pooling estimate (blue) is a weighted average of the terms from the complete (red) and no-pooling models (green), where the weights are defined by variances and group sample sizes. (Note: the equations are taken from a slightly simpler example and are not the exact ones computed in the models above.)", "People refer to groups as \u201ccarrying\u201d more or less information on the basis of the effect of group sample size and/or variance in this equation. For example, in counties with smaller sample sizes n_j (i.e.n_j -> 0 ) we see that the left term gets down-weighted. As a result, the estimates are pulled or \u201cshrunk\u201d closer to the overall population average, which is beneficial, since we generally don\u2019t want to estimate parameters with few data points. The effect is the opposite for groups with larger samples sizes \u2014 we\u2019re more confident about the estimates of group-level effects in these data.", "In essence what we see is smaller groups \u201cborrow information\u201d from larger groups and get their estimates shrunk towards the population values.", "Let\u2019s dive back to the website bounce rates example.", "Given your strong (or newly developed) understanding of the problem at hand and how partial-pooling can lead to better estimates in this case, you choose the mixed effects model to answer how age affects bounce rates across counties. Partial-pooling seems to have \u201cshrunk\u201d estimates and confidence intervals as intended (see below). Notice something funny about the slope estimates \u2014 the confidence intervals have almost disappeared! How is that possible? What happened?", "Remember the \u201csingular fit\u201d warning I previously mentioned? Well, that happened. Simply put, this warning tells us that the model is too complex for the data to support. In our case, in counties with smaller sample sizes, the random intercept accounts for most of the variability so when we try to fit a county-specific slope there isn\u2019t enough information left to do so.", "We could simplify our model and remove the random slope, but what if we believe there might be some merit to having county-specific slopes? We can include both components using a Bayesian approach (see next section).", "Before moving on it is important to note a crucial lesson about how partial-pooling/shrinkage might lead to unintended consequences. In 2016, George et al. showed that partial pooling can lead to artificially low predicted mortality rates for smaller hospitals. As seen in the figures below, the predicted mortality rates (y-axis) have been \u201cartificially shrunk\u201d for hospitals with smaller numbers of beds (x-axis). That is to say, the model is systematically down-weighting the observed (higher) mortality in smaller hospitals. In this scenario, partial-pooling from a standard mixed effects model has potentially nightmarish public health and legal consequences. This under-prediction of the observed mortality rate could affect patients down the line. \ud83d\ude31", "In their paper George et al. provide extensions to the mixed effects model that can help limit unwanted effects of partial-pooling.", "If you\u2019re not very familiar with Bayesian inference I recommend Aerin Kim\u2019s amazing article.", "Also, given that fitting a Bayesian model is a conversation in itself (e.g. choosing priors, diagnostics, etc.) this section will only focus on results. Future articles will cover Bayesian fits in more detail.", "Bayesian mixed effects method are powerful alternatives to more commonly used Frequentist approaches (as above). Particularly, they are able to account for uncertainty when estimating group-level effects and provide stable estimates for groups with smaller sample sizes with the help of weakly informative priors.", "Let\u2019s imagine, you\u2019ve recently learned that a Bayesian approach can help you deal with the \u201csingular fit\u201d problem in your model. Plus, you\u2019ve heard from a colleague that there is a great R package (brms) package that provides an easy-to-use formula builder to fit Bayesian mixed models with stan. After selecting your priors (covered in future installments), you fit the same mixed effects model as before.", "This new model seems to have a good fit (not shown) and posterior predictive checks give you confidence in your estimates and associated errors. More importantly, you notice that the 95% credible intervals for the Essex, Kent, London, and Norfolk slopes include 0 (i.e. there is some probability that these slopes are actually zero).", "Visually you can see posterior draws for each county\u2019s trend line (left) seem to fit the data and this new approach had a marginal improvement the model\u2019s performance (right) in terms of RMSE.", "Most importantly, your estimates still utilize partial-pooling but this time without the vanishing error bounds we saw earlier. This is because you introduced \u201cinformation\u201d via your weakly informative priors. This gets to one idea at the heart of Bayesian inference, which combines information in the observed data with information from specified prior distributions (which we can often think of as baseline estimates). Posterior estimates are always theoretically possible (unlike our \u201csingular fit\u201d example) but with insufficient data, these estimates default to resembling our priors.", "As a final remark, I\u2019m not saying Bayesians > Frequentists, or that you should drop everything and become Bayesian. As in any situation, the method of your choosing should reflect an understanding of the problem at hand. Here I fit a Bayesian model to help illustrate how it can help dealing with vanishing error bounds. However, I could instead have simplified the model (see rintercept_only RMSE table above). It all depends on what questions you\u2019re trying to answer.", "Here\u2019s some final thoughts to consider", "If you liked the article feel free to share!
