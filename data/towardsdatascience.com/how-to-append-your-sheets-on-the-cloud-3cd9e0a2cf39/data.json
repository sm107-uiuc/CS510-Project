Then you\u2019ll have your own hosted notebook, ready to be used as below:", "Your first notebook will create a location in your Google Drive automatically a folder called \u201cColab Notebooks\u201d to store all your work automatically.", "After a brief instruction of the tool, let\u2019s dive into our code to append your sheets that are located in your Drive into a new Google Sheets. The whole process consists of 6 simple steps.", "In order to read and make changes in your Google Sheets documents, you first need to authenticate Google Colab to access your Google Drive documents. Even though both apps belong to Google, access between them requires exclusive authentication from your side.", "If you run the code below in the first cell of the Notebook, you\u2019ll be good to make any changes in your Google Drive documents.", "Running the cell will generate a link and ask for the auth code.", "Click the link to complete the sign-in process.", "As stated in the image on the left, this authentication will allow you to see, edit, create, and edit all files in your Google Drive. So make sure to double-check any code you run from your notebook to avoid irreversible mistakes.", "Allow the changes to be made in your documents.", "Once allowed, the system will generate a code. Copy the code and paste it into Colab to complete the authentication process.", "The second step is to read the files in your Google Drive from the Colab notebook.", "This step consists of opening the Google Sheets to read the data from, select the worksheets the data is located in, get the data, and finally place the data into a pandas dataframe.", "One note here is that the link doesn\u2019t have to be a publicly available one since all the permissions are granted, so you may just copy the link of your Google Sheets document from your browser.", "After taking the data into a dataframe, setting the columns and specifying the data range is the following step.", "If your columns are part of the data and are not positioned at the column part where currently there is \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d is located on the image here, then setting the columns and specifying the data range with the following code is needed. If you already have your column names in place, you may skip this step.", "The updated df1 dataframe can be seen here when the execution is completed.", "One key point in the append function is that the number of columns in the selected worksheet should match. Otherwise, the append command would generate an error in the next step. Therefore, you need to choose the columns with the same name in advance, to append the right values to each other.", "In the example below, I\u2019ve selected my \u201cSales\u201d and \u201cBrand\u201d columns that exist in both sheets. You may rename them or add as much as columns you want, as long as all can be found in both files.", "Be careful with the spaces before or after the column name.", "The data sets are finally ready to be appended. Therefore, we just need to run our single line code to complete the append function.", "In this example, I\u2019ve focused on append but based on your need you may also use \u201cmerge\u201d, \u201cjoin\u201d or \u201cconcatenate\u201d functions based on your need. You may check the pandas documentation to discover these other functions in detail.", "It\u2019s important to check if your append is successfully completed by running \u201cdf\u201d see the latest version of your dataframe before writing your new data to your Google Sheets.", "Last but not the least, you need to open a new Google Sheet document and choose its relevant worksheet to write your new dataframe into it with the \u201cset_with_dataframe\u201d function.", "Congrats! You have now appended your Google Sheets without even downloading them to your computer. This doesn't mean that you cannot do the same thing locally on your computer but since that\u2019s a more common practice, I haven\u2019t covered it in this piece.", "Also, the aim of this piece was not only to show you append sheets but also make you aware that you have a free processing power in the cloud, called Google Colab and show you how to interact with your files in your Google Drive to be able to use it for many other use cases.", "Your home for data science.
