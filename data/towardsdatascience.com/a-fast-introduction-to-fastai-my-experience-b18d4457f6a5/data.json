FastAI \u2014 as its name stands, boasts to help coders deep dive into the vast and complicated world of deep learning in just a few lines of code and an extremely minimal setup too. Needless to say, I was pretty pumped to get my hands dirty and start experimenting with it a little.", "If you\u2019d like to get ahead and see all the code in one go, here\u2019s the GitHub repo I put it all in:", "The installation on both Google Colaboratory as well as locally is very simple. It just takes one simple line of pip install fastai in the terminal/code block and you\u2019re done!", "Note: Do make sure you\u2019re inside a new virtual environment when you install fastai and open the jupyter notebook to start writing your model! It\u2019ll help a lot in managing the dependencies and later, if you want, you can even package it as a production ready model with just a bit of extra work.", "Reading the book which is also provided freely in the convenience of Jupyter Notebooks was a great way to get started; I had already read the first three chapters before I got into writing my own model, utilising a pretty popular dataset from Kaggle for my convolutional neural network based image classification task.", "The dataset I wanted to try my hands on was the Rock, Paper, Scissors dataset. It has a reasonable amount of images categorised into three respective folders of train, test and validation which can easily be read by the powerful high level APIs provided by fastai. Believe me, I was pretty surprised to see how easy it was to import data through their DataBlock API \u2014 if you\u2019re coming from Keras, from my personal experience, this process feels much simpler than the Keras one.", "Let me now get into the mechanics of the steps I went through to make my first model and see for yourself how simple it all is!", "Here\u2019s the data I used for this little project:", "Importing the vision modules from fastai is the first thing I did:", "The next step was to create something called a \u2018Path\u2019 object to indicate where your data is. For example, I wrote it like this:", "This process is pretty intuitive, you can in fact view your folders of data through the ls function too:", "Now we get into supplying the data for our model through the DataBlock API I mentioned earlier.", "Yes, it is that simple! If your data is arranged into folders like this:", "Then importing the images with required labels and train + validation split is all done with just this single block of code!", "Breaking it down a little: fastai takes the names of the grandparent folders \u2014 the train and valid folders \u2014 as the train and validation split for our dataset through the argument \u2018splitter\u2019, and parent folders \u2014 as the x and y for our dataset, the images being the \u2018x\u2019 and the rock, paper, scissors folder names being the \u2018y\u2019. And that\u2019s it! Our data is now ready to be consumed by a model. And not only that, the DataBlock API also gives access to a variety of data augmentation functions as well, which I will be exploring in my future articles.", "One of the first things Jeremy Howard, the co-founder of fastai, teaches in his book is to use the effectiveness of transfer learning for image classification. If you\u2019re new to the world of ML, don\u2019t worry about it too much. In the book, the introduction to using the power of transfer learning through the large pre-trained models is taught very well, and in simpler, non-mathematical terms too, so it\u2019s really convenient to learn from there instead of many many other online resources) and especially if you are as bad at learning ML math as me :P", "Loading a pre-trained model in fastai is even simpler. It looks like this:", "Here, as you can see, we\u2019re using the resnet34 pre-trained model for our purposes, and the accuracy after each evaluation on the validation set will be printed for our reference \u2014 to see how good or bad our model is performing.", "We can also see the model architecture in detail with one simple line:", "Learning can then be initiated with this line:", "One of the most useful methods of viewing how good your model is performing on the validation set via the Confusion Matrix. This is also very simple to do:", "This gives the confusion matrix for the three classes of images we have here. There are plenty of methods to customise the appearance of the matrix as well, display useful heatmaps for accuracy, etc.", "All of this seemed pretty surreal to me when I first read the chapters and tried to attempt it myself. The power of fastai seems unmatched in the current world of AI \u2014 the effortless execution of neural networks in this simple project of mine is a testament to that. In the book, they also explain the in-depth, under-the-hood details of most of the algorithms used very commonly in machine learning, for example, the stochastic gradient descent algorithm and the back propagation algorithm.", "As I continue on my journey to explore and learn more, it seems I\u2019ll be doing some very interesting projects in the coming weeks, and if you\u2019re here, after having read all the way through, I\u2019ll encourage you to embark on it with me! I don\u2019t remember the last time I was this excited about learning a new library, one that also encompasses all aspects of deep learning too!", "The resources I\u2019ll recommend for you to look up if you\u2019re willing to learn more:", "Follow me on Twitter. I post new Data Science tidbits every day.", "Loved my article? Become a Medium member to continue to read all of my stories.", "Your home for data science.
