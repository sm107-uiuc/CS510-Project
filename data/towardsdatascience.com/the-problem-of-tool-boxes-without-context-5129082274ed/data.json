It wasn\u2019t one moment, but a series of meetings, committees, programs, papers, and organizations. On one side was the computer science movement, structured programming, program production, and everything we teach (mostly badly though there are efforts to help that) now. The other side is best represented by Peter Naur of whom is said:", "Contrary to most of his colleagues who were heavily defending (and quarreling about) specific language features, Peter put his efforts into meta considerations.", "It is this sentence which also best summarizes the current plight of data science, information science, and computing to this day. Academic programs fret heavily over what techniques to include, what type of statistics to instruct, what languages to include; yet, I find most programs (including my own as well as my PhD Program) tend to send all meta considerations to one course \u2014 the social science course.", "The course I am about to teach. Over the course of the semester, i\u2019ll be writing about this process and hopefully, i\u2019ll find more than powerlessness and frustration. This entry focuses on meta-considerations about the place of programming itself.", "There seems to be a mismatch within programming related to Naur\u2019s initial existence as a meta-consideration for the purpose of programming. He outlines the theory building view of programming:", "Within this conceptualization of programming, the programmer / programming team, has constructed a program not because it was convenient, but because they had a theory of the world through which a computer program could help. Sadly, this view of computer science was quickly overwhelmed by the structured approach.", "In this approach, it has been the primary consideration of minimizing a ratio of cost to performance. In other words, we seek to construct programs that cost as little as possible to the maximum benefit of\u2026whoever funded it. Under the auspices of this approach, we have managed to organize complexity within computation quite effectively but much of that organization is hidden which leaves little to discuss besides consequences. For academic programs that seek to offer programs in \u201cdata science\u201d or \u201cinformation science\u201d or \u201canalytics,\u201d much of the teaching those programs will do comes in the form of:", "As a result, we favor program production and team-based production using methods internally created for programs created at bottom dollar for maximum return. In essence, practical considerations rather than theoretical considerations have come to dominate the space. This is not a surprise given the events surrounding the birth and spread of the technology itself.", "However, the result of that development is that any academic program reflects those aspects of computational culture and the resulting gulf of production and theory has only widened to the point wherein all those not part of the industry can only theorize about the consequences of such programs.", "It is not surprising that this has occurred. Rapid growth is not well-known as an insightful ground for forethought. Yet, we sit at a crossroads through which the specters of Programming as Theory Building / Structured Programming need to be re-considered. In essence, we have practically-programmed ourselves into a corner and instead of figuring out a solution we\u2019ve simply begun to paint in the other direction toward the other corner like a ball in a game of pong.", "The re-consideration is needed because this is not an internal issue common to all those who consider computation, but an issue of intersectionality, of hybridity. Within Programming as Theory Building, philosophical, social, and cultural considerations would have been a feature of programming, not something that fights against the spread of unknowable computer programs. Instead of students in programs that focus on computing taking, \u201cThe social science course,\u201d those philosophical considerations would be part of all tool-building courses.", "The gulf between these approaches is now so wide that it seems impossible to bridge. We instead focus on prompting \u201clittle victories.\u201d If we can somehow create a series of in-class lessons that promotes the occasional pull of a values lever, this is a victory. It is a disappointing compromise within the promise of an activity that is quickly assuming large swathes of everyday life.", "Within Social Science though, there is also not an answer. While there is movement to incorporate this object into analyses, most social science discussion of computation is not useful within the context outlined above. If I were to offer any opinion about the gulf between Programming as Theory Building / Structured Programming, it is that the former did not catch on because it required the social sciences to abandon their over-zealous favoring of humans as the only agents capable of will-based action.", "The result is that teaching the \u201csocial science\u201d course is lectures, readings, theories, and student work will be viewed as a waste by all parties. That programs, program managers, and course developers will do their best to offer the equivalent of, \u201clittle victory\u201d fodder in an effort to attract students who can fill spots on teams as quickly and as lucratively as possible. Even in the program I direct, I have done this.", "I get angry when I see students demand that they write more code instead of writing research papers or considering their work in broader, global contexts. But in the end, if I do force students to write more research, students will find another program, one that let\u2019s them only program, only learn how more tools work. These all exist and many of them are available even without enrollment. As a result, the ability for me to compete as a program is tenuous within the consequences of the structured programming space created long ago.", "And so, as I prepare to teach the \u201csocial science\u201d course in a program that is in-person (my own is Online Only), I wonder about tricks, about invisible, systemic things I can do that students won\u2019t notice as I endeavor to correct an issue that itself is invisible and systemic. I wonder about how to correct or fix social science issues in order to get students to see the world in a way that includes being critical of their tool boxes, of the tools they\u2019ve fought through the frustration and pitfalls of programming pedagogy to learn.", "Your home for data science.
