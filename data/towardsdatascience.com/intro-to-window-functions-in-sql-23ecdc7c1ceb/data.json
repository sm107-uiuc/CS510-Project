A window function uses values from the rows in a window to calculate the returned values.", "Some common uses of window function include calculating cumulative sums, moving average, ranking, and more. (Chartio)", "Window functions are initiated with the OVER clause, and are configured using three concepts:", "For this tutorial, we will cover PARTITIONand ORDER BY. I will assume you have basic to intermediate SQL experience. If you don\u2019t, here are some great resources to get started.", "I will be working with an Olympic Medalist table called summer_medal from Datacamp. (If you are a student with an edu email, and want to get three months of free Datacamp visit \u2014 GitHub Student Developer Pack).", "Here is an overview of the table.", "The table represents the Olympic games from 1896 to 2010, containing every medal winner from each country, sport, event, gender, and discipline.", "As mentioned earlier, using OVER() identifies the window function. The first function in this tutorial is ROW_NUMBER(). This function assigns a number to each record in the row.", "We can see that we use the ROW_NUMBER() to create and assign a row number to selected variables. We alias the window function as Row_Number and sort it so we can get the first-row number on the top.", "We can combine ORDER BY and ROW_NUMBER to determine which column should be used for the row number assignment. Let\u2019s find the DISTINCT sports, and assign them row numbers based on alphabetical order.", "Using PARTITION BY you can split a table based on a unique value from a column. It is useful when we have to perform a calculation on individual rows of a group using other rows of that group. This clause works on windows functions only, like- LAG(), LEAD(), RANK(), etc.", "SQL LAG() is a window function that outputs a row that comes before the current row.", "Here is an excellent example of how it relates to our data. Let\u2019s find the players separated by gender, who won the gold medal in singles for tennis and who won the year before from 2004 onwards.", "There are several steps to this problem. First, we would want to create a CTE, which allows you to define a temporary named result set that available temporarily in the execution scope of a statement \u2014 if you\u2019re stuck here, visit my other post to learn more.", "Since we would want our results to have the winner from the year before we can use LAG().", "We can see that the results for both males and females are outputted in a single column \u2014 this is how partition helped. We recognize there are 3 winners for males and 3 for females. The first winner for both genders was in 2004, and if we look at the right, we see a NULL, because there is no winner before this since we started in 2004. Using LAG and PARTITION BYhelps achieve this.", "SQL LEAD() is a window function that outputs a row that comes after the current row \u2014 essentially the opposite to LAG().", "Let\u2019s use the same question from the tennis example, but instead, find the future champion, not the past champion.", "We only changed LAG to LEAD and altered the alias to future champion, and we can achieve the opposite result.", "SQL RANK is similar to ROW_NUMBER except it will assign the same number to rows with identical values, skipping over the following number. There is also DENSE_RANK which assigns a number to a row with equal values but doesn\u2019t skip over a number. If this all seems confusing, don\u2019t worry. See below for a side by side comparison of what that would look like.", "That is the main difference between RANK and DENSE_RANK. One includes a rank preceding a jointly ranked number, and one doesn\u2019t.", "Here is the code I used to get the table above.", "And that concludes this introduction to window functions. There are many more functionalities to windows functions including a ROWS , NTILE, as well as aggregate functions (SUM, MAX, MIN, etc.). I will be posting tutorials on how to utilize window functions more in SQL, so be sure to stay tuned for my latest posts.", "Connect with me on Linkedin or Github", "Your home for data science.
