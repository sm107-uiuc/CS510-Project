There are a lot of statistical tests, some of which we all use every day. Statistical tests are important to data science because we often need to know the significance of something\u2019s value.", "Lesser-known is a cool test called the Signs test, pioneered in the early 1700\u2019s by John Arbuthnot, a Scottish physician who is also responsible for essentially creating early ways to combat smallpox. The signs test uses statistical distribution and counts of symbols as a precursor to a statistical test.", "Rather conveniently, the signs test is available in Lathe, and with that, we can observe the source. The first step of the signs test is to subtract the two arrays we are testing. This is done quite easily in Julia, by just using the .- operator:", "Next, we have to find out what values are positive, and what values are negative. We can figure this out by using conditionals to see if a number is less than or great than zero. There is likely a far more concise way to do this, but typically the performance hit isn\u2019t too bad using this loop:", "You could likely very easily use Julia\u2019s filter!() method for this instead; filtering values that are less than, greater than, or equal to 0. Now as for our zeroes and our negatives,", "We actually don\u2019t need them. The only values that we need are n (the sample size), and x (the number of positives.) We can calculate n and x like this:", "The next step is to plug n and x into binomial distribution. The function below is similar to what we should have now:", "In order to calculate binomial probability and binomial distribution, we need to be able to calculate factorials. This is a huge downer for the signs test, as factorials are a surprisingly complex and intensive computing problem. In Python, you can import the factorial function from scipy.special. The problem? Well, any number above around 23 will return infinite. This is because a factorial of 4 even is a lot of multiplication:", "And that multiplication grows exponentially at an alarming rate, take 7 for example:", "That\u2019s a difference of 5015 from a 3 number gap. Plugging factorial of 20 for example into the calculator on Google renders us a very very large number.", "The issue with this is that typically in Data Science, our sample size is a lot more than 20. The looping to create a factorial function in the first place is incredibly thought-provoking, and paradoxical. The language I\u2019m working in, Julia, uses a factorial lookup table that cannot go over 20. This entire thing makes the whole test kind-of incomprehensive, and not all that viable for Data Science. If you\u2019d like to read more about this issue in Julia, I\u2019ve written an entire article on it here. The promise with Julia and facing this issue is Julia\u2019s big float type, which is highly accurate and could hold enough digits to have an actual factorial, so long as the function was manual and not on a factorial table lookup. I may invest time into this into the future, but only time will tell\u2026", "Digressing beyond this major issue with the test, the formula for binomial distribution is rather simple. Read aloud, it is the factorial of n divided by the factorial of x multiplied by n minus x. In a better light, here it is written out:", "So with that in mind, we can grab our x and n from the signs test we performed, and then get the factorials for them. In Julia, this is done with factorial():", "And then it\u2019s as easy as plugging our variables into the formula:", "Coming out to a final function something like this\u2026", "We now have a function to do the signs test. The signs test is surprisingly unknown, and is certainly a lot more fun to perform with a calculator than a programming language. I can only hope as more and more statistical tests get written into various languages, the classic signs test still remains. The signs test is simple, given that we can calculate it in only a few lines of code (especially without that ugly for loop I\u2019m too lazy to fix.) In the future, it would be interesting to see more people know about this test and more clever adoption across the board.", "Your home for data science.
