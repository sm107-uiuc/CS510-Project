Fast forward to today, and I have completed courses in deep learning, got into the top 10% of a simple machine learning competition and obtained the AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification. This experience has been both challenging and rewarding, and I am eager to share my insights and growth with others who are just starting their ML journey. Here is my original article with updates for 2022.", "Keen to understand more about this field and it\u2019s potential I was quickly overwhelmed in detail. Machine learning is a vast topic, and it was quite daunting to know where to begin. Do you start with the maths or the code? Do I need a PhD?", "After a false start, there were three things I learned: Don\u2019t try and learn this fast, start with some good learning material and practice, practice, practice. These are relatively obvious, but in my eagerness, to progress, I lost sight of these study principles.", "Artificial Intelligence is everywhere, and companies are betting their operating model on it. AI will enrich our lives while taking our jobs, it\u2019s the hottest topic in business, and there is already a shortage of skills. I felt it was time to get a better technical understanding of this field, starting with Machine Learning.", "Kai-Fu Lee author of AI Superpowers describes the current moment as \u201cthe age of implementation\u201d, where the technology starts \u201cspilling out of the lab and into the world.\u201d Finding the right level of Machine Learning information was difficult. There were either the high-level documents which overlay generalised Machine Learning or detailed explanations. It resulted in much mathematics, long equations and Machine Learning concepts that are hard to understand in isolation.", "I have always had a strong desire for continuous learning, and I saw Machine Learning as a new challenge and opportunity for growth.", "To use Machine Learning as a tool that can augment human capabilities, translating theory into practice to solve real problems.", "I started with this course because I\u2019ve had taken Frank Kane\u2019s courses before, and I liked the practical approach. His experience with Amazon and IMDB provides real-world examples where Machine Learning can be applied. The course doesn\u2019t have academic, deeply mathematical coverage of Machine Learning algorithms, the focus is on a broad practical understanding, and it\u2019s the application.", "This course will teach you techniques to select and clean your data, supervised and unsupervised Machine Learning algorithms, how to evaluate metrics, deep learning and neural networks. The course does provide an overview of Python, which was enough, but non-coders should consider a Python course before this. Frank covers almost all topics of which you need to be aware of before diving deep into this field.", "As I was new to Python, I took this course to tailor my Python skills towards data science. There are a few Python specialisations. As I didn\u2019t want to focus on a particular platform, this one drew my attention because it wasn\u2019t (IBM/Google/AWS). It\u2019s a five-course specialisation that focuses on the programming rather than the theory or mathematics.", "The course taught me data manipulation and data cleaning techniques, plotting and data representation. IT covers Machine Learning, Natural Language processing and social network, graph theory with Python libraries scikit-learn, Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) and NetworkX.", "Each course builds on the other, and you will be building on the techniques as you progress through the series. The assignments are peer-graded, giving you different perspectives on how people approach the same problem.", "My motivation for Andrew NG\u2019s course was to understand what\u2019s under the hood of Machine Learning and the intuition behind the algorithms. This course is cited as one of the best introductions on the theory and concepts behind Machine Learning. It covers supervised learning, unsupervised learning, deep networks and the best practice without overwhelming you with the underlying mathematics.", "You don\u2019t need in-depth knowledge of linear algebra or calculus to complete the course. Still, if you want to study mathematics, this course will provide the foundations for further training. Programming assignments are in Octave or Matlab. While it would have been better in Python, it was very satisfying to code an actual algorithm and see it work. This level of detail helps you to understand Python Machine Learning libraries like scikit-learn better.", "There is an outstanding community around this course. The forums provide detailed explanations for many of the problems you will encounter, and it was the perfect complement to the more practical courses I took.", "As I was starting out in Machine Learning, my goal was to learn enough mathematics to understand and code the algorithms. I took the approach to learn mathematics on demand, first familiarising myself with the algorithms, then studying the mathematics behind them and finally translating the algorithms to code. I ended up with an understanding of basic linear algebra and essential calculus and a right balance of theory and practice.", "If mathematics is a challenge, start by learning Linear Regression and Logistic Regression algorithms. These will introduce you to the cost/loss function and gradient descent and provide a foundation for other algorithms. One good tip was to work out the algorithms in Excel, this helped me get over some of the more challenging concepts.", "That said, mathematics is only one part of the overall application of Machine Learning. Having been in the industry for many years, I tend to agree that for practitioners, the main prerequisite for Machine Learning is data analysis. That\u2019s where domain experience domain expertise trumps the mathematics. Being able to identify a problem, selecting objectives and metrics, gathering and cleaning the data forms the greater part of a Machine Learning application.", "Initially coding the algorithms is frustrating but keep at it because it helps reinforce the understanding. If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Python, I would recommend starting with additional courses. Ones that cover pandas for data manipulation and analysis, numpy for multi-dimensional arrays and matrices and matplotlib for data visualisation. That will give you the foundations to complete the courses mentioned above and start your Python Machine Learning journey.", "Artificial intelligence has the potential to improve our lives substantially. It is essential to remember that AI is designed and created by humans for humans. Human-centred design is an approach that puts people at the forefront of the design process. When applied to AI, this approach ensures that AI products and services focus on human connection, experience, and needs.", "Human design involves empathy, definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing. This process encourages collaboration, experimentation, and iteration to arrive at human-centred and innovative solutions that are desirable, feasible, and viable.", "If you are looking to build your digital business, please connect me here David Kolb or email me here david@davidkolbconsultancy.com", "You can follow the progress of deep learning in the next blog post. Starting out in Deep Learning.", "To supplement my studying, I used these audio podcasts.", "Machine Learning Guide, an excellent supplement to the training courses.", "Data sceptic podcast, nice mini-episodes that cover Machine Learning concepts.", "TWIML (This Week in Machine Learning), Good conversations with industry practitioners.", "Stack-overflow for when your Python code just doesn\u2019t work", "Towards data science on Medium has a large digest of all Machine Learning topics at various levels.", "Kaggle is online community of data scientists and Machine Learning practitioners, you can also take part in their competitions to test your mastery.", "3BLUE1BROWN SERIES if you really want to go deeper into Linear Algebra and Calculus.", "Cassie Kozyrkov on Medium, for a no nonsense view of Machine Learning.", "Khan Academy for an alternative view on linear Algebra and Calculus.", "Your home for data science.
