In most of the conversations that our algorithms will need to work with, people will interrupt each other and cutting the audio between sentences won\u2019t be a trivial task.", "In addition to that, in many applications we will want to identify multiple speakers in a conversation, for example when writing a protocol of a meeting. For such occasions, identifying the different speakers and connect different sentences under the same speaker is a critical task.", "Speaker Diarization is the solution for those problems. With this process we can divide an input audio into segments according to the speaker\u2019s identity. It can be described as the question \u201cwho spoke when?\u201d in an audio segment.", "The first ML-based works of Speaker Diarization began around 2006 but significant improvements started only around 2012 (Xavier, 2012) and at the time it was considered a extremely difficult task. Most methods back then were GMMs or HMMs based (Such as JFA) that didn\u2019t involve any Neural-Networks.", "A really big breakthrough happened with the release of LIUM, an open-source software dedicated to speaker diarization that was written in Java. For the first time there was an freely distributed algorithm that could perform that task with reasonable accuracy. The algorithm in the core of LIUM is a complex mechanism that combines GMM with I-Vectors, a method that used to have state of the art results in speaker recognition tasks.", "Today, such systems of complex multi-part algorithms are being replaced with neural-networks in many different domains such as Image Segmentation and even Speech Recognition.", "A recent breakthrough was published in 2017 by D. Snyder, D. Garcia-Romero, D. Povey, and S. Khudanpur in an article named \u201cDeep Neural Network Embeddings for Text-Independent Speaker Verification\u201d that presented a model that will later be named \u201cX-Vectors\u201d.", "In that method the input of the network is the raw audio in the form of MFCC. Those features are fed into a Neural Network that can be partitioned into four parts:", "The real power of the X-Vectors isn\u2019t (only) in classifying the different speakers, but also its use of the two Fully connected layers as embedded representation of the entire segment. In the article they use these representations to classify an entirely different dataset from the dataset that they trained on. They first created the embedding for each new audio sample and then classified them with an PLDA backend similarity metric.", "After we understood that we can use these embeddings as a representation of the speaker in each audio sample, we can see how that representation can be used to segment sub-parts of an audio sample. That method is described in the article \u201cDiarization is Hard: Some Experiences and Lessons Learned for the JHUTeam in the Inaugural DIHARD Challenge\u201d. The DIHARD challenge was especially hard because it contained 10 diverse audio domains ranging from TV-shows to Phone calls to conversations between children and in addition to that there were extra 2 domains that appeared only in the validation set.", "In the article, they described many practices which brought their diarization algorithms to their current state of the art level. Although using different techniques (like Variational Bayes) improved the accuracy of the model dramatically it was essentially based on the same X-Vectors embedding and PLDA Backend.", "First of all, If you haven\u2019t used Kaldi before I highly recommend reading my first article about using Kaldi. It\u2019s hard to start using the system without experience with Speech recognition systems.", "Secondly, you don\u2019t need to re-train the X-Vectors network or the PLDA backend, you can just download them from the official site. If you still want to perform a full training from scratch you can follow the call_home_v2 recipe in the Kaldi project.", "Now that you have a model, whether you\u2019ve created the model or pretrained it, I will go through the different parts of the Diarization process. This walkthrough is adapted from the different comments at GitHub, mainly the one by david, and the documentation.", "You\u2019ll first need to have a normal wav.scp and segments file, in the same way as in an ASR project. If you want an easy way to create such a file you can always use the compute_vad_decision.sh script and then the vad_to_segments.sh script on the output. If you don\u2019t want to divide your audios, just map the segments to utterances from start to end.", "Next, You\u2019ll need to create an utt2spk file that will map segments to utterances. you can do that simply in Linux by running the command awk \u2018{$1, $2}\u2019 segments > utt2spk. Next, to create the other necessary files just put all the files in one folder and run the fix_data_dir.sh script.", "Now you\u2019ll need to create the features for the audio that will later be the inputs for your X-Vectors extractor.", "We will start with Creating the MFCC&CMVN in the same way as in an ASR project. Note that you\u2019ll need to have a mfcc.conf file that is matching the training you had. If you used the pre-trained model use these files.", "For the MFCC creation run the following command:", "And then for the CMVN run this command:", "After finishing the data use utils/fix_data_dir.sh $data_dir to fix the data directory and then move the segments file to the CMVN directory with cp $data_dir/segments $cmn_dir/ and after that, fix the CMVN directory again with utils/fix_data_dir.sh $cmn_dir .", "The next phase will be to create the X-Vectors for your data. I refer here to the export folder where you have the X-Vectors as $nnet_dirif you downloaded that from Kaldi website use the path \u201cexp/xvectors_sre_combined\u201d and then run that command:", "Notice that in this example we are using a window of 1.5 seconds with 0.75 seconds shift of each window. lowering the shift might help to capture more details.", "Now you\u2019ll need to score the pair-wise similarity between the X-Vectors with the PLDA backend. Do that with following command:", "The last part will be to cluster the PLDA scores you\u2019ve created. Luckily there is also a script for that. But, You can do that in two ways, in a supervised way and in an unsupervised way.", "in the supervised way you\u2019ll need to state how many speakers are in each utterance. It\u2019s especially easy when you\u2019re working with a phone call that essentially only has two speakers, or with a conference meeting with a known number of speakers. To cluster the scores in a supervised way you\u2019ll first need to create a file that maps the utterances from the wav.scp file to the number of speakers in that utterance. the file should be named reco2num_spk and should look something like this:", "An important note is that you need to map each utterance by the number of speakers and not each segment. After you\u2019ve created the reco2num_spk file you can run the following command:", "If you don\u2019t know the number of speakers that each utterance has you can always run the clustering in an unsupervised way and try to tune the threshold in the script. A good starting value will be 0.5. To cluster in an unsupervised way use the same script but in the following way:", "After clustering you\u2019ll have an output file named rttm in the $nnet_dir/xvectors/plda_scores_speakers directory. The file will look something like this:", "In that file the 2nd column is the recording-id from the wav.scp file, the 4th column is the start time of the current segment, the 5th column is the size of the current segment and the 8th column is the ID of the speaker in that segment.", "And with that, we\u2019ve completed the Diarization process! We can now try to use speech recognition techniques to determine what each speaker said or use speaker verification techniques to validate if we know any of the different speakers.", "If you liked what you read you can always follow me on Twitter or leave me a comment in here.
