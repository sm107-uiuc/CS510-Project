Crypto transforms electricity very efficiently into a lot of heat. So, used wisely, data mining could be much more efficient because heating bills could be offset.", "The Blockchain will also allow the distribution of many database operations from expensive locations to remote locations, providing not only energy benefits.", "To create Bitcoin, tons of servers, the \u201cmining machines\u201d, are connected to the cryptocurrency network. They are responsible for checking the transactions made by people who exchange Bitcoin. It is, therefore, the total power (and consumption) of computers connected to the system that explains the delirious carbon footprint of this system.", "The Bitcoin network has indeed a problem of energy consumption. It consumes a lot of energy despite processing less than 100 million financial transactions a year. A figure to compare to that of the conventional financial industry, which processes 500 billion transactions per year. And if we consider the amount of energy used by data centers, Bitcoin consumes much more energy per transaction than all the banks in the world combined.", "It is no more a surprise that mining cryptocurrencies use more energy than mining for gold. Well-Known researches and notably one published in Nature at the end of last year has confirmed that.", "For dollar value produced, the computer-intensive process of \u201cmining\u201d digital currency consumes more energy than physically mining gold, platinum or rare-earth metals. The study in Nature had made an interesting quantification of energy and carbon costs for mining cryptocurrencies. Only Aluminum mining was consuming more per US$ created that the mining of the main cryptocurrencies.", "Mining for precious metals is hard work, involving massive machines, huge smelters and harsh chemicals to extract resources like gold and copper. On the crypto mining side, a lot of \u2018virtual\u2019 work goes into mining digital currencies. Many digital currencies \u2014 Bitcoin is the most famous example \u2014 are produced by having computers grind away at ever more difficult mathematical problems.", "As digital currencies like Bitcoin get more popular, the energy requirements will only rise \u2014 and not only because of the increased interest in mining. The concern is not just for the amount of energy consumed, but also for the volume of climate-warming carbon emissions this energy represents.", "Recall that large computing power is needed, both to manage the flow of Bitcoin, but also to mine. The good functioning of this cryptocurrency thus explodes the power consumption. Another study by the Scientific Journal Joule also estimates that the electricity used for Bitcoin would produce 22 megatonnes of CO2 per year, a figure very close to that of countries like Jordan or Sri Lanka. What is the environmental impact of cryptocurrencies? To this question, the University of Cambridge is trying to answer in part by proposing the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index tool.", "The University of Cambridge tool models the operation of bitcoin miners around the world. It uses an average electricity cost of approximately 0.05 per kilowatt-hour and the energy needs of the Bitcoin network. Finally, assumes that all Bitcoin mining machines in the world operate with different efficiencies.", "The latter displays every thirty seconds worldwide consumption related to Bitcoin. At the time these lines are written, the star cryptocurrency would consume 7.23 gigawatts, for an annual total estimated at 61.88 Twh (terawatts/hour) \u2026 more than Switzerland, Kuwait, Greece or Algeria, but slightly less than the Czech Republic or Austria.", "Last year, OpenAI published an analysis that documents an explosion in computing power over the past six years, which is driving advances in artificial intelligence. Compute power used in the largest AI training runs, the piece found, has doubled every 3.5 months since 2012.", "The following chart shows the total amount of computing that was used to train selected results that are relatively well known, used a lot of computing for their time, and gave enough information to estimate the compute used. A petaflop/s-day (pfs-day) consists of performing 1015 neural net operations per second for one day, or a total of about 1020 operations. This compute-time parameter serves as a mental convenience, similar to kW-hr for energy. And by the way, energy consumption tends to increase proportionally to petaflops\u2026", "Improvements in computing have been a key component of AI progress, so as long as this trend continues, it\u2019s worth preparing for the implications of systems far outside today\u2019s capabilities. But the improvement also needs to be done on the energy supply for AI and Machine Learning as well.", "If not well organized, Artificial intelligence will create exactly the same problems as cryptocurrencies using energy, but even bigger.", "AI uses identical or similar chip technologies and therefore produces similar amounts of heat per device. Simply eliminating the heat produced or worse by using air conditioning to cancel it is a horribly primitive solution. This current approach to removing free but unwanted energy should disappear after the deployment of the first generation of these technologies. If not, what we see with the crypto-actives will be small compared to the heat rejections numbers we\u2019ll be facing with power consumption and all the connected objects required by AI, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics that we see upcoming.", "Since, the energy in all its from worth money, the heat rejections should be used as an energy resource and not as a pure waste of energy.", "So, let\u2019s change the energy challenges into opportunities and come with solutions. Great options are given by a combination of clean technologies including Artificial Intelligence, Renewables and Hybrid Energy Storage. Exploiting the waste energy recovery and conversion of heat generated by the mining operation to provide a source of energy. Many options are discussed in previous articles:", "At a time when the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) keeps repeating its calls for caution in the face of global warming, the use of this energy-consuming technology is clearly questioned.", "Solutions already exist to imagine a \u201cgreen\u201d cryptocurrency, based on a \u201cproof of space/proof of time\u201d security. It is therefore relevant to question the involvement of public authorities in the development of these green technologies.", "So, let\u2019s start right now to improve while this sector is still in its infancy. This will, in turn, be absolutely useful to harness the energy challenges that we see upcoming for the growing use of AI, Machine Learning, Predictive Analytics, etc.", "The author, Stephane Bilodeau, ing., P.Eng, PhD, FEC, is an entrepreneur in cleantech, working and teaming on innovation, notably in energy storage, renewables, and artificial intelligence.
