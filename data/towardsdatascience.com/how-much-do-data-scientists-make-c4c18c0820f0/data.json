I looked at over 1,400 self-reported salaries from levels.fyi in order come up with the following breakdown:", "If you\u2019re satisfied with the above, feel free to move on to whatever else you had planned in the day! But if you had five minutes to spare \u2014 I\u2019ll go through some interesting insights I found from breaking out the compensation data, as well as some caveats to this self-reported dataset.", "Typically, a data scientist\u2019s salary will consist of three key parts:", "For this article, I am defining compensation / total compensation to be the sum of the parts three above.", "I\u2019m using levels.fyi, a place that collects user-reported compensation across many different roles in tech. As of this article date (November 2020), there were 1,400 self-reported data points that I used for this analysis. The screenshot below shows the type of data that is available alongside compensation \u2014 we\u2019ll look at each of these categories in more detail in the following sections.", "For this article, I collected and cleaned the data using R (source code here). I recommend you play around this website for yourself, especially if you\u2019re reading this article a few months after it was published!", "Out of the 1,400 self-reported data points, 90% of the roles were based within the United States. Because the data for outside-of-US roles is so sparse, I\u2019ll focus this article on US-based roles only.", "Geography-wise, even within the US, we see that a three-fourths of the roles are focused in just three major tech hubs:", "Not too surprising, as this is where most of the major tech companies are headquartered or have a large office in. Google, Facebook, Apple, Netflix, and Uber are all headquartered here.", "Contains Microsoft and Amazon, which make up a majority of the responses here.", "Most larger tech companies will have a sizable office here, so having NYC on this list is not too surprising.", "If we wanted to break this out by individual cities, we have the graph below \u2014 outside of the major tech hubs, we see that several other major metro areas appear.", "This section goes hand-in-hand with the previous section. Large companies make up a disproportionate share of the data science positions, and the data below confirms that. In addition, most companies are tech companies \u2014 the only companies below that are not explicitly tech are Capital One, JPMorgan Chase, and Booz Allen Hamilton. 40% of the data comes from just 6 companies: Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Google, Apple, and Uber.", "Another way to look at these companies is to look at the type of employees that are reporting their compensation at each of these places. If we look at the average data scientist at each of these companies, here is what they look like in terms of their years of experience as well as their compensation.", "Some interesting callouts from the graph above:", "Compensation increases gradually with experience \u2014 the graph below tells the complete story. But to summarize:", "To add another dimension to the above, let\u2019s focus only on median compensation and each of its components. The general trend as one becomes more experienced is that equity and bonuses become a larger component of their compensation package.", "Of course, the graphs above are only as good as the data underlying it. Below, we see how many people reported compensation info for each YOE bucket. The coverage here is decent \u2014 for some of the smallest buckets, we have over 50 respondents, and in most categories we have over 100.", "Fun Fact: One interesting tidbit to point out here is that data science is a relatively new career path that came to prominence in the age of big data. Because the need for data literacy is going to more important than ever moving forward, I\u2019d be curious to see how compensation rises or falls to the demand and supply of data scientists in the upcoming years.", "So we\u2019ve talked about compensation as a function of experience, as well as the companies that dominate this list. The next logical step is to try to compare compensation at these key companies!", "Before jumping into compensation at the major tech companies, I wanted to talk about levels. At tech companies, talking about compensation only makes sense if you\u2019re talking about it in the context of levels. Levels are determined based on years of experience, interview performance, as well as previous roles/education. For each level, you\u2019ll have a set of expectations as well as a compensation range.", "At Facebook, their entry-level data science position would be for IC3. From this dataset of 11 responses, we can assume that Facebook paid $144k-$190k in total comp for a data scientist coming in as an IC3.", "Now that we have this concept of leveling, the graph below shows how different levels compare at the six major tech companies. I think this is one of the most interesting insights from this entire article as we can normalize salaries across major companies using comparable years of experience. Two key callouts:", "You may have stumbled upon this article after you looked through a few other articles about this same topic. When I do my own Google search, I see a pretty big range of salaries ranging from $85k \u2014 $130k. The numbers in this article are a little higher, however there are several reasons for this:", "In other words, when we consider the above three callouts, a more accurate title for this article would actually be:", "How much do data scientists make at Big Tech companies in major tech hubs (Silicon Valley, Seattle, NYC)?", "But that title is too long\u2026 so I went with a shorter version.", "Hopefully you found this article informative and interesting. When I first thought about pursuing a career in data science, there weren\u2019t many good resources on compensation, so I would have really appreciated an article like this. Having previously worked at companies that encouraged salary transparency, I have the mindset that increased transparency around this touchy topic is a good thing. So this is my contribution towards that effort!", "If you enjoyed this article, you may also enjoy a similar analysis I did for product manager compensation:", "Your home for data science.
