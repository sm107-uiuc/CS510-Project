What if you can use TensorFlow from anywhere without the hassle of setting up the environment? Better yet, what if you can use GPU to train your Deep Learning models for free?", "Google Colaboratory (Colab)is the answer! It is a very exciting technology that allows Data Scientists to focus on building Machine Learning models instead of the logistics!", "In this article, we\u2019ll not only walk through the basics of using Colab, but also help you get started with TensorFlow with easy to understand examples.", "When using Colab for the first time, you can launch a new notebook here:", "Once you have a notebook created, it\u2019ll be saved in your Google Drive (Colab Notebooks folder). You can access it by visiting your Google Drive page, then either double-click on the file name, or right-click, and then choose \u201cOpen with Colab\u201d.", "The builders of Colab are so thoughtful that they even baked in the functionality of committing to Github.", "To connect with GitHub, you first need to create a repo with a master branch on GitHub. Then, from the drop-down menu, select \u201cFile \u2014Save a copy in GitHub\u201d. You will be asked to authorize only for the first time. What\u2019s handy is that it even allows you to include an \u201cOpen in Colab\u201d button in your notebook like this:", "To turn on GPU for your Deep Learning projects, just go to the drop-down menu and select \u201cRuntime \u2014 Change runtime type \u2014 Hardware accelerator\u201d and choose GPU:", "For the most part, it\u2019s exactly the same with a local Jupyter Notebook. For example, to run a code cell, you can just press \u201cShift + Enter\u201d. Check out the below frequently used keyboard shortcuts (on Windows using Chrome):", "You can also upload data to your Colab folder. See image below:", "TensorFlow bases its name on the word \u201ctensor\u201d. What is a tensor anyway? In short, a multi-dimensional array. Let\u2019s see what that means!", "In TensorFlow jargons, a scalar is a rank 0 tensor, a vector is rank 1 and matrix rank 2 etc. There are three frequently used types of tensors: constant, variable, and placeholder which are explained below.", "Constants are exactly what their names refer to. They are the fixed numbers in your equation. To define a constant, we can do this:", "Aside from the value 1, we can also provide a name such as \u201ca_var\u201d for the tensor which is separate from the Python variable name \u201ca\u201d. It\u2019s optional but will be helpful in later operations and troubleshooting.", "After defining, if we print variable a, we\u2019ll have:", "Variables are the model parameters to be optimized, for example, the weights and biases in your neural networks. Similarly, we can also define a variable and show its contents like this:", "But it\u2019s important to note that all variables need to be initialized before use like this:", "You might have noticed that the values of a and b, i.e., integers 1 and 2 are not showing up anywhere, why?", "That\u2019s an important characteristic of TensorFlow \u2014 \u201clazy execution\u201d, meaning things are defined first, but not run. It\u2019s only executed when we tell it to do, which is done through the running of a session! (Note that TensorFlow also has eager execution. Check here for more info)", "Now let\u2019s define a session and run it:", "Notice that within the session we run both the initialization of variables and the calculation of c. We defined c as the sum of a and b:", "This, in TensorFlow and Deep Learning speak, is the \u201ccomputational graph\u201d. Sounds pretty sophisticated, right? But it\u2019s really just an expression of the calculation we want to carry out!", "Another important tensor type is the placeholder. Its use case is to hold the place for data to be supplied. For example, we defined a computational graph, and we have lots of training data, we can then use placeholders to indicate we\u2019ll feed these in later.", "Let\u2019s see an example. Say we have an equation like this:", "Instead of one single x input, we have a vector of x\u2019s. So we can use a placeholder to define x:", "We also need the coefficients. Let\u2019s use constants:", "Now let\u2019s make the computational graph and provide the input values for x:", "And finally, we can run it:", "Now that we have the basics of TensorFlow, let\u2019s do a mini project to build a linear regression model, aka, a neural network :) (The code is adapted from the example given in TensorFlow\u2019s guide here)", "Let\u2019s say we have a bunch of x, y value pairs, and we need to find the best fit line. First, since both x and y have values to be fed in the model, we\u2019ll define them as placeholders:", "The number of rows is defined as None to have the flexibility of feeding in any number of rows we want.", "Next, we need to define a model. In this case here, our model has just one layer with one weight and one bias.", "TensorFlow allows us to define neural network layers very easily:", "The number of units is set to be one since we only have one node in the hidden layer.", "Furthermore, we need to have a loss function and set up the optimization method. The loss function is basically a way to measure how bad our model is when measured using the training data, so of course, we want it to be minimized. We\u2019ll use the gradient descent algorithm to optimize this loss function (I\u2019ll explain gradient descent in a future post).", "Then we can initialize all the variables. In this case here, all our variables including weight and bias are part of the layer we defined above.", "Lastly, we can supply the training data for the placeholders and start the training:", "and we can get the weights and make the predictions like so:", "If you are curious like me, you can verify to confirm the model did make the predictions using its trained weight and bias by:", "which gives us exactly the same result!", "Voila! A simple neural network built using TensorFlow in Google Colab! Hope you find this tutorial interesting and informative.", "The notebook containing all the code can be found here. Do give it a try!", "Cloud computing is definitely the future of Deep Learning computing. Google Colab is clearly a future-ready product. It\u2019s hard to imagine people still wanting to spend time setting up Deep Learning environments when we can just fire up a notebook on the cloud and start building models!", "Your home for data science.
