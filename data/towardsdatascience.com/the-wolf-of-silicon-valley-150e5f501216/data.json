Turns out, the phenomenon generalizes to people as well. Every one of us data scientists in Silicon Valley has a doppelg\u00e4nger in Wall Street.", "Nobody grows up yearning to shuffle numbers around twelve hours a day, only eight of which you actually get paid for. Most grow up aspiring to become scientists. Some look into social sciences, for they want to weed out poverty for us all. They\u2019re quickly convinced by Goldman to start by first weeding it out for themselves. Others lean towards real sciences, for they want to know what makes the Universe tick. They end up in Mountain View, discovering what makes the customer click.", "Regardless of the side of the coast you end up on, you\u2019ll spend your days drooling over a capricious chart illustrating movements in price or loss function values. The whole gestalt of your existence will be encapsulated in this single goddamn line. It goes one way, and you\u2019ll be somebody. It goes the other, and you\u2019re better off throwing yourself out of your top-floor window. Or in case you find yourself in Google, sliding headfirst down the tube slide, bashing your brains against the technicolor floor down below.", "To hold dominion over their graphs, the wunderkinds force information into their brains so aggressively they\u2019ll inevitably drop to the floor in seizures and salivate. In money management, one must have at least two screens \u2014 one for each one of his pair of eyes \u2014 tuned to the fake news of CNBC and Bloomberg. In data science, there\u2019s always another arXiv article to be read, always another OpenAI shitpost to peruse.", "However much you read, though, there are evermore acronyms to assimilate. Most memorize the letter combinations, the more daring look up the full forms, but absolutely nobody understands the underlying concepts. In finance, you have CDOs and CDSs, the misunderstanding of which lead to social unrest in the past. In machine learning, you have DNNs, CNNs, and LSTMs, the misunderstanding of which leads to social unrest in the present, for they\u2019re labeling people of color as gorillas, and Ricky Gervais as a totalitarianist.", "Even if you don\u2019t understand the technologies in full, you\u2019re still asked to do the God\u2019s work of deploying them. On the Street, this amounts to digging ditches for the fiberoptic cables that shave five milliseconds off your stock trades. In the Valley, you\u2019ll be perennially refreshing Intel\u2019s desolate support forum, for your f***ing Neural Compute Stick was bricked right out of the box.", "If all else fails, it\u2019s always possible to sham your way to the top. Many of the most celebrated financiers \u2014 from Bernie Madoff to the prot\u00e9g\u00e9s of the three original Lehman brothers \u2014 vow by the time-tested strategy of cheating retirees out of their pension funds. We data scientists, too, bully old men by passing their work off as our own. Indeed, Gordon \u201cGreed is Good\u201d Gekko\u2019s entangled counterpart in machine learning, Richard Sutton, shares his mantra: \u201cAny policy that is greedy \u2026 is an optimal policy.\u201d", "Now, all this hustling and bustling is bound to leave you neurotic.
