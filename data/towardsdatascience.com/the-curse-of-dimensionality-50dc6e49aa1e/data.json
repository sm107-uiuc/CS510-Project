We want our information quick and to the point.", "That is the essence of dimensionality reduction. When confronted with a ton of data, we can use dimensionality reduction algorithms to make the data \u201cget to the point\u201d.", "In a previous post, I covered PCA, a powerful and versatile dimensionality reduction algorithm that unearths the underlying trends in our data. There are other options as well \u2014 such as non-negative matrix factorization, linear discriminant analysis and more (I promise to cover these in the future).", "However, today our topic is not about a specific algorithm, but rather about why we need dimensionality reduction algorithms in the first place \u2014 The Curse of Dimensionality.", "The Curse of Dimensionality sounds like something straight out of a pirate movie but what it really refers to is when your data has too many features.", "The phrase, attributed to Richard Bellman, was coined to express the difficulty of using brute force (a.k.a. grid search) to optimize a function with too many input variables. Imagine running an Excel Solver optimization where there are 100,000 possible input variables, or in other words, 100,000 potential levers to pull (pretty sure that would crash your Excel).", "In today\u2019s big data world it can also refer to several other potential issues that arise when your data has a huge number of dimensions:", "Point 2 is an important one so let\u2019s use an example to see why it occurs.", "Imagine our dataset consists of the following 8 candies.", "The ground truth is that there are two clusters within our dataset of 8 candies \u2014 spicy and sweet. So if all we cared about was getting the flavor right, how could we cluster our candies to ensure that we never accidentally give a spicy candy to our friend with the sweet tooth?", "We can cluster by color like so:", "Nice, thanks to our clustering we know that if we eat a reddish candy, it will be spicy; and if we eat a bluish candy, it will be sweet.", "But actually it\u2019s not that simple. As humans we are able to visually inspect the candies and quickly decide that red means spicy and blue means sweet. But a machine learning algorithm can only do so if the data is presented to it properly. If our data looks like the following table, then we are in luck \u2014 we have two features, reddish and bluish that produce perfect clusters of taste giving us a perfect model.", "But what if our data is high dimensional like in the next table?", "Now instead of 2 categories of colors, we have 8. How would a clustering algorithm likely interpret this? It would look at each candy and make the following conclusions:", "That\u2019s not useful at all. It is true that the candies are all different colors but this conclusion leaves us no better off than how we started. Read the last bullet again \u2014 it literally just restates what we already knew about our dataset. We have gained zero insight into how to predict whether a given candy will be spicy or sweet. So how can we fix this?", "Below is a stylized example of how dimensionality reduction works. This is not meant to explain a specific algorithm but rather it is a simple example that demonstrates some of the principles that dimensionality reduction algorithms follow.", "The algorithm starts by locating the underlying trends in our features \u2014 these can be topics such as sports or politics for text data, or the primary trend in time series data (see my Understanding PCA blog post for more details on this). For our candy dataset, the underlying trends would most likely be the primary colors red and blue. In data science, these underlying trends hidden in our features are often called latent features.", "Next, the algorithm estimates and rewrites every other feature in terms of their exposures to these latent features as in the table above.", "Let\u2019s plot each candy in terms of their latent feature exposures (the numerical values in the previous table) \u2014 recall that each candy is its own unique color:", "Nice! It\u2019s pretty clear from the plot above that using our latent features (red and blue) has allowed us to produce two meaningful clusters. Finally, we can look within each cluster and count how many candies are spicy and how many are sweet and use this frequency as the basis for our predictions.", "So our spicy/sweet model for candy would look something like the following:", "Today, we saw how having too many features can confuse certain machine learning algorithms such as clustering algorithms. And we saw how dimensionality reduction can help restore order.", "In the real world of messy, noisy data and complicated relationships (unlike with our simple candies), dimensionality reduction represents a tradeoff between a more robust model (hopefully!) and lower interpretability (my PCA blog post goes into this in more detail \u2014 check out the section titled \u201cAn Example to Tie it All Together\u201d).", "So remember that while we do have a tool for combating the Curse of Dimensionality, using that tool comes with a cost.
