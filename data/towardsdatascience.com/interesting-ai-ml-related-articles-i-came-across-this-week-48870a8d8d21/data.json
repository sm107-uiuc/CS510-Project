I have listed below the articles that stood out to me, along with reasons I believe you, the reader should give them a read.", "Be prepared to encounter writers covering topics such as:", "Tivadar Danka\u2019s article highlights some common issues that accompany the current rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence technology.", "DeepFakes, privacy issue and misinformation have been at the headlines of plenty of news and media outlets around the globe.", "Tivadar\u2019s article gives a brief insight into common forms the misuse of AI technology can take. The information provides within the article is reinforced with real-life case studies and scenarios to give the reader a sense of present danger.", "Early on in the article, there is a mention of the potential power of manipulation and misinformation DeepFakes could posses in the near future. Tivadar reinforces the misinformation potential of DeepFakes by including an actual DeepFake video(its\u2019s of someone you know).", "The issue of how human bias feeds into algorithmic bias in aspects of our lives such as job seeking, credit checks and even law enforcement are explored.", "One of the dangers highlighted by Tivadar lives within our pockets. The smartphone\u2019s facial recognition feature feeds into the danger of mass surveillance.", "I find Tivadar article relevant and interesting for two reasons.", "The first is that during the COVID-19 pandemic, one of the effective methods to reduce the spread of infection is to give up an aspect of privacy. The contact tracing method utilized in many nations has proven very effective, but can also be seen as the start to means of imposing unwanted surveillance on the masses.", "The second reason is that awareness of the dangers that algorithms and techniques that are developed by researchers and engineers need to be increased, and this article does that.", "This article is very different from the usual machine learning code walkthrough type articles I come by. I found this article pretty fun to read, and I navigated back and forth between both the article and the links to the games included.", "The article brings to light some creative and intuitive games that have been developed by Google, and are powered by AI.", "Apart from presenting how to play the games, this article provides information on how the AI behind the game functions.", "A simple explanation of machine learning techniques is explained to the reader. The article omits complex technical jargon, which makes this article a fun read for AI enthusiasts of all levels.", "The games include techniques such as object recognition, pose estimation, speech recognition and more.", "This article presents several examples of how a machine learning practitioner can get creative with the power of AI.", "Caleb Kaiser writes from his own perspective, how the technical resources within the AI industry have been democratized.", "His article touches on how resources for deep learning models are now easily accessible across the industry. And now small businesses, such as startups can leverage these resources to advance their products offerings.", "Caleb includes the fact that having a dedicated research team for the purpose of utilizing deep learning techniques is a requirement that has been eliminated with the inclusion of state of the art models and datasets in common machine learning libraries and frameworks.", "Caleb gives a number of example of how to leverage state of the art models, with included code snippets.", "I admire Calebs\u2019s writing approach to this article; he creates a David vs Goliath-like imagery as he draws side by side comparison between the resources that are available to the masses and the vast resources tech giant Google withholds.", "Reading this article provides a sense of a levelled playing field for anyone to create an amazing product with Artificial Intelligence. Caleb supports this article by listing emerging AI startup companies that have products almost rivalling top industrial competitors.", "I\u2019m quite surprised this article doesn\u2019t have more claps. It\u2019s probably the longest article I\u2019ve come across this week, but easily one of the most informative.", "Jakub Czakon explores six libraries that add a level of abstraction to the PyTorch machine learning library. Simply put, these libraries reduce the complexity that PyTorch brings to model implementation and training.", "The information provided in Jakub\u2019s article is impressively supplemented with more insight from the authors of the libraries themselves. Some of the libraries explored include Fast.ai, PyTorch Lighting, Skorch, etc.", "The author of each included library goes through a series of topic areas proposed by Jakub. Some of the areas include the philosophy of the project, ease of learning, and popularity.", "Jakub concludes the article by giving his own perspective on each of the mentioned libraries.", "I\u2019ve saved this article to my reading list, as this is timeless information and knowledge.", "Jordi TORRES.AI conjures the age-old battle between two formidable foes, TensorFlow and PyTorch.", "Machine Learning practitioners have asked the question Jordi\u2019s article is addressing. The answer is presented in a structured manner, and this is what makes Jordi\u2019s article a good read for beginners and curious learners", "Jordi pretty much answers the proposed question very early in the article.", "I won\u2019t include any spoilers here. But the article explores a variety of crucial areas that are factors for consideration when selecting an appropriate framework.", "A side by side comparison on the implementation process of typical machine learning project tasks such as model implementation, data processing and model evaluation, points out how similar the two frameworks can be.", "Jordi also mentions the point that both frameworks seem to be increasing in the number of similarities they share.", "He refers to a feature released recently in TensorFlow that shares similar functionality to methods within the PyTorch library. Jordi speaks about the reason for the similarities and how the future might look for both frameworks.", "Although the article highlights key similarities, Jordi mentions a key distinction machine learning practitioners should be aware of when making a selection.", "The article concludes with a statement on the importance of understanding deep learning concepts, as opposed to focusing on which framework to choose.", "Remember, frameworks come and go, ideologies and concepts stay.", "Your home for data science.
