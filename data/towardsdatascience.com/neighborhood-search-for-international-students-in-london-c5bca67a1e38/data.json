According to 2018/2019 statistics from the Higher Education Statistics Agency, 485,645 international students were pursuing their degree in the UK, of which 125,035 were studying in the capital- London.", "Moving to London to pursue their studies, these international students have queries related to accommodation- one important one is \u201cWhich neighborhood should I consider for accommodation?\u201d Finding suitable housing in the UK is not easy. Especially in the cities where the most popular universities are located, which makes access to student accommodation somewhat tedious as well as costly. Students prefer to stay close to their universities and in areas which are easily accessible by public transport. When I came to London to pursue my Masters at Imperial College Business School, I had the same questions: Which neighborhoods are close to the university? Is the neighborhood well connected?", "In this project, I will be addressing this by exploring the Neighborhoods in the vicinity of a particular college. The solution is designed for the international candidates moving to London for pursuing their studies. The code is available in GitHub.", "Coming from a technology background and transitioning into the world of Data Science, this project is the stepping stone, utilizing the knowledge gained through the IBM Data Science Certification course.", "For this project I will be using the following data:", "Adding the PTAL score to the Postal Code data set:", "I have selected the first Institute \u201cThe Royal Veterinary College\u201d from our previous data set to explore its neighborhood more for exploring the venues. There are 38 different area codes around 5km radius of this college. Adding in the postal code data to the institute data:", "One-hot encoding for the venue categories and PTAL: Using one-hot encoding technique to assign numerical values to categorical variables- Venue categories and PTAL :", "Then grouping the encoded data set by \u201cArea code\u201d to get the means of the venue categories and PTAL of each of the 38 area codes:", "Get the top 10 venues in each area-code which will assist the students to know what the top category of venue are available in the area-code.", "I want to group our area-codes into subsets based on the venue categories and PTAL, hence we use the K-means modelling technique to get our clusters.", "Finding the optimal k-value for training the data: I am using the elbow method to get to the optimal value. The first graph obtained below tells us that the elbow point is 3 (left), however, to confirm it we create another graph till value 6 (right).", "Using k-means =3, to fit the model on to the following data:", "The 38 area-codes around the Royal Veterinary College are clustered into three groups, which can be visualized below:", "The first cluster has neighborhoods with the highest PTAL score (6b)", "The second cluster has good connectivity score (6a)", "The final cluster has medium connectivity (3,4,5)", "The clustering technique clearly divided the neighborhoods into 3 clusters mainly based on the PTAL score, which assesses the level of walking distances to transport stops and stations, including measuring the level of transport service and wider connectivity.", "Clustering the neighborhoods based on their connectivity, with Clusters 0 and 1, having the highest(6b) and good (6a) than Cluster 2 which has medium level of connectivity.", "A bar chart representing the distribution of neighborhoods around The Royal Veterinary College clearly shows that most of the neighborhoods have the best network connectivity and would be the most preferable locations.", "Further look at the nearby venues listed; we see that most of the neighborhoods are well distributed in respect of food joints. Based on these groupings a student can select the neighborhood that appeals to their preferences. A student who is a fitness enthusiast and wants to live in a neighborhood with wider connectivity can search for accommodations in neighborhoods -NW1 3, W1T 7 of Cluster 0.", "While this project was done to assist students /prospects of The Royal Veterinary College, this could be extended to other Institutes. The methodology is not limited to institutions but could be used to get the same results for anyone exploring nearby neighborhoods around a location such as near offices.", "This project could be further refined, by taking more factors into consideration to get more granularity in the output, such as Average Rent depending on the house type, Crime Rate in each Outcode of the neighborhood, Average distance from the University. Taking these factors into consideration will enhance the results for the students to pin down exact neighborhoods. Most students prefer accommodations in neighborhoods that are close to the university, have better connectivity and are safe.", "Your home for data science.
