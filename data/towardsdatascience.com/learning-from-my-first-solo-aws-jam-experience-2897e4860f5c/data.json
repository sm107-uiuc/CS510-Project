About a year later, I can confidently say that my knowledge of the (digital) cloud is a bit better: I can name some AWS services and explain their features just like I can for the clouds that appear in the sky. However, I\u2019m nowhere near ready to call myself a master (or even competent) in AWS, just like I wouldn\u2019t want anyone to ask me to accurately forecast the weather. To take a step towards cloud mastery, I decided to take part in a Jam session!", "I actually decided to sign up for many of the talks that happened at the AWS re:Invent 2020, at first because it was free this year and then because I became fascinated with how much the cloud could shape the world in the future (and how much it already had). I had worked with AWS a bit in both my internship and my full-time role, but I hadn\u2019t spent much time exploring different services outside of the ones I used.", "About an hour before the \u201cModernization and DevOps Jam\u201d, on a whim, I decided to sign up for it. Thus began the next four hours of my life in the cloud.", "AWS Jams events are designed to help individuals learn new skills and test their knowledge of the cloud. You technically don\u2019t need any knowledge about AWS whatsoever, although some knowledge at least of what AWS is and what the cloud can potentially do would be useful. There are easy, medium, and hard challenges that you can potentially split up across more and less advanced members, or you could choose to work on each one as a team.", "You can choose your team members beforehand so that you can work with friends and colleagues, or you can select your skill level and be assigned to a team with others. When the challenge begins, you\u2019ll be taken to the Jam dashboard that shows all the available challenges to complete, as well as a leaderboard with the top teams. You earn points depending on how fast you solve challenges and how many hints (or lack thereof) you use.", "I decided to sign up solo so I could see how far I\u2019d get just looking at the AWS documentation and figuring out the challenges on my own. If you\u2019re curious as to how I placed, I\u2019ve attached a screenshot of my (not very glamorous) score in the middle of this piece. Also, you don\u2019t need to pay for any of the AWS resources you use during the Jam session- just sign up and you\u2019ll get put into some test environments to complete the challenges.", "With that introduction out of the way, let\u2019s dive into my main (non-technical) takeaways from the experience! I won\u2019t be telling you things like \u201chow to add tests to CodePipeline\u201d or \u201chow to use Systems Manager with your EC2 instances\u201d (which are snippets of some of the challenges I completed). Instead, I\u2019m taking a step back and reflecting on the non-technical but still important things I learned from the Jam session.", "Sidenote: I feel like now is a good time to say that I\u2019m not affiliated with AWS in any way- these are just reflections on my experience with the event.", "Getting stuck in tutorial land is bad \u2014 Everyone, 2020", "There are a wealth of courses and tutorial videos on online platforms like Udemy and even YouTube. However, I think there comes a point when you need to stop following an exact set of steps (at least for a while) and do something completely from scratch.", "It\u2019s a different kind of learning when you finish a project by following to the letter a tutorial\u2019s steps and when you have to create something using tools you might be familiar with but in an unfamiliar setting. For AWS, this might mean using services you aren\u2019t familiar with or using services you\u2019ve worked with before in a different way.", "In the Jam session I joined, each challenge put me in an AWS environment where some services were already set up and I was tasked to reconfigure some of the services or add new components. The challenge instructions gave the end goal, but it didn\u2019t tell you exactly what to do. This is why it felt different from following a tutorial. While it\u2019s true that all the answers were in the AWS documentation, I still had to explore multiple options and fiddle with the AWS console and cry when things broke and Google what to do after things break and only after all that would I be able to sigh in relief as I completed the challenge.", "After I finished the session, it struck me that completing the different challenges forced me to learn new things. But going through four hours of focusing on AWS gave me a clearer picture of how to move forward with my AWS studying. I used maybe a dozen services and walked through implementing different configurations for DevOps and modernization related tasks. Doing the challenges gave me an insight into how people like cloud architects developers who work heavily in the cloud, which was important because even though I knew what AWS could be used for, it was another thing entirely to actually be using it.", "I was stuck on the first \u201ceasy\u201d challenge for 30 minutes because I got stuck staring at the instructions and the AWS console without doing anything. The challenge was to add tests to an existing CodePipeline and make sure it would still deploy properly. I kept flipping between tabs in AWS to figure out what to do, getting more frustrated because I didn\u2019t know where to even begin. Finally, it struck me that I should begin just by Googling the services I was supposed to be working with. After I read what CodePipeline, CodeCommit, and CodeBuild were, my brain went \u201cByron it\u2019s a PIPELINE, you need to put things INSIDE it to make it work\u201d.", "Sometimes I get stuck just looking at problems without actually looking for answers. Thankfully, unlike many high-school/university exams, when you\u2019re solving problems in real life you\u2019re allowed to use the internet! This is not to say that you shouldn\u2019t spend any time familiarizing yourself with the basics- I think it would be awkward for a software engineer to have to google \u201cwhat\u2019s a for loop\u201d or for a cloud architect to have to look up \u201cwhat\u2019s an S3 bucket\u201d every day. But I do think most people go through some process of Googling and looking up documentation when things don\u2019t work.", "I was in a one-man team for this Jam session, so I wasn\u2019t thinking about taking first or even 40th place. However, I did see that there were more than 150 teams, so my personal goal as the competition progressed was to at least place below 100. As I was working on the challenges, I\u2019d occasionally check the scoreboard to see how I was doing. In the beginning, I was happy to see myself at 93rd, but after completing two more challenges I had dropped to 105th. With only an hour left, I felt like I entered an intense state of focus (kind of like the \u201cflow\u201d that Kahneman described).", "I blew through another challenge and saw that I was back under 100! However, with only half an hour left I felt like there was more than enough time for another team to overtake me, so I pushed through the mental fatigue and began another challenge. I finished the first two parts and I couldn\u2019t figure out the final component as the last minutes ticked away.", "Ultimately, I placed 88th. It wasn\u2019t an outstanding achievement by any means, but I was happy that I hit my goal of finishing under 100.", "A few hours had passed since the Jam session started and I was stuck on the fourth challenge. I was tasked with recovering a deleted table without using a snapshot, so after reading through the Aurora documentation I quickly found that there was an option to \u201cbacktrack\u201d instead. This would allow you to revert the database to how it was at a previous time you specify. However, I couldn\u2019t figure out how to actually get into the instance where the database was hosted. It seems a bit silly now, especially after reading up on how to do it, but I\u2019d never worked with the CLI or Linux before.", "I decided to take a shower to clear my head and BOY if that wasn\u2019t one of the most relaxing warm showers I\u2019ve taken in my life. I hopped out of the shower and something clicked in my brain. After reading the question once more I realized I was supposed to use Systems Manager to get into the instance. All I needed to do was find the instance Aurora was hosted on and plug that into Systems Manager. The challenge then said I was supposed to use a stored procedure to get the answer, so after StackOverflow helped me do that, I finally got to the answer.", "I find it hard sometimes to consciously take a step away from what I\u2019m working on when I\u2019m stuck, but I\u2019ve found that doing so has allowed me to kind of restart my brain and look at whatever problem I\u2019m working on with a fresh perspective.", "Getting started with something new is exciting, but often frustrating. I went into this challenge alone and with very little experience in AWS, so doing seemingly simple things like connecting to an EC2 instance and or copy-pasting code into a Lambda function felt daunting.", "However, and I acknowledge that the following will sound a little cheesy, going through the four (and a half) challenges during the Jam session was a lot of fun! Fun doesn\u2019t necessarily mean four hours straight of laughter. To me, the experience was fun because it felt like four hours passed in a blink. The challenges I chose were difficult enough for them to be engaging but not so hard that a noob like me would be stuck on one challenge for the whole four hours.", "I also have had some intrinsic desire to learn more about the cloud already, but it wasn\u2019t enough for me to actively try to learn anything until the event came around. I think sometimes it\u2019s a bit silly to say that something is boring if you haven\u2019t tried it before, and I\u2019m definitely guilty of that. I graduated with a bachelor\u2019s in business administration, so I never thought I\u2019d be working with techy stuff and I would shy away from any assignments with coding or even Excel. I never thought that a year later, I\u2019d be programming in Python for work and willingly signing up for three weeks of AWS Re:Invent talks.", "If I had spent four hours thinking \u201cAWS sucks and I\u2019m bored and when will this end\u201d, I think I\u2019d be right to look for something else to focus on, because I had at least given it a shot. My only regret now is not having tried something like a Jam session or even just watching an introductory course on YouTube earlier.", "\u2026 so yeah try to have fun and if you\u2019re not having fun maybe try something else!", "The AWS Jam session I joined was an interesting experience, especially to go through it without a team. In hindsight, if you\u2019re thinking of doing one, I\u2019d recommend grabbing a friend who has some AWS experience. That way if you get stuck on a particularly difficult challenge, you can turn to them for help. This jam session had all challenges open at the same time, so each team member could split up the challenges and then collaborate when someone got stuck.", "With that being said, I don\u2019t regret going through the event solo, because I think experiencing the frustration of being stuck on a challenge and then finally figuring out the solution reinforced that most things CAN be solved. Sometimes it\u2019s just a matter of trying hard enough (studying in advance, praying to the StackOverflow lords, begging friends for help, etc.).", "Looking back at it, those four hours themselves may have taught me a lot, but perhaps more importantly they also opened a lot of new doors after the event ended. I had something close to a dozen tabs of documentation open after the event ended, which I kept open on purpose. I spent the evening after the challenge kind of doing that thing on Wikipedia where you keep clicking on keywords to visit more and more random pages, except in my case I was diving ever so deeper into the AWS documentation.", "I can\u2019t say I remember everything I read that evening, nor am I likely to use any more than 10% of it in the near future. But I am glad that I did it because I think the event (and the subsequent reading) jump-started my passion for learning and using the cloud.", "Best of luck in your own cloud adventures!", "Your home for data science.
