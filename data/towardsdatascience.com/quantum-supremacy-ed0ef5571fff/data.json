A huge part of finding applications of quantum computing moving forward will be comparing quantum methods to well studied classical methods that have decades of empirical evidence to support them. In many cases there are heuristic classical algorithms developed for various special cases of problems which will outperform quantum methods. However, there are also cases where quantum methods may outperform classical methods, and deciding which cases will be appropriate for quantum methods versus classical methods is a highly non-trivial problem.", "Furthermore, in some cases a minor improvement in the performance may not be worth the resources used when applying one method over the other. Perhaps the problem is more accurately solved by a classical algorithm, but the quantum algorithm may be more efficient and may take fewer resources. Perhaps in another problem, the exact opposite is true. In some cases, the cost of resources may mean sacrificing accuracy, and in other cases accuracy may be of utmost importance, for example when human lives and health are involved. It may require more resources to solve the problem using one method, but perhaps the improvement in performance means predicting cancer risk at a rate several percentage points higher translating into thousands or even millions of lives being saved.", "Approaching the problem of when to use quantum computing is, just like with other methods, an ongoing question with an answer that changes over time based on what resources are available, what question is being asked, what other methods are available, how important accuracy is, and how important the resources we have available are. Addressing this question in terms of effectiveness of the method are addressed in the following paper:", "To quantum or not to quantum: towards algorithm selection in near-term quantum optimization", "For a great short podcast on the real depth and complexity of defining how important and significant quantum supremacy is, see the MIT technology review article on The Google-IBM \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d feud. We will discuss this \u201cfeud\u201d a little more below after a short video by Google on their claims of \u201cquantum supremacy\u201d.", "Another consideration is hardware limitations that may not be present in the near future. While some circuit algorithms may be outperformed by classical algorithms and models currently, QAOA can be shown to reach the correct answer asymptotically as circuit depth is increased. Circuit depth refers to the number of gate operations that can be applied, which is related to the run time of the algorithm. Limitations due to decoherence are present in current hardware but this limit may increase drastically in the near term as quantum computing hardware improves and as more methods of quantum computing using different materials and hardware geometry and topology are discovered. Higher fidelity gate operations and quantum error correction will eventually provide fault tolerant quantum computers which can run indefinitely long computations. In this case, the asymptotically optimal answer will outperform the classical Goemans-Williamson method.", "In the above paper, it is shown even with a circuit depth of 10, the QAOA method can outperform the Goemans-Williamson method on certain classes of problems. So, it is clear further investigation of quantum methods is absolutely necessary to determine when quantum methods are necessary or beneficial, and when they are not\u2026a meta-optimization problem. As time goes on we will find ourselves faced with more and more meta-optimization problems of this kind, where humanity\u2019s biggest questions will not be how to solve the problem, but rather how to most efficiently solve the problem, and what definition of efficiency is appropriate. In other words, we must ask the question,", "\u201cWhat is the correct meta-objective function for some fixed set of circumstances?\u201d", "Even in near term problems there are situations where current quantum computers can perform calculations that simply cannot be performed by classical computers, and no matter how good our classical computers get, they will never be able to perform these computations. This brings up issues of verifiability. As an example, think of the classical example in machine learning of \u201csupport vector machines\u201d. On very low dimensional, say two dimensional data, SVMs are often drastically outperformed by other methods, as can be seen in the classifier comparison in scikit-learn. However, in high dimensional data, say greater than 12 dimensions, SVMs perform much better.", "A similar phenomenon may be observed in quantum computers, where computations that can be performed on classical computers may be a case-by-case analysis of which method performs better on a given problem, but as soon as we move into the realm where classical computers simply cannot be used due to the incredibly high dimensional Hilbert space involved, quantum computers will be necessary. However, we run into an interesting issue where results are not verifiable using classical computers. There will be problems and computations which simply cannot be run on a classical computer and there will be no way of comparing classical computers to quantum computers in these cases. Once Google claims of \u201cquantum supremecy\u201d emerged in late 2019, we entered into the realm where quantum computers are performing calculations which are either very difficult, or impossible to verify using a classical computer.", "Even though IBM claims to have found a way to heuristically simulate the calculation in about 2.5 days on one of their supercomputers, the quantum computer used by Google took about 200 seconds. This amounts to a time resource increase of about 1000. Now, imagine running a computation on a quantum computer that takes 10 days, which is typical when training machine learning models. This could amount to a computation on a classical computer that takes approximately 30 years to complete. This gap in computation time is only going to increase as the quantum computing technology improves, unless of course something astounding happens and the complexity classes collapse (for example P=NP), and we can find out how to translate the quantum algorithms to classical algorithms efficiently.", "The mathematician Peter Shor, famous within the quantum computing industry for his factoring algorithm which is touted as a way to break RSA public key cryptography, gave a lecture on the QAOA algorithm. In his lecture, he argues for usability and adaptability of quantum algorithms in general. His claim was essentially that (at least some) quantum algorithms may, in fact, be more adaptable to a wider range of problems and may also prove easier to use by non-experts who want to apply optimization or machine learning methods to solving problems they are interested in. Obviously this argument depends on the problem to be solved, the algorithm or machine learning options that are available for that kind of problem, the simplicity of those options, whether they are implemented in a user-friendly format in well-documented code, and the minimum barrier to understanding how to use the methods effectively. In the case of QAOA, there are of course many implementations which are well documented, but one could argue the same is true for the Goemans-Williamson max cut algorithm. This argument highly depends on what one means by \u201cuser-friendly\u201d and \u201cadaptability\u201d in regards to machine learning models and optimization techniques.", "At The-Singularity-Research, we are working on making quantum computing more accessible to the average person, with extensive interactive Jupyter notebooks for non-programmers and non-mathematicians. We want to make the ideas and applications widely testable, accessible, and usable. Our goal is to implement applications and algorithms from generally inaccessible research papers. We are creating user-friendly interactive notebooks using Python and quantum computing and quantum machine learning libraries and software. We are trying to do this in an educational and informative way so that learning about the technology and how to use it in a meaningful way will become much easier over time.
