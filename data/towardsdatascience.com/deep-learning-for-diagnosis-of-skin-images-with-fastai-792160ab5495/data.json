Approximation images taken with the ruler are also important for a patient already in treatment in order to allow the accompanying physician to follow the evolution of the lesion.

This normally means that the data are of bad quality and possess too much noise. In this case however, we\u2019ve already seen that we can achieve 93% accuracy with a ResNet34. So, bad data is not the case here. Another possibility is that the network has too much parameters and it is not generalizing, but adapting to individual instances of the training set, thus learning individual examples and de-generalizing.

If you want to know more about finding the best learning rates, look here:", "Bigger is not always better: in the end, the ResNet50 perfomed almost identically to the ResNet34, but took much more time to train and showed slightly worse results. It is a bad choice to begin your training space exploration with a large network model.", "Image resolution plays a role: employing twice the resolution the highest ranking competitor of the ISIC 2018 Challenge used, we obtained comparable results with a single, relatively simple, ResNet34,while that competitor employed a machine learning method on top of 18 different networks, including a huge ResNet152.", "Fast.ai is fast: Finally, compared to the other approaches, with fast.ai we were able to solve the same classification problem employing much less code while using high-level hyperparameter optimization strategies that allowed us to train much faster. At the same time, a set of high level functions allows us also to easily inspect the results both as tables and as graphs. This simplicity allowed us to experiment with three different network models and compare their results. This shows that fast.ai is a very promising alternative to more traditional CNN frameworks, especially if the task at hand is a \u201cstandard\u201d deep learning task such as image classification, object detection or semantic segmentation, that can be solved by fine-tuning off-the-shelf pre-trained network models.", "This work was the result of a collaborative effort of a team of engaged researchers besides me:", "We wish also to thank to J\u00fcrgen Kreusch <juergen.kreusch@gmail.com> and Luis Fernando Kopke <luiskopke@uol.com.br>for the stereodermoscopic material.", "[2]Kopke, L.F.
