Self-driving cars! Smart speakers! Robots stealing your job! But what if there was an AI-driven system that took you out of the world of tech and instead connected you to the natural world around you?", "That\u2019s the promise of Plantsnap, a free app that uses AI and Machine Learning to automatically identify nearly any plant, using only a smartphone photo.", "Plantsnap is simple. You open the app and are immediately taken to a camera view. Find a plant--any will do, from the cut flowers from your last dinner party to a tree growing in your backyard to something exotic growing in a botanical garden--and snap a picture of it.", "The app will mull it over for a few seconds, and return its best guess as to which plant you\u2019re seeing. For many plants, you get detailed info on their growing conditions, taxonomic data, Latin names, etc. It\u2019s like having a botanist in your pocket. You can even link to a nursery website and buy the plant if you\u2019d like one of your own.", "How does Plantsnap do it? They leverage the Machine Learning services of Imagga, a company that provides API-based visual AI services in the cloud. Plantsnap used Imagga\u2019s system to train its model on 320,000 plants. To do this, they used a training set of 90 million images \u2014 likely many from the public internet.", "From a Machine Learning perspective, this is interesting because Plantsnap is dealing with an insane number of classes. Normally, you might be categorizing photographs into just a few classes for an ML system. Maybe you would be taking photos of different kinds of manufacturing defects, and classifying them using an ML driven system. Or maybe you would be doing auto-tagging of images and would need at most a few thousand classes.", "More than 300k classes is unheard of, though. Any many plants look very similar \u2014 that\u2019s why the system is valuable because they can be quite hard to tell apart. That\u2019s likely why they needed almost 100 million images to train the system properly. Any way you cut it, that\u2019s a lot of data to feed into any Machine Learning system. To train the whole thing up, they used NVIDIA DGX stations and added in their own disambiguation processes for similar plants. The result is the user-friendly plant app anyone can download today.", "So how accurate is Plantsnap? We use it routinely in our own photography at Gado Images, and we find it reliably provides matches to the correct plant in many cases, or at least points our researchers in the right direction. Imagga says that it achieves 90% accuracy, which given the huge number of classes is really good. Plants are hard, too \u2014 even a human biologist is only right in identifying a plant about 95% of the time. So the fact that Plantsnap and Imagga have done this with Machine Learning is pretty neat.", "As a test, here is a bouquet of carnations.", "With Plantsnap, you can snap a photo of the bouquet.", "Within about 5 seconds, Plantsnap has a match. Bingo--carnations!", "Notably, Plantsnap got this one right despite their main image for carnations being a completely different color. Cut flowers are one thing, but again, we\u2019ve seen good success with wild plants, exotics and more.", "Plantsnap is free for a certain number of snaps per day. Beyond that, they charge a nominal yearly fee for unlimited use of the service.", "So does Plantsnap really use Machine Learning to make you more connected to nature? There\u2019s an obvious irony in using a cellphone app built on advanced Machine Learning and AI to connect with the natural world. But I find it really does work.", "There\u2019s something magical about seeing an interesting plant (or even a boring one), taking out your phone, snapping a picture, and instantly knowing what you\u2019re looking at. And I find that once you\u2019ve IDed a plant using the tech, it starts to become familiar, and you start to recognize it even without the app. There\u2019s milk thistle! Ah, that\u2019s a nice\u00a0Foeniculum vulgare! If you so choose, you can be \u201cthat guy\" (and yes, it\u2019s usually a guy) who bores people with plant identifications on every hike, only without the years of careful study!", "Beyond the novelty factor, there are some concrete reasons to know about plants. Ever been hiking and wondered \u201cis that thing I just touched poison ivy\"? Plantsnap will tell you! Have a plant with ominous red berries growing in your backyard? Plantsnap will tell if it\u2019s poisonous to your dog.", "It\u2019s also a really interesting case study in what\u2019s possible with Machine Learning. You wouldn\u2019t think you could train a system on 320,000 classes and get anything close to an accurate result. But Plantsnap is nearly as accurate as a specialized human. The lesson? If you\u2019re trying to solve a Machine Learning problem with a huge number of classes or a giant training data set (again, they used 90m images), don\u2019t despair \u2014 Plantsnap shows it\u2019s possible.", "If you\u2019ve ever been curious about plants--or just want to see a really cool application for powerful AI--give Plantsnap a try. And watch out for that Toxicodendron radicans!", "Your home for data science.
