The solutions to the sub-problems are then combined to give a solution to the original problem.", "If you treat an article like a bigger problem you want to solve then it makes sense to divide the article into smaller sub-problems.", "On the one hand, this creates motivation and momentum for yourself because you now have small and easy sub-problems instead of one big, monolithic problem. You can link each sub-problem to a milestone you want to achieve and therefore you are creating a way to measure your progress.", "On the other hand, dividing the article into smaller sub-problems can also mean to divide the article visually for the reader.
