That\u2019s how humanity proceeds right! Spiderman is truly a visionary when he says \u201cwith great power, comes great responsibility\u201d.", "Machine Learning is one such power that boosts our convenience from Spotify\u2019s suggestions based on our previous playlists to filtering spam and phishing emails. Though ML is an ingenious gift of advanced technology to us, it always remains in the ring succumbed by notorious malware and attacks.", "Every business develops with the Trust of its customers and investors. This trust remains in place only if the customer\u2019s data is not compromised and privacy is maintained. As we know, this has now become an uphill task with Data being the new fuel. Every organization big or small is racing against time to protect themselves and their clients from data breaches.", "In this article, I will tell you the 5 good reasons why it is high time to protect your ML systems diligently.", "1. Data Theft: We expect eCommerce to surpass the trillion-dollar mark and obviously leading to a booming increase in digital frauds too. One such fraud is card-not-present fraud (CNP) which Juniper Research report says is expected to reach $130 billion by 2023. Another alarming news is that almost fifty percent of the eCommerce companies have fallen victim to it already.", "2. Intellectual Property Theft: A patent is like a \u201cLegal Monopoly\u201d for your creativity and virtuoso (20 years by US Patent and Trademark Laws). In your corporate environment, the IP war may get worse than what is between Eminem and Iggy Azalea. These are the important forms of IP breaches seen in various sectors viz;", "a. Tech: Employees stealing computing solutions or outsourcing their work to make double paychecks.", "b. Healthcare: Healthcare workers and pharmacists billing drugs beyond their authorization capacity.", "c. Education: Someone requesting for fake student loan grants.", "d. Finance: Creation and Execution of fraudulent invoices of fake transactions.", "3. Non-Compliance: Cyber Security laws in play are nothing less than corporate liabilities that come with a lot of checks and balances vis-\u00e0-vis.", "a. Full verbatim of Privacy Policy: According to the California Online Privacy Protection Act, 2004 every company which runs an online business and website or collects customer\u2019s information (tracking or research purposes) residing in California (now covers almost the entire USA) must detail about its Privacy Policy eloquently in the website. This law explains the extent of the information collected, its purpose shared by a third party", "b. Personal data in all terms is very different than Personal Information or Personal Identifiable Information (you might have referred to them interchangeably, but each has a specific legal classification) and even the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) needs to propose its privacy laws and stand by it.", "c. Planning to spread your horizon outside the US. Great! But remember to book an appointment with your Lawyer. Data privacy laws outside the US are not parallel to US laws such as the EU\u2019s GDPR bestows its citizens the right to collect, delete their information obtained by companies; while China\u2019s data protection laws allow the Chinese government to interfere and save a copy of the source code of all software packages as well.", "4. Degraded QoS: Quality of Service sheds light on the complete performance of the computing service using which an attacker can easily transmit huge amounts of optimized grants in the system. By doing so, the attacker can decrease the QoS or enforce upturn to the human operators. A (QoS)-enabled network becomes vulnerable to another form of attack- the QoS attack. The QoS-enabled network, such as a differentiated services network, provides distinct classes of service at varying costs. This difference in the charging rates may incite a few users to steal the bandwidth or any other network-related resource.", "5. Analytics Poisoning: Data poisoning is the most potential threat vector in the financial industry, as it can pull off any AI-based security system breach. It is highly manipulative and goes unnoticed for eons while continually harming the data and breaking the trust of your clients. Forensic experts also find it extremely difficult to trace such a sophisticated yet vulnerable state vector, indicating that cloud-based infrastructure requires skilled security modules.", "In addition to good ML services, you need security which always guards and filters out the potential threats, kind of like a modern data gladiator. I hope you are now more aware of the urgent need for securing your ML systems. Good Luck!", "Learn more about what we are building at Scanta here", "Your home for data science.
