You\u2019d be surprised at how far you can get in a year.", "And so, I\u2019m presenting to you a complete 52 weeks curriculum that you can do in 2021 as a new years resolution! It is crammed and it will be a grind, but it will be worth it.", "Immediately, you\u2019ll notice that this guide does not start with machine learning, and I have good reasons for that. If you want to learn more about why machine learning comes in the later weeks, check out my article:", "A couple of notes before we dive into it:", "With that said, let\u2019s dive into it!", "Be sure to subscribe here or to my exclusive newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "Data science and machine learning are essentially a modern version of statistics. By learning statistics first, you\u2019ll have a much easier time when it comes to learning machine learning concepts and algorithms! Even though it may seem like you\u2019re not getting anything tangible out of the first few weeks, it will be worth it in the later weeks.", "Like statistics, many data science concepts build on fundamental mathematical concepts.", "In order to understand cost functions, you need to know differential calculus. In order to understand hypothesis testing, you need to understand integration. And to give more one more example, linear algebra is essential to learning deep learning concepts, recommendation systems, and principal component analysis.", "Be sure to subscribe here or to my exclusive newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "SQL is arguably the most important skill to learn across any type of data-related profession, whether you\u2019re a data scientist, data engineer, data analyst, business analyst, the list goes on.", "At its core, SQL is used to extract (or query) specific data from a database, so that you can do things like analyze the data, visualize the data, model the data, etc. Therefore, developing strong SQL skills will allow you to take your analyses, visualizations, and modeling to the next level because you will be able to extract and manipulate the data in advanced ways.", "I came across Mode\u2019s curriculum a while back and it is fantastic! So I would first get familiar with using SQL in Mode and then you\u2019ll be able to go through the topics below!", "I started with Python, and I\u2019ll probably stick with Python for the rest of my life. It\u2019s so far ahead in terms of open source contributions, and it\u2019s straightforward to learn. Feel free to go with R if you want, but I have no opinions or advice to provide regarding R.", "Arguably the most important library to know in Python is Pandas, which is specifically meant for data manipulation and analysis.", "The ability to visualize data and insights is so important because it\u2019s the easiest way to communicate intricate information and a lot of information at once. As a data scientist, you\u2019re always selling yourself and your ideas, whether your pitching a new project or convincing others why your model should be productionalized \u2014 data visualizations are a great tool to help you with that.", "There are dozens of data visualization libraries out there, but I\u2019m going to focus on two: Matplotlib and Plotly.", "The models that you create can only be as good as the data that you feed into it. To understand what the state of your data is in, i.e. whether it\u2019s \u201cgood\u201d or not, you have to explore the data and prepare the data. Therefore, for the next four weeks, I\u2019m going to provide several amazing resources for you to go through and get a better understanding of what data exploration and preparation entails.", "Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) can be difficult because there\u2019s no one set way of doing it \u2014 but that\u2019s also what keeps it exciting. Generally, you want to\u2026", "Check out a beginner\u2019s guide to EDA here.", "Everything that you\u2019ve learned has led up to this point! Not only is machine learning interesting and exciting, but it is also a skill that all data scientists have. It\u2019s true that modeling makes up a small portion of a data scientist\u2019s time, but it doesn\u2019t take away from its importance.", "Later in your career, you might notice that I left out some machine learning algorithms, like K Nearest-Neighbors, Gradient Boost, and CatBoost. This is completely intentional \u2014 if you can understand the following machine learning concepts, you\u2019ll have the skills to learn any other machine learning algorithms in the future.", "If you feel comfortable with the materials above, you\u2019re definitely ready to start your own data science project! Just in case, I\u2019ve provided three ideas that you can use as inspiration to get started, but feel free to do whatever you like.", "The objective of this case is to determine the cause for a drop in user engagement for a social network called Yammer. Before diving into the data, you should read the overview of what Yammer does here. There are 4 tables that you should work with.", "The link to the case above will provide you with much more detail pertaining to the problem, the data, and the questions that should be answered.", "Check out how I approached this case study here if you\u2019d like guidance.", "Learning how to webscrape data is simple to learn and extremely useful, especially when it comes to collecting data for personal projects. Scraping a customer review website, like Trustpilot, is valuable for a company as it allows them to understand review trends (getting better or worse) and see what customers are saying via NLP.", "First I would get familiar with how Trustpilot is organized, and decide upon which kinds of businesses to analyze. Then I would take a look at this walkthrough of how to scrape Trustpilot reviews.", "In my opinion, there\u2019s no better way of showing that you\u2019re ready for a data science job than to showcase your code through competitions. Kaggle hosts a variety of competitions that involves building a model to optimize a certain metric, one of them being the Titanic Machine Learning Competition.", "If you want to get some inspiration and guidance, check out this step-by-step walkthrough of one of the solutions.", "Be sure to subscribe here or to my exclusive newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "I hope you found this useful! If you managed to get through this, you should have a strong understanding of the fundamentals in Statistics, Mathematics, SQL, Python/Pandas, and several machine learning algorithms!", "I hope this inspired you to continue learning too \u2014 there are so many things that you can continue to explore like more advanced models (eg. CatBoost), deep learning, experimental design, Bayesian modeling, cloud architecture, and the list goes on.", "If you like this and want to see future content, be sure to give me a follow on Medium. And as always, I wish you the best in your data science endeavors.", "Not sure what to read next? I\u2019ve picked another article for you:", "Your home for data science.
