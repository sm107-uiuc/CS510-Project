Calculating model\u2019s metrics and tuning it to better performance is NOT the end of a data scientist job. You can do much more than that. In fact, deploying a scalable model is much easier than it looks like. And knowing how to do it, certainly will add great value to your resume, because most data scientists don\u2019t go that far. You can think of this tutorial as the first step into becoming a data science unicorn.", "We will deploy a Logistic Regression model in AWS Lambda and then create API endpoints with API Gateway. With that done you have a scalable model that works as a service, you just do a simple POST request and it returns the prediction back to you.", "Then we will build a Flask App with HTML form to get some answers to feed our model. The app makes a request to our API, redirect the user to another page and exhibits the model prediction on it.", "Here you can access the working app that we are developing at this tutorial. Play with it as you like.", "The main objective of this article is not to develop a model, but you are free to check out how the model we are using here was developed. It is a simple Logistic Regression Model. To deploy it we have basically two options:", "I\u2019m choosing the second option because I want the model to be transparent to anyone. It should be clear what the coefficients are and how the score is calculated. A serialized model wouldn\u2019t let us see that in detail.", "You\u2019ll find instructions on how to deploy a serialized model to AWS Lambda on this Towards Data Science post, by Ben Weber.", "A Logistic Regression model can be written like this:", "We trained our model and got all coefficient\u2019s values. So it\u2019s just a matter of writing that equation manually: summing all coefficients and the intercept. Then to get scores (the probability) between 0 and 1 we do:", "Log in into your AWS console, go to IAM and create a role that has at least those permissions policies attached:", "Then you can go to Lambda and click into \u201cCreate function\u201d. Now we will define the basic configuration of our function.", "Now you go down to function code and add the following to the lambda function that was already created:", "The function receives a json as the event argument and treat it to the right format. Next we calculate the score with our helper function that we will define below, then we build a response and return it. Simple as that.", "Now we will create some helper functions. Go to File > New From Template > Python File:", "Add the following code and save it as normalizer.py:", "Create a new Python file, name it pre_treatment.py:", "Finally we will add a function that calculates the score. Note that the model coefficients are hardcoded here. Name it scorer.py.", "Done! Now let\u2019s create an API for our model. At Designer > Add triggers, click on API Gateway.", "Click on configuration required, choose create a new API, and then save your lambda function. If you come back to the API Gateway you should see an endpoint available. That\u2019s the one you are using to access your API.", "To test your API, just send a POST request to the endpoint like the one below (replace the url by the one you just created):", "You should expect to get the calculated score as a response.
