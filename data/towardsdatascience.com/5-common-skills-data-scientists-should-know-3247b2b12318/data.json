However, over working several years at several companies as a Data Scientist, I wanted to highlight five common skills Data Scientists should know. As a Data Scientist, you can expect to use some of these skills most likely in your career. I will be outlining SQL, Python/R, Jupyter Notebook, visualizations, and communication.", "You will, of course, encounter even more required skills and beneficial skills as you work along, but I hope these serve as a good start or enhancement of where you are in your current journey as a Data Scientist.", "As a studying Data Scientist or even a professional Data Scientist, you may be surprised to see this first skill. It is commonly associated with Data Analysts, while the Data Scientists are focused on a programming language and Machine Learning algorithms. However, in order to start using Python, R, or your Machine Learning algorithms, you will need to gather data. The most popular skill that I can think or have personally experienced over the years as a Data Scientist (as well as from other Data Scientists I know), is SQL. Most companies have a database set up with tables that you can query. The result of the query may be the dataset that you use for your Data Science model. While usually, you do not need to be an expert in SQL to become a successful Data Scientist, you should become familiar with some key SQL concepts and commands.", "The most popular SQL concepts I have come across are:", "Here is an example of a simplified query I would run to obtain my Data Science dataset.", "I have learned R in school and use it for some projects, but I mainly use Python, so I will be discussing that language over R. Another tool that a Data Scientist may use is SAS. Python, however, is beneficial due to the great number of libraries or packages that include common Data Science and Machine Learning algorithms already. You can expect to use prepared libraries that cover a wide array of models like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, etc. In addition to accessing a lot of great information and making your Data Science more efficient, you can work with an object-oriented format in Python (classes, methods, or functions, modules, etc.). This format helps to make your models run more efficiently as well, while also creating a scalable framework for deployment. Additionally, it helps your model to become more easily deployed when in OOP format, as you can either do it yourself or communicate with a Software Engineer, Data Engineer, or Machine Engineer for your deployment.", "Some useful libraries in Python include, but are not limited to:", "I probably use NumPy and Pandas the most during exploratory data analysis, SciKit-Learn during model building for Data Science, and Keras and TensorFlow for more Machine Learning and Deep Learning exercises. I have not used PyTorch myself but have heard it is quite popular.", "When using Python, you can use the popular Jupyter Notebook tool as well to organize and research your dataset and perform your main set of code. I usually use a Jupyter Notebook first when importing my dataset, applying exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model building. I think of it as a place that has my rough draft before finalizing my code into an OOP format that will ultimately be integrated and deployed. It is nice to comment in the cells as well as to create headlines and bullet points so that you can easily collaborate with other Data Scientists, or if you want to go back to your model in the future and have found well-documented cells.", "Here is a useful link for the Jupyter Notebook [3]:", "Being able to visualize several parts of the Data Science process is incredibly important. You may want to visualize the business problem, dataset, and visualize the model itself. Perhaps the most popular time to visualize in Data Science is after the model is built. When you explain your results to stakeholders, you will be describing complex ideas and output that could better be explained visually. It may also help yourself and others on your team get a better idea of what the model is performing, and how it works when you add visualizations.", "Some visualization tools you can use for Data Science processes include, but are not limited to:", "I personally tend to use Tableau and Seaborn, but all are pretty useful tools to utilize for Data Science.", "In addition to visualizing, you can expect to communicate.", "Communication is a skill that is not taught as much in Data Science education or in bootcamps, but is a vital skill to have as a Data Scientist.", "Before starting the Data Science process of coding, you will have to speak with several different stakeholders and subject-matter experts. You may have to convince them that Data Science is necessary in the first place for the specific situation. Once you are successful with that part of the process, you will then look to the benefits of the model itself, along with key points and updates, and eventually the results and impact of your model.", "You can expect to employ communication during these parts of the Data Science process:", "As you can see, there are several key skills that a Data Scientist should know. You could spend hours describing skills, but it is best to jump in and start learning, one day at a time, and not be overwhelmed. The five common Data Science skills you should know are:", "Please comment down below if you can think of any common skills that you use so that other Data Scientist can either anticipate as they enter the job market, or to better themselves as current Data Scientists.", "Your home for data science.
