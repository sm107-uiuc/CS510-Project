Newton was talking about the motion of objects, physical objects, not about life or feelings. I urge you to read Newton\u2019s Principia, so you know what I mean. This is very important, you should know what a scientific argument suggests, and where it applies. It\u2019s not to be used wherever. Before Newton wrote that he defined matter, momentum, force, and much more, he stated axioms and explained a whole theory for physics. And that argument can only be applied to that, particles, motion, and forces.", "But even more, we have investigations in where the third law can be broken, making it a little fuzzy.

It\u2019s not that easy. Don\u2019t take me wrong that helps as a start, but if we want to solve a problem, we need to dig deep. We need to collect as much data as possible and transform our data as much as possible to find useful information as possible.", "Always remember that correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation, and there are not always simple reactions to actions, not everything is like that.", "We are scientists, and if you are still not convinced, please read this:", "Every problem can\u2019t be solved with a linear or logistic regression or neural network with 20 features.
