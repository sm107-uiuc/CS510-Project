Once you\u2019ve created your model, the next step is to productionize your model, which includes deploying your model and monitoring it. And while this sounds costly, it\u2019s essential that you monitor your model for as long as you\u2019re using it in order to get the maximum value out of your ML model.", "Think of monitoring an ML model the same way as you would think about getting your annual physical check-up or getting periodic oil changes for your car. Model modeling is an operational task that allows you to check that your model is performing to the best of its abilities.", "In this article, you\u2019ll learn what model monitoring is and why it\u2019s so important when it comes to productionized models.", "Model Monitoring is an operational stage in the machine learning life cycle that comes after model deployment, and it entails \u2018monitoring\u2019 your ML models for things like errors, crashes, and latency, but most importantly, to ensure that your model is maintaining a predetermined desired level of performance.", "The simple answer to why model monitoring is important is that your models will degrade over time as you use them, known as model drift. Model Drift, also known as model decay, refers to the degradation of a model\u2019s prediction power due to various reasons which I will explain below.", "Generally, a machine learning model is only trained on a sample size of around ten percent of the total population of in-domain data [1] and is typically due to a scarcity of labeled data or computational constraints of training a significant amount of data. And while a machine learning model is constructed to reduce bias and be able to generalize the data, there will always be data samples that your model outputs incorrectly, inaccurately, or simply below standards.", "What people frequently forget is that a model is optimized based on the variables and parameters in the time that it was created, and ML models are no exception. Imagine how a spam-detection model that was created twenty years ago would perform now. The internet was barely a thing twenty years ago! Spam emails have become much more sophisticated and have changed significantly, so one can doubt that the spam-detection model would perform at all. This is an example of an environmental change.", "Another factor that affects the environment of a model and its relationships between its variables is our interpretation of data. For example, a sentiment model created ten years ago may falsely classify the sentiment of various words and phrases, as the way we speak, words that we use, and slang that we develop constantly changes over time. You don\u2019t hear anyone speaking in old English anymore, do you?", "This refers to operational data changes in the data pipeline. In practice, this is fairly common as the data science team or department usually doesn\u2019t have control over every system where input data comes from. For example, a completely siloed software engineering team might change the measurements of a variable from Celsius to Fahrenheit even though the rest of the data is stored in Celsius. This can result in significant consequences if one was trying to find the average temperature, for example. A simpler example of an upstream data change is when a feature is no longer being generated, resulting in missing values.", "The staging environment of a machine learning model is never indefinitely synonymous with the production environment because the world we live in is always changing. And for the reasons above, it\u2019s essential that you monitor any ML that you bring into production. In the next chapter, we\u2019ll go through various metrics that you can monitor and the factors you should consider when deciding what metric(s) you want to monitor.", "There are several metrics that you can use to monitor an ML model. The metric(s) you choose depends on various factors:", "Below are various metrics that are commonly used in model monitoring:", "Also known as a false positive, it is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class. For example, a pregnancy test with a positive outcome, when you aren\u2019t pregnant is an example of a type 1 error.", "Also known as a false negative, it is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class. An example of this is when a result says that you don\u2019t have cancer when you actually do.", "The accuracy of a model is simply equal to the fraction of predictions that a model got right and is represented by the following equation:", "Precision attempts to answer \u201cWhat proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?\u201d and can be represented by the following equation:", "Recall attempts to answer \u201cWhat proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?\u201d and can be represented by the following equation:", "The F1 score is a measure of a test\u2019s accuracy \u2014 it is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. It can have a maximum score of 1 (perfect precision and recall) and a minimum of 0. Overall, it is a measure of the preciseness and robustness of your model and can be represented with the following equation:", "R Squared is a measurement that tells you to what extent the proportion of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. In simpler terms, while the coefficients estimate trends, R-squared represents the scatter around the line of best fit.", "For example, if the R\u00b2 is 0.80, then 80% of the variation can be explained by the model\u2019s inputs.", "If the R\u00b2 is 1.0 or 100%, that means that all movements of the dependent variable can be entirely explained by the movements of the independent variables.", "Every additional independent variable added to a model always increases the R\u00b2 value \u2014 therefore, a model with several independent variables may seem to be a better fit even if it isn\u2019t. This is where Adjusted R\u00b2 comes in. The adjusted R\u00b2 compensates for each additional independent variable and only increases if each given variable improves the model above what is possible by probability.", "The absolute error is the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. Thus, the mean absolute error is the average of the absolute error.", "The mean squared error or MSE is similar to the MAE, except you take the average of the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values.", "Because the differences are squared, larger errors are weighted more highly, and so this should be used over the MAE when you want to minimize large errors. Below is the equation for MSE, as well as the code.", "Overall, the metric(s) that you choose to monitor ultimately depends on the task at hand, and the business context that you\u2019re working in.", "For example, it\u2019s common knowledge in the data science world that accuracy metrics are irrelevant when it comes to fraud detection models because the percentage of fraudulent transactions is usually less than 1%. Therefore, even if a fraudulent detection model has an accuracy of 99% because it classifies all transactions as non-fraudulent, that doesn\u2019t help us determine whether the model is effective or not.", "Another example is that the severity of a false negative classification when it comes to cancer screening tests is much worse than a false positive classification. Saying that a patient with cancer doesn\u2019t have cancer can ultimately lead to his or her death. This is much worse than saying that a patient has cancer, conducting further tests, only to realize that the patient does not have cancer. (It\u2019s always better to be safe than sorry!)", "For more articles like this one, check out Datatron\u2019s Medium page or their blog https://blog.datatron.com/", "If you like my work and want to support me, I\u2019d greatly appreciate if you followed me on my social media channels:", "Your home for data science.
