In it, I bring up events such as a social network for women that uses facial recognition to determine if you are a woman, that time amazon used an algorithm to determine optimal job candidates, the use of an algorithm that decides who does and does not get a loan, and an algorithm used by AirBnb to ban people it considers undesirable. In all these cases, the algorithm was biased in some kind of way because either the data fed into the algorithm was biased, the assumptions made by the algorithm were biased, or both. Given all this, why does a good portion of the population assume that algorithms are not and cannot be biased?", "At this point, I think we\u2019re all aware that every human is biased in one way or another. We\u2019re aware of some of our biases, but there\u2019s some bias we may not even be aware we have. Even when we work to minimize our bias, it\u2019s still going to be there. However, it\u2019s not like we come out of the womb being racist or sexist or homophobic. Biases are learned over time as we grow up and learn from the adults around us. The same is true for machines, but the reason people tend to think this isn\u2019t true is because of a fun thing called automation bias.", "Automation bias is defined as a bias, \u201cwhich occurs when a human decision maker disregards or does not search for contradictory information in light of a computer-generated solution which is accepted as correct\u201d (Cummings 2004, pg. 2). In other words, a human assumes that the computer is automatically correct and does not question its decision, even when they should. This is a well-documented phenomenon that has far-reaching consequences in sectors such as flying planes (Mosier 1998), prescribing medicine (Lyell 2017), military command-and-control operations (Parasuraman 2010), among many others.", "There are two types of errors that happen when people fall victim to automation bias:", "In other words, an error of omission would be \u201cI didn\u2019t catch that because the computer didn\u2019t catch it,\u201d and an error of commission would be, \u201cI did something that contradicted my training and/or available data because the computer told me to.\u201d In the case of Amazon\u2019s biased hiring algorithm, an error of omission would be something like, \u201cI didn\u2019t realize this person would be a great fit for this position because the algorithm didn\u2019t think this person would be a great fit,\u201d and an error of commission would be, \u201cI assumed that women were less qualified for our available positions because the algorithm assumed they were, even though I know the attribute of being a woman does not make you less qualified for a job.\u201d Obviously these two errors can start to blend into each other, and sometimes the errors humans make based on algorithm misuse is a combination of the two errors delineated here.", "Algorithms and AI are becoming more and more of an integral part of our lives. This is why we need to constantly reassess our relationship to technology and our assumptions concerning our use of said algorithms. Particularly, we need to assess our own bias towards technology and determine the automation bias that we may possess. Obviously, we\u2019d all like to avoid errors of commission and omission and possess as little bias as possible. The question is, how do we do that? The same way we handle every other bias we work to minimize: awareness and accountability. We need to be aware of our bias, since obviously you cannot work to minimize something of which you\u2019re unaware. We need to also be accountable, in that we need to take responsibility for our decisions at the end of the day, even if that decision was aided by a machine. In the case of pilots, Mosier et. al, found:", "those pilots who reported an internalized perception of \u201caccountability\u201d for their performance and strategies of interaction with the automation were significantly more likely to double-check automated functioning against other cues and less likely to commit errors than those who did not share this perception. (Mosier 1998)", "In other words, if we want to maintain a healthy relationship with the technology we use, we need to take responsibility for our biases and our actions and decisions that may or may not be aided by technology of some kind.", "[1] Cummings, Mary. \u201cAutomation bias in intelligent time critical decision support systems.\u201d In AIAA 1st Intelligent Systems Technical Conference, p. 6313. 2004.", "[2] Mosier, Kathleen L., Linda J.
