I think it\u2019s because our society tends to frown upon discontent or ennui. If someone is struggling to stay engaged at their job, society\u2019s go-to response is, \u201cSuck it up and be a professional.\u201d The guilt trip response is also popular, \u201cSo many people don\u2019t even have a steady paycheck, so stop whining.\u201d", "Making a career change takes courage and a certain level of introspection \u2014 you\u2019ve looked at the current state of \u201cyou\u201d and decided that professionally, it needs a change. This is not an easy decision. Giving up a decent paycheck, even if you no longer care for the job, is difficult. It\u2019s even harder when you realize, for better or worse after you quit, that your job was a major part of your identity. And without it, you feel more vulnerable and exposed.", "But venture forth you do. Others might call you foolish, misguided, or even selfish. But I know that you are actually brave, curious, and sincere.", "It\u2019s hard enough to recognize that a change needs to be made; it\u2019s even harder to muster up the initiative to act.", "So this post is for you, brave career changer. The road you\u2019ve chosen is long and the destination uncertain. But years later when you look back, you will realize that the first step, the one you already made when you started your journey of transformation, was actually the hardest one of all. Because it\u2019s one that not everybody has the courage to take.", "Career changers go through a wide range of emotions before they make it to their ultimate destination. I am a recent data science bootcamp grad and my friends and I went through the following sequence of emotions during the past few months:", "That\u2019s a lot of ups and downs to go through in just a 4 to 6 month span\u2014 months without a paycheck, rejection after rejection, mixed emotions as your friends land jobs while you search on. All the while, you are working hard to both learn data science and prove to the world that you know it. It can be quite the struggle, but that\u2019s also what makes your eventual victory feel so rewarding.", "While the struggle is real, it\u2019s not all for naught. I want to share a few success stories (from friends of mine) that I found personally inspiring. They are all career changers who are either in the process of or have already successfully broken into the field of data science.", "Mohammad Bakir \u2014 Mo was a member of my METIS (data science bootcamp) cohort. Mo is curious, smart, and passionate. But above all he is a hustler and a grinder. When he began to run low on living expenses a few weeks after finishing the bootcamp, he began driving for Uber. But not only did he use Uber to pay the bills, he also used it as a networking opportunity. Mo is the only person I know to have gotten an interview and a job opportunity (he turned it down as it wasn\u2019t a good fit) from driving Uber. Undeterred, he kept grinding away, and I am happy to report that he received an offer from Apple last week. Congratulations Mo!", "Mailei Vargas \u2014 A Seattle Metis grad that I met through my blog (she blogs too!). Two years after her bootcamp graduation, Mailei found herself at a crossroads: the pace of learning at her job had slowed and the opportunity to work on data-intensive projects was lacking. Feeling like it was now or never to make a change, Mailei did something that surprised me: she quit her job so that she could search full time for her dream job. And search she did. I was shocked and impressed by how full her schedule of meetings and networking events was (networking makes me sleepy). For a lot of us, the tendency is to slack off and procrastinate when we lose the day to day structure of school or job. Not her, Mailei made the job hunt her job and eventually her discipline paid off. She is now a happily employed data professional. Congrats Mailei!", "Black Raven (James Ng) \u2014 I don\u2019t know James personally but I am impressed by his blogging prolificness. James is a very recent graduate of Metis\u2019 inaugural Singapore cohort (congrats you all!), and he and his fellow cohort mates are currently hitting the job market hard (if you\u2019re an employer in Singapore and you would like a passionate and hungry data person, you should check out James, Ken, Regina, and Lliana). As you can probably guess, I\u2019m very much in favor of blogging as a means to bridge the gap between learning something new and developing real proficiency in it (the best way to learn something is to teach it). So I\u2019m excited to see James, who I am sure is plenty busy with recruiting and interviews, still find the time to pump out tutorials and write-ups of his passion projects (I hope you keep it up!).", "The relentless pursuit of that data science job can be soul-sucking at times. That\u2019s why you need to remind yourself often of why you are doing this in the first place.", "You want a job that\u2019s fun, exciting, and challenging (in a good way). So in between the networking and interviews, take some time to learn a new algorithm or enter a Kaggle competition with some friends \u2014 anything that reminds you how fun data science (and learning new things) can be.", "Because if it\u2019s not fun, then you might as well have stayed at your old job.", "More Data Science Related Posts By Me:", "How Much Do Data Scientists Make?", "A Better Way to Skill Up", "Your home for data science.
