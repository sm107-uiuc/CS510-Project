So more and more junior data scientists are interested to build an online portfolio with blogs or Youtube videos so that they get more visibility.", "But how does one offer value to the data science community by being a beginner? Every data science project they can think of seems to be done already and available online with code. Also, beginners usually don\u2019t have any heavy compute resources to train deep learning algorithms.", "In this post, we will see a few ways to add value and build a portfolio despite being an absolute beginner in data science -", "Instead of thinking about a project think about a product. Without data collection and training, can you combine multiple existing pre-trained algorithms and build a solution that addresses a need?", "Let\u2019s take an example to understand this. If you think about projects with GAN ( Generative Adversarial Networks) there are projects online ranging from generating faces to generating Anime characters. If you think about projects in Optical Character Recognition (OCR) there are several projects online to apply OCR to legal, medical, banking documents and extract text. If you think of a language translation project then there are several code examples available to train using different sequence to sequence (seq2seq) techniques like LSTM\u2019s, transformers, etc.", "If you are thinking about a project, then you hit roadblocks with each of the above-mentioned examples. Instead, think about a product.", "Can you build an image translator that converts the text in an image to a different language and replace the original text? Eg: Word lens acquired by Google", "You can use the same technology to build a meme or quote translator. Or you can use the same technology to convert presentation slides in one language to another.", "Combining the above three discussed algorithms OCR, Image Inpainting (GAN) and translation we can create a pipeline like below to get the final translated image.", "This could be a portfolio project that showcases your skillset. It is developed with pretrained models and doesn\u2019t use any heavy compute resources to train like GPU. As of today, I couldn\u2019t find any project online with code that does the same. Maybe you could build a chrome plugin to translate images of memes and quotes to get popularity as well.", "If you are looking for a similar example in NLP look at my True or False Question generation algorithm that is completely built using pre-trained models of GPT2, Sentence BERT, and constituency parser.", "Applying innovative techniques, you can build a compelling project portfolio without training AI algorithms and only staying on the applied AI layer.", "If you are a beginner you feel that it is hard to stay up to date with cutting edge research. While that is true, there is also a sure-shot way for a beginner to add value.", "As the research is new, oftentimes the documentation is poor and there are no online resources for other beginners to search when they are stuck. You could easily write getting started guides for a new library or write a research summary of a newly released paper etc. You can also apply existing techniques to the newly released algorithms and present your results.", "i) There is a new library in NLP called Stanza from Stanford. As the library is new there aren\u2019t that many resources to get started with it. You could explore the library and write some beginner guides and gain traffic online.", "ii) In training, any NLP classification algorithms like sentiment analysis or summarization, Glove or Word2vec embedding vectors are heavily used. If a new word/sentence embedding (Eg: BERT) is released you can try the same algorithm with newer embeddings and post your results/performance online.", "If your skillset is at the intermediate level of doing fine-tuning (NLP) or transfer learning (computer vision) then you can leverage some of your time to collect and clean a small dataset. Then you can use the dataset to fine-tune pretrained NLP or computer vision models and leverage it for newer use cases.", "Example 1: You can collect or create a dataset of True/False pairs and train/fine-tune any sequence to sequence transformer model.", "Example 2: You can collect some student essay answers for a given topic and fine-tune a BERT model to auto score an essay.", "These are some of the things that you can do if you can afford time in data collection and have some computing resources.", "Tip: There are free compute resources to train deep learning models online like Google Colab and Paperspace. As long as your model training finishes under a few hours you can leverage these.", "If your skillset falls in this category then you can do the following things to build a deeper expertise portfolio.", "Happy AI exploration and if you loved the content, feel free to find me on Twitter.", "If you want to learn modern NLP using transformers, check out my course Question generation using NLP", "Your home for data science.
