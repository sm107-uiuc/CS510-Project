This canvas helps you prioritize your goals first and then work backward to achieve them. You can think about it this way: instead of following steps in a recipe to cook a predetermined meal, you first envision what the meal looks and tastes like and then you start developing a recipe. When working on a data science project, you usually don\u2019t have a set of instructions to achieve a predetermined outcome. Instead, you have to determine the outcomes and the steps to achieve those outcomes. This Data Science Workflow Canvas was designed with that process in mind. Here, I\u2019ll walk you through how to use this canvas, and I\u2019ll share examples of how I implemented this canvas in my own projects.", "Download the Data Science Workflow Canvas.", "What problem are you trying to solve? And what larger issues do that problem address? This section helps you address the \u201cwhy\u201d of your project.", "Yes, you won\u2019t know what your outcomes are until after you\u2019re done with your project, but you should at least have an idea of what you think they should look like. Identify potential predictor (X) and/or target (y) variables.", "Where are you sourcing your data from? Is there enough data? And can you actually work with it? Sometimes you might have access to ready-made datasets, or you might need to scrape your data.", "Choose your model(s) depending on your answers to these questions: are your outcomes discrete or continuous? Do you have labeled or unlabeled datasets? Are you concerned with outliers? How well do you want to interpret your results? The list of questions can vary depending on your project.", "Identify corresponding model evaluation metrics to interpret your outcomes. Every model will have its own set of evaluation metrics.", "What do you need to do to your data in order to run your model and achieve your outcomes? Data preparation includes data cleaning, feature selection, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and so on.", "Once you finish brainstorming your ideas on the canvas, it\u2019s time to bring it all together and activate your project! Refer the order listed in the \u201cActivation\u201d section of the canvas as you bring your project to life.", "Here\u2019s an example of how I implemented the Data Science Workflow Canvas while working on my WNBA machine learning project.
