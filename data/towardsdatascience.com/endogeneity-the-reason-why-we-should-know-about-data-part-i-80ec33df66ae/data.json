He collects data for total sales (Y) and selling price (X) for 2 years. He gives the data to a data scientist asking him to find the optimal selling price. The data scientist fits a linear regression model, Y = alpha+beta X+error and finds the optimal by differentiating the profit function =(X-cost)(alpha+beta X).", "However, the ice cream vendor used to increase the price of the ice creams once the temperature was high as the demand went up. He forgot to mention his pricing strategy to the data scientist. The linear regression thinks that as the selling price increases, the sales increases (beta > 0) or the slope is not as negative as expected. Thus the optimal selling price from the model is at the very least, sub-optimal (if not harmful to business).", "A merchandise store gives customized coupons to its customers. There are different coupons (with different offers). The store collects data for customers response, that is, they used the coupon or not (Y) and coupon details (X). They want to know the effectiveness of each coupon so that they could customize it and send it to different customers in the future.", "The data scientist fits a model to predict the probability of purchase (in the next month or next few months) for each customer from each coupon. Again, the store had a strategy as to whom they send the coupon and what coupons do they send (instead of randomized coupons). For example, if they think a customer will buy even without a coupon, they did not send it or if they think a person might buy, they sent them more coupons. This strategy was not disclosed to the data scientist. The could also give biased \u2018effectiveness\u2019 of coupons if more coupons were sent to the customers with a higher chance of purchase.", "Rich becomes richer, poor becomes poorer (conceptually similar to Example 2 as explained later but this example is included to show endogeneity is not just restricted to data science). This is also called Mathew\u2019s effect in sociology. Hard work helps movie artists win awards. Producers want to affiliate themselves with artists who have won awards as they affiliate award with acting quality, hence they get better opportunities and thus they reap more recognition and more awards (again, rich becomes richer).", "All these examples violate one of the fundamentals of Design of Experiments- randomization. Often times, a company cannot afford randomization. In field experiments, the subjects are assigned to different treatment levels randomly (or we should randomly set the value of independent variables and observe dependent variables). But in the above examples, this is violated (as the independent variables depend on certain strategy \u2014 by ice cream vendor/ merchandise store/ movie producer).", "In other words, the independent predictor variables (X) should be exogenous and not endogenous. Exogenous variables are not driven by other factors (observable or unobservable). In the first example, the price was driven by temperature. In the second example, coupons were driven by past sales). Endogenous variables are correlated with the error terms \u2014 let\u2019s deconstruct this.", "The response (Y) in a model should be explained by independent variables(X) and all that which could not be explained by X is included in the error term. ( We know the issue and adverse effects of multicollinearity in linear regression \u2014 in the case of multicollinearity, X1 is explained by X2). If there is a factor that could explain Y but is unobserved, say Z, it is included in the error. But if Z could explain any of the X (in example 1, Z = temperature, X = price), the error term is correlated with X (hence, the price is an endogenous variable). Thus, the issue of endogeneity arises when we have a Z that is related to Y, but it is also related to X and not included in the model.", "There is a wide range of sources of endogeneity \u2014 what if the vendor changes location based on time, what if the vendor changes price based on the queue. The sources of endogeneity can be broadly classified as:", "I hope the following statement makes more sense now (which simply means that the independent variables are set strategically or in which independent variables are endogenous):", "Endogeneity arises when the marginal distribution of the independent variable is not independent of the conditional distribution of the dependent variable given the independent.", "What if we don\u2019t consider endogeneity?", "The contents are heavily taken from here and here. Here, we will go through the case study of the ice cream vendor discussed here.
