You can follow this guide to learn operating systems from scratch and clearly explain them to your interviewer.", "The definition of operating systems can be divided into three parts:", "The computer operation can be divided into two modes:", "The typical applications often run under the user mode. When there is a demand for service under kernel mode, a system call should be issued. It is a request asking kernel process to execute functions such as device management, file management, process management, and memory management.", "In short, a process is an active program. It can generate multiple threads while executing. Processes are usually independent of each other, but threads are not necessary. Processes will lead to more overhead, but are also more convenient for the management, and threads are just the opposite.", "Take JVM process as an example, threads inside are sharing global variables such as heap space and method area (metaspace), but the Program Counter Register, JVM stack, and native method stack are private.", "There are 7 states of the process, which are:", "Context switching means saving the running process state and loading the state of another process. This usually happens while a higher-priority process comes into the ready state or an interrupt occurs.", "A race condition happens while more than one process are sharing the same code or resources. In this case, an unexpected result might occur as each process could access the shared variables at any time.", "There are six ways of inter-process communications (IPC):", "The purpose of thread synchronization is similar to inter-process communication, which avoid competing shared resources between concurrent threads. There are three common ways of thread synchronization:", "There are several CPU scheduling algorithms in order to achieve maximum CPU utilization:", "There are two types of memory in operating systems:", "The memory management of operating systems is responsible for allocating memory to processes, including converting logical addresses into physical addresses or swapping processes between internal and external memory.", "Take a common example, the pointer concept we see in some programming languages stores the virtual address of memory, which is decided by operating systems. The physical address is the address in physical memory, i.e., memory address registers.", "Modern processors use virtual addressing technique to translate a virtual address into a physical address via MMU (memory management unit). The process of virtual addressing is shown in the image below:", "There are four types of common memory allocation techniques:", "In paged memory management, there are two issues need to be handled:", "TLB could be applied to speed up the transition between virtual and physical memory. It could be regarded as a cache, which stores a part of the data in a page table. With this cache, we only need to access the main memory once instead of twice while executing I/O.", "The process of translating a virtual address into a physical address is:", "Besides speeding up mapping, we can use a multilevel page table to handle the issue caused by the large virtual address space. It avoids always placing all the page tables in main memory, which could save up more space.", "This is common while the memory cost of a software exceeds the space of a computer. The reason why this can be implemented is because of the virtual memory. It divides a program into several pieces and allows them to be temporarily stored in the external memory (disk) before the program needs it. By doing this, the program will regard itself to own a piece of continuous space.", "There are two common types of virtual memory implementation:", "Page fault happens while a required page is not in the main memory. And we need page replacement algorithms to swap the page from the secondary memory into the main memory. Some common types of page replacement algorithms are listed below:", "Deadlock is a situation when more than two processes are waiting for the resource holding by each other, but no one is going to release first.", "Deadlock will appear if the system satisfies all of the following conditions:", "There are three methods to handle deadlock:", "By learning operating systems, you can found that there are so many computer science concepts involved in this field, so it is definitely worth and important to dig into each of those topics. Hope you find it useful and good luck with your next interview!", "Your home for data science.
