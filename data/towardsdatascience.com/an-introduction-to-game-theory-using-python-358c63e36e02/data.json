In his book \u201cPlaying for Real: A Text on Game Theory,\u201d Ken Binmore characterizes it as the study of rational interaction within groups of people. Essentially, whenever you deal with another person, you\u2019re playing a game. I was first introduced to game theory in an introductory microeconomics class. It seemed quite odd and not very intuitive. A couple of years later I found myself in an upper-division game theory course. It was heavy in mathematical notation, graphs, and misery. Unlike the econometrics and computational economics courses where I was introduced to coding (in R and Julia, respectively), I didn\u2019t write a single line of code while studying game theory. In retrospect, the skillset I developed during that course has benefitted me greatly in my data science journey. I decided to re-visit game theory and use it to sharpen my skills in python (and reminisce on the misery).", "Let\u2019s start with the classic example: The Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma. Our two players are Julian and Randy. They were both arrested and taken to the police station then separated into different interrogation rooms. The detectives interrogating our players don\u2019t have enough evidence, they need a confession. Here are the strategies and payoffs for our players :", "We\u2019ll call staying silent the dove strategy and snitching the hawk strategy (I took the strategy names and payoffs from Binmore, they were better than the ones in my notes). Let\u2019s use python to create Julian\u2019s payoff matrix:", "Julian is represented by the rows while Randy is represented by the columns. For example, if Julian plays dove while Randy plays hawk, Julian\u2019s payoff is -10 (the number of years he goes to jail). If Julian plays hawk and Randy plays dove, Julian\u2019s payoff is 0 (no jail time).", "Now let\u2019s create Randy\u2019s payoff matrix. To achieve this, we need to swap the rows with the columns because Randy\u2019s payoff matrix is the transpose of Julian\u2019s. This is very easy to do in python:", "Another way to create the payoff matrices is to use the nashpy package like so:", "Now it\u2019s time to create the payoff table. The payoff table is a bi-matrix which contains Julian and Randy\u2019s payoff matrices written together. First, I\u2019ll draw it out:", "Julian\u2019s payoff is the first number and Randy\u2019s is the second. So, if Julian plays hawk and Randy plays dove, what\u2019s the payoff? If you chose (0, -10), good job! The payoff table shows the payoff for each player given their strategy and the strategy of their opponent. The payoff table looks wonderful drawn out, but let\u2019s create it in python using the quantecon package:", "You may have noticed the list of payoffs above were passed through a function called NormalFormGame (it\u2019s in the output, as well). The Prisoners\u2019 Dilemma represents a normal form game. What is that, you ask? It consists of the following three conditions:", "Now that we understand the strategies and the payoffs, we can write a function to further crystalize our understanding:", "We established earlier that the strategy profile (hawk, dove) = (0, -10). If we wrote the function correctly, that should be our output:", "Et voila! But now comes the question, how will the agents in our game maximize their preferences? It might seem like Julian and Randy would both benefit by keeping their lips sealed. However, each player is faced with the same payoffs and strategies. Remember, this game is being played simultaneously. Each player maximizes their payoffs by playing hawk (it\u2019s the only possible way either player can avoid getting locked up). So, if our players are rational and look to maximize their preferences, they\u2019ll always play hawk. In wonky economic speak, hawk strictly dominates dove. Therefore, the outcome of our game will be (hawk, hawk). This represents the Nash equilibrium:", "To say this blog barely scratches the surface of game theory is an understatement. However, I really believe the intuition behind game theory is complementary to the type of thinking one needs to develop to be successful in data science. I plan to write more on game theory in the future, so look out for that!", "I\u2019d like to thank my former professor (The Dealer of Misery) Jianbin Wu for the inspiration to write this article. Check out his personal website here. Do you have questions, comments, concerns, or criticism? I\u2019d love to hear what you have to say in the comments section!", "Your home for data science.
