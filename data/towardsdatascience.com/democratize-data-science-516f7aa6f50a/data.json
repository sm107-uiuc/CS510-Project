Most of the articles aim not to discourage but serve as a reminder to take a hard look in the mirror first and realize what we\u2019re up against. However, a few detractors have proclaimed that the proliferation of these online courses and boot camps have caused the degradation of the profession.", "To the latter, I vehemently disagree.", "Data science have captured popular imagination ever since Harvard Business Review dubbed data scientist as the sexiest job of the 21st century. More than seven years later, data science remains one of the most highly sought-after job markets today. In fact, due to the dynamics of supply and demand, \u201cthe United States alone is projected to face a shortfall of some 250,000 data scientists by 2024\u00b9.\u201d", "As a result, capitalism and entrepreneurship answered the call and companies like Codeup have vowed to \u201chelp bridge the gap between companies and people wanting to enter the field.\u201d\u00b2", "In addition, AutoML libraries like PyCaret are \u201cdemocratizing machine learning and the use of advanced analytics by providing free, open-source, and low-code machine learning solution for business analysts, domain experts, citizen data scientists, and experienced data scientists\u201d\u00b3.", "The availability of online courses, boot camps, and AutoML libraries has led a lot of data scientists to raise their brows. They fear that boot camp alumni and self-taught candidates would somehow lower the overall caliber of data scientists and disgrace the field. Furthermore, they are afraid that the availability of tools like AutoML would allow anyone to be a data scientist.", "I mean, God forbid if anyone thinks that they too can be data scientists! Right?", "Alumni of boot camps and self-taught learners, like myself, have one thing going for them: our rookie smarts. To quote Liz Wiseman, author of the book Rookie Smarts:", "In a rapidly changing world, experience can be a curse. Being new, na\u00efve, and even clueless can be an asset. \u2014 Liz Wiseman", "Rookies are unencumbered. We are alert and constantly seeking like hunter-gatherers, cautious but quick like firewalkers, and hungry and relentless like frontiersmen\u2074. In other words, we\u2019re street smart.", "Many are so bogged down by \u201cyou\u2019ve got to learn this\u201d and \u201cyou\u2019ve got learn that\u201d that they forget to stress the fact that data science is so vast that you can\u2019t possibly know everything about anything. And that\u2019s okay.", "We learn fast and adapt quickly.", "At the end of the day, it\u2019s all about the value that we bring to our organizations. They are, after all, the ones paying our bills. We don\u2019t get paid to memorize formulas or by knowing how to code an algorithm from scratch.", "We get paid to solve problems.", "And this is where the street smart data scientist excels. We don\u2019t suffer from analysis paralysis or be bothered with theories, at least not while on the clock. Our center of focus is based on pragmatic solutions to problems, not on academic debate.", "This is not to say we\u2019re not interested in the latest research. In fact, it\u2019s quite the contrary. We are voracious consumers of the latest development in machine learning and AI. We drool over the latest development in natural language processing. And we\u2019re always on the lookout for the latest tool that will make our jobs easier and less boring.", "So what if we have to use AutoML? If it gets us to an automatic pipeline where analysts can get the results of machine learning without manual intervention by a data scientist, the better. We\u2019re not threatened by automation, we\u2019re exhilarated by it!", "Do not let perfection be the enemy of progress. \u2014 Winston Churchill", "By building an automatic pipeline, there\u2019s bound to be some tradeoffs. But building it this way will free our brain cells and gives us more time to focus on solving other higher-level problems and produce more impactful solutions.", "We\u2019re not concerned about job security, because we know that it doesn\u2019t exist. What we do know is that the more value we bring to a business, the better we will be in the long run.", "After all this, I will concede a bit. For the sake of argument, maybe they\u2019re right. Maybe online courses, boot camps, and low-code machine learning libraries really do produce low-caliber data scientists.", "But still, I argue, this doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t have value. Data science skills lie on a spectrum and so does companies\u2019 maturity when it comes to data. Why hire a six-figure employee when your organization barely has a recognizable machine learning infrastructure?", "Maybe, to be labeled as a data scientist, one must be a unicorn first. A unicorn data scientist is a data scientist who excels at all facets of data science.", "Data science has long been described as the intersection between computer science, applied statistics, and business or domain knowledge. To this, they ask, how can one person possibly accumulate all those knowledge into just a few months? To this, we also ask the same question, how can a college grad?", "Unicorns do exist I believe, but they also have had to start from somewhere.", "A whole slew of online courses and tools promise to democratize data science, and this is a good thing.", "Thank you for reading.
