You can find it here: Setting Up Jupyter Notebooks for Data Visualisation .", "We use Jupyter Notebooks because they allow us to experiment with the charts that we produce before exporting them for use in a document. They also allow us to create complete documents including those charts and save them as web pages or PDFs.", "In fact, this article was originally written in a Jupyter Notebook.", "First, you need to start up a Jupyter notebook (refer to the introductory article above, if you are unsure).", "In you first code cell type in the following:", "This imports all of the necessary Python libraries to do data visualisation with Pandas: numpy is a maths package, pandas gives us ways of manipulating data and matplotlib provides the basic plotting functionality that Pandas uses to produce charts and graphs.", "Run this code once in order that all the subsequent bits of code will work.", "Before we start to visualise the data we need to load it from somewhere. I\u2019ve provided a csv file of London weather data from 2018. It\u2019s a subset of historical data available from the Met Office in the UK and records the maximum and minimum temperatures, the rainfall and the number of hours of sun for each month.", "The snippet of code below uses a variable weather to hold the weather data and we load the csv file into that variable from the url, as shown.", "The second line of code is simply the variable name, and this displays the data as a table.", "In the table you can see that the columns are labelled Year, Month, Tmax (Maximum temperature), Tmin (Minimum temperature), Rain (in inches) and Sun (hours of sunlight).", "(When you are working with your own data, you can store the data file in the same directory as your notebook \u2014 then the code to load the data would look something like:", "The weather variable is a Pandas dataframe. This is essentially a table, as we saw above, but Pandas provides us with all sorts of functionality associated with the dataframe. One of these functions is the ability to plot a graph. We simply use the code weather.plot() to create a line graph. We need to specify the x and y coordinates, though, and we do this by referencing the column names from the dataframe thus:", "You can see that, when you run this cell, it gives you a simple line plot of the maximum temperature over the 12 month period.", "To plot both maximum and minimum temperatures, we give two column names enclosed within square brackets and separated by a comma, like this:", "A line chart is the default when you use the plot function. If we want to draw some other form then we have to specify which one.", "To draw a bar chart of the same data as above, we add the text .bar to the plot function. Like this:", "And if we prefer horizontal bars we use the barh version.", "Plotting two sets of data (Tmax and Tmin) in a bar chart is similar to what we saw above with the line chart:", "If we want to create a set of separate charts for each type of data, we can. We set the x and y values as usual but, in addition, we specifiy a parameter subplots as being True (the default is False) and, if we wish, we can set the layout as you see below.", "We can do this with any type of chart. Here\u2019s the same thing but as a set of line graphs.", "A scatter plot plots a series of points that correspond to two variables and allows us to determine if there is a relationship between them. The one below plots Sun and Rain. There are 12 points, one for each row in the table, and the points plot the value of Rain on the vertical axis against Sun on the horizontal one.", "It\u2019s not particularly clear but you can see a vague linear relationship. A straight line that was the best fit through the twelve points would start somewhere high up on the left and end up low on the right. That tells us that when Rain has a high level, Sun has a low one, and vice versa. Which common sense tells us is probably right \u2014 there is, generally speaking, an inverse relationship between the amount of sun and the amount of rain.", "Pie charts are the last type we are going to deal with here. But since the weather data doesn\u2019t really lend itself to representation in a pie chart, we\u2019ll load some more data that represents peoples choices for meals (yes, you\u2019re right, I made it up!).", "One thing to notice here is that you need to specify the index for the pie chart \u2014 that\u2019s the labels of the data to be plotted. In this case it\u2019s in column 0, the one that contains the labels for the different meals.", "This is all very well but maybe you want to be able to use the charts that you produce. If you want to use them in a presentation or document, then it would be useful to be able to export them as image files that you can include in another file.", "The simple way of saving the images is like this:", "The variable plt is created when you plot a graph and it has a function called savefig which is used to save the image. You can see that the name of the file is specified inside the brackets and in this case it will save to a file called \u201cpie.png\u201d in the same directory as the notebook.", "This was an introduction to data visualisation with Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks. We\u2019ve seen how we can produce a range of charts from a data file and save them for use in our documents.", "There\u2019s plenty more to find out, and I\u2019ll be looking a more advanced topics in a subsequent article (see below).", "Update: the next article is here, Data Visualization: Simple Statistical Views in Pandas", "And if you would like to be informed about future articles please subscribe to my free Technofile newsletter.", "Your home for data science.
