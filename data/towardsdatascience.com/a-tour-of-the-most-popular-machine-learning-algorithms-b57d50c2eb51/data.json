If you\u2019re in the same boat, you\u2019re in the right place!", "In this article, we will take a high-level tour of the most popular machine learning algorithms in order to understand the true scope of the field. First, we\u2018ll look into the learning styles of algorithms followed by the algorithms themselves and their functions. By the end, you should have a solid sense for all the algorithms Machine Learning covers as well as how they are related to one another. Let\u2019s dive in!", "In machine learning, it is tradition to categorize algorithms by their learning style. In general, learning style is just a fancy way of saying what data you have readily available to train your algorithm. Let\u2019s look at some!", "In supervised learning, input data is called training data and has a known label/result. An example of an input could be a picture of an animal and a label could be the name of it (i.e. elephant, cat, etc.). Another example can be emails as input and whether or not they\u2019re spam as the label.", "A model is then learned by iteratively training on input data where it constantly makes predictions and corrects itself when those predictions are wrong. Here\u2019s an easier way to think about it.", "Whenever I think of machine learning, I like to think of babies. Imagine teaching a baby what a cat is and it occasionally points at a dog and exclaims \u201ccat.\u201d Any sane parent would correct the child and inform the baby that the animal was actually a dog; likewise, the baby will eventually learn the difference pretty well after trial and error.", "This is exactly how supervised learning works; the computer is the baby. When it sees a picture of a cat and it says \u201cdog,\u201d you as the parent tell it that it was actually a cat. Over thousands of times telling the computer or the child what\u2019s a cat or not, the machine/child will eventually be able to predict the label pretty well.", "This process of training/correcting occurs until the model achieves a desired level of accuracy on the data.", "Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning does not have labels \u2014 only input data.", "A model is leaned by deducing similarities and other structures present in the input.", "As an ode to our previous analogy, imagine dumping a ton of different M&Ms in front of a baby. Chances are that the child will cluster the pieces of chocolate effectively based on color and shape (assuming there\u2019s peanut M&Ms in there :)) without being explicitly told what categories they belong in.", "This is what ML engineers strive to do in unsupervised learning. We want to dump a ton of data in a computer and have it efficiently grouped/categorized based on the similarities and differences existent among the individual data points.", "As the name entails, semi-supervised learning has input data with a mixture of labelled and unlabeled examples.", "Within semi-supervised learning, we want the machine to make a prediction but also learn the structures to organize the data at hand.", "This type of learning is much less common but is still an extremely cool area in which tons of research is being done. When using ML to make business decisions, however, you will typically see teams and individuals using unsupervised and supervised learning methods instead of semi-supervised due to reliability and accuracy.", "Now that we have a solid understanding of learning styles, let\u2019s take a look at the most popular algorithms themselves.", "As you are reading through them, I highly suggest you think of problems that could be solved with the methods as well as the learning style the problem belongs to; doing so will not only inspire you but also allow the algorithms to stick.", "Regression algorithms are concerned with modeling the relationship between the input and output; this is iteratively refined by using a measure of error in predictions (recall the cat-baby example).", "The most popular regression algorithms include:", "Instance-based algorithms are concerned with comparing new instances with instances already stored in memory. Another name for the algorithms, as the process suggests, is memory-based learning.", "These algorithms typically rely on building up a database of example data. They then compare the new input data submitted to data within the database and use a similarity measure in order to find the best match and make a prediction. When programming and implementing these algorithms, focus is put into the representation of the stored instances as well as the similarity metrics used to determine relationships.", "The most popular instance-based algorithms include:", "Although regularization algorithms are in their own category in this article, they are primarily used alongside others. Regularization, at a high level, penalizes models based on their complexity; this, in turn, leads to simpler models that also prove better at generalizing.", "As an example, imagine being asked \u201chow would you double a number x ?\u201d. You probably thought of multiplying the number x by 2 (x * 2) but you could have also ended up doubling the number by doing ((4x + 8)/4 \u2014 2) * 2. Clearly the second method is more complex and not the ideal way to do it; regularization penalizes such complexity and leads to the model favoring simplicity such as just multiplying the number by two.", "The most popular regularization algorithms include:", "Decision tree methods are concerned with constructing models of \u201cdecisions\u201d based on values within the data.", "The \u201cTree\u201d part of \u201cDecision Tree\u201d comes from the fact that decisions fork down in tree structures until a decision/prediction is made.", "My favorite way to explain decision trees is comparing the algorithm to 20 questions. In 20 questions, the person guessing asks a series of yes or no questions to ultimately land on the person within the other\u2019s head (the app Akinator is another example of this concept). Similarly, the computer asks \u201cquestions\u201d about certain features of the input to traverse the tree and ultimately make a decision.", "The most popular decision tree algorithms include:", "Bayesian algorithms are concerned with explicitly applying the Bayes\u2019 Theorem to problems like regression and classification. If you\u2019re not familiar with Bayes\u2019 Theorem here it is:", "In short, it calculates the probability of an event A, given event B. For example, \u201cwhat is the probability of it raining given that it\u2019s cloudy?\u201d will be represented as P(rain | cloudy). Likewise, it will be calculated by using the probability of it being cloudy when raining (P(cloudy| raining)), multiplying it with the probability of it raining in general (P(raining)), and dividing it all with the probability of it being cloudy (P(cloudy)).", "The most popular Bayesian algorithms include:", "Clustering algorithms are concerned with, as the name suggests, clustering groups of similar data points together. All the methods undertaken (i.e. hierarchal, centroid-based, etc.) use inherent structures within the data in order to best organize the points into groups with maximum similarity.", "Remember that M&Ms analogy we mentioned way long ago? Imagine dumping a bag of colored M&Ms in front of a person and telling them to \u201cgroup them.\u201d Chances are they\u2019ll cluster the pieces of chocolate pretty well using color, shape, etc.", "Similarly, the computer looks at similarities amongst the data points entered and clusters them into groups based on maximum similarity.", "The most popular clustering algorithms include:", "Dimensionality Reduction, as the name suggests, is the process of reducing the dimensions of the input data\u2019s features. For example, if we have a hundred columns of features for each of our data entries, we could bring the columns down to, say, twenty.", "But you may ask, why not just use all the columns? That is because of the curse of dimensionality (oooh spooky\u2026 sorry, it\u2019s a lot less cool than it sounds).", "Without going into too much detail, the curse of dimensionality pretty much states that data with too many dimensions leads to overly complex models that are unable to generalize well; in other words, the model risks the chance of overfitting to our training data and resulting in poor performance on real world data.", "The most popular dimensionality reduction algorithms include:", "Ensemble algorithms are concerned with combining multiple weaker independently-trained models and their predictions in order to produce a final, more accurate prediction.", "As Aristotle\u2019s saying goes, \u201cThe whole is greater than the sum of its parts.\u201d Who thought philosophy would apply to ML, huh?", "In general, this is an extremely powerful class of algorithms and techniques which is used frequently across the machine learning community.", "The most popular ensemble methods include:", "Neural Networks are models that are inspired by our biological brains and neural connections (emphasis on inspire, not imitate\u2026 @ElonMusk). Although they are super flashy and seem sparkling new, neural networks have actually been around for decades!", "In general, neural networks can be grouped under the pattern matching umbrella in which it is used for regression and classification. As we will see in the coming section, Neural Networks are extremely powerful with modern computing abilities and have taken to their own field called Deep Learning.", "However, to call this section Neural Network \u201cAlgorithms\u201d is incorrect due to the fact that Neural Networks are an extremely large subfield comprised of hundreds of different algorithms and variations catered to specific facets and problems (i.e. computer vision, language processing, classification, etc.).", "The foundational and most popular algorithms that make neural networks include:", "Deep Learning is a modern reincarnation of Neural Networks that takes advantage of current \u201ccheap\u201d computation.", "In general, deep learning strives to create much larger and more robust neural networks with the use of equally large datasets of labelled data (images, text, video, audio, etc.).", "The most popular fundamental algorithms and structures of deep learning include:", "Even though what we covered in this article seems quite extensive, I am sorry/happy to say that we\u2019re barely scraping the surface! For example, I did not cover any of the algorithms pertaining to subfields of ML like natural language processing, recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, graphical models, etc. The list goes on and on but hopefully, this strikes enough curiosity for you to venture out and discover all of the extremely cool algorithms being implemented in the field today.", "Just to get a sense of all the machine learning algorithms we\u2019re glancing over, take a look at this Wikipedia page.", "But don\u2019t fret! This wiki page is fairly extensive and knowing the algorithms I mentioned in this article should give you more than enough of a strong foundation to start your new career in Machine Learning :).", "So, to wrap up our time together, let\u2019s look at what we went over. We began by learning the three core learning styles within Machine Learning; can you remember them from the top of your head? (If not, it\u2019s time to reread!)", "We then spent the large majority of the article going over different categories of Machine Learning algorithms and mentioning the most popular ones within each.", "If you have an algorithm that wasn\u2019t mentioned and you want to explain/put it in one of the listed categories, go ahead and put it in the responses for all the readers to see; after all, we\u2019re in this learning journey together :)", "In coming articles, we\u2019ll dive deeper into those specific algorithms as well as how we can make them from scratch; make sure you shoot a follow so you know when they come out! But for now, I hope you enjoyed this journey and learned something new.", "EDIT: The first part of the explained series is out! Learn linear regression and gradient descent with absolutely 0 prior experience!", "Your home for data science.
