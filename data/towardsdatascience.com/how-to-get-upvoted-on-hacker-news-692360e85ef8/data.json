As I looked at my posts go dying quickly down the \u201cnew\u201d section, I wondered what was the relationship between score and how long the story was remaining in the visible portion of the \u201cnew\u201d section, raising the probability of upvote.", "In this article I look at correlations between the score and different attributes of the story:", "The accompanying notebook can be found on Kaggle.", "Let\u2019s look at the distribution of scores. Scores start at 1 (you upvote yourself automatically when posting your story, that\u2019s how far I got :)).", "Posting a story on Hacker News is like flipping a coin. Your story likelihood of not getting upvoted is about 50%", "Let\u2019s get a quick read on the topics published on HN by doing a word cloud on the titles.", "There are 3.4% of Show HN stories and 3.3% of Ask HN stories. Let\u2019s remove those from the titles.", "More on trending topics towards the end of the article. Let\u2019s dive into what influences the score.", "Taking a look at the correlation matrix between score and couple of computed properties, the top influencer is the day of the week.", "Zooming in on a per week day average score, we see week-end days stand out.", "Also during the week-end, less stories are posted than during the week. The average time between stories on Saturday is around 3mn, about twice as much as during the week such as Monday.", "Not shockingly, when plotting the average score against the average time between stories, you get a pretty nice trend. What should be of equal influence is the number of viewers which we don\u2019t know, but from making the simplistic assumption that avg score = k * nreader * time between stories, then there should be around 25% less readers over the week-end on HN.", "This results in the average story score during the week-end to be about 30% higher than during the week.", "Show HN stories are more popular than Ask HN stories which in turn are more popular than regular posts. The value of a running demo is a significant advantage.", "Your likelihood of not being upvoted is 50% for a regular story against 30% for a Show HN story", "While Hacker News policy allows reposts within reason, some users or bots are clearly abusing it and not getting rewarded.", "Around 4% of stories are posted more than once (based on the title being the same, so this is a lower bound). On the high end of the reposters, those are the stories we find\u2026", "Looking at the average score vs number of repost, we see it raises up until 3 reposts then decreases hinting at spamming as seen in the table above.", "Since some of those reposts are coming from different people and possibly proxying a notable story rather than an intent for visibility, let\u2019s now slice by looking at the same story reposted by the same author. The graph below show a significant variance on the repost.", "We can see a lot of variation on your score on reposting for lower counts, and going down for higher count (hypothesis for low score evolves from not enough eyeballs to not enough interest). This is an average, there are edge cases as you can see from a recent example, where the score hovered around 2 then exploded to 192 after 8 reposts.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at the maximum score you can gain versus your initial score.", "On reposting your story, on average you will more than triple its initial score. And the most impactful days to repost are week-ends", "Hacker News likes Hacker News. While those stories (looking for \u201cHacker News\u201d in the title) are few (0.2%), the average score is 8.4 for them, versus 5.6 for a non Hacker News story.", "Stories about HN have a 50% higher score than average", "I wanted to do a bit of topic discovery for fun to see if there were particular topics scoring typically higher.", "For this, I computed the embeddings of the titles using BERT (in that case I averaged the per word embeddings to get a fixed vector length for the sentence), and also tried Google\u2019s sentence encoder which ended up working faster and better. While it is typical on such high dimensions (sentence encoding is 512 long) to use a cosine distance (pairwise distances are similar due with points being on the edge), in practice I found for the output of Google\u2019s sentence embedder (Transfomer\u2019s encoder), euclidean distances gave better results. Additionally, this type of analysis is memory hungry so I have only been able to sample 30000 titles on my standard issue kaggle kernel.", "Here are the topic discovered, along with their average score. Note that this is dated, the dataset available covers the Dec 2013 to Oct 2015 period", "Popular topic: web technologies, privacy, net neutrality and space exploration.
