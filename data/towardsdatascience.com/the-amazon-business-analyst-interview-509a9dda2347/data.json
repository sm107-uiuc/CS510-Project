A successful business analyst will move into a career path of product management, analytics management, or business intelligence, all of which require depth as well as width of knowledge.", "The Amazon interview process is extremely consistent across the different teams. Once your resume is shortlisted, the interview starts with a recruiter screening or phone screen with a hiring manager. Then if selected in those initial rounds, you are invited for an interview loop of around 4\u20135 interviews in the same day. All of the interviews are based on Amazon\u2019s 14 leadership principles to test your competency and may include technical interview questions.", "Overall the breakdown in terms of focus in preparation should be mainly on leadership principles, a little bit on database system design, and lastly on actually coding, SQL queries, and product and business cases.", "Check out a mock interview of an Amazon business case question.", "Based on the level (L3/L4/L5), you will have 4\u20135 rounds in person. Out of these, there will be a couple of technical rounds and a couple of behavioral rounds. Behavioral rounds will be mostly to judge you on the notorious leadership principles of Amazon.", "For Amazon\u2019s leadership behavioral competency interview, the exact phrasing of the question may be different but the central idea remains the same between each leadership principle.", "For each leadership principle, remember to craft a story around how you exemplified each one of these principles. For example:", "The interviewer will never state that they\u2019re asking you a leadership principles type question. Yet know exactly how to craft a story that leads to one of the fourteen principles. It\u2019s basically the elephant in the room!", "For these scenario-type questions such as tell me about a time where you\u2026etc, it\u2019s helpful to think about the STAR method. The STAR method is a simple framework to elaborate on your work experience.", "Situation: Setting the scene and give context.Task: Describe what your responsibility was.Action: Explain exactly what steps you took to address it.Result: Share what outcomes your actions directly achieved.", "For each part of the STAR method, let most of the discussion happen within the Action and Result section. You have to emphasize exactly what you did and the results from your actions. Don\u2019t let the project discussion go over 5 minutes given the short time of each interview.", "Also remember to think about having at least two to three projects and stories that you can confidently narrate and respond to follow-up questions. This reduces the risk that you don\u2019t have any relevant examples for the scenario based questions.", "The general technical questions to focus on would be:", "At least 1\u20132 rounds will be based on technical skills. For business analysts, the main skillset they are testing for is SQL, although it helps to know a little bit of Python, R, or data visualization tools like Tableau. Expect to see some easy to medium level SQL questions on Interview Query. There are also elements of data engineering such as raw data extraction, transformation, and loading data.", "Check out our ultimate guide to SQL interview questions", "Generally, business analysts will write some ETL pipelines as well, so it helps to brush up key concepts. This will depend on the team and whether they expect business analyst\u2019s to write ETL pipelines or not.", "Example ETL questions would be like:", "Check out this mock interview on how a candidate answers a data engineering and ETL problem given by Amazon.", "Amazon has moved almost completely to AWS internally so it will be good if you possess some AWS knowledge, especially the services related to databases. Additionally understanding how Redshift works should be beneficial in terms of SQL syntax that the interviewer will likely be familiar with.", "SQL questions will revolve around your understanding of the basic SQL logic like JOIN conditions using multiple datasets, and how to calculate averages, max, min, sums, and other functions.", "Refresh yourself on working with multiple datasets, creating new tables off of the data given, and creating a summarized output.", "Python and R are more advanced tools that are not required, but will make your candidacy stand out. Most teams will rely on a data engineer for their Python needs and a data scientist to utilize R for statistical analytics. Knowing these skills will make you more valuable as an Amazon business analyst.", "Additionally, the most common other technical questions to encounter are statistical analysis, consulting-style business case questions, and product insight generation which is interpreting impact of trends on a business. Expect some case-type questions in these tech rounds, questions like measurement and tracking of a particular performance metric, or automation of leadership reporting dashboards. These questions are commonly problem strategy type questions.", "You are tasked with flagging users who post fake comments on Amazon to then give to the modeling team for further analysis. How would you initially go about filtering users who post fake comments on Amazon?", "Find out what the best answers to this question above are on Interview Query.", "Your home for data science.
