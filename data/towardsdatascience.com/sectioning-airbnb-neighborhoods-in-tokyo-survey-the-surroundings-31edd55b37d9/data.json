Airbnb, just as in other major cities, is among the popular platforms to find one, especially for foreigners who possess little or no local language understanding.", "When arriving at Airbnb, people tend to wonder what are some good spots nearby. Hidden underrated sushi bars, authentic local ramen stalls, or maybe those \u2018grammable Japanesque cafes are waiting to be discovered. Quick Google search will do, but what if we could explore what kind of places are there in which area before even booking the place? Or find out areas with similar characteristics but cost less? We probably could save more time on deciding where to go and even plan our trip better. This light project aims to answer that question. It\u2019s not only targeting travelers, but also might be useful for those interested in running the lodging or related business around the proximity, or even for people who consider living in the world\u2019s most populous metropolitan city and wonder what the neighborhoods look like.", "Inside Airbnb has one of the most updated databases for any Airbnb cities in the world, and it\u2019s free; thanks to their scraping tool that managed to extract texts from the relatively complex HTML structure of the Airbnb webpage. After grabbing only the necessary data for the analysis, the data consisting of 13367 listings (as of November 2019) would look like this:", "Then I aggregated the data to find out the number of listings, average price, and latitude/longitude coordinate of each neighborhood. To add some more spice, I did a quick BeautifulSoup scraping on the Special Wards of Tokyo Wikipedia page containing population and area data of the city\u2019s administrative 23 wards.", "Subsequently, based on the coordinates, I retrieved a maximum of 100 recommended places for each area within walking distance radius (less than 1km) using Foursquare API. There might be some areas that are less concentrated than the others, therefore having fewer spots surrounding. I found it interesting to see the obtained results as I didn\u2019t know some quite nice places around despite living within the area for years now. Displayed below are the first few rows of 2216 records collected. We would look up more on the venue category to have a glance at the surroundings and answer the project question. So let\u2019s get going to further analysis.", "The chart below sums up all the information and gives us a glimpse of the comparison between the wards. I am using Plotly for the visualization, so feel free to hover around.", "Overall, Tokyo listings cost 12k~15k JPY ($110~140) per night on average. It\u2019s relatively equal or lower than average in other world\u2019s major cities but it\u2019s been actually getting pricier since last year due to rising demand ahead of Olympics Games this summer.", "Area and population seem to be well-correlated as Nerima, Adachi, Edogawa, and Ota are in roughly equal size and color. It\u2019s also interesting to see Bunkyo as the most expensive ward although it sits at bottom 3 for the number of listings. Besides, a spike on Edogawa price despite being on par in terms of population and area with 2 cheapest regions, is probably due to its easy access to Tokyo Disney Resort as well as to the city center. 5 outliers are easily identified for having \u00b11000~ listings; there seems to be an apparent reason for that which we\u2019ll see in the next few lines.", "You might be wondering where most of Tokyo\u2019s Airbnb listings are concentrated. So here\u2019s the map showing the apartment locations (smaller radius means less costly) and the 23 special wards pointed by the marker icons.", "Roughly there are 3 big groups and a few smaller clusters of listings. The one at 4 o\u2019clock position of Nakano sign there is Shinjuku, the busiest district in the country and also where ~17% of Tokyo listings are located. Having the city\u2019s central station and lots of attractions could be the main reason why rental apartments are bunched there. Slightly to the north, we could see the second packed area \u2014 Toshima \u2014 home to the famous Ikebukuro district. It\u2019s one of the main hubs connecting Tokyo and the neighboring suburbs as well as among convenient areas to live. The last group is situated on the east side where Taito and Sumida based. The must-visit Asakusa Shinsoji Temple and Tokyo Skytree never fail to attract a vast number of tourists there every single day. I am not quite familiar with the locale around but I heard more influx are coming to reside, thanks to reasonable rent and improving infrastructure.", "In dataset 3, there are 242 unique categories with \u2018Convenience Store\u2019, \u2018Ramen Restaurant\u2019, \u2018Japanese Restaurant\u2019 (you don\u2019t say), \u2018Cafe\u2019, and \u2018Sake Bar\u2019 top the list. Random categories such as \u2018Well\u2019, \u2018Belarusian Restaurant\u2019, and \u2018Intersection\u2019\u2019 are also found in the list.", "To figure out what the neighborhood looks like, I listed up the most common venue categories in each ward then used the relative frequency values for the segmenting part. The aggregated table is a sparse 23\u00d7243 matrix.", "This time I would just fit the k-means clustering algorithm to find similar neighborhood groups as it\u2019s common and powerful for unsupervised tasks. I choose 4 as the optimum number of k after examining the elbow method and silhouette score. Other features in dataset 2 aren\u2019t included in fitting the model to avoid demographic and spatial noise. But those are instead useful in comparing the difference between clusters as shown in the table below:", "The first and second cluster look like this,", "and here are the remaining third and fourth.", "For those who are not familiar with Tokyo, it should be difficult to see the geographical pattern just from looking at the table above, so the following refined visualization might help.", "We have observed interesting findings only from a relatively small dataset from basic geospatial data, Airbnb listings, and Foursquare. In the brief check part, you could have a big picture of which neighborhood suits your needs. For instance, if you want to stay at a place in the common area and are willing to be charged more than average, set your filter search to one of the top 5 wards in the number of listings. Or those who could compromise spending a bit more transits and commute time for cheaper rents may find places around Nerima and Adachi suitable for them.", "The clustering result also turned out to be surprisingly good. Without putting geocoordinate data into k-means fitting, the outcome seemingly found the way to form segments that group neighborhood with its spatially close counterpart. If I may include my own domain knowledge, cluster 1 consists of the outskirts, cluster 2 represents the traveler-friendly area, cluster 3 seems to be the all-rounder (business, shopping, tourism), cluster 4 is pretty much random. Seeing further, each cluster could be characterized as below:", "When booking Airbnb or other rental lodgings, it might be useful in understanding the characteristics and the surroundings. You know which neighborhoods that may fit and not fit your preferences, by considering the location, average price, and/or population density, too. Popular areas like Shinjuku, Shibuya, Ikebukuro, Ueno, and Asakusa are where the rental apartments are condensed. However, less famous neighborhoods are also worth trying and they cost comparatively less; perhaps you\u2019ll find hidden gems and local experiences along the way. The data reveals that the Japanese capital could diverge into 4 zones. The suburbs? The travelers\u2019 swarm? The all-in-one districts? Or the average locales? Which one would you prefer?", "This writing is part of the applied capstone project of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate.", "Your home for data science.
