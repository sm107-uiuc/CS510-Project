They come in many shapes, but in only one size: probabilities in a distribution always add up to 1. We will now delve into the different types of distributions, in terms of the dataset being continuous or discrete.", "When we see a graph like the one in the figure below, we think that it shows the probability of a given value occurring. However, this is not entirely true for continuous data because there is an infinite number of data points. As such the probability of a specific value happening can be very small \u2014 infinitely small!", "The PDF represents the probability of a given range of values occurring. And hence the word \u2018density\u2019! To visualise the probability, we plot the dataset as a curve. The area under the curve between two points corresponds to the probability that the variable falls between those two values.", "\u270f\ufe0f The \u2018infamous\u2019 bell-shaped Standard Normal DistributionTo understand this a bit more, we will examine a special case of PDF:", "Between the mean and one standard deviation (1\u03c3) there is 34.1% possibility of a value landing in that range. So for a given value there is 68.2% chance to fall between -1\u03c3 and 1\u03c3 \u2014 which is very likely!!!What this means is that there is a concentration of values near the mean and as we get out beyond the one standard deviations (+-), the probability gets smaller and smaller.", "When it comes to discrete data, the PMF is the measure that gives us the probability of a given value occurring. To visualise the probability, we plot the dataset as a histogram.", "Now that we understand the distinction between PDF and PMF, we will see the most frequently occurring distribution types, starting with the continuous ones.", "A uniform distribution means there is a flat constant probability of a value occurring within a given range, and is concerned with events that are equally likely to occur.", "In the plot above, we do not expect to see anything outside the range of under 0.0 or beyond 1.0. But within this range, we have a flat line because there is a constant probability of any one of those values occurring.", "We saw a standard normal distribution when we explored what PDF is. If we introduce the \u2018random\u2019 element, a normal distribution does not look like a perfect curve, but more like the following example.", "The mean for the standard normal distribution is zero, and the standard deviation is one.", "T or Student\u2019s T distribution looks a lot like the bell shaped curve of a normal distribution, but is a bit shorter and with heavier tails. It is used (instead of the normal distribution) when we have small samples and/or when the population variance is unknown.", "The chi-square (\u03c7\u00b2) distribution is used to assess a series of problems:", "The curve is skewed to the right.", "Another distribution function that is often encountered is the exponential probability distribution function, where things fall off in an exponential manner.", "There are fewer large values and more small values, i.e. it is very likely for something to happen, near zero, but then, as we get further away from it, it drops off dramatically.", "An every-day example is the amount of money customers spend in one trip to the supermarket: there are more people who spend small amounts of money and fewer people who spend large amounts of money.", "It is widely used to model the time elapsed between events as well as the reliability, which deals with the amount of time a product lasts, e.g. the amount of time (beginning now) in months, a car battery lasts.", "Before we move on to the next section, I would like to recommend this exceptional article on PDFs from Sean Owen, where he has created a map of their relationships:", "As for the discrete probability distributions the two main categories include:", "Let\u2019s consider an experiment having two possible outcomes: either success or failure. Suppose the experiment is repeated several times and the repetitions are independent of each other. The total number of experiments where the outcome turns out to be a success is a random variable whose distribution is called binomial distribution.", "The Poisson distribution gives the probability of a number of events occurring in a fixed interval of time, if these events happen:", "A classic example here is the number of phone calls received by a call centre. \u2014 Or \u2014 If we know the average number of things that happen in a given time period, another use-case can be to predict the odds of getting another value instead, on a given future time. E.g. my Medium posts get an average of 1,000 views per day; I can use the Poisson probability mass function to estimate the probability of having 1,500 visits.", "This brings today\u2019s article to an end!
