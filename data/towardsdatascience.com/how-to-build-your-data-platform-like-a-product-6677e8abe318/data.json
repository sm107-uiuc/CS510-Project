Despite the data platform\u2019s rising popularity, however, little literature exists on what it actually takes to successfully build one.", "Barr Moses, CEO & co-founder of Monte Carlo, and Atul Gupte, former Product Manager for Uber\u2019s Data Platform Team, share advice for designing a data platform that will maximize the value and impact of data on your organization.", "Your company likes data. A lot. Your boss requested additional headcount this year to beef up your data engineering team (Presto and Kafka and Hadoop, oh my!). Your VP of Data is constantly lurking in your company\u2019s Eng-Team Slack channel to see \u201chow people feel\u201d about migrating to Snowflake. Your CEO even wants to become data-driven, whatever that means. To say that data is a priority for your company would be an understatement.", "To satisfy your company\u2019s insatiable appetite for data, you may even be building a complex, multi-layered data ecosystem: in other words, a data platform.", "At its core, a data platform is a central repository for all data, handling the collection, cleansing, transformation, and application of data to generate business insights. For most organizations, building a data platform is no longer a nice-to-have but a necessity, with many businesses distinguishing themselves from the competition based on their ability to glean actionable insights from their data, whether to improve the customer experience, increase revenue, or even define their brand.", "Much in the same way that many view data itself as a product, data-first companies like Uber, LinkedIn, and Facebook increasingly view data platforms as \u201cproducts,\u201d too, with dedicated engineering, product, and operational teams. Despite their ubiquity and popularity, however, data platforms are often spun up with little foresight into who is using them, how they\u2019re being used, and what engineers and product managers can do to optimize these experiences.", "Whether you\u2019re just getting started or are in the process of scaling one, we share five best practices for avoiding these common pitfalls and building the data platform of your dreams:", "For several decades, data platforms were viewed as a means to an end versus \u201cthe end,\u201d as in, the core product you\u2019re building. In fact, although data platforms powered many services, fueling rich insights to the applications that power our lives, they weren\u2019t given the respect and attention they truly deserve until very recently.", "When you\u2019re building or scaling your data platform, the first question you should ask is: how does data map to your company\u2019s goals?", "To answer this question, you have to put on your data platform product manager hat. Unlike specific product managers, a data platform product manager must understand the big picture versus area-specific goals since data feeds into the needs of every other functional team, from marketing and recruiting to business development and sales.", "For instance, if your business\u2019s goal is to increase revenue (go big or go home!), how does data help you achieve these goals? For the sake of this experiment, consider the following questions:", "By answering these questions, you\u2019ll have a better understanding of how to prioritize your product roadmap, as well as who you need to build for (often, the engineers) versus design for (the day-to-day platform users, including analysts). Moreover, this holistic approach to KPI development and execution strategy sets your platform up for a more scalable impact across teams.", "It goes without saying that receiving both buy-in upfront and iterative feedback throughout the product development process are necessary components of the data platform journey. What isn\u2019t as widely understood is whose voice you should care about.", "Yes, you need the ultimate sign-off from your CTO or VP of Data on the finished product, but their decisions are often informed by their trusted advisors: staff engineers, technical program managers, and other day-to-day data practitioners.", "While developing a new data cataloging system for her company, one product manager we spoke with at a leading transportation company spent 3 months trying to sell her VP of Engineering on her team\u2019s idea, only to be shut down in a single email by his chief-of-staff.", "Consider different tactics based on the DNA of your company. We suggest following these three concurrent steps:", "At the end of the day, it\u2019s important that this experience nurtures a community of data enthusiasts that build, share, and learn together. Since your platform has the potential to serve the entire company, everyone should feel invested in its success, even if that means making some compromises along the way.", "Unlike other types of products, data platforms are not successful simply because they benefit \u201cfirst-to-market.\u201d Since data platforms are almost exclusively internal tools, we\u2019ve found that the best data platforms are built with sustainability in mind versus feature-specific wins.", "Remember: your customer is your company, and your company\u2019s success is your success. This is not to say that your roadmap won\u2019t change several times over (it will), but when you do make changes, do it with growth and maturation in mind.", "For instance, Uber\u2019s big data platform was built over the course of five years, constantly evolving with the needs of the business; Pinterest has gone through several iterations of their core data analytics product; and leading the pack, LinkedIn has been building and iterating on its data platform since 2008!", "Our suggestion: choose solutions that make sense in the context of your organization, and align your plan with these expectations and deadlines. Sometimes, quick wins as part of a larger product development strategy can help with achieving internal buy-in \u2014 as long as it\u2019s not shortsighted. Rome wasn\u2019t built in a day, and neither was your data platform.", "It doesn\u2019t matter how great your data platform is if you can\u2019t trust your data, but data quality means different things to different stakeholders. Consequently, your data platform won\u2019t be successful if you and your stakeholders aren\u2019t aligned on this definition.", "To address this, it\u2019s important to set baseline expectations for your data reliability, in other words, your organization\u2019s ability to deliver high data availability and health throughout the entire data life cycle. Setting clear Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Indicators (SLIs) for software application reliability is a no-brainer. Data teams should do the same for their data pipelines.", "This isn\u2019t to say that different stakeholders will have the same vision for what \u201cgood data\u201d looks like; in fact, they probably won\u2019t, and that\u2019s OK. Instead of fitting square pegs into round holes, it\u2019s important to create a baseline metric of data reliability and, as with building a new platform feature, gain sign-off on the lowest common denominator.", "We suggest choosing a novel measurement (like this one for data downtime) that will help data practitioners across the company align on baseline quality metrics.", "One of the first decisions you have to make is whether or not to build the platform from scratch or purchase the technology (or several supporting technologies) from a vendor.", "While companies like \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 Uber, LinkedIn, and Facebook have opted to build their own data platforms, often on top of open source solutions, it doesn\u2019t always make sense for your needs. While there isn\u2019t a magic formula that will tell you whether to build vs. buy, we\u2019ve found that there is value in buying until you\u2019re convinced that:", "One VP of Data Engineering at a healthcare startup we spoke with noted that if he was in his 20s, he would have wanted to build. But now, in his late 30s, he would almost exclusively buy.", "\u201cI get the enthusiasm,\u201d he says, \u201cBut I\u2019ll be darned if I have the time, energy, and resources to build a data platform from scratch. I\u2019m older and wiser now \u2014 I know better than to NOT trust the experts.\u201d", "When it comes to where you could be spending your time \u2014 and more importantly, money \u2014 it often makes more sense to buy a tried and true solution with a dedicated team to help you solve any issues that arise.", "Building your data platform as a product will help you ensure greater consensus around data priorities, standardize on data quality and other key KPIs, foster greater collaboration, and, as a result, bring unprecedented value to your company.", "In addition to serving as a vehicle for effective data management, reliability, and democratization, the benefits of building a data platform as a product include:", "Building a data platform might seem overwhelming at first blush, but with the right approach, your solution has the potential to become a force multiplier for your entire organization.", "Want to learn more about building a reliable data platform?
