But for Jeff to care, you need to grow your user base pronto. How?", "Decision-making always boils down to these sorts of questions. How should we do something? Which course of action should we take?", "Yet, even when drowning in data, it feels like you never seem to have quite what you need to make an informed decision. This article not only explains why this keeps happening, but actually offers a solution. Just between us, this is some of the most useful stuff I know.", "One thing\u2019s for sure, it\u2019s not numbers we\u2019re short of. For example, at your imaginary mobile payments company you come across plenty of seemingly-insightful stats, often visualized in charts, just like this one:", "It certainly tells you that, among mobile payment apps, WeChat has the largest user base.", "Because you\u2019ve been in this industry for, what, at least two months, you know that both Alipay and WeChat target mainly the Chinese market. So, looking at the relative size of the columns, you infer that there are more Chinese customers using mobile payments than elsewhere in the world.", "But that\u2019s pretty much it. Among the things this chart doesn\u2019t tell us are:", "When seeking to solve a business problem, we have some \u2014 maybe many \u2014 potential ideas as to how to solve it. We\u2019re open to more, but what we\u2019d really like is an indication of which ideas might work best.", "To figure out the stuff we need to know to answer such questions, it\u2019s useful to use a mental model called the DIKW pyramid.", "Its name is an acronym for the four layers of stuff you can know: Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom. We\u2019ll soon break down what each of these layers means.", "But what stands out immediately, is that not all types of \u201cknowing\u201d are the same \u2014 and some are worth more than others.", "Here\u2019s a great example: despite an explosion of commercial solutions, marketing analytics still fails to impress, and the contribution to company-wide performance has been consistently blah for the past six years.", "Don\u2019t you find it odd, for companies to have all this data sloshing about, yet to consistently struggle to make good use of it?", "The researchers conducting the survey were very clear about what needs to change:", "\u201cRather than create data and then decide what to do with it, firms should decide what to do first, and then which data they need to do it.\u201d", "It seems simple enough, but when we look at the pyramid, the issue suddenly becomes obvious:", "The actionable insights we are after are in the WISDOM layer, all the way at the top; but the stuff we collect in order to arrive at the insights is DATA, right there at the bottom.", "So, to get meaningful answers to business questions, it\u2019s never enough to just collect data, or even to analyze it. It\u2019s about nailing a process to get from DATA up to WISDOM.", "Having such a roadmap means you can backtrack from a business question into the sort of data you\u2019ll be wanting. So, right at the initial stages of designing your questionnaire or deciding what data to collect, you\u2019re able to tell what you\u2019ll be needing later on.", "With this in mind, can you imagine how great it would be if getting from one level to next was merely a matter of specific formal steps?", "Well, I did say it\u2019s one of the most useful things I know.", "Data is merely a collection of observations: a computer server log; a list of transactions; a collection of items. Knowing nothing, any insight we can derive from data will be the outcome of processing it.", "We obtain information by asking quantifiable questions about the data. A crude but useful rule of thumb is to say that information is essentially counting data points:", "Why or How can never be asked on data to derive information. So, by the time we\u2019ve obtained information, we know something \u2014 but nothing useful, because we lack context.", "Just look at this jumble of information points. Each seems insightful, but actually tells you very little, because you haven\u2019t got any reference point.", "We obtain knowledge when we compare and contrast two or more units or information. Notice it\u2019s always done with bits of information, not bits of data. To see this, recall the digital payments chart.", "Consider how pointless it would have been to say: WeChat has 600 million users, and Paypal logged a UK transaction on Monday 08:35GMT.", "One is an information point, the other is a data point; the two don\u2019t mesh.", "Instead, we counted how many users each payment platform had. That was information, derived out of data. By ordering these results, we could tell WeChat has the largest user base. That\u2019s knowledge \u2014 a relational fact.", "More generally, the way to derive knowledge from information points is by making deductions using logical quantifiers:", "Notice you can use information points derived from different data sets. For example, our chart didn\u2019t state where each app\u2019s user base is located. That WeChat and AliPay have mostly China-based clients was information we got elsewhere.", "Be careful though! The logical deduction must be valid. For example, we cannot say the following, because this inference is false:", "I see A LOT of studies, surveys and analyses falling into this trap: they present a conclusion, without ever pausing to consider alternative \u2014 yet equally valid \u2014 explanations. (The Economist is a particular repeat offender.)", "You\u2019ll appear much more insightful by laying out different possible explanations, instead of opting directly for the one you happen to prefer.", "All the previous types of knowing something share a common trait; they can all be crushed with two simple words: So What?", "By contrast, wisdom is an actionable insight. You can tell it apart because it cannot be similarly whacked down:", "Wisdom is highly desirable because it\u2019s the only outcome that turns a data study useful. It typically addresses cause-and-effect questions \u2014 like How and Why \u2014 the very questions we\u2019d really like to answer.", "There is never just one logical way to solve a business problem, since there will always be several competing possible answers. Still, here are two useful pointers on getting from knowledge to wisdom.", "One, wisdom is derived out of knowledge using, again, logical quantifiers, this time between knowledge statements. As before, it\u2019s no use trying to mix up, say, knowledge and information.", "Two, you\u2019re unlikely to get all the required knowledge from a single dataset.", "Please read that last statement again. However wonderful your customer survey, your daily website traffic log or your Kaggle dataset, it\u2019s probably not enough. You\u2019ll need either more information (to combine into new pieces of knowledge), or pre-derived knowledge.", "By now we\u2019ve realized that, when making decisions, we\u2019re after the stuff at the top of the pyramid, while the data we actually collect is the stuff at the bottom. Without prior planning, odds are we\u2019ll never end up collecting the right data to allow for the full logical deduction chain.", "So, to evaluate alternative courses of action with a data-driven approach, you need to backtrack down the logical chain that would support each action:   At first, this will give you a bunch of KNOWLEDGE statements, bound together by logic. But each of these can be broken down to the series of INFORMATION statements. And those tell you exactly what the sort of things you need to be counting, directly suggesting which DATA points you should be collecting.", "Then, once you\u2019ve actually collected the data, you start following your steps. And that\u2019s when you find out if the data, or the information, or the knowledge, actually stacks up in reality:", "Maybe you thought targeting low-income customers would be a good idea, because they\u2019d prefer payment apps due to lower transaction costs. But then you collected and counted the data, and the resulting information showed that it\u2019s mostly middle-income folk who use payment apps. Or maybe you though that among well-off customers, those with more credit cards would have a better attitude towards digital payments. By backtracking, you now realize you\u2019ll want to know how many credit cards your prospects hold. Once you\u2019ve counted and sorted the data \u2014 the knowledge you\u2019ve gained showed it actually makes no difference. Sure, these targeting ideas turned out to be duds. But you were able to know beforehand what data you\u2019ll need to judge these options, because you\u2019ve laid out the full path from the course of action all the way back to the data.", "This article almost didn\u2019t see the light of day, even though I\u2019ve been writing it for weeks. When I showed earlier drafts to smart readers I trust, they sort of winced:", "\u201cAlso, nobody cares about digital payments.\u201d", "Mental models are abstract, but that doesn\u2019t make them any less useful. There\u2019s unbelievable business value in knowing which questions to ask, and I stand by what I said: The DIKW pyramid model is a practical tool for generating actionable insights, because it cuts through the fog of getting from the data layer to the wisdom layer.", "Your home for data science.
