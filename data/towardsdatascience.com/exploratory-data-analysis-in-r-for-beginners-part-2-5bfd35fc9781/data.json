Here is a quick summary of Part 1:", "Those are the basic steps in performing simple EDA. However, to make our plots, charts and graphs more informative and of course visually appealing, we need to make one step further. What do I mean by that? Let\u2019s find it out!", "Doing EDA is not merely about plotting graphs. It is about making informative graphs. In this article, you would expect to find the following tricks:", "By the end of this article, you would be able to generate the following plots:", "Let\u2019s quickly look at the types of datasets that we created in Part 1 of this series.", "Please refer back to my previous article for a detailed explanation on how to manipulate the original dataset to get these various versions.", "Great! Let\u2019s start our new visual plots now", "First of all, we want to achieve this kind of boxplot", "In order to get this, we must have a data frame where the rows are the countries and 4 columns, namely, Country names, % difference in Maths, Reading and Science. Now refer back to all the dataframes we created earlier, we can see that df has all of these requirements. Hence we will select relevant columns from df and name it as df5", "Done! Following this code, you should be able to get the plot as above.", "Now we want to move on to the next level. This is the plot that we want to get", "Thankfully, the \u2018ggplot2\u2019 package has everything we need. It is just a matter of whether we can find these arguments and functions in the \u2018ggplot2\u2019 package. But before we even move on to what arguments and functions to use, we need to determine what kind of data frame/structure the dataset should be. By looking at this plot, we can see that the data frame must have 1 column of 3 categories (Maths, Reading and Science), 1 column of numeric results for the % difference in performance in each subject and of course, 1 column for the country name. Hence 3 columns in total.", "Now we have df5 that looks like this", "How would we transform this into a data frame described above? Remember a trick I introduced in Part 1 of this series, the magical function is pivot_longer(). Now, lets do it:", "The column \u2018Test Diff\u2019 is now redundant so you can choose to delete that, simply use the code below. (This step is not compulsory)", "Here, I will not delete it.", "Great! Now that we have the data set in the right structure ready for visualization, let\u2019s use ggplot now", "Is this good enough? The answer is NO: Caption, titles and subtitles are too small, the proportion and size of the plot is not as good as the plot we introduced at the start of this section.", "We can do a better job.", "To adjust the size and so on, use theme () function", "Here, don\u2019t ask me how I got those numbers to put. This is trial and error. You can just simply try out any numbers until you get the perfect size and position.", "The plot looks much better now. You can stop here. However, I would like to introduce a way to rearrange the order of variables to get a decreasing trend. Simply use", "Awesome!! Now the plot looks really informative. However, better data analysts would produce something even more informative like the following:", "Let\u2019s define the outlier. This part requires a bit of Statistics knowledge. I would recommend you to read Michael Galarnyk\u2019s article here. He explains the concepts pretty well.", "Notice that the columns \u2018Country\u2019 and \u2018Test\u2019 are factors. First let\u2019s change it to characters.", "As you can see, the last column of the data frame shows that Jordan is an outlier. Now, at the \u2018Country\u2019 column, we want to make sure that only the outliers are labeled, the rest should be put as \u2018NA\u2019. This will be helpful for us later when we code the visualization plot.", "Now, let\u2019s plot the graph. The same code as above. However we need to add in geom_text () to label the outliers", "For each of the plot in the combined plot above, we have gone through how to create it in Part 1 of this series. Here is the recap:", "To combine them all together, use \u2018gridExtra\u2019 package.", "That is it! Again, I hope you guys enjoyed and picked up something from this article. Of course, this guide is not exhaustive, and there are a lot of other techniques we can use to do EDA. However, I believe this guide will more or less give you some ideas of how to do improve from a simple plot to a more complicated and informative plot with R.", "If you have any questions, feel free to put them down in the comment section below. Once again, thank you for your read. Have a great day and happy programming!!!", "Your home for data science.
