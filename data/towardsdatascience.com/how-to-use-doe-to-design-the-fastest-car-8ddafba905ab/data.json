The race-car was built from a limited number of Lego bricks. Through the construction of this race-car, the distance was meticulously compared in order to find the optimal model.", "First off, when the experiment was conducted, all of the observations were taken on the same day. As mentioned before, there were two different replications of this model with four factors (which will be introduced in the next section). The angle of this ramp against the wall came out to 24 degrees, and the measurements of the ramp were 28\u201d (L) x 12.5\u201d (H). For testing purposes, the car was released from the top of this stable ramp and travelled across the room for a certain distance. Each of the variations that were tested, regarding the model, held a different combination of factors in order to discover the best race-car.", "The first factor that was picked for the project is Ground Clearance(A), which describes the height of the model\u2019s base from the ground in centimeters. In order to see if ground clearance matters, 2 centimeters has been chosen for the factor level of \u201c-1\u201d and, on the other hand, 2.2 centimeters is under factor level \u201c1\u201d. The second factor that was chosen in this project is the axle base(B) of the model, which is related to the width of the axel base on the front and back of the car. To see if this factor matters, 4.8 centimeters was picked for the factor level of \u201c-1\u201d and 6.4 centimeters was picked for the factor level of \u201c1\u201d. The third factor that was picked for the project is the front wheel size(C), which describes the different sets of wheels that can be fitted to the model. Once again, the small wheel size will be denoted by the factor level of \u201c-1\u201d and the large wheel size will be denoted by the factor level of \u201c1\u201d. The fourth and final factor is the spoiler(D) of the model, which is the mini wing-shaped mechanism on the back of the model. To see if there is an actual change in the results, the factor level of \u201c-1\u201d will be used for the replication of the model that does not have a spoiler and \u201c1\u201d will be used for the model that has a spoiler.", "The distance from the end of the ramp was measured with a measuring tape. In this project, the response variable (y) is the horizontal distance that is measured from the end of the ramp. For each observation, the distance from the center of the ramp\u2019s base was measured. In terms of the race-car, the measurements were made from the back, left wheel of the model in order for better accuracy throughout all of the observations. Through this experimental setup, a full table of data was gathered with all 32 observations.", "The design of this experiment involved constantly testing out the Lego race-car with the same base model, while also implementing the four factors and two replications. In order to reduce the variation in this model, we selected the previously mentioned factors for quick adjustments during the testing period. This enabled comparative decisions to be made by seeing how the models compared, when different combinations of factors were present. In order to avoid any noise, the experiment was rerun two more times to avoid and block any noise parameters in these rare situations. In the approach of this project, two constraints were followed in order to ensure that the car\u2019s performance was not enhanced by any external factors. The first constraint was that the given Lego blocks were the only ones used in this DOE project. The second constraint involved making sure that all the models tested had the windshield and steering wheel provided in the Lego set.", "The \u201cResiduals Versus Fits\u201d in the plot below demonstrates that all residuals separate randomly around the midline of 0. This kind of pattern supports the assumption of regression that the relationship is linear and suggests that the residuals have constant variance, while also pointing out that there are no outliers. This can further be seen through the variety of the points in the chart. There are no red flags or trends in the plot that would indicate a problem in the data. Now, the \u201cResiduals Versus Order\u201d plot also shows that all residuals randomly around the middle line of 0 with very similar results to the previously mentioned plot. Therefore, both of these plots indicate that the residuals are independent and not correlated with each other. When looking at the \u201cNormal Probability Plot\u201d, the points are normally distributed with a very strong linear relationship to indicate normality. The \u201cHistogram\u201d plot also tells a similar story, as the frequency of the residuals shows a very normally distributed set of data.", "As seen in the chart above, the significant factors can be seen through four combinations that came from the dataset. The first significant factor is the axle base. The second, significant factor is the ground clearance from the base of the race-car to the floor. The third significant, factor is the wheel size of the front of the car. The final and most intriguing factor is the combination of the ground clearance, axle base, and the spoiler. First off, this point includes D, which is not a significant factor in of itself. On the other hand, this particular mix of the factors produced a difference in the data that rivaled the other significant factors that have been previously mentioned.", "The \u201cMain Effects\u201d plot here shows that there is a larger effect from factors A, B, C, as compared to D. The reason for this is that the lines are much steeper, which indicates that a strong main effect is present. The steepest of these is approximately the axle base, as this factor has a very significant and positive effect. While there may be a slight main effect, regarding the spoiler, the line is closer to being horizontal, which would show that this is, in fact, less significant.", "The \u201cInteraction Plot for Distance\u201d above shows various interactions that may be present in the data. Each graph here that is closer to being parallel, such as A*B at the top left, does not have an interaction that is present in the data. On the other hand, there is an interaction for A*D, which is \u201cGround Clearance * Spoiler\u201d, as the two lines cross each other and, therefore, indicates the presence of a relationship. Furthermore, these two factors, being A*D, have an effect on each other, due to this occurrence.", "The \u201cCube Plot\u201d shown above here displays the fitted means, as related to the results of the experimental testing and the dataset. The largest of these values is 46.3828 at the top right of the left cube. This represents the fact that the A*B relationship produced a large value, as seen in this chart. Furthermore, the cube on the left holds higher fitted means, as compared to the other cube.", "The ANOVA table below indicates that all the 4 factors (A, B, C, and ABD) individually are significant. This can be seen through the P-Values of 0.017, 0.000, 0.002, and 0.026. Since each of these values are under .05, they are statistically significant and show that they make a difference in the data. Furthermore, they also have a high F value, which indicates statistical significance in most cases.", "The high R2 value of 80.09% indicates that the fitted values are very close to the actual observed values.", "The coded coefficients table below show that all the VIF values are each 1, indicating the factors have no multicollinearity.", "In conclusion, the most important factors that were found in this DOE project were both the ground clearance and the axle base. Each of these components had a large effect on the distance and speed of the Lego race-car. The best car that was chosen during the financial analysis is the \u201cAB\u201d model, which involves a wider axle base, higher ground clearance, small front wheels, and no spoiler. This car achieved the maximum average distance as compared to the other models. In terms of recommendations, the model with the large axle base, high ground clearance, small front wheels, and without a spoiler is the optimal race-car. Now, in terms of what else was experienced during the DOE project, a wider axle base for any model is recommended. All in all, the cost-effective model that was found displayed optimal distance and will be a contender in the \u201cRace Day\u201d competition.", "Thank you so much for reading my article!
