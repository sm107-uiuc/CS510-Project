So I thought of giving a definitive answer.", "It is not really impossible to do this but it will take a lot of time and effort. Fortunately, I had an ample supply of both.", "Given below is the way that I took, and any aspiring person could choose to become a self-trained data scientist.", "Some of the courses are not the same I did since some of them don\u2019t exist and some have been merged into bigger specializations.

The course will introduce data manipulation and cleaning techniques using the popular python pandas data science library and introduce the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with tutorials on how to use functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables effectively. By the end of this course, students will be able to take tabular data, clean it, manipulate it, and run basic inferential statistical analyses.", "This course gives an intro to many modern machine learning methods that you should know about.

No one likes to wait too long to get something useful, and you will become useful after this course.", "This course will introduce the learner to applied machine learning, focusing more on the techniques and methods than on the statistics behind these methods.
