Below is a data viz, created by my partner Jo\u00e3o Silva and I, which I will briefly comment on in two parts.", "European countries have won a total of 51 Best Foreign Language Oscars", "The Foreign Language category (newly branded as the Academy Award for the best International Feature Film) has awarded Oscars annually since 1956 to feature-length motion pictures produced outside the US with a predominantly non-English dialogue track. The first part of our data viz uses a bar chart formed of flags to show the spread of success for the four parts of the globe.", "This has been undeniably dominated by films from European countries \u2014 with Italy winning 11 Oscars, followed by France as the two most successful countries. These two countries have helped Europe claim 80% of the wins, with the Americas only winning 8% and Africa producing 5% of the winning films. Before last night, Asia was third place \u2014 but with \u2018Parasite\u2019 winning the Best Foreign Language Film (beating four European hopefuls), Asia now is even with the Americas with 5 wins.", "For the past 20 years, 50% of the winners have been non-European", "Looking at the first part of our data viz you could be forgiven for thinking that this is purely a story of Europe\u2019s dominance. But in the second part, we plotted the non-European wins on a timeline to highlight a new trend. The Algerian movie Z was the first non-European to win in 1969. Ivory Coast had the sole non-European win in the 1970s, while one film from Argentina represented the rest of the world during the 1980s.", "From 2000, a new trend forms starting with Asia\u2019s first winning film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon. In the past 20 years, now 50% of the winners have been non-European with Parasite confirming this new form of diversity in this category.", "Last night Parasite became the first foreign language film to ever win the top prize of Best Picture \u2014 an achievement that both the acclaimed Mexican Roma failed to do last year and this category\u2019s most successful country could not do with the wonderful Italian Life is Beautiful in 1998. This hopefully opens up the door for more attention to non-English language movies in general or at the very least, continues the trend for a more diverse Foreign Language category than we have had in the past.", "We combed through the Oscar data for this category and decided to categorise the Oscar wins by world area (Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas). We then used the browser-based UI and UX design application, Figma, to design the data viz.", "We used Country Flags to download images for the flags of the winning film\u2019s country of origin to form the bar chart, with flags repeated for the number of wins from each country. We repeated the use of flags again in a timeline to show the years of the winning films, omitting European countries. This clearly shows the cluster of non-European countries within the last 20 years.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Mostly data visualization.
