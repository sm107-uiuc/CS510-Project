Below I will share my findings and hope it can save your time on researching if you are once confused by the definition.", "This article will focus in explaining the main difference of 2 approaches and may not go through the coding in detail. Please visit the repository here for the respective Jupyter notebooks and you will find the Python implementation of both approaches!", "Based on my understanding, approach 1 is similar to item-based collaborative filtering. In short, the system will recommend anything similar to an item you like before.", "In model-building stage, the system first find the similarity between all pairs of items, then it uses the most similar items to a user\u2019s already-rated items to generate a list of recommendations in recommendation stage.", "For example, if someone watches Edge of Tomorrow, system may recommend Looper based on similarity .", "How can you find the similarity between items?", "Usually the similarity will be derived from the description of the item and the concept of TF-IDF will be introduced. Then each item will be represented by a TF-IDF vector.", "TF-IDF is in the sub-area of Natural Language Processing(NLP). It is used in information retrieval for feature extraction purposes. In short, you are somehow counting the occurrence of each words in a document and weight the importance of each words, and calculate a score for that document.", "Frequency of the word in the current document to the total number of words in the document. It signifies the occurrence of the word in a document and gives higher weight when the frequency is more so it is divided by document length to normalize.", "Total Number of Documents to the frequency occurrence of documents containing the word. It signifies the rarity of the word as the word occurring the document is less the IDF increases. It helps in giving a higher score to rare terms in the documents.", "In the End, TF-IDF is a measure used to evaluate how important a word is to a document in a document corpus. The importance of the word increases proportionally to the number of times a word appears in the document but is offset by the frequency of the word in the corpus.", "Since the method heavily relies on the description to distinguish each items, the description shall go deeper into the product details, i.e title, summary, taglines, genre, so that it provides much more information about the item.", "After defining the TF-IDF value for the tags, then we can make the keyword vectors for each item. Each row below represent a keyword vector for one item. For detail calculation on TF-IDF, you may refer to an article here.", "To compute how similar the item vectors are, we will can use various methods such as:", "Then the recommender will give recommendation based on the most similar items.", "I tried to implemented all three methods, and I find no significant difference in the recommended items. You can find my full code from this Jupyter notebook. The example dataset \u2014 Book Crossing Dataset can be downloaded here.", "This approach is similar to the definition from wikipedia.", "Approach 2 leverages description or attributes from items the user has interacted to recommend similar items. It depends only on the user previous choices, making this method robust to avoid the cold-start problem. For textual items, like articles, news and books, it is simple to use the article category or raw text to build item profiles and user profiles.", "Suppose I watch a particular genre movie I will be recommended movies with respective to that specific genre. The Title, Year of Release, Director, Cast are also helpful in identifying similar movie content.", "In this approach contents of the product are already rated based on the user\u2019s preference (User Profile), while the genre of an item is an implicit features that it will be used to build Item Profile. An item score is then predicted by using both profiles and recommendation can be made. Similar to approach 1, TF-IDF technique will also be used in this approach.", "How to build User Profile and Item Profile?", "Usually rating table (user rating), item profile (book genres) are the only material we've got.", "Then we will create the user profile so that we can understand what attribute the users actually prefer.", "Thus, with the user profile, we can predict all item score of a particular user based on his/her user profile and item profile.", "You can find my full code for approach 2 from this Jupyter notebook. While this approach requires information like book genre and it is absence from the book-crossing dataset, scrapping was done using Google Books API to retrieve the additional information. The scrapped info can be found here.", "P.S. The above findings are from my collaborative project in Data Science Bootcamp.
