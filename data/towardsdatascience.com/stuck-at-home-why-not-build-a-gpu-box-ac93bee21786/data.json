Probably the biggest obstable that I faced in getting started was the workflow, specifically, finding an accessible, fluid GPU-powered environment to work in. My Mac Pro (affectionately called the trash can model) was not going to help. I began to use cloud services, but missed having my own place to store data and run code without having the meter running. So I decided to build my own GPU box. At first it was pretty Intimidating (capital I), but things went fairly smoothly, and the end result was extremely gratifying. In case my adventure is interesting or helpful to you, here it is!", "I\u2019ll start with the mobo. Let me say upfront that this build won\u2019t apply without modification to your situation if you want to use multiple GPUs. I decided to build a mini-ITX form factor (i.e. small) machine with a single GPU because this was my first build and I thought it would be challenging enough. Also, I like my house to have a decorated and put-together feel, including my office. I wasn\u2019t trying to create a man cave gaming paradise with a large neon-glowing tower. But can I say, I love this board! For the gamers, this was the only RGB item I bought for the system, and it\u2019s perfect. But in practical building terms, the real bonus is the built-in I/O shield. As one of the helpful youtube gaming computer assembly gentlemen pointed out, installing the shield can be the most challenging part of the build. You\u2019re already a hero for building your own rig; you can catch a break without feeling guilty.", "I decided on the case early in the process, because it determined the sizes that would be possible for some of the other components. It\u2019s also pretty fun, because there are a lot of options. I chose the Core V1 because, while it\u2019s certainly a mini, it isn\u2019t super small, so there\u2019s still plenty of room for cables, etc. Some things to watch out for are: 1) the CPU cooler height, 2) the length of the GPU, and 3) the length of the power supply (PSU). This case is incredibly well designed. I like the fact that the board sits upright instead of sideways, so your components aren\u2019t \u2018hanging on for dear life\u2019 as one reviewer pointed out.", "I think I may have over-bought on the processor. I had to have generation 8 to fit the motherboard, but the \u2018K\u2019 in the model number means that the processor is unlocked and so can be \u2018overclocked.\u2019 This is gamer language for pushing the processor to go faster than normal; however, my board doesn\u2019t support this functionality anyhow (it\u2019s a B instead of a Z series).", "The cooler might be one place on a small machine where you pay a bit more, but this is the most highly rated item (reviewer stars) on my list. It\u2019s still less expensive than many liquid coolers (although not as lovely). Plus, who wants to burn things up \u2019cause they were too cheap to spend an extra $30. You will learn to love this baby.", "Not much to comment on for RAM. I decided to max out what the board could do. These sticks sit pretty low so it\u2019s not hard to attach the fan on the heat sink to clear them.", "For now I have one SSD. There\u2019s dedicated space in the case to add a second later if needed.", "For the PSU I went with the recommended power as specified by the GPU (\u2018Fully Modular\u2019 means that no cables are pre-attached, so you only use what you need). The PSU was the part I had the most concern about fitting into the case, but in it went.", "And lastly, the most important part. I chose the RTX 2070 due its performance/cost profile. Another plus with a custom machine is that you can update your GPU relatively easily in the future if needed.", "With a little planning and luck, it all fit beautifully! Now that you\u2019re done with hardware, you\u2019re ready to start installing the software to turn your box into a mean Deep Learning machine.", "Your home for data science.
