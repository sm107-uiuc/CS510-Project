If you have, you are not alone.", "According to the article by Balance Articles, employees jump across jobs and roles for averagely 12 times during their lifetime career. Shocking! Imagine what happened to all of those billions of dollars wasted put by the Multinational Companies (MNCs) to retain the employees or \u2026 you. (Put a sinister voice here, Du du Dum)", "Therefore, managing employee attrition effectively and efficiently is very important. New employees will spend lots of time and money to train and hire them which could otherwise be reallocated in another investment. In fact, this has been a big concern for IBM HR Professionals that IBM is investing billions of dollars in Watson to predict flight risk and win employee attrition. Surely this means knowing why employee quits is a great beginning to attract and retain talents.", "In conclusion,it is very important to derive a data driven decision making to understand employees leave to reduce turnover rate, save hiring/training cost and maximize work productivity. All of these translate into great profit for the years ahead.", "Through this publication, let us discuss how we could figure out why employees leave and find how to predict who is going to leave the company. Then, we will suggest how companies could retain them.", "The reason of this brainstorming is to make sure that we have some further rooms of topics to discover when our analysis hits a dead end.", "I have met some data analysts/scientists who have troubles to focus back to different solutions from what they are currently working on. In psychology this is called cognitive tunneling.", "Knowing how to solve this will greatly save you time to get your analysis flowing.", "To solve cognitive tunneling, one good practice is to brainstorm the questions to diffuse thoughts. Then after a good brainstorming session, plan your way to code. In my opinion, a good data scientist or developer should always engage in brainstorming to discover new perspectives on the questions and analysis in mind. Therefore, pause your deep urge to code and think.", "Ok, have you done that? Good. Let\u2019s move on :).", "The dataset comes from Kaggle by an user called ludobenistant which is taken down for unknown reasons. Fortunately, you could download the csv file in my repo below.", "The metadata includes the following features: Employee satisfaction level, Last Evaluation, Number of Projects, Average Monthly Hours, Time Spent at the Company, Whether they have had a work accident, Whether they have had a promotion in the last 5 years, Departments, Salary, Whether the employee has left.", "All of these are pretty straightforward; no need for further explanations, especially if you are already familiar with the darkness of corporate life \ud83d\ude08.", "Not funny? Anyway, let us start our journey by importing the csv file into Pandas Dataframe.", "Let us just glimpse on the quick and dirty sanity test at the data below with a simple code.", "This seems all right. In total, we have 14998 records in the dataframe.", "First, to understand the quick outlook of our dataset, let us describe the dataset. We will transpose it to put the features as rows for better view.", "This will describe all of the numerical features with their aggregated values (counts, means, etc). From here we could see that everything looks good: full count values, no null, and logical distributed values.", "One interesting value is the max average monthly hours: 310 hours. Wow! That means somebody is working 15 hours per weekday. Probably this guy is an investment banker \u2014 oops, no offense if you are one. Feel free to comment below if you are one \ud83d\ude01.", "We then can describe the non numerical values by including the datatype \u2018object\u2019 for parameter. include=[\u2018object\u2019]", "The sales here means the department that the employees are working on and the salary indicates \u201ctop\u201d,\u201dmedium\u201d,\u201dlow\u201d.", "Seems like Kaggle has spoilt us with data which is clean and ready for analysis. However, in reality, you should expect to engage in full throttle data cleaning which includes null values, outliers, etc.", "For those of you who do not know Seaborn, shame on me for not telling you sooner. In my opinion, this is one of the biggest treasures that every data analyst and scientist needs to be familiar of! (no joke!).", "Seaborn will allow you to create stunning graph and visualizations within a few seconds. Thus, a very important tool to brush up your story telling techniques as effective data scientists/analysts.", "Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. \u2014 Seaborn Pydata Org", "After importing seaborn and matplotlib, let us get the counts of people that left or stayed. We will visualize it in a simple matplotlib pie chart", "Now this is where Seaborn visualization really kicks in. Let us generate multiple Seaborn distribution for each leaving and staying employees, then combine it with Matplotlib Figure. This code will be a bit long as we are inserting 10 subplots (5 rows, 2 columns). But the visualization is really valuable to discover the trend and discrepancy among those who left and stayed. Hence the story telling!", "Neat! Remember this visualization and it will serve you good for life :). Now, what could we learn from this?", "Cool story, let us further engage to figure out how these variables are correlated to each other.", "Let us create correlation analysis to find out the correlations among features. This can be done by .corr() method to derive correlations of all the numerical values in the left employees data frame. Then let us apply the Seaborn Heatmap graph to indicate correlations of attributes among the employees that left.", "Seaborn saves the day! Very simple visualization, all in one line sns.heatmap().", "Within a quick glimpse, we could find some possible dependent elements such as:", "Let\u2019s keep that in mind when we do our prediction models and move on. For now, there seems to be no dependent features yet \u2014 based on our understandings of the metadata and the strength of correlations (>0.7)", "We will use Seaborn Factorplot to visualize left data frame based on the departments and salary levels. Since the image does not show clear enough text size, I have labelled the critical features to look at.", "We could now ask ourselves \u201cwhy?\u201d", "Let us visualize the boxplot to get clear answers why. Using Seaborn we could stack the visualizations inside the matplotlib figure. This will allow us to align the four features which we had covered earlier.", "For your understandings, I have numbered the stories derived by the visualization. Feel free to find the stories below. If you find that this is too far fetched, it is! The purpose is to let your imagination flow and be free range in coming up with your hypothesis. Some of them might even be true and you will emerge as heroes who found treasures among piles of rubble.", "In these stories, I took the opportunity to relate with some of my own personal experience or social groups. Feel free to clap or comment if you can relate :).", "Whew, so much stories we learnt today. Now, let us have some fun to generate the model. Hooray!!", "Let us start by creating the train and test data set.", "The idea is to train the model using using the training data set and test the model using the test data set. This is to avoid overfitting the model to reach high accuracy but high variance error. Another set that you could use is the validation set which is to tune the model.", "Please refer to this amazing train test validation split explanation on Medium.", "Once we have done the split, we will proceed to train and validate the model.", "Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm for classification and regression. This model will process each data point in n-dimensional space where n means the number of features you have. Each of the value is the value of a particular coordinate in the n-dimensional planes. The classification will then find this optimal hyperplane which gives the largest minimum distance to the training examples. It separates the classes, just like how you put a partition between your office desk and your annoying colleague\u2019s desk. This is my own example, please use on your own discretion!", "Here is an amazing reference for you to further learn about SVM.", "Now, let us train our SVM with the train data. Once we fit the model, we could find the accuracy through a simple scoring process.", "This will return accuracy of 0.96 which performs really well against the test data set.", "Decision tree is basically a binary tree flowchart where each node splits a group of observations according to some feature variable. The goal of a decision tree is to split your data into groups such that every element in one group belongs to the same category. This will be based on the lowest mean squared to make sure that each group has the homogeneity defined. The biggest advantage of this is that it is really intuitive and easy to use to derive insights.", "Please refer the following article for more information.", "Let us start training our decision tree.", "The biggest perk of having decision tree is to visualize it. You can import pydotplus and run the following visualizations.", "Neat! You just visualize a very intuitive decision tree. You could find the red circle to figure out these insights:", "This is very obvious but aligned with some of the hypothesis we brainstormed earlier, such as low satisfaction level and low last evaluation. This finding can also be represented in a rule based that you could easily code in excel sheet then present to your management for high evaluation (nice!).", "In general, we get satisfaction level as our top level node. Then it branches out to level 2 nodes with the number_project and time_spend_company. Technically the lower the node position, the less gini (classification dispersion) of the branch node is. This means that the lower the node, the more homogeneous the separations become.", "The top node holds the most important feature to separate the classifications, followed by the second level and so on.", "This is a bonus analysis to improve your understandings by training several classification models. I will cover each model in greater topic for my subsequent publications. For now we will just explore a piece of quick code to cover some models such as RandomForest, AdaBoost, etc.", "Great! You will get some prints as below, refer to the Python Notebook for the full prints:", "We will use accuracy and log loss to evaluate these models. Log loss is the accumulated cost derived from mismatches among the predicted features and the actual features. Please refer to the following post for the log loss definition:", "Using Seaborn, let us visualize which models that perform the best based on accuracy and log loss.", "Here you go, a nice visualization that showcase the performance of various models in our classification needs.", "From the graph, we learn that we should train the Random Forest Classification due to its low log loss and high accuracy. For you who do not know what Random Forest is, I would define it as an aggregation of various decision trees prediction. Feel free to read the following post for more details.", "This is how you can make the predictions with Random Forest Classifier to wrap up our analysis.", "That\u2019s the end of my walk through. Hopefully now you understand more about the tale behind flight risk and how you could keep your job from data driven insights :).", "The purpose for this Proof Of Concepts (POC) was created as a part of side project for learning purpose. The goal of this application is to help you retrieve and display the right insights quickly to understand and solve real life business problems.", "In the POC, I used Pandas to generate table format data frame for analysis, Seaborn to visualize the important analysis, and finally Machine Learning Models such as SVM and Decision Tree to predict employees flight risk. The Github Python Notebook Code is located below.", "Feel free to clone the repository and contribute whenever you have time.", "In lieu with today\u2019s topics about python and analytics. You could also visit another of my publication for aspiring investors. You should try this walk through to guide you to code quick and dirty Python to analyse, visualize, and predict stocks.", "Other good publication I have is Value Investing Dashboard for aspiring value investors.", "Hopefully from these two publications, you could learn how to create personal values through story telling. Please read and give claps if you like it :).", "I would like to thank you my fellow HR professionals and friends who gave me constructive feedback on this publication. I really enjoyed learning that you gained much values from this publication of mine.", "Whew\u2026 That\u2019s it, about my idea which I formulated into writings.
