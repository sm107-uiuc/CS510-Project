In this paper we explore Chicago crime data for fun."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["by Tyler Doll, Jeff Greene, Gazi Morshed", "This paper was originally submitted for my database class in college. We found it interesting and we spent a good amount of time on it so I wanted to share it here. It has been edited for this format.", "The city of Chicago is often called \u201cThe Windy City\u201d or \u201cThe Second City\u201d. It is often times known for its food which includes deep dish pizza and the Chicago hot dog. Unfortunately, Chicago is also notorious for its high rate of crime, and often the crimes committed are violent in nature. Because of the availability of data on the various crimes in the city of Chicago, we chose to examine the crime in Chicago to determine what information we could draw from analyzing the dataset. We were curious to see what the most frequent crimes in the city were, if those highly committed crimes changed from year to year and what the arrest rate was for different crimes. Although this dataset may not contain the most uplifting information, we thought it would be interesting to analyze and to try to determine if Chicago is really as violent as it is portrayed by the media.", "The data we chose was a dataset that consists of information about crime in the city of Chicago over the last 5 years. We thought this would be an intriguing dataset because we might be able to discover compelling trends within the data, in addition to observing what exactly was happening with crime in the city of Chicago. The data included but was not limited to the date of a crime, the block the crime was committed on, the community area, the Illinois Uniform Crime Reporting code (IUCR), the FBI Uniform Reporting Code, and the beat of the officer reporting the crime. The dataset was found on Kaggle and the set of data is considered to be licensed under a creative commons license CC0 1.0 public domain, which means that we could use the data without any further approval. We have four tables overall, but one of our tables was a staging table used to hold the unnormalized data. After going through the data and beginning to normalize it, we ended up with 3 main tables: Chicago crime data, Chicago IUCR codes, Chicago common areas (neighborhoods), and an auto-generated sequence table for chicago_crime_data. The information and attributes within the Chicago crime data table is self explanatory for the most part. However, the IUCR table attributes may require a bit of explanation. The id within this table matches the IUCR code used within the Chicago crime data table. This id is attached to a primary description and secondary description for a crime. For instance there are different ids based on the combination of the primary and secondary description. The example below is for homicides. Although all 3 of these offenses have the same primary type, they have a different secondary type and id.", "For ease of explanation of the attributes and data types used for each of our tables, we have included the two schemas for our tables below which also contain the primary and foreign keys:", "Most of the queries we performed on the database had to do with the numbers of particular crimes and the locations of different crimes. Although there were a wide variety of queries we wanted to perform on the data, in general we wanted to focus on the number of crimes and use this information to determine which crimes occur most often. We also looked at which committed crimes had the highest rate of arrest and as well as their locations throughout Chicago.", "Here, we wanted to discover the overall count of crimes regardless of their severity or details. As we can see from the graph, theft has been the most committed crime in Chicago over the last couple of years followed by battery.", "From figures 2 and 3, we can see that theft has been Chicago\u2019s most committed crime for the last two years. In addition to these visualizations, we also looked at graphs from previous years dating back to 2014. We can use these graphs to conclude that in fact theft has been the most common crime, and has not seen a spike in the past couple years.", "We also wanted to look at the distribution of these crimes within the neighborhoods of Chicago. This data would be useful for a newcomer in Chicago who is trying to find a less crime prone neighborhood to live in and at the same time stay away from the most crime prone neighborhood. It will also be useful to characterize the type of crimes each neighborhood suffers from. We found the least and the most crime prone areas in the queries below and we also looked at the crime distribution.", "Moreover, we can also query and show crime distribution on a specific neighborhood at a user\u2019s request.", "From the data we can calculate exactly how often people are arrested for specific crimes. For instance we can see for the different types of assault charges over 80% of people who are charged with aggravated possession: hands no/min injury are arrested. This is interesting when compared to something like aggravated assault with a handgun, where the arrest rate is only around 20%.", "We are also able to look at specific locations of crimes. Figure 7 shows all of the assaults with known locations since January 1, 2017. However the graph does not differentiate between different types and seriousness of assaults. Regardless, it is safe to say Chicago has an assault issue.", "Using location data, we can determine the areas with high concentrations of homicide throughout Chicago. Here, homicide includes first degree, second degree, and involuntary manslaughter.", "A rather interesting chart is the crimes related to prostitution throughout Chicago. We can see here that related crimes appear to be in distinctive line patterns, most likely representing various streets throughout the city.", "After obtaining the data, the only major problem we encountered was loading the dataset from Kaggle into the database. The dataset was stored as a BigQuery dataset in Kaggle, which required us to use a Kaggle kernel to download a limited set of data from the database. We chose to download the last 5 years worth of data as this gave us a large dataset to work with. After we successfully got the data, we ran into problems inserting the data into a staging table. We believe that the majority of the problems here stemmed from the pure size of the dataset, which contained over 1.3 million rows. When attempting to ingest such a large amount of data we ran into memory errors with the Windows machines we were using and did not determine a way to remedy this. However, when the data was ingested on a Mac, we did not encounter these issues. In order to solve the memory error issues, we used the Mac to load the dataset into the database and then provided access to the tables to other members of the team via methods we found on Piazza. We also ran into problems with queries on timestamp fields when trying to focus just on the month and ignore the rest. Fortunately, we were able to use the EXTRACT command to do this.", "After analyzing the graphs and other visualizations, we can conclude that Chicago is a pretty dangerous city and is actually as violent as it is portrayed by media. The number of assaults alone is quite startling, not to mention the homicide rate. Using this data for the project made the assignment interesting, although it was not the most cheerful dataset. We feel that using this dataset would resemble data that we may have to deal with in possible industry employment, so this assignment gave us experience that will be helpful to future employment.", "Your home for data science.
