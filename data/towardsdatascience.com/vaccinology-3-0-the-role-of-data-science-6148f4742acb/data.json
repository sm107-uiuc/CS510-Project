It tries to answer some of the questions which garner more and more attention as the world looks at scientists and pharmaceutical companies racing to develop the vaccine(s) for the Wuhan virus pandemic \u2014 in record time. For example:", "This is a review article with a focus on data science but with the goal of covering the essentials of vaccinology and related concepts. Therefore, before trying to progress towards the objective of reviewing the opportunities/accomplishments for data science in the modern vaccinology, a cursory look at the definitions of a few key terms in this field is necessary.", "Vaccinology is the branch of medicine concerned with the development of vaccines. The basic idea is to introduce a harmless entity into the body which triggers the immune response of the body against the disease-causing pathogen which persists in the body thus preventing future infection. Depending on the entity introduced into the body, there are three types of vaccines.", "Whole-pathogen vaccines (traditional) introduce a dead or weakened pathogen to elicit life long immunity. Subunit vaccines consist of only component(s) (or antigens) of the pathogen along with adjuvants. Adjuvants are substances to boost the required immunity response of a vaccine. It must be mentioned that adjuvants are subject to debate with respect to their safety. Nucleic acid vaccines are based on the approach which involves introducing the genetic material encoding the antigen against which immunity is desired. In a crude sense, the terms vaccinology 1.0 and 2.0 could be attributed to the development of the first two types of vaccines, respectively.", "Vaccinology 3.0 or reverse vaccinology, which is more recent, involves the process of antigen discovery enabled by the genome information of the pathogen. From the problem-solving point of view, Vaccinology 3.0 is similar to the first principles from Physics. It starts by gaining information about the epidemiology of vaccine candidates and modelling the host-pathogen interactions, effectively reducing the huge list of candidate vaccines.", "This is made possible by the explosion of the omics data; omics is used to refer to the data from (fancy!) disciplines viz., transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, cytomics, immunomics, secretomics, surfomics, or interactomics. Enabled by this Big Data, reverse vaccinology essentially becomes a top-down approach compared to the previous bottom-up and hypothesis-driven approaches. Consequently, the latest addition to the omics terms is vaccinomics defined as the study of vaccine-induced immune responses.", "With an understanding of these key terms, albeit at a high level and some background into the evolution of vaccine development, we can delve into the methodologies from data science which enables vaccinology 3.0. In order to do that effectively, let us list out the key challenges in vaccine development; which this new paradigm of reverse vaccinology aims to be effective in solving. And for each of these challenges, highlight how data science and big data technologies are leveraged.", "There are a large number of issues concerning vaccine development and its delivery. For example, one of the societal issues being an increase in the anti-vax movements. The ageing population of the world is another problem. A very recent list of the top four current challenges from an article by the scientists from Mayo clinic is being discussed here.", "The human body and its immune system are extremely complex with a large number of components. The current understanding of this system is far from complete even after considerable progress in recent decades. It is not possible for scientists to accurately predict the behaviour of the immune system for a particular vaccination and the related infection.", "This is where the data-based computing approaches of vaccinomics and systems biology provide the opportunity in filling the knowledge gaps. It is worthwhile to quote Donald Knuth, the famous American scientist and ACM Turing Award recipient, who has inspired multiple generations of computer scientists. Knuth is extremely optimistic about the scope of computational biology when he says (courtesy: Computer Literacy Bookshops, Inc):", "\u201cI can\u2019t be as confident about computer science as I can about biology. Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on, it\u2019s at that level.\u201d \u2014 Donald Knuth.", "This is an excerpt from his interview in 1993, and things have moved quite exponentially in the direction he anticipated. Computing hardware, cloud technologies and most importantly deep learning have opened up the floodgates of innovation in this area.", "One of the principal underlying activities in the immune system is performed by the relatively autonomous and specialized cells called T-cells; which communicate with each other activated through their surface receptors. Recently, technology to measure (en masse) cell state, function and their products along with their gene encoding have become feasible. This essentially generates a large amount of data, which could be used to develop more holistic models of the immune system \u2014 something not possible traditionally. Thus it has given rise to the area of systems immunology \u2014 another playground for the data scientists. It also enables scientists to develop better adjuvants and improve the durability of immune responses.", "The immune responses of human populations vary depending upon genetic predispositions. This makes it difficult to develop single vaccines which are effective across the whole population. A solution to this is the approach using Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS), which are conducted with the aim to identify common genetic variants under a particular trait of interest.", "For the uninitiated, let me dwell slightly deeper into genome studies. Living organisms are made up of cells. Each of our cells consists of a nucleus. The cell nucleus consists of DNA which is organized into chromosomes. DNA has four bases denoted by T, A, C and G. DNA sequencing is the determination of the physical order of these bases in a molecule of DNA. In genomic data science, fundamentally, a sample is collected from subjects and DNA sequencing is performed defining the subject\u2019s genome. Your genome defines how your body works. The total length of the human genome is over 3 billion base pairs. The genome consists of small functional bits which could be associated with specific processes and traits. Genomics is concerned with the structure, function, evolution and mapping of genomes.", "The human genome project, the world\u2019s biggest collaborative biology project, was started in the 80s with the goal of identifying and mapping all the genes of the human genome, which was achieved in 2003.", "Coming back to GWAS, its main objective is to associate specific genetic variations with particular diseases. It involves scanning the genomes from many different people and looking for genetic markers that can be used to predict the presence of a disease. As a recent example, a GWAS study for Covid-19 reported considerable behavioural variations among the patients with the people with blood group O showing a protective effect as compared to higher risk with people having blood group A.", "From the data science perspective, apart from its huge contribution in enabling faster and cheaper sequencing technologies, a number of machine learning approaches have benefitted GWAS. This article is a good summary of many ML contributions to GWAS e.g. how different methods deal with the \u201cthe curse of dimensionality\u201d \u2014 where data has a large number of features than samples \u2014 a regular problem with GWAS.", "Researchers from King\u2019s College London just reported six strains of Covid-19 virus in the US, UK and Sweden in a subset of patients numbering just a few thousand. They used the time series data of symptom progression among the patients and clustered the data to identify 6 different patterns attributed to the possible variations in the virus. Patients belonging to two of these clusters required critical care.", "Pathogen variability poses a challenge for vaccine development in two ways. Firstly, if the number of strains is high then making a vaccine effective across all strains is difficult and secondly, the pathogen could keep mutating necessitating the need for continuous reformulation of the vaccines.", "Genome sequencing combined with vaccinomics is once again an important approach to deal with this challenge.", "The specific case of vaccine development for influenza virus highlights the significance of data science to deal with this challenge.", "Influenza has two distinct surface proteins, H and N, which it uses to enter the host cells. There are multiple variations of these proteins, with H1N1 and H3N2 as the two most common subtypes. H3N2 killed over a million people in the world in 1968\u201369. H1N1 in 1918 resulted in the Spanish flu.", "Influenza vaccines are reformulated every year because of the pathogen variability discussed above. Based on the data (genomic) on former and current variants of the virus, vaccinologists model and predicts the future behaviour of viruses using machine learning algorithms. One of the ways of doing this is by constructing a phylogenetic (evolutionary) tree. A phylogenetic tree represents the closeness of different strains in terms of their genetics. Phylogenetic analysis by Maximum likelihood (PAML) is a program package which helps in tree construction and analysis. To this end, non-negative least squares regression is another technique which could be employed. Similarly, Bayesian analysis is also quite popular in this research.", "Considering the gaps in our understanding of the immune system and the way vaccines interact with our body, it is of critical importance to ensure safety and avoid any side effects from newly invented vaccines. In this age of social network when the news and fake news spread like a virus and with many unwanted consequences (e.g. the recent measles outbreak in the world after a recent safety lapse in vaccine administration), vaccine safety is extremely important. As another example, a list of nine safety issues regarding vaccine is provided at this link by the CDC. The latest being the recall of a batch of HPV vaccine in 2013.", "Dengue vaccine is an example of a vaccine which when given to healthy individuals, with no prior history of infection by dengue virus, could actually increase the risk of severe dengue, due to a phenomenon called antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). ADE leads to increased infectivity of the virus and has been observed with dengue virus, HIV, yellow fever virus, zika virus and coronaviruses.", "Adversomics is a new area of study which aims to identify, characterize and predict adverse immune responses to vaccines. This body of research takes us to to the doorstep of the era of personalized vaccines. It deals with sophisticated biostatistical approaches to identify patterns and causative networks within large volumes of extremely high dimensional data.", "Now let us discuss two recent but prominent applications of ML and AI to vaccinology from rival internet companies.", "One of the core challenges in Biology is that of protein folding. The protein folding problem is the question of how a protein\u2019s amino acid sequence dictates its 3-D structure. In other words, could the structure of protein be predicted from its amino-acid sequence? This is important because the attainment of the specific 3-D structure by folding characterizes the biological function of a protein. It is estimated that the human body contains between 80,000 and 400,000 proteins.", "For example, the human lung cells contain specific proteins complementary to those of Covid-19, which activate the virus towards triggering the infection. When designing a vaccine or a drug for a virus like the Covid-19, it is thus, of vital importance to solve the protein folding problem.", "Alphafold is a deep learning-based protein structure prediction tool open-sourced by DeepMind. In essence, it uses the protein data bank and dataset of protein sequences (which were built through DNA sequencing over a period of time) to find a similar sequence to the target sequence. By correlating the changes in positions of amino acid residues between sequences and the target sequence, it is possible to predict the contact between residues, which are then used to predict the protein structure.", "Under the hood, Alphafold uses a convolutional neural network to predict the distance and torsion angles between amino acid residues. These values are used to determine the statistical potential of the protein. In a very crude way, think of this as the energy of the protein system and that the protein will fold itself in such a way that this energy is minimized. Using gradient descent this protein potential is minimized to obtain more accurate torsion angles and the distances.", "DeepMind has shown that Alphafold is more accurate than the state-of-the-art methods, and it could benefit all areas of protein science. More importantly, this could add a step to the race for finding vaccine and drugs to fight the pandemic.", "Before discussing Baidu\u2019s LinearDesign it makes sense to briefly talk about Moderna. Moderna is a biotechnology company which is working on drug and vaccine development with technology exclusively based on mRNA. For the uninitiated, RNA is a nucleic acid, like DNA, but is single-stranded. One of the key processes of the RNA is protein synthesis. The Messenger RNA (mRNA) carries the genetic information copied from DNA to the sites of protein synthesis outside the cell nucleus. Then, the tRNA and rRNA perform the follow-up activities, essentially acting as directors in how amino acids (the building blocks of proteins) must be connected with each other to form the proteins.", "Companies like Moderna which are trying to build vaccines based on mRNA, basically try to develop a synthetic mRNA which mimics the actual mRNA of a virus. The virus mRNA is used by the pathogen to build the viral protein in the host. The goal of the vaccine based on synthetic mRNA is, therefore, to trick the immune system into generating antibodies which will then fight against the actual virus.", "This is a new paradigm for developing viruses which is still under intensely active research. Moderna is also trying to use this technology to build a coronavirus vaccine which could be a first, if successful.", "LinearDesign developed by Baidu is a tool to design optimized mRNA sequence toward vaccine development. In a nutshell, this is the problem which their work addresses \u2014 the number of possible mRNAs which could lead to encoding the same protein sequence is exponentially high making the search for optima mRNA design hard. They reduce this design problem to a classical problem in formal language theory and computational linguistics and then use approximation algorithms to determine a fast solution with high accuracy compared to the ones determined by the exact search.", "Baidu\u2019s LinearDesign which is inspired by their previous technology called LinearFold and similar tools are crucial for developing vaccines for Covid-19, in particular, and as building blocks for vaccinology 3.0, in general.", "In particular, the mRNA based technology for developing vaccines could usher in a new era of vaccine development and management which is quite analogous to what PlanetLabs is doing in space technology by streamlining the evolution and development of satellites using the agile methodology. To this end, data science and AI technologies will be playing pivotal roles.", "The current pandemic is acting as a catalyst toward the development of innovative vaccine development technologies and data science is a key enabler.", "Your home for data science.
