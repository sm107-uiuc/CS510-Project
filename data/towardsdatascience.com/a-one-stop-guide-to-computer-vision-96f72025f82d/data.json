We are able to identify if an image is a dog or a cat, if an image has a red ball or calculate the number of people in an image. These tasks are not so easy for a computer.", "Computer vision allows your computer to understand images. But how?", "Why don\u2019t we use instance segmentation for every single task?", "Every model has its own trade-offs. The more complex it is, the slower and more expensive it is. The simpler it is, the faster and cheaper it is. It will not make sense to use the most expensive instance segmentation if you simply want a program to detect if there is a ball in an image.", "It is insane to develop your own computer vision model from scratch for practical use. Why spend hours and tons of money on building your own model when you can achieve better results with models that have been pre-trained by researchers?", "MXNet is an open-sourced deep learning framework. MXNet provides a high-level API called Gluon. Gluon provides several toolkits for several tasks:", "GluonCV provides implementations of state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep learning algorithms in computer vision. It aims to help engineers, researchers, and students quickly prototype products, validate new ideas and learn computer vision.", "GluonCV has tons of models that have been fine-tuned by well-known institutes and researchers with a copious amount of data collected over several years using an unimaginable amount of computing power and time. All the pre-trained models are housed inside GluonCV in Model Zoo.", "After this article, you should be able to conduct all 4 computer vision tasks with GluonCV and MXNet.", "This entire article only requires you to download 2 packages \u2014 MXNet and GluonCV. You can do so with the following commands:", "If you would like to make use of your CPU/GPU or TPU for processing, you simply have to change the install commands:", "Before we start, remember to import the installed packages (download numpy and matplotlib if you haven\u2019t done so):", "Head over here to check out the documentation. There are a lot of models that are available for each CV task. Each of these models is trained with a different number of images and labels and hence will have a different set of hyperparameters. For instance, the ImageNet22k was trained on over 14 million images and can predict over 22,000 classes. The image below shows the trade-off between accuracy and speed associated with each model. Naturally, the higher the accuracy, the lower the speed will be.", "You only need 4 steps to classify an image:", "You can use any image you want, just simply edit the links. We will be using an image of Mount Baker. Next, we will visualise the image and explore the image:", "The first line sets our image to a variable. The next 4 lines print out the details of the image and the results are as such:", "The shape is in 3 dimensions (HCW) as it consists of the Height, Width and Channel. Height and Width represent the vertical and horizontal length of the image, and Channel represents the depth of the image. Since the image is made of RGB colours, the depth is only 3:", "The data type is a numpy array filled with integers, with a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 255. Lastly, let\u2019s visualise the image:", "GluonCV requires that your image meets the following criteria:", "Not to worry, all these steps can be achieved with a single command:", "We shall use the ResNet 50 model. We will be using a pre-trained version of the model.", "To find a list of all the models you can use, simply type:", "All the models will be downloaded in your local mxnet cache. You can view the sizes here:", "Prediction is done simply in 1 line:", "Since we only input 1 image, we shall retrieve the first index of the results:", "Prediction stores the raw probabilities of every class that this image belongs to. Since ResNet 50 is able to predict 1000 classes, the length of prediction will be 1000.", "You can retrieve a list of all the classes that your ResNet 50 model is able to predict, and there should be 1000 of them:", "Prediction stores the raw probabilities that the model output. It will make no sense to interpret them as some of the probabilities are negative. As such, we shall use a softmax function to transform all the probabilities such that it is bounded between 0 and 1:", "Now, let\u2019s retrieve the top 5 predicted classes:", "And the results are as such:", "GluonCV predicts with an 84.1% confidence that this is an image of a volcano. Since ResNet 50 do not have a class specifically for Mount Baker, a volcano is as close as we can get.", "Head over here to check out the documentation. You will find that this section is very similar to Image Classification. However, instead of using ResNet 50, we will be using YOLO V3, which is an extremely fast model for object detection.", "Let\u2019s use another image with several objects:", "Let\u2019s explore the data. This portion is very similar to what you did previously.", "Since we are using another model, we will have to transform the data into another format that is suitable for YOLO V3. Not to worry as this can yet again, be done in a single line:", "Instead of a single transformed image, we now have 2 images \u2014 image and chw_image. Image consists of your original image while chw_image consists of your transformed image. The variable short=512 is used to indicate the width of the image, while still maintaining the aspect ratio.", "This is the model that we will be using:", "However this time around, our prediction returns us with 3 items:", "In addition, there are some slight differences:", "Note that \u201c-1\u201d is a special class, which means that no object is detected.", "Now that we have the coordinates, let\u2019s label our images!", "Head over here to check out the documentation.", "Semantic segmentation aims to classify every pixel in an image. It will look at the full context of the image before making segment level prediction. After which, the model will use different colours to overlay all the pixels of an image to separate them by class. In this section, background classes are labelled as -1.", "This section will use FCN ResNet ADE, which is a fully connected neural network with ResNet architecture that is trained on the ADE20K dataset.", "This section is exactly the same as Object Detection. You may skip this step if you wish to", "There isn\u2019t a one-line code for this segment. You have to define your own functions to transform your data:", "ToTensor() changes your image from HWC to CHW format and the data type from 8-bit integer to 32-bit float. The image is then normalised according to the ImageNet one case statistics.", "As mentioned earlier, we usually predict images batches by batches. Even though we are only predicting 1 single image, we still have to specify the batch size:", "To speed things up, we will apply .demo to our network. The longer version can be found under instance segmentation.", "There is only 1 image, 150 predicted classes, and the image has a width of 576 and height of 768.", "Now, let\u2019s colour our image to segment them:", "Instance segmentation is able to identify that one person is different from another person. Instead of a boundary box, we can predict the exact boundary and colour of those pixels.", "Congratulations! You managed to complete the 4 main computer vision tasks using only a single framework!", "Do try out different models and determine which is the best for you. Remember: A more complex model is not necessarily the best model.", "Understanding business requirements is very important. Choose the model that best fits your purpose. There is always a trade-off.
