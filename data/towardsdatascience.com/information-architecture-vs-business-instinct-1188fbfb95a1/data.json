As part of a niche but highly profitable business, steel brokerages win and lose opportunities around the fluctuating market price of their product. Consequentially, providing accurate and fast quotes to customers is a nuanced and competitive process.", "Currently, O\u2019Donnell is in the midst of a multi-year project to modernize their company by integrating technology solutions that will allow them to be the fastest and best-priced steel brokerage on the market, and they have already begun to experience exponential gains. But as O\u2019Donnell looks forward to increasing revenue, their capacity to handle more and more jobs has become a concern.", "The company\u2019s president, Matt Weiss, comes from a product management background and has been building a custom CRM solution for his team so that they can better organize and streamline their customer and project management records. His first version of the CRM solves many issues surrounding the organization of contact and company information, but Matt ran into a problem when it came to structuring the records for jobs and quotes.", "How do you design the records in a CRM that must be fundamentally agile, amorphous, and responsive to market fluctuations and unique customer needs?", "To address this problem, I joined the O\u2019Donnell CRM project along with two other UX Designers, Ben Throm and Melissa Glasser, for a two week design sprint. We set out to discover the best way to structure the information architecture of the CRM and design records and dashboards to track O\u2019Donnell\u2019s project-focused business. We all shared and collaborated in the role of UX Designer, and brought our various backgrounds to the table to steer the team when needed. The background I brought to this project was a year and a half of experience administering, customizing, and automating business processes for a CRM in a start-up environment, as well as leading a CRM migration project post company acquisition.", "We started by setting a schedule, with one week of research followed by one week of design. The research methods executed were:", "After gathering as much data as possible in the first week, we synthesized our findings over the weekend to prepare for design the following week. From stakeholder and secondary interviews, we created an affinity map and identified key challenges, goals, and insights, as well as common data categorizations, industry tools, and processes.", "We knew from the initial client brief that O\u2019Donnell handles three main categories of jobs, and we learned about these job types in greater detail from our stakeholder interviews. The three types are:", "To design the CRM record for these jobs, we needed to understand all the moving pieces of handling each type of job, including aspects outside of the O\u2018Donnell employee\u2019s immediate interaction with the customer. These aspects pertained mostly to scheduling and tracking both supplier and shipping partner relationships. We first sketched out the business process for each job type to document how O\u2019Donnell\u2019s relationships with their suppliers, shipping partners, and various customers weave together. Then we sketched out user flows for an O\u2018Donnell employee\u2019s typical path to create and update each type of job record.", "Next, we synthesized the results of our card sort by mapping both of the mental models on a whiteboard and comparing their styles of thinking.", "There were some similarities between the mental models of the participants, such as grouping familiar names under categories such as \u201cVendor\u201d and \u201cCompany.\u201d Some cards were also immediately recognizable to both participants as belonging to a predefined category like \u201cStatus/Sales Stage.\u201d", "Synthesizing the card sort also exhibited some differences in how the two employees categorized information relating to their work. While the first participant grouped cards into a two-level deep hierarchy with 15 category headings, the second participant grouped cards into a three-level deep hierarchy. The second participant also arranged the groupings in an associative way, where groupings were next to each other based upon how they interrelated, telling more of a story about the process he follows in his work. A possible reason for these differences is that the first participant is primarily involved in quoting customers and handling pre-sale interactions, while the second participant is a project manager that carries the most complex type of job through the production process.", "Overall, the card sort was not as valuable as we had hoped for determining the information architecture of the CRM for two main reasons. First, we only had two participants, and much like our stakeholder interviews, this small pool could not be helped. Second, the amount of cards to sort (~50) and where we derived those field names (various OMD internal tools) made it difficult for both participants to group and make sense of so much overlapping information. A better way to conduct this in the future would be to only make cards for the fields at the deepest level of hierarchy, from only one reference, such as the team\u2019s Airtable spreadsheet.", "After synthesizing our research, we used our user flows, business process diagrams, and low fidelity wireframes provided by O\u2019Donnell as a reference to build a paper prototype of the job record. We tested the paper prototype on site, and then talked through the feedback we received, screen by screen, on the whiteboard.", "The feedback was also collected in a spreadsheet where we defined what changes needs to be made. We then incorporated those changes into a low fidelity wireframe prototype built in Balsamiq.", "Next we returned to the site to conduct usability tests with the employees at O\u2019Donnell. These tests got more to the heart of what kind of page layout would be most intuitive for the team. From these tests, we decided to move away from a tab structure, which we had implemented to break apart different stages of the job, in favor of a page where users could scroll through to find where they needed to be at any given moment in their workflow. While this would prevent fields from being tucked away and hard to find, there was uncertainty about how exactly the fields on a longer scrolling page should be laid out. What fields are most important, and how should proximity be applied as a design technique so that fields are grouped in a way that makes sense to the user?", "To answer these questions, we went back to our research and worked to finalize the information architecture. With a background in information technology and database architecture, our teammate Ben stepped in and drew out an entity relationship diagram to define how different entities would relate to each other in the CRM, and to show which fields belonged within each entity.", "Next, we brainstormed as a group and whiteboarded a concept map of how the fields in the job record relate to each other and/or belong together to determine the page hierarchy for the job record. Lastly, we came to a consensus about the navigational hierarchy of the CRM and drew out a map to use as a reference in building our final prototype in Axure.", "With these guidelines and the feedback from our low fidelity usability tests, we got to work building a mid-fidelity interactive prototype that would allow the user to filter jobs in list view, create a new job record, and add inputs to the job record. This was challenging because we had to build the logic for the multitude of dependent options that the user would need to create a custom job record.", "Finally, as a reference for the final look and feel, I created a high fidelity mock-up of the job record page:", "My team provided Matt with a product roadmap to focus the continued development of the O\u2019Donnell CRM, recommending the incorporation of role-specific dashboards as the next high impact/low effort goal so that users can get an immediate, bird\u2019s eye view of their work. Next, we recommended addressing the high impact/high effort goal of integrating a quote estimation tool directly into the CRM. Lastly, customer follow up and opportunity loss reasons should be tracked, followed by the development of a reporting functionality housed within the CRM.", "After presenting our research, prototype, and future product vision to the client, we were all asked to continue the project on contract. As we begin our next two week sprint for the O\u2019Donnell CRM project, we will be designing the custom dashboards for the roles of sales rep and project manager, as well as continuing to test and improve the job record page. For this sprint, my teammates and I are splitting the work, with my focus being the design of a custom dashboard for O\u2019Donnell project managers.", "The biggest takeaway from the first sprint of this project was that there are huge challenges facing the designer when digitizing a business that has been run for decades on paper records, internalized, institutional knowledge, and a well-honed, gut-feeling about negotiation and market price. There is often a tendency in design to assume that uniformity, simplicity, and automation will always provide the best experience. But this is a precarious mindset to carry as a designer, because there are some aspects of how certain businesses function that will always be unpredictable, reactive, and resistant to order and classification. It is not always best to have everything neatly tucked away.", "As I grow as a designer, I hope to build tools that support and enhance the human interactions that drive business relationships rather than impede them by trying to place too much in a neat and tidy box. It is okay to let some things stay organic and mutable. Sometimes, that sense of chance and excitement is what motivates the user to do what they\u2019re doing in the first place.", "Your home for data science.
