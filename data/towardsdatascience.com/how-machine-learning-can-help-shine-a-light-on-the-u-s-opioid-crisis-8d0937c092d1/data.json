A well-designed clustering algorithm is like a specialized finder of needles in haystacks.", "And when it comes to haystacks, few can match the ARCOS opioid dataset.", "ARCOS, short for Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System, is the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency\u2019s record of prescription drug transactions in the United States. That includes prescription opioid transactions \u2014 as well as information on who made those opioids, who shipped them, and who sold them to U.S. patients.", "The ARCOS dataset, first made public by the DEA this summer after a legal battle led by the Charleston Gazette-Mail and the Washington Post, stretches across 400 million rows and 40-plus columns. It comprises virtually every opioid transaction from 2006 to 2012, between manufacturers (like Purdue Pharma), distributors (like AmerisourceBergen, Cardinal Health, and McKesson), and thousands of pharmacies, hospitals, doctor\u2019s offices, and clinics around the nation.", "But from the perspective of opioid litigation and the U.S. opioid crisis, the ARCOS dataset is also notable for what it omits. Even though the DEA records violations by opioid \u201cbuyers\u201d \u2014 pharmacies, doctor\u2019s offices, clinics, or other businesses that sell drugs to patients \u2014 the ARCOS dataset does not contain any such flags.", "Working together with Nephron Research, a healthcare investment research firm, our team of MBAs and data scientists wondered: Could we find a way to label potentially problematic opioid buyers using a purely data-driven approach? And could we use the ARCOS transactions dataset to accomplish that goal?", "The ARCOS dataset lists transactions involving many kinds of buyers, from large hospitals to small clinics. We initially decided to limit our search to chain pharmacies, for two reasons. First, opioid litigation has primarily focused on major public companies. Second, we reasoned that chain pharmacies might have fewer outliers than independent pharmacies, which suited a clustering approach.", "We began our search for \u201chigh-yield chain pharmacies\u201d (as we dubbed our target) by looking for individual pharmacies that met two criteria:", "As is often the case with machine-learning projects, our first round of clustering actually started with nitty-gritty data cleaning and organization. After a few weeks smoothing and standardizing some 400 million rows of data, we developed a set of Python functions to aggregate transactions into simplified, pharmacy-scale numbers. We also weighted transactions by county-level U.S. Census Bureau population data, so as not to punish pharmacies located in big cities for what would otherwise seem like large transaction volumes.", "In our first clustering iteration, we loaded all of our 20-odd dimensions of transaction data into a k-means clustering algorithm. It\u2019s tough to visualize so many dimensions, of course, so we leveraged PCA \u2014 short for principal component analysis \u2014 to compress those dimensions into two more easily digestible dimensions. The first results were \u2026", "\u2026 not very encouraging. We saw plenty of fast-growing but tiny pharmacies (cluster 2, in purple); plenty of big pharmacies that barely changed their sales volumes (cluster 3, in yellow); and a clump of pharmacies in the middle (cluster 1, in turquoise).", "We then decided to isolate the \u201cstrength\u201d of drugs, rather than treating all opioids equally. We specifically focused on three drugs that CDC research suggested were most often connected with overdoses: oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl. (Fentanyl had not yet exploded across the U.S. in 2012 as it has more recently, but it was nevertheless of interest because of its sheer chemical power). The results:", "Now we were getting somewhere. Isolating the \u201cdrug strength factor\u201d from opioid transactions seemed to produce a standout cluster of chain pharmacies that met our two criteria. However, it was hard to visualize the strangely streaky clusters that PCA produced \u2014 particularly PC1, which seemed to represent an inverse of growth rate, and was difficult to interpret.", "We then made three improvements. First, we weighted pharmacy transactions according to county-specific CDC opioid prescription rate data, as well as population. We knew, from our separate analysis, that county-level opioid prescriptions were significantly correlated with county-level opioid overdose rates over 2006\u20132012:", "Second, we eliminated all of the transaction data except for transactions related to oxycodone, hydrocodone, and fentanyl.", "Third, we used the \u201celbow rule\u201d to settle on four distinct clusters. The results:", "Finally, with our third iteration of clustering, we\u2019d found it: a swath of pharmacies that sold high volumes of dangerous drugs (adjusted for local population and prescription rates), and that rapidly accelerated their sales of those drugs. Moreover, the high-yield clusters (collectively purple and blue in the plot above) were different from normal-yield clusters at the 1% significance level.", "With our clustering results in hand, we followed up on one more hunch. Our clustering experiment so far had focused on chain pharmacies, simply because chains had attracted more attention in the opioid crisis so far. But what if we applied our analysis to independent retail pharmacies as well? Could mom-and-pop shops sell more dangerous opioids than chain pharmacies?", "When we combine independent and chain pharmacies in the same clustering analysis, the number of high-yield independent pharmacies dwarfs comparable chain pharmacies, and by a huge margin. Of the 99 pharmacies above the 60th percentile for both principal components \u2014 call them super-high-yield pharmacies \u2014 all 99 are independent retailers.", "At the outset of our project, our mission was to identify potentially problematic pharmacies in the massive ARCOS dataset. Using a combination of data aggregation, k-means clustering, and PCA \u2014 as well as additional CDC population and prescription data \u2014 we uncovered a subset of chain and independent pharmacies that bought dangerous opioids, at significantly high volumes and at increasing rates, from 2006 to 2012.", "It would be a stretch, at best, to suggest that our analysis implicates those pharmacies, or even implies greater liability. Ours is only one of many potential data-driven approaches to the ARCOS dataset.", "We still expect that chain pharmacies \u2014 not independent pharmacies \u2014 will remain the focus of ongoing opioid litigation, along with manufacturers and distributors. Furthermore, while opioid litigants may not target individual independent pharmacies, we expect that the DEA has identified and shut down these independent pharmacies, and will continue to do so.", "Ultimately, our aim is to demonstrate that unsupervised machine learning is a viable approach to understanding the ARCOS dataset. And as opioid litigation continues, such an approach could certainly illuminate arguments over who did how much \u2014 and when and where they did it.", "This report was produced as part of Analytics in Action, a Columbia University course. Throughout the course, MBA students at Columbia Business School and master\u2019s students in the Columbia Graduate School of Engineering\u2019s Business Analytics program work together to apply data science and solve a practical business problem for a company.", "Your home for data science.
