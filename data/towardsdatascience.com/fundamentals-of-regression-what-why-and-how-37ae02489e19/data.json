But his height is unknown. Not a problem! Thanks to regression, it\u2019s possible to make an estimate of his unknown height based on the age-height relationship of other students in the class.", "Regression is nothing but a statistical relationship between two variables \u2014 age and height in this case \u2014 such that you are able to predict one if you knew the other.", "In this article, I\u2019ll be giving a high-level statistical intuition behind regression and discuss how it works and why it works. At the end, I\u2019ve outlined a few real-world use cases.", "Let\u2019s take a formal, textbook definition of regression.", "\u201cRegression analysis is a statistical tool for the investigation of relationships between variables. Usually, the investigator seeks to ascertain the causal effect of one variable upon another \u2014 the effect of a price increase upon demand, for example, or the effect of changes in the money supply upon the inflation rate.\u201d Source: Sykes (1993).", "There\u2019s quite a bit packed in there. If we unpack a little bit we distill a few things:", "a) regression is a set of tools/techniques", "b) regression determines whether there is a relationship between two or more variables", "c) regression measures the size/strength of the relationship", "The example I gave above \u2014 age vs height \u2014 is a relationship between two variables. Height is the dependent variable and age is the predictor or independent variable. Mathematically speaking:", "In statistics lingo, it\u2019s called \u201csimple regression\u201d, because it has only one predictor (age). But what if several predictors are needed to predict a dependent variable? Let\u2019s consider house prices and think about what factors affect the price?", "The price of a house depends on several factors \u2014 number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the area of floor space are some of them (and of course it\u2019s also about location!). Since the price is affected by those factors you\u2019d need all of them as predictors. This kind of regression with multiple predictors is called \u201cmultiple regression\u201d. The mathematical representation is the following:", "house price = f(# beds, # baths, floor area)", "We can also write it in the format of a regression equation:", "The purpose of regression is to find out a, b1, b2 and b3 parameter values through some statistical procedure so that the price of an unknown house can be predicted just by knowing 3 variables in the model.", "The simple and multiple regression techniques just discussed are known as \u201clinear regression\u201d \u2014 because you fit a linear line to the data. Then there\u2019re a few non-linear regression techniques that I\u2019ll talk about in the next section.", "Depending on whether you are in statistics or in machine learning, regression can mean a slightly different thing to you.", "A large portion of students in statistics and econometrics tend to think that regression is about finding out factors affecting the dependent variable and their degree of explanatory power. That\u2019s probably why correlation and regression are taught in parallel in many classical textbooks. Correlation tells you the direction and strength of a relationship, while regression quantifies the effect.", "In machine learning, however, it\u2019s all about applications. Regression is one of many algorithms to make predictions.", "Machine learning problems are broadly classified into (1) classification and (2) regression problems. Classification predicts discrete classes (e.g. dog vs cats) and regression predicts a quantity (e.g. prediction of sales revenue given some factors).", "Beyond linear regression techniques to predict outcomes, there is a wide range of algorithms used in the machine learning field. Here are some frequently cited ones with brief description of each:", "1) Logistic Regression is used to predict a binary outcome; e.g. classifying whether an animal in the picture is a dog or a cat etc.", "2) Polynomial Regression is used when the relationship between two variables is not linear. In other words, if linear regression underfits data (figure on the left below), a non-linear line is fitted (figure on the right).", "3) Ridge Regression is a way to reduce model complexity. If there are too many predictors \u2014 especially correlated predictors \u2014 some predictors are penalized to reduce their effects instead of getting rid of them completely.", "4) LASSO, short for Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator, is conceptually similar to Ridge regression, but coefficients can be penalized to set them close to zero.", "5) Support Vector Regression: Support Vector Machine is a popular algorithm for classification problems, but similar principles are used in regression problems. While normal regression minimizes errors, SVR fits model such that errors are within a threshold.", "6) Panel data regression: Panel data regression is a very specialized regression technique used in modeling time series data. It is a powerful technique for forecasting time-dependent observations (shameless plug: check out below an older article of mine).", "Now comes the final yet most important part of this discussion \u2014 use cases of regression. As a data scientist, it doesn\u2019t matter how many algorithms you know and how sophisticated models you can build, but the real value lies in real-world applications. So here are some use cases of various techniques that we have discussed so far.", "The purpose of this article was to discuss some fundamental statistical intuition behind regression with examples. We also talked about different kinds of linear and non-linear regression techniques used in machine learning. In the final section, I covered some practical use cases of regression.", "Of course, there is a lot more that could be said on regression techniques and their implementation using standard programming libraries.
