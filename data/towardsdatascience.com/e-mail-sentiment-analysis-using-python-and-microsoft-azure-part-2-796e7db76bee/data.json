We\u2019ll be exploring this, as well as the following notable changes:", "In Part 1 I had also mentioned how Outlook itself doesn\u2019t allow you to natively export a copy of your email (in CSV or PST format) with the sent or received dates/times included.", "An alternative to opening the Outlook app and downloading the CSV is to leverage PowerShell to query and save the information. By using PowerShell we have the ability to manipulate fields not otherwise available to us in the Outlook app.", "The following code will pull your Sent Items folder message body and sent dates/times, then store into a CSV. Make sure to update the -path switch to whatever you want.", "When reviewing the file in Excel (assuming you have default settings applied) you\u2019ll notice some formatting issues like:", "To get around this and provide a format easier to work with in Python, we\u2019ll open a new blank Excel file, click the \u201cData\u201d tab, and in the Get & Transform Data section click From Test/CSV. Select your CSV file and use the following settings:", "You\u2019ll notice we changed the delimiter to a | character, as we don\u2019t see that used much in most email text, especially not in any emails I would have sent.", "We can also see a preview showing us it is formatted how we want it. We\u2019ll click Load at the bottom, save this as our working CSV and now you\u2019re ready to load it into a dataframe!", "Shout out to Jason Bruno for help with the PowerShell script and modifying the format in Excel!", "Where did RescueTime come from? Well, about a year and a half or so ago I had downloaded an application that helps track active time spent in applications and help you find areas to cut back on, as well as just general insight into where you spend most of your time.", "I used this app for about a month or so, then honestly forgot I had it installed. Oops!", "To my benefit, this app was still collecting data. RescueTime provides the ability to download a copy of all of your data in CSV format (available in your profile on their website), so I knew I was going to try to incorporate that into my goal of determining trends in happiness/sadness.", "Also, I am not affiliated or linked in any way to RescueTime, it was just a free app I decided to try a while ago that is interesting enough to bring into this story. :)", "We\u2019ll be skipping a lot of the line-by-line code in this section, as we\u2019re using a lot of the existing code from Part 1. I\u2019m also providing a GitHub link to the Jupyter notebook in the event you want to review, copy or modify it.", "When we import our new email Sent Items export, we\u2019ll see a lot of similarities in the data that we\u2019ll need to clean; however, also note we now datetime data available to us. Woo! This will be very useful when visualizing and joining datasets in Part 3.", "Snippets you\u2019ll see have some general data cleaning done following a lot of steps in Part 1, with a few added such as converting the column to datetime and changing formatting a bit. I\u2019m also continuing to learn as I go, so some code is continually being made more efficient.", "After importing and doing some initial cleanup on the RescueTime dataset, here is a snippet of some information that is available to us:", "Pretty interesting that it has certain levels of detail that we can explore, but it also provides data like:", "Just for fun, here\u2019s a visualization of my recorded active Slack instances that we\u2019ll touch on in Part 3. Trending downward is probably an indication of when the company I work for rolled out Microsoft Teams and started to migrate away from Slack. Also, happy my Saturday usage wasn\u2019t terrible!", "We\u2019ll be exploring and joining with the RescueTime dataset more in Part 3, but for now we\u2019ll shift focus to changing our Sentiment Analysis results against our new email dataset.", "Back on our email dataset, I\u2019ve gone through cleaning the data using much of what we went over in Part 1, with a few additions considering we have a datetime column now.", "For the sake of easier visibility, I\u2019ve included changes to the primary sentiment analysis function(s) to return details from the API that we\u2019ll need, as well as some modifications to the cleaned email dataset to make use of these additional features:", "\u2026and the small changes to the email dataset to take in additional detail from the sentiment analysis output. We\u2019re using the \u2018message\u2019 Series from the DataFrame to send for analysis (compared to turning it into a list) and adding additional columns.", "After sending our messages to the Text Analytics API we can see our results provide a similar output as found in Part 1 (including the newer \u2018Mixed\u2019 result), as well as our DataFrame having new columns with detailed sentiment scores and the overall sentiment result.", "It would also be a smart time to output this result to a csv, as it takes a while to get all the results each time you send to the API. :)", "To quickly recap, some current benefits we have with our latest dataset include:", "That being said, we can use our email data in it\u2019s current state to plot, but it might be fun to also see which days of the week were more positive/negative etc.. It might also be helpful to grab the top reported score for each row.", "For the sake of cleanliness, we\u2019ll first make a copy of our email_clean DataFrame into one called email_plot, which we\u2019ll (probably obviously) use to plot. We\u2019ll also add a new column for the day of the week and translate from our date column.", "We\u2019ll also do the same for getting our top-rated score, but we\u2019ll only have it check columns related to our score outputs.", "Now we have some additional interesting data we can use when plotting!", "Now that we have our data with a decent cleaning effort on the message column, added columns for our sentiment scores, overall sentiment result, day of the week and a top score, we\u2019re ready to plot!", "Recently, I\u2019ve been focused more on Plotly as I feel it is much easier modifying layouts, color maps, etc. in comparison to MatPlotLib. MatPlotLib is definitely still a great library, but I also plan on publishing some of this on my personal site, so an interactive library made more sense.", "With that being said, Plotly has the ability to easily split a plot into panels using facet_col when generating your plot. After doing some tweaks to the plot details I have a fun scatter plot to look at:", "If you\u2019re new to Plotly you can filter the scatter plot above by clicking the sentiment result in the right side legend.", "If we filter to only show Positive results first we can actually see what looks to be more emails flagged confidently on Thursdays and Fridays as we moved from July 2019 to July 2020.", "If we switch to Negative results we can see the amount of negatively labeled emails sent on Mondays drastically reduced, with 0 negative emails on Mondays in the last quarter!", "However, the opposite is true for Tuesdays (mild increase) and Wednesdays, as we can see a tighter cluster of points as we progressed into mid 2020.", "It is also interesting that any emails sent on weekends seem to be mostly positive, which might be contributed to general weekend happiness playing a role in my responses.", "While this isn\u2019t meant to be 100% accurate in terms of sentiment results and overall data cleanliness, it is definitely a step in a better direction and ability to start to see how my email sentiment is trending. I think it is also worth mentioning that a Negative sentiment doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re being a total jerk or swearing someone out (I\u2019m not that bad of a person\u2026), but rather certain words used in series that may trigger the API to result in adding to the Negative response score. :)", "As usual, please leave any comments/thoughts/feedback in the comments section below. I am always looking for more efficient ways to do something, errors in something I may have done along the way, or general feedback!", "Stay tuned for Part 3 where we take the data used in this story and combine it with datetime data from our RescueTime data to find correlations between sentiment results and heavy application usage!", "Your home for data science.
