Artificial Neural Networks involve the following concepts. The input & the output layer, the hidden layers, neurons under hidden layers, forward propagation, and backward propagation. In a nutshell, the input layer is the set of independent variables, the output layer represents the final output (the dependent variable), the hidden layers consist of neurons where equations are developed and activation functions are applied. The forward propagation talks about how equations are developed to achieve the final output, whereas the backward propagation calculates the gradient descent to updates the learning rates accordingly. More about the operational process can be found in the article below.", "When an ANN contains a deep stack of hidden layers, it is called a deep neural network (DNN). A DNN works with multiple weights and bias terms, each of which needs to be trained. In just two passes through the network, the algorithm can compute the Gradient Descent automatically. In other words, it can identify how each weight and each bias term across all the neurons should be tweaked to reduce the error. The process repeats unless the network converges to a minimum error.", "Let\u2019s run through the algorithm step by step:", "It is important to initialize all the hidden layers\u2019 connection weights randomly, or else training will fail. For example, if you initialize all weights and biases to zero, then all neurons in a given layer will be perfectly identical, and thus backpropagation will affect them in exactly the same way, so they will remain identical. In other words, despite having hundreds of neurons per layer, your model will act as if it had only one neuron per layer: it won\u2019t be too smart. If instead you randomly initialize the weights, you break the symmetry and allow backpropagation to train a diverse team of neurons (Aure\u0301lien Ge\u0301ron, 2017, pp. 290\u2013291)", "Activation functions are key to gradient descent. The gradient descent can\u2019t move on a flat surface, hence it is important to have a well defined non-zero derivative to allow Gradient Descent to make progress at every step. Sigmoid is popularly used for logistic regression problems, however, there are other popular choices as well.", "This function is S-shaped, continuous, and can be differentiated except for the fact that the output ranges from -1 to +1. At the beginning of the training, each layer\u2019s output is more or less centered around 0, hence it helps in faster convergence.", "A continuous function not differentiable at Z=0 and it\u2019s derivative is 0 for Z<0. It produces good output and more importantly has faster computation. The function doesn\u2019t have a maximum output, hence a few of the issues that can come up during Gradient Descent are handled well.", "Let\u2019s say f(x) = 2x + 5 and g(x) = 3x -1. Equations for two different neurons, where x is the input variable 2 and 3 are weights and 5 and -1 are the bias terms. In chaining these function what we get is, f(g(x)) = 2(3x -1) + 5 = 6x + 3 which is again a linear equation. Absence of non-linearity is similar to having one equation in a deep neural network. Complex problem space in such scenarios can\u2019t be handled.", "While working on regression problems, we need not use any activation function for the output layer. The loss function to use during training a regression problem is the mean squared error. However, outliers in the training set can be handled using the mean absolute error instead. Huber loss is also a widely used error function for the regression-based task.", "The Huber loss is quadratic when the error is smaller than a threshold t (mostly 1) but linear when the error is larger than t. The linear part allows it to be less sensitive to outliers when compared to the mean squared error, and the quadratic part allows faster convergence and more accurate figures than the mean absolute error.", "Classification problems usually work with binary cross-entropy or categorical cross-entropy or sparse categorical cross-entropy. Binary cross-entropy is used for binary classification, whereas categorical or sparse categorical cross-entropy is used for multiclass classification problems. You can find more details about the loss function in the link below.", "Note: Categorical cross-entropy is used for a one-hot representation of the dependent variable, sparse categorical cross-entropy is used when labels are provided as integers.", "We will be using a Credit Data from Kaggle to develop a fraud detection model using Jupyter Notebook. The same can be done in Google Colab as well. The datasets contain transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders. This dataset presents transactions that occurred in two days, where we have 492 frauds out of 284,807 transactions. The dataset is highly unbalanced, the positive class (frauds) account for 0.172% of all transactions.", "The dataset consists of the following attributes. Time, Principal Components, Amount, and Class. For more information refer to the Kaggle website.", "Since most of the attributes are principal components, the correlation will always be 0 (property of orthogonal vectors in principal components). The only column with the possibility of an outlier is the amount. A quick description of the same provides the statistics outlined below.", "Outliers can be crucial towards detecting frauds as the underlying hypothesis being, higher transaction could be an indication of fraud activity. However, the boxplot doesn\u2019t reveal any specific trend to validate the above hypothesis.", "The amount and the PCA variables use different scales, hence the dataset is normalized. Normalization plays an important role in gradient descent. Convergence is much faster on Normalized Data.", "The above output suggests that we have 29 independent variables to work with, hence the shape of the input layer is 29. The general structure of any ANN architecture is outlined below.", "TensorBoard is a great interactive visualization tool that can be used to view the learning curves during training, compare learning curves across multiple runs, analyze training metrics and many more. This tool is installed automatically with TensorFlow.", "As stated earlier, there are no predefined rules on how many hidden layers or how many neurons are best suited for a problem space. We can use a RandomizedSearchCV or a GridSearchCV to hyper tune a few parameters. Parameters that can be finetuned are outlined below:", "Declaring Function to Develop the Model", "Using Wrapper Class to Clone the Model", "The optimizer should also be finetuned as they impact gradient descent, convergence, and automatic adjustment of learning rates.", "In general one can achieve better output by increasing the number of layers instead of the number of neurons per layer.", "Aure\u0301lien Ge\u0301ron (2017).
