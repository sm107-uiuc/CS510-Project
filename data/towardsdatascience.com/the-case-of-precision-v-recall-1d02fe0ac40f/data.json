Because classification is often binary and thus you are either correct or incorrect, this brings the issues of false positives and false negatives to the forefront.", "In some cases, it would be more detrimental for a false positive to occur. For example, in spam detection, if an important email were marked as spam (which is positive in this case) when it actually isn\u2019t, this could be disastrous as you would miss it. Therefore, it would be more important to control for, or prevent, false positives, since it would be better to have spam in your inbox than it would be to have an important email in your spam. If your emphasis is on controlling for false positives, you would prefer a higher precision score.", "Precision is the ratio of the number of true positives to the combined number of true positives and false positives. In other words, precision is the percentage of correctly ruled positives out of all of the results that were ruled positive, correctly or not \u2014 emails correctly marked as spam out of all of the emails marked as spam.", "In medicine, on the contrary, a false negative would be much more damaging. It would be better to be diagnosed for a disease you ultimately don\u2019t have than it would be to receive a negative test result for a disease you actually do have. The latter could result in a serious illness not being treated, and could literally be a deadly mistake. Thus, in this instance, it is imperative to control for false negatives. If your emphasis is on controlling for false negatives, you would prefer a higher recall score.", "Recall is the ratio of the number of true positives to the combined number of true positives and false negatives. In other words, recall is the percentage of correctly ruled positives out of all of the actual positives, ruled correctly or not \u2014 test results correctly coming back positive out of all of the test results of people who do have the disease, positive test result or not. It is important to remember that a false negative is a positive result that is ruled incorrectly.", "As you may have been able to deduce, precision and recall have an inverse relationship \u2014 as one goes up, the other goes down since you\u2019re choosing to either control for false positives or false negatives. If you are still confused, which is entirely possible and I apologize for failing you thus far, perhaps the diagram below can help clear things up:", "And if you\u2019re still confused, maybe this next analogy from Samar Srivastava that I recently came across on LinkedIn can help:", "\u201cImagine that your girlfriend gave you a birthday surprise every year in last 10 years.", "However, one day, your girlfriend asks you:", "\u2018Sweetie, do you remember all birthday surprises from me?\u2019", "This simple question makes your life in danger.", "To extend your life, you need to recall all 10 surprising events from your memory.", "So, recall is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall to a number of all correct events.", "If you can recall all 10 events correctly, then, your recall ratio is 1.0 (100%). If you can recall 7 events correctly, your recall ratio is 0.7 (70%).", "Now, it\u2019s easier to map the word recall to real life usage of that word.", "However, you might be wrong in some answers.", "For example, you answer 15 times, 10 events are correct and 5 events are wrong. This means you can recall all events but it\u2019s not so precise.", "So, precision is the ratio of a number of events you can correctly recall to a number all events you recall (mix of correct and wrong recalls). In other words, it is how precise your recall is.", "Hope that did the trick for you!", "Your home for data science.
