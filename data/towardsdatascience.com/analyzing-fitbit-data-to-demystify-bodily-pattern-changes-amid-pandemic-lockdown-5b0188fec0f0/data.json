It\u2019s for the first time that I have no access to Gym or any type of equipment for this long due to the Pandemic situation. Hopefully, most of us are facing the same. We all know how important it is to stay at home and flatten the pandemic curve.", "However, we can still try our best to stay fit by staying at home. I have been working out in my balcony/terrace using staircase as the pull-up bars, a long rod as my weights (luckily I found it), doing pushups of few kinds and a resistance tube which I had bought in the past to workout during my travels.", "To quantify the effectiveness of the Home workout, I downloaded my Fitbit data, did some preprocessing and tagged it as Pre and Post-Lockdown Period Data. The main objective was to understand:", "What are different Fitbit metrices? Is there any relationship between them?", "How my Calories burned in Pre and Post-Lockdown period looks like?", "Have I been able to burn/achieve the same intensity at home?", "How has my Sleep pattern changed over the two periods?", "Can I create smart recommendation based on this analysis? Like how many hours to sleep for my body to recover?", "What can I further optimise as a result of this analysis?", "Through this blog post, I intend to analyze the data and find an answer to the above questions. This post is also an excellent example of how we can use Analytics to become healthy and fit. How we can create insights from the data and create smart recommendations regarding Sleep, workout reminders, workout appreciation badges, etc. I have made the data and code available here. Let\u2019s start the fun stuff.", "Before jumping to code and finding insights I want to call out the challenges I am facing during home-workout which made me dig deep and perform this analysis.", "I have been trying my best to maintain my fitness with whatever things I can find and use in my workout. The main challenges I face are -", "In Gym, I was doing 110 kgs (242 Pounds) Squats, 120 Kgs (265 Pounds) Deadlift and so on. At home, I can\u2019t manage to get such heavyweights. So, I have increased the number of reps with the lighter rod I got.", "I don\u2019t have a proper pull-up or chin-up bar, so I am managing with the staircase. I am using a Resistance tube for the majority of my exercises. The weight/tension is less, so again, I have increased the number of reps instead. But, still, the absence of heavyweights and equipment is a challenge.", "I found an interesting article that states lifting heavy weights results in muscle growth resulting in burning more calories. So, lifting weight is the key.", "I can\u2019t go out for a run or a walk as its risky at present times. I am doing cardio on a yoga mat to account for it.", "Here is some glimpse of exercise I am doing at home to maintain my fitness. One thing you can observe below is I am wearing a Fitbit all the time.", "The Calories intake for an Individual depends on their Sex, Age, Height and Weight. There are online calculators one can use to calculate it. One can also use Sex, Age, Height and Weight information to calculate BMI (Body Mass Index).", "Similarly, the number of calories to be burnt depends on Sex, Age, Height and Weight factors. Online calculators are available to calculate it.", "Two important files Fitbit provides are Activity Data and Sleep Data. Let\u2019s have a look at it", "I tagged the data separately as Pre-Lockdown (Before 15-March-2020) and Post-Lockdown (On and After 15-March-2020). I also removed weekend data as I mostly don\u2019t work out on Saturday and Sunday to give my body rest and recovery time.", "Let\u2019s have a look at Distplot(Histogram plots) and Box plot. Sometimes, Mean may be a biased parameter so should look at the Percentile Distribution.", "The average calories burned has reduced from 2475 to 2290 Kcalorie during the Post-Lockdown period. There has been a decrement of around 7.5%.", "Another interesting thing to note is consistency has reduced as well. There\u2019s a notable high variance in Calories burned during Post-Lockdown compared to Pre-Lockdown. This is clear from the plots and Standard Deviation calculated. I kind of know the reason. In-office I walk a good amount from desk to meeting rooms and also walk with colleagues after lunch. My Gym timings were consistent during pre-lockdown but now at home, I deviate from a fixed routine and sometimes start late and end soon. Bingo!! I found the scope for improvement. Consistency is the key.", "I further wanted to find a relationship between Steps taken, Distance covered and Calories burned. Both Intuitively and looking at data they seem to have a positive correlation. Let\u2019s verify the amount or strength of the correlation.", "All the metrics are completely correlated with a Correlation coefficient of 1. It basically means if we know the correct formula Fitbit uses, we can derive Steps and Distance exactly using Calories Burnt. Also, it indicates the relationship/formula is linear.", "Let\u2019s have a look at Sleep Data. I have tagged the data as Pre and Post-Lockdown.", "Let\u2019s have a look at Distplot(Histogram plots) and Box plot. Sometimes, Mean may be a biased parameter so we can look at the Percentile Distribution.", "My body has trained itself over the years to sleep less and still being active. There are articles around the topic that how sleep requirements differ among individuals. It depends on factors like genes and the way the body has trained over the years. Here\u2019s an interesting article.", "There\u2019s been a drop in my average Calories burned during the Post Lockdown period by 7.5%. There\u2019s a drop in average Sleep also by 14 minutes. But, the good thing is variance is much low during the PostLockdown. My sleeping hours are more consistent. Great!! something I am happy about and would like to do so even after the Lockdown ends.", "Next, I want to work on smart recommendations, depending on the number of calories I have burnt, recommend the right amount of Sleep as per my body requirement.", "There are some days when I feel lazy due to lack of sleep or heavy workout but most of the days I feel energized and refreshed with the amount of sleep I get.", "Secondly, I workout in the evening and sleep at night mostly after 12 AM. So, I am interested in the number of calories I burnt on Day 1 and the amount of sleep I got on Day 2. I will use this information to create a Dataset where I will keep in account the calories burnt on Day 1 and hours slept on Day 2.", "Depending on your workout and sleeping pattern, you can create the dataset differently.", "This is how the final joined Dataset looks like", "Next, I will try to find the ideal relationship between Calories burnt and Minute Asleep. I will use Regression because it gives coefficients values, and results are intuitive. Also, since I am regressing just on Calories consumed, it\u2019s wise to keep the model simple.", "Intercept and coefficient of the Regression model are", "Let\u2019s see what my Recommendation Engine suggests depending on the calories burnt amount", "Through this blog-post, I shared how I used my Fitbit Data to learn my bodily pattern changes amid Pandemic situation. The main insights can be summarised as:", "There has been a decay in Calories burnt by 7.5% during Post Lockdown period due to lack of proper equipment, less movement and not being able to follow a strict routine. But, still, with home-workout, I have been able to burn a good number of calories.", "Average Sleep has reduced by 14 minutes during the Post Lockdown period but consistency has increased with low variance in sleeping hours, something I am happy about and would like to continue.", "We also found important insights about Fitbit metrics and correlation between them.", "We also created a Smart Recommendation Engine which recommends the amount of sleep needed depending on the number of calories burnt and as per individual\u2019s sleep requirements.", "I have made the data and code available here.", "If you have any doubts or queries, do reach out to me.
