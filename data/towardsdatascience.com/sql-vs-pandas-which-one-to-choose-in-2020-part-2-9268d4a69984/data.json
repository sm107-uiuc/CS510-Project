The technologies aren\u2019t designed for the same job, but it\u2019s nice to see corresponding functions between the two. As promised, today we\u2019ll cover more advanced topics:", "Before we do so, let\u2019s start simple with the delete statements.", "DELETE statement is used in SQL to delete or remove a row from the table. The syntax for deleting rows in SQL is as follows:", "Deleting a row is slightly different in Pandas. In Pandas, we do not delete a row, we just select the part that we require and discard the rest of it. Don\u2019t worry if it seems like a riddle to you, the example will illustrate it further.", "Let\u2019s say we want to delete all the records from the Asian region.", "The rows have been successfully deleted. Now let\u2019s see how to perform this task in Pandas.", "Here, we have selected all the rows where the region is not \u2018Asia\u2019 and then assigned the resultset to our current data frame. That means we have excluded all the rows where the region was \u2018Asia\u2019.", "JOINS are used in SQL to join or merge two or more tables together based on a specific condition. There are primarily four types of joins in SQL: LEFT, RIGHT, INNER, FULL. Here is the syntax for JOIN :", "In Pandas, we can join two or more data frames using merge(). By default, it will perform an inner join. But you can customize it using the how argument to perform other joins. The basic syntax for pd.merge() is as follows :", "Here is an example to illustrate joins.", "Given below is a table called country_sub_region. We have to join this table with fert_data using an inner join.", "The tables have been successfully joined. Let\u2019s see how to join them in Pandas.", "Here we have created a data frame similar to the country_sub_region table:", "We will merge df_sr with df on the country field using an inner join:", "UNION operator is used to club together the results of two or more SELECT statements in SQL. There is a comrade to the Union operator called UNION ALL. They differ in the sense that the former removes duplicate values from the combined result.", "The task of a UNION ALL operator in Pandas can be performed using pd.concat(). While the function of the UNION operator can be performed by first concatenating the data frames using pd.concat() and then applying pd.drop_duplicates() on it.", "In order to illustrate the UNION/UNION ALL operator in SQL, we have created an additional table called fert_data_1. The data in this table looks something as follows:", "Our task is as follows \u2014 find the union of rows from fert_data and fert_data_1 table:", "You will observe that there are some duplicate values. Yes, you guessed it right. You can use the UNION operator to remove them. Try it for yourself.", "In Pandas, we have created a data frame that is similar to the fert_data_1 table in SQL.", "The data from data frames have been combined. But, in this case, we will get duplicate rows as well. For example, the goal is to have \u2018Bangladesh\u2019 listed only once:", "We can drop duplicate records using drop_duplicates() as shown:", "Let\u2019s run the same query and see if we still get two rows.", "Problem solved. No more duplicate rows.", "GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to prepare summary rows by grouping records together. The clause is usually used in conjugation with aggregate functions such as AVG, SUM, COUNT, MIN, MAX, etc. Here is the basic syntax for GROUP BY clause :", "In Pandas, we have a groupby() function that helps us in summarizing data along a specific column. The generic syntax is as follows:", "Let\u2019s try an example to understand it better \u2014 find the average tfr and count of contraceptors field for each region.", "We got the same results from both the queries. You must be wondering what that agg() in Pandas is used for. It used to aggregate one or more operations over a specified axis.", "And this does it \u2014 you should now have a good picture behind both technologies, at least data-analysis-wise. It\u2019s difficult to recommend one over the other, as that will depend on your previous experience, biases, and options company you work in opted for.", "The good thing is \u2014 everything done in SQL can be done in Pandas \u2014 at least on this level.
