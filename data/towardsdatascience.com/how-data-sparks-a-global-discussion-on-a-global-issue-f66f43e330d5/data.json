But is there more to these figures which supposedly reflect the success (or popularity) of the bar chart I posted on the subreddit /r/dataisbeautiful?", "Recently I posted a race bar chart showing the evolution of the top 10 countries of origin of international students in Australia from 2002 to 2009. This was part of a class on data visualisations that I\u2019m taking this semester and we were encouraged to share our (better) creations with the wider internet community. And so I did.", "But never did I expect it to garner so many responses. After all, this was only my second post and here I have, people from all over the world giving their two cents worth on whatever I had posted.", "Before I go on, it\u2019s probably worth pointing out that I barely know anything about Australia. I simply chose such a dataset because a friend and I agreed that it\u2019d be interesting to look at the demographics of international students over there because the Australian tertiary education industry is well known for its openness to foreign students.", "So what then could I have possibly learnt from sharing my tiny little animated graph with the rest of the world?", "Stories. Stories that people relate to on a personal level. Stories from all over the world. And many of these stories revolve around issues surrounding not just Australia but also immigration in the world.", "The first thing that people talked about was what they saw were interesting observations of the data presented in the graph. These can also be unexpected trends or numbers that just don\u2019t tally up with what their intuition would tell them.", "For those of you who are unable (or too lazy) to spot anything interesting in the graph, here\u2019s a couple of them that some redditors have pointed out:", "While these observations are pretty general in that most people could pick them out right away, there are also those that only people with specific knowledge or interests could point out.", "A simple example of the latter would be a Malaysian pointing out, \u201cHey, I thought we would number much more and be higher up in the rankings because it seems like all my Malaysian friends seem to be heading for Australia for university.\u201d", "What makes these observations generated by diverse individuals all over the world even more fascinating however, are the vast responses that other users around the world, through the unique lenses that they see the world, have sought to explain or rationalise these observations.", "A case in point would be how Nepalese redditors have stepped in discuss not only their surprise (or lack of) at their new-found limelight, but also the reasons they believe have produced the data before them (see point 2 above). Some pointed out poor education opportunities back home, rampant corruption and the ease of getting visas and residency abroad.", "Similarly, some Indian redditors who live in Australia pointed out that the sudden drop in Indian students from 2009 to 2013 was potentially caused by the upsurge in the anger and fear of Indians in response to a series of violent attacks and robberies on Indian students in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia\u2019s two largest cities. Here\u2019s an article that one of the redditors have shared:", "What do these stories have in common? I see a pooling of efforts to rediscover, reinterpret and retell a certain story, a story that was left untold until the dust and cobweb have been swept away from the cover of its book.", "But the discussions didn\u2019t just revolve around finding stories to explain or fit the data. We people are living beings and we try to relate ourselves to things that we see, and in this case, to the data presented in my bar chart.", "Redditors who viewed my post shared their personal experiences and relationship with the subject on student immigration (and even on foreign influence), be it from the point of view of a foreigner or from that of a local observing how immigration has affected them in places such as the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, Brazil, Canada, the US, South Africa, Vietnam, Indonesia, New Zealand and of course, not forgetting Australia.", "All of them also have very different backgrounds that affect their stories, perceptions and opinions of this subject; some are administrative staff in a university, some are students, some are probably professors in a university, one says that he/she works in a language school, and another one claims to have worked at a PC retailer. And certainly, there are many others who have simply not revealed their occupations.", "Many of the personal anecdotes that I\u2019ve read also talked about the number of international students they encounter in their daily lives, the behaviour and characteristics of these students \u2014 if they speak the language of their host country well, if they mingle well with the local students, their spending habits (especially that of the Chinese), or even their competency in group projects.", "Conversely, there are stories about how international students struggle to adapt to life in their host countries and how they might have been shunned by local students.", "Others had interesting accounts of how they have observed first-hand how the lowering of entry requirements (such as English proficiency) of their university or the laxity of immigration policies (to acquire permanent residency and citizenship) has opened the floodgates to international student arrivals.", "In Australia\u2019s case, one even pointed out how the increase in partnerships between Australian universities and Chinese technology companies has led to more Chinese students and also, greater fears of intellectual property theft.", "Certainly, politics also get inevitably pulled into the picture when some redditors talk about how they have witnessed repeated cuts in government funding to universities in their countries, and how changes in taxation has affected their countries\u2019 immigration policies.", "It must be said however, that some of the stories or opinions may potentially be controversial or incorrect, and it\u2019s really up to the individual\u2019s discretion to discern what\u2019s worth believing or not.", "That aside, such comments reflect how people around the world relate and connect to data on a personal level. They may not necessarily be accepted by everyone, but they form part of the global conversation and an ongoing story that we can learn a lot from, even by just being a spectator.", "Having gone through the various comments on my post, I realised that I\u2019ve learnt much more about how people think and feel about the topic that I\u2019ve brought up using my graph. Not just about Australia, but about various other countries too. I wouldn\u2019t be aware of them \u2014 the interesting observations and insights, and the personal anecdotes and opinions, etc. \u2014 without their contributions.", "Surely I might have been able to do some research on my own for some the trends that I have observed, but it would be nowhere as enriching and rewarding as seeing people around the world who are more in touch with the topic contributing their interpretations, explanations and stories.", "For those of you who\u2019d like to read more on the exact insights were given, feel free to take a look at the comments in the reddit post itself. Don\u2019t forget that the post was also crossposted by other redditors in 10 other diverse subreddits such as /r/melbourne, /r/nepal and /r/professors and they feature other interesting discussions too.", "So if there\u2019s any of you out there who\u2019s hesitating to share your data or your visualisations with the greater community out there, don\u2019t be afraid! It can only spark stimulating discussions and create a novel story that you can\u2019t otherwise read elsewhere.", "A collective story that you wouldn\u2019t have discovered, nor we, the internet community, would have pieced together if not for the data itself.", "If you liked this story and would like to create an animated bar chart race on your own using Tableau, check out my other article here for a step-by-step tutorial!", "Your home for data science.
