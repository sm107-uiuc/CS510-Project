And how did the financial situation develop in general? To answer these questions, we are mainly using Numpy and Pandas for data analysis and Plotly for visualization. The database is self -scraped from transfermarkt.com[1] which includes transfer data from 2009 to 2018. In an other article, I will show how the data is scraped and processed.

For further questions, please contact me.", "The English Premier League is considered as one of the most attractive leagues in the world. Not only the long history, but also the financial volume of the league are the reasons for their uninterrupted popularity. In season 2017/2018, the 20 Premier League teams were able to allocate a total of \u00a32.42 billion (approximately \u20ac2.7 billion) in TV funds among themselves. Manchester United alone received nearly \u00a3150 million (\u20ac167 million) without revenue from ticket sales, merchandise and promotional activities [2]. With this money young talents and world stars can be brought into the English league, which in turn also secures the sporting success. UEFA has a ranking on its website showing the European football associations. The calculation basis is the performance of individual clubs in European top competitions such as the Champions and Euro League. The current top 10 is shown in Figure 1:", "Spain is in first place in the five-year average, because a total of 4 Champions- and 3 Euro-League titles could be won in this period. However, England has made up much since the season 2017/2018, which is due to the title wins of FC Liverpool and Chelsea. Do we also find this pattern in the squad values? To answer this question, we visualized the average squad value for each country:", "Figure 2 shows the average squad value of the top 10 leagues [2]. The financial dominance of England can be seen at first glance. In the season 2018/2019, the average cash value of the squads was around \u20ac452 million, while in the second-placed league of Spain it was just \u20ac291 million. Relatively close behind follows Germany (\u20ac257 million) and Italy (\u20ac245 million). France is ranked fifth with an average of \u20ac178 million. These are also the national associations that make up the top 5. All five clubs have performed well since 2012 in terms of squad value. If you look at the other five clubs, Russia, Portugal, Belgium, Ukraine and Turkey, you can see at first glance that the average squad values \u200b\u200bin this cohort decrease in total. In addition, the absolute level is significantly lower than the top 5 quintet. The front runner here is Portugal with an average squad value of \u20ac68 million, while it is only \u20ac28 million for the Ukraine. This financial dominance is also reflected in the form of sporting dominance in the Champions League. Figure 3 shows the title winners of the last 15 years:", "The Champions League has been won over the past 15 years exclusively by German, English, Italian and Spanish teams. 8 titles went during this time to Barcelona and Madrid. The four countries that ranked fourth in terms of squad value have in the recent past also been the winners of the highest European soccer class. Obviously, the financial dominance also leads to a sporting dominance, which manifests itself more and more. But what about the top 5 leagues at national level? Can we expect variety here? Are the clubs pictured in Figure 2 uncatchable for the competition?", "For the five European top leagues we have longer time series from 2009 to 2018. Thus, we can look at the development over a period of 10 years:", "Figure 4 also shows that the average squad value in all leagues has increased significantly. The order is mainly the same, only Italy has slipped from 2nd place to 4th place. Is there a dominance of the teams with the most valuable squads here, analogous to the European level? The following teams have had the most valuable squads in the last ten years:", "Figure 5 shows championship titles from the aforementioned teams. Olympique Lyon and SSC Napoli are not shown as they have not won a national title since 2009:", "Overall, the two teams with the most valuable squads have won over 80% of the championships. Especially in Germany, Italy and Spain the top teams are dominant. At the national level too, the clubs with the most expensive squads dominate the league.", "But what about financial development in general? Is financial inequality in the leagues continuing to increase or are there dynamic developments at the national level, so that we can expect more variety in the future? To answer this question, we look at the so-called GINI coefficient. This is primarily used in economics to reflect equality or inequality. Often the coefficient is applied to the distribution of income to check how equal or unequal assets are distributed in a society. If the GINI coefficient is 0 all persons would have exactly the same, but if the value is 1, one person would have everything and the others nothing. We will now apply this indicator to the squad values \u200b\u200b to check how the distribution has developed. In Figure 6 we are able to see the result:", "Inequality has increased in all five leagues over the last ten years. The strongest growth was in France, where the GINI coefficient increased from 0.29 to 0.46. The greatest degree of inequality is found in Spain. Here the coefficient has risen from 0.46 to 0.52. The relatively lowest inequality exists in Germany, but here, too, inequality has increased. In Italy, there was a sharp decline of 0.06 to 0.45. The lowest increase was in England, where the coefficient only increased by 0.01 to 0.39.", "The dashed black line represents the average over all five leagues. In 2009, the GINI coefficient was at 0.41 and in 2018 at 0.47. It is noticeable that there was a continuous increase until 2014 to 0.48. Since then, the value has largely stagnated. One reason for this could be the introduction of UEFA\u2019s financial fair play, which meant that the top clubs could no longer expand their investment volume [5].", "We have already noticed that the financially stronger leagues dominate the European scene and at national level the clubs with more valuable squads are also better off. Now we check the statistical correlation between the value of the squad and the sporting success in terms of points achieved in a season:", "In Figure 7 we see that Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient is about 0.69 across all leagues. This is a strong positive relationship. The correlation coefficient first indicates that there is a relationship, but does not yet say anything about causality. This correlation exists in all leagues and is strongest in Spain, while the correlation is relatively low in France. Nevertheless, there is a strong positive correlation between the number of points scored and the squad value in all leagues.", "In Figure 8, this relationship is visualized. It can be clearly seen that with an increasing squad value on average, the number of points scored also increases. It can be assumed that there is a partial correlation here. If a team like Leicester City unexpectedly competes for the championship, the market values \u200b\u200bof the players will rise without the team has invested in new players. In this example, the good performance would be responsible for an increase of the squad value. Generally, clubs make transfers to expand their sporting potential and we assume that a higher squad value leads to greater sporting success. We can check this assumption with a regression:", "Figure 9 shows the result of the regression. The points are the dependent and the squad value the independent variable. The adjusted R-squared is 0.662. This means that approximately 66% of the variance of the dependent variable, that is, the points, can be explained by our independent variable. Furthermore, we can see from the P-value that the result is statistically significant.", "In the introduction, we have seen that the top five European leagues dominate financially as well as athletically. In addition, this cohort continues to grow dynamically, while the remaining leagues show a slight downward trend. Therefore, it can be assumed that the sporting dominance continues to manifest itself.In a comparison of England, France, Germany, Italy and Spain it is noticeable that England has by far the highest squad values \u200b\u200band that dominance continues for the last ten years. Due to the current development, it is unlikely that another league will take first place in the near future. In the national leagues we have found that the distribution of squad values \u200b\u200bis becoming increasingly unequal. The greatest increase in inequality occurred in France, while the absolute level is highest in Spain.In the last part, we statistically checked the correlation between squad value and athletic success. There is a strong positive correlation, which allows two conclusions. The sporting dominance of the five European top leagues will increase rather than decrease in the near future due to the financial potential. Furthermore, due to the increasing inequality in the national leagues, the dominance of top teams will continue to exist.", "If you enjoy Medium and Towards Data Science and didn\u2019t sign up yet, feel free to use my referral link to join the community.", "Your home for data science.
