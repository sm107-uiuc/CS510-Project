I describe here an open source, production-ready, ensemble-based document classifier for PDFs. It achieves 98% accuracy. This is the explanation of how it came to be, why the different classifiers were combined, and how I made it into a production system.", "My client, the non-profit Internet Archive, preserves content on the Web so that the past is not lost. Almost everyone knows about the \u201cWayback Machine\u201d, a time machine for the Web that they offer.", "Internet Archive has a heuristic for picking what to archive: if something might soon get lost forever, then archive that first. Sometimes this is tactical and a certainty, like saving Google Plus content before the plug was pulled. The focus of this work is to preserve PDFs that are obscure, but might be important in the long-tail scheme of things someday. In particular, research works like academic papers served by small publishers could disappear because they are not well-funded. By contrast, at the other end of the scale, papers at Public Library Of Science are in no danger of being lost.", "The Andrew Mellon Foundation has a history of supporting libraries, and it awarded a grant to make this work possible. The grant specifies that the software developed is open source; that made it easy to put this project on github.com.", "Internet Archive presented me with this situation in early 2019: it takes 30 seconds to determine whether a PDF is a research work, but it needs to be less than 1 second. It will be used on PDFs already archived and on PDFs as they are found during a Web crawl. Usage will be batch, not interactive, and it must work without GPUs. Importantly, it must work with multiple languages for which there are not many training examples. The plan is to process 650 million PDFs to find the 6% that are research works.", "The positive training set is a known collection of 18 million papers which can be assumed to be clean, ground truth. The negative training set is simply a random selection from the 650 million PDFs which is polluted with positive cases. An audit of 1,000 negative examples showed 6\u20137% positive cases. These were cleaned up by manual inspection and bootstrapping was used to increase the size of the set.", "With these goals and facts in mind, I set out to form a solution.", "The first step to any machine learning project is to know your data. I inspected a subset of PDFs and found:\u2022 Some PDFs only contained images of text\u2022 Number of pages ranges from one to hundreds\u2022 Aspect ratio and page layout varies", "To handle image-only documents, the first page can be used to make an image which can then be used for image classification.", "A small percentage of research works are published with cover sheets that advertise the publisher and/or show licensing text. This suggests that multiple pages could be rendered to improve accuracy, but using just the first page gave us sufficient accuracy at this stage of the project that examining more pages was left to the future.", "You might imagine that a research work looks like a typical computer science conference paper with a title, authors, centered abstract, and maybe some body text on the first page. I certainly expected that, but as soon as you venture into life sciences, position papers, transcribed conference keynote speeches, and so on, the designs are quite varied. Here are some positive and negative examples, picked at random:", "Even for a human being, this is not a slam-dunk for visual analysis.", "ImageMagick was chosen for first page image generation. It uses ghostscript underneath to render an image. Initially, there were many problem images that were mostly black. The trick to fixing this is setting the background to be white explicitly. Apparently, about half the PDFs out there are actually printing to a transparent background.", "The image produced is actually a thumbnail. This works fine because plenty of successful image classification is done on small images all the time. This has a side benefit that the result is language independent: at 224x224, it is not possible to discern the language used in the document.", "A heuristic had to be developed to detect and reject blank images. These might be due to rendering errors like a missing font for Japanese or there might actually be a blank first page. Obviously, if both the positive and negative example sets contained blank images, the classification would be like throwing a die, so these had to be removed.", "Unlike natural images where a cat could appear anywhere in the frame, research work PDFs are rigidly aligned, often with centered text in a title. To capture this aspect, ImageMagick is directed to horizontally center the rendering flush against the north side. In a study of 2000 examples, I did not see a big accuracy improvement due to alignment, so it might be the case that models already able to handle unaligned images get no benefit from more alignment.", "Text needs to be extracted as well as first page images. After much experimentation, the pdftotext utility was found to be fast and efficient for text. Moreover, because it is run as a subprocess, a timeout is used to avoid getting stuck on parasitic cases. When exposing a system to millions of examples, bad apple PDFs which cause the process to be slow or stuck are possible.", "Using pdftotext is a joy. Out of the box, it just works and it can keep the words in human-reading order, even with 2 column formatting.", "The PDF format is a set of instructions to render documents using typesetting, line art, and images. There are many degrees of freedom, so each implementation of a PDF likely has a slightly different style. If some are used exclusively for research works or not, the instruction patterns might be a cheap clue, but there are no guarantees that it is stable over time; styles would come and go over time. I estimate that there are probably 100 instruction patterns in active use. For image-only PDFs, there is no chance that training could learn OCR on any reasonable compute budget just by training on positive and negative examples. That would be like science fiction writer Stanislaw Lem\u2019s idea of training ants to write natural language by zapping the erroneous ants with a magnifying glass in the sun.", "After discarding the end-to-end raw PDF idea, I assumed that text extraction and rendering the first page as an image would be good approaches. The speed of these feature-extraction preprocessing steps is easily within the 1sec time budget.", "Assuming pdftotext is used, then what would a be a good baseline model? The classic computer science paper has the words \u201cabstract\u201d and \u201creferences\u201d. How well would it work to simply require both of these words? I performed informal measurements and found that requiring both words had only 50% accuracy, which is dismal. Requiring either keyword has 84% accuracy for the positive case. Only 10% of the negative cases had either of these keywords. This gave me an accuracy target to beat.", "Next up, what models can be used?", "Utilizing transfer learning, TensorFlow Hub was used to test out a dozen image classifier models for accuracy. InceptionV3 and Resnet had the best at 87%; I picked InceptionV3 somewhat arbitrarily.", "While 87% is not exactly stellar, it is the PDFs that only contain images of text that will suffer that 13% error rate. Most PDFs contain explicit text.", "Linear text classifiers can be very fast, but they can have trouble with multiple languages when there are insufficient training examples. In this project, fastText[1] from FaceBook was chosen. It\u2019s a well-written C++ package with python bindings that makes no compromises when it comes to speed.", "\u201cFast\u201d means 0.4msec., which is 3 orders of magnitude faster than a deep neural network on a CPU. The accuracy on a 20,000 document training and test set reached 96%. One of the big advantages is that it is full text, but a big disadvantage is that this kind of bag-of-words classifier does no generalization to languages with little or no training examples.", "FastText is able to do n-grams, like word pairs. In testing, no accuracy advantage was seen for bigrams.", "By now, everyone knows that the BERT[2] model was a big leap ahead for \u201cself-supervised\u201d natural language. The multilingual model was trained with over 100 languages and it is a perfect choice for this project.", "Using the classifier mode for BERT, the model was fine-tuned on a 20,000 document training and test set. The result was 98% accuracy.", "The number of examples in some languages is not large, but classification was working correctly for non-English, which suggests that it is indeed generalizing across languages.", "Ensemble learning was all the rage in the early 2000s. That was right before Bayesian learning became popular. In fact, Random Forest is usually considered to be a kind of ensemble in the way it creates a patchwork over the training examples.", "We are in the deep learning era now, but ensembles are part of the standard toolkit for combining multiple modalities like text and images. One step further is to use an ensemble to conditionally speed up classifying by using a fast, linear model and, if confidence is low, then use BERT.", "Here is a diagram showing how the production classifier ensemble works:", "Each model described above computes a classification confidence. This makes it possible to create an ensemble classifier that selectively uses the models to emphasize speed or accuracy. For a speed example, if text is available and the fastText linear classifier confidence is high, BERT could be skipped. To emphasize accuracy, all three models can be run and then the combined confidence values and classification predictions make an overall classification.", "The REST interface, implemented using Flask, uses variations in the URI path to indicate the preference for which classifiers to run. Possible processing choices indicated by URI:", "\u00b7 Use a specific list of classifiers", "\u00b7 Auto mode to use fastest methods possible, depending on confidence", "TensorFlow Serving[3] is essential for running a TensorFlow model in production. Some practical remarks are in order. TensorFlow Serving is a tensor graph computation engine that loads the \u201csaved model\u201d (I quote that because it sounds generic, but it is a specific data format) and serves requests over the network. It is written in C++ for speed and can be recompiled to utilize the precise instruction set offered by your machine for maximum throughput.", "TensorFlow Serving is able to use REST or gRPC. As it turns out, gRPC is rather intrusive on the client side because server-side Python code (\u201cprocessors\u201d) used to create the input tensors tends to also be used on the client when gRPC is used. This makes for a very messy integration where the server-side and client-side are more coupled than necessary; it\u2019s not just API, but code. This might be simply an oversight in BERT or could be a general lack of encapsulation practices for gRPC when combined with TensorFlow.", "REST, on the other hand, is able to use a more generic call signature that requires no backend code. The advantage of gRPC is a slightly faster transport via smaller messages vs. HTTP, but on a CPU-only deployment that speed difference is negligible. For these reasons, REST was preferred in this project.", "The original code for BERT from Google did not export the \u201csaved model\u201d format of the model. To fix that, the official BERT project was forked and an option added to create the necessary model format.", "The project is playfully named for the ensemble of three classifiers: \u201cpdf_trio\u201d.", "The first is the main project. The second is a CNN classifier example from TensorFlow Hub. The third is a small delta of the official BERT. The pdf_trio has 5 README.md files that serve as reference documentation, and has scripts to train, test, and deploy.", "The trained models are too big for github, but they are available for download from archive.org, as described in the project README file.", "That\u2019s the end of this gentle tour of PDF_trio. A different kind of PDF classifier can be made simply by using different training examples. I hope you find PDF_trio useful.", "Thanks to: Bryan Newbold, Jefferson Bailey, David S. H.
