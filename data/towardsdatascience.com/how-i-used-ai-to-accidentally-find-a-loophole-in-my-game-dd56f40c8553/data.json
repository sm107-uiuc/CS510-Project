Genetic Algorithm2. Neural Network", "The concept behind this algorithm is inspired by Darwin\u2019s Theory of Evolution.", "These are the major stages of Genetic algorithm\u2026", "See, you may take an intuition of this from the real world evolution of human or other living beings, but after all, do keep in mind that Genetic Algorithm is basically a search algorithm.", "Consider this graph, let\u2019s say here you want to search for an (x,y) point such that \u2018z\u2019 value at it is maximum. Initially, the graph would be totally unexplored, so you aren\u2019t really sure about \u2018z\u2019 value for any other points in the graph but the initial point.", "We can apply many search algorithms to do this for us, but let\u2019s see how Genetic Algorithm would do it.", "First, in GA(Genetic Algorithm) we will start with a few random points or we can say random guesses from the solution space. For example, in the above graph, we see that \u2018x\u2019 value can be anything from -3 to +3, and the same range goes for \u2018y\u2019.", "So our random guesses might look like\u2026", "If we talk in terms of GA, that was random population generation. We basically generated a random population of (x,y) pairs, each will have some \u2018z\u2019 value. These \u2018x\u2019 value and \u2018y\u2019 value can be considered as genes.", "Now comes the fitness calculation, this is because we want to judge which of the random guess is better than other and we need something to compare concretely.So we have to define a fitness function, which will say how fit is that random guess. In this example, it\u2019s pretty simple as we need (x,y) pair with maximum \u2018z\u2019 value, so for some random guess, their \u2018z\u2019 value can act as their fitness score.", "So, now considering that fitness function we look up z-value for each point and we get a relation between them as shown below.", "Now we perform natural selection, which means randomly picking one of the random guesses, but the random pick is based on probability distribution. That means the ones which has higher fitness value will be more likely to get naturally selected. Ones with very low fitness may not get selected.", "\u201cSurvival of the fittest\u201d \u2014 Charles Darwin", "Next step is crossover or simply saying, those 2 naturally selected pairs\u2019 genes get mixed up and forms a new hybrid pair, aka offspring!", "The diagram above illustrates how crossover may take place in this example. It mixes genes from both parents to form a single offspring.We repeat natural selection multiple times and do cross over to generate offsprings.", "Now, on these new offsprings, we perform \u2018Mutation\u2019, which means randomly changing it\u2019s genes\u2019 values. Though the occurrence of mutation depends on the mutation rate, if the mutation rate is 100% then all offsprings generated will get mutated, if the mutation rate is 5%, then only 5% of offsprings will get mutated.", "Above illustration shows how \u2018y\u2019 value was randomly mutated to -2.3.The mutation is done to maintain diversity in the population, because if the population stays pretty much the same then we won\u2019t be able to explore the graph as much as we need, and as a result, we won\u2019t reach the highest point.", "Now, after mutation is applied, we have a brand new population of offsprings, which is probably better than the previous population or we can say the previous generation, as we tend to select better members from a population (through natural selection) and then mix up their genes(through crossover).", "At this point, we will discard the old generation and start performing the same steps again from fitness calculation on this new generation.", "As this loop keeps going, after some time all members will converge to the same point, which will be the highest point in the solution space and that\u2019s our goal and that\u2019s when this algorithm stops.", "\ud83d\udc47 Recommended videos on this topic \ud83d\udc47Genetic Algorithm: Introduction | The Coding TrainLearning: Genetic Algorithms | MIT OCW", "The idea of the neural network is derived from the human brain itself. This concept explains how we learn stuff based on that we can apply the same concept to make a computer learn things!", "The Artifical Neural Network(ANN) is based on Biological Neural Network, though they\u2019re not exactly same, ANN can be seen as an abstraction of actual biological neural network.", "A neural network is made up of a bunch of interconnected neurons. So, before looking at the neural network, let\u2019s take a look at a single \u2018neuron\u2019 that we use in ANN. We have named this artificial neuron as Perceptron, as they are implemented slightly differently, still let\u2019s just keep calling it a neuron to keep the biology analogy for now.", "Imagine this neuron as a function which takes a bunch of inputs (real number) and gives a single output. So now the question is what this function does to its inputs to produce the output.You see in the above illustration of the neuron each input value is passed to the neuron through an edge, and this edge has a \u2018weight\u2019 associated with it.", "i.e. when input \u2018x1\u2019 goes to the neuron through an edge which has weight \u2018w1\u2019 as shown in the diagram, value at the neuron becomes x1 * w1.", "Then all such values received from the different input edges are summed up and then there\u2019s also a value called \u2018bias\u2019 associated with neuron which gets subtracted from that sum and then this result is passed into the activation function.", "What is this activation function? There are many options for this, let\u2019s say it is a sigmoid function.", "This function takes any real number and squashes it between 0 and 1.", "So, the output of this activation function is the output of the neuron. That bias is used to set a threshold value before entering the activation function.", "Ok, a neuron is fine, but what\u2019s the use of it?For instance, you can implement AND Gate with a neuron!", "As the output is value given by the sigmoid function, it can range from 0 to 1. So, if we get output < 0.5, we will consider the result = 0Similarly if output > 0.5, we will consider the result = 1", "Now let\u2019s test this with all inputs", "But how did we find such weights and bias? This \u2018setting up weights and biases\u2019 part is all where the learning logic goes. After setting up inputs and outputs schema, all we need to do is to just find appropriate values for those weights and biases! Basically, that\u2019s what learning is in nutshell! We will get back to learning part soon.", "Now, probably you are feeling like, \u201cAND gate is boring\u2026 Can\u2019t we do a bit more cool stuff?\u201dOf course! We sure will, but before that let me tell you that a single neuron is not enough to solve all kinds of problems, as they are capable of solving only linearly separable problems.", "Informally saying, you need more neurons to do cool stuff!", "Multilayer ANN to the rescue! It has 3 kinds of layers :", "There can be more than one hidden layer, it depends on the use case. The number of neurons in each layer is also use case dependent. Each neuron is connected to all neurons of the next layer (though they can be partially connected). Each neuron has a bias value and each connection has associated weight with it. The process of processing from inputs to outputs layer by layer is called feedforward.", "To understand it, imagine this whole neural network thing as a function, which can take inputs and returns outputs.For example, You can design ANN to take sides of a rectangle as input and area of the rectangle as output, but that we can do on our own with simple logic.But we use the neural network when deriving a straight forward logic is not as easy. Consider the problem of writing a computer program which takes pictures of handwritten digits and guesses what digit it is. In that case, input neurons would be all pixels and outputs would be 10 neurons for all digits and you can experiment for hidden layers.", "Okay, this input and output part is fine, but what\u2019s with the weights and biases? That\u2019s the thing which will make these outputs possible, without the right weights and biases, a neural network is just a stupid thing!", "There are several approaches to this. One of them is to initialize ANN with random weights and train it with some labelled data set and based on errors we keep adjusting its weights and biases through backpropagation which uses a concept called gradient descent. This type of learning is called Supervised Learning.", "We can also use Reinforcement learning. Here agents start performing in its randomly initialized state and based on results of their actions they keep adjusting. We can apply the Genetic Algorithm to achieve this kind of behaviour, let\u2019s see this in the next section.", "\ud83d\udc47 Recommended video on this topic \ud83d\udc47But what is a Neural Network? | 3blue1brown", "Evolving neural networks using genetic algorithm is \u2018neuroevolution\u2019.That being said, the term \u2018Neuroevolution\u2019 makes sense, right?", "Neural Network + Evolution = Neuroevolution", "First, we identify the problem statement and design a suitable neural network architecture. But to make it work right, we need to find the right weights and biases for it, so now GA comes into the picture.", "We generate multiple ANNs initialized with random weights for their connections, thus a random population of ANNs. So, here all of these randomly generated weights would result in just some stupid ANNs, but since it\u2019s random, some ANNs would be less stupid and some would be more stupid. We know what this neural network is supposed to do, so by its performance, we can calculate its fitness. Here weights and biases would be genes of ANN. Based on fitness values and probability distribution natural selection will occur. For crossover, naturally selected ANN\u2019s weights and biases would be mixed to form a hybrid ANN. During mutation, some weights and biases get randomly changed slightly. Through natural selections, crossovers and mutations as we move forward with new generations, ANNs start to improve in the direction guided by the fitness function.", "It\u2019s still a search algorithm though. Earlier, when we were trying to find best (x, y) point using GA, we were actually exploring the 2 dimension space of X-axis and Y-axis. Similarly here assume a dimension for the weight of each connection of an ANN and bias of each neuron, It\u2019s hard to imagine that visually, but basically we are exploring dimension space of all weights & biases and trying to find best weights and biases vector in that space.", "As we keep this loop running, eventually the ANN should behave the way we expected.", "\ud83d\udc47 Recommended video on this topic \ud83d\udc47Introduction to Neuroevolution | The Coding Train", "I got inspired by this Flappy Bird with Neuroevolution coding challenge where they use neuroevolution to let the computer learn to play the game on its own. check the live version of their project.", "So, I wanted to do a similar project on some other game, so I started looking for a simple game where I could apply this algorithm.", "After a bit of research, I decided to make my own game \ud83d\ude1b and then use this algorithm on that.", "Now this project had 2 parts:", "Now, designing the game\u2026 long story short, I came up with this game called \u2018escape jump\u2019 (a friend helped me with the name \ud83d\ude43 )", "Here you control that red ball with arrow keys, and you have to escape through or jump through the space between the pipes (black bars) before it squeezes you (the red ball), at which point both pipes will close is unknown in the beginning, so you have to make a quick judgment when they appear. If you are on a desktop, you can try this game right now from this link. Try it and see how much you can score, and later see how much the AI scored on its own!", "Ok, I know that the game is not so decent looking, though I think it\u2019s good enough for this experiment, isn\u2019t it? it\u2019s not too easy neither too hard, a fair game I thought.", "But life never went the way I feel \ud83d\ude05, yet I went with it anyway to see where it goes.", "For neuroevolution, we initialize the game with multiple balls each having their own ANN (as shown in the above diagram) which makes the decision for them. ANN takes input at each frame and takes action based on ANN output.", "That function above is from the \u2018Ball\u2019 class. It shows how it is passing inputs to the ANN and how it\u2019s using outputs of ANN to make the decision of whether to jump or to move.", "We let all balls play together in the same game. Number of seconds the ball survives in the game can be considered as their fitness. A ball dies when it gets squeezed in between the pipes. When all of the balls die, we would have fitness score for each ball, based on that we can perform natural selection, crossover, mutation and then the new generation emerges.", "So, that\u2019s how it looks, now if you have seen how that flappy bird was learning to play on its own using this algorithm, you can kinda imagine how this game should have gone. It should have learned to play like we normally would, something similar to what I was playing in the first animation shown.", "So, I ran it for a few generations and was surprised by what it did to the game, it felt like the computer was making fun of my game \ud83d\ude02", "So, this algorithm found a place where it can keep jumping at regular intervals and beat the game! Wow! Though initially, I was a bit sad realizing my game was too easy to play, then I realized that an AI told me that, I realized that I just accidentally used an AI to find a loophole in a game, it felt better that way.", "I never fixed that loophole though \ud83d\ude1c, probably I\u2019ll just keep the code this way.", "If you want to see this simulation and play around with it, Checkout thisIf you want to take a look at this code, here\u2019s a link to its GitHub repository", "Your home for data science.
