Or do you get extremely curious and excited when you see a stylish portrait being built using computers only by providing a small layout to it? Well, this is what we are going to uncover in this article. All these cool ideas are mostly implemented with the help of a modern idea in machine learning i.e. GANs.", "Note: The aforementioned ideas could also be implemented with an efficient usage of Computer Graphics packages which is out of scope for this article but I\u2019ve added links some of them in the reference section.", "GANs or Generative Adversarial Networks are the class of networks that have the capability to generate images which are similar to the real images. If you are familiar with the concept of style transfer, the idea of GANs won\u2019t be exactly new to you. However you can get a good brush-up over style transfer from the link in the Reference section. GANs have various applications like Image-Image translation, Text-Image translation, Real time video simulation with face mask, Generating Cartoon Characters and many more. One idea that I think GANs could also prove themselves to be useful is in the case of upsampling of the data.(Think over it!).", "Recently I\u2019ve participated in a technical writing competition hosted by IEEE which aimed towards writing about a potential and beneficial use case for the future of any technology and so I\u2019ve written down about GANs. You can find a PDF of the article from the Reference section!", "Basically as stated above, GANs or Generative Adversarial Networks are the networks in which we generate images which resemble similarity to the real world images. But wait! Who exactly generates the images? How Image generation is even possible? How the model is trained? How the model learn mappings to generate images? Don\u2019t we use Convolutional Networks?You would get answers for all of these questions in the article so read carefully.", "A particular GAN contains two distinct networks. One of them is called a Generator network and the other one is called a Discriminator network. The Generator model (being an Artist) tries to generate images which resembles similarity with the real images and the Discriminator model (being an Art-critic) distinguishes between the real image and the generated image.", "Note that the Discriminator network is also called as Adversarial Network and hence the name Generative Adversarial Network.", "The ideal condition for a GAN network is when the Discriminator network is unable to distinguish between the real images and the images being generated by the Generator network.", "At a very base level the workings of Generator and Discriminator networks can be summarized as-", "Generator model does not see the real image directly and works only on the observed image (or vector in case of DCGAN). After generating an image, this image is being sent into the Discriminator network which classifies it as real or fake. The Discriminator network also sees the real image and hence captures some information from it. The output we get from the Discriminator network for an input of the generated image contains some information about the real image. We then calculate loss for the Generator network based on this output. Through this the Generator network gets information about real image and then in the next attempt, it tries to generate an image more similar to the real image. Through continuous practice, the Generator model becomes able to generate an image having a strong resemblance to the real image which a Discriminator is unable to classify.", "GANs are not that much newer to the tech community and since few decades our tech community has evolved so far that researches are being carried out at very faster pace than before. As a result, we\u2019ve got many areas in which GANs are already being implemented and are working very well. Let\u2019s uncover some of those areas:", "DeepFake is an amazing implementation of GANs where a person in an image or video is being replaced with a person of similar looks. It is not only the image that are being replaced here but also the voice of the speaker gets changed sometimes.", "However this technology introduced various negative usage such as celebrity pornographic videos, revenge porn, fake news, hoaxes, and financial fraud. Although DeepFake could be used for many wrong tasks, it also has various positive implementations such as Dubbing in Films, educating students and so on.", "A very beneficial implementation of GANs are generating beautiful and creative portraits from scratch. We can provide training samples to these models in both paired (where there is a direct mapping b/w observed and real images) and unpaired (where there is no direct mapping b/w observed and real images) form.", "ExGANs or Exemplar Generative Adversarial Networks is an approach being implemented by Facebook. ExGANs are a type of conditional GANs that utilize the exemplar information to produce high-quality, personalized in-painting results. This approach in-particular uses ExGANs to convert image of people with closed eyes into the same image with eyes being opened.", "There are also other areas which makes a great usage of GANs. See reference section to know more.", "Although there are various variants of GANs, today we are going to deal with three common types of GANs viz DCGAN, Pix2Pix GAN and CyclicGAN. Implementations for these GANs is being posted as the official tutorials by Tensorflow so don\u2019t forget to check that out. Okay, so let\u2019s get started:", "DCGANs or Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks are some of the basic forms of GANs that learn a mapping from a noise vector to an image. Now you might be thinking that how we could convert a vector into an image? The answer for this is really simple. It uses Transposed Convolutional layers to perform deconvolution of the input. This is exactly opposite to what a Convolutional layer would do. A Convolutional layer extract features from the input image such that the number of channels increases but in Transposed Convolutional layers, new features are being added to the input vectors that converts them into images.", "The generator network is built up over a series of [Transposed Convolutional + BatchNorm + LeakyReLU layers]. The Discriminator network is a normal classifier that uses convolutional layers to classify if the input image is real or generated.", "The Discriminator loss is a combined form of losses over the real image\u2019s output and the generated image\u2019s output. The loss function used is BinaryCrossEntropy (but the choice is not restricted). The Generator loss is calculated based upon the output we get from the Discriminator network for the generated image as an input.", "These class of GANs come under the category of Conditional GANs. Conditional GANs are those class of GANs that generate images based on conditions in the input images. For example, consider the image below-", "In the above image, we have to generate the image on the right using the image on the left. Here we can see that there is a direct relation b/w the input and output and the model very easily learns to generate images based on such pairs. These kind of data is also called as Paired Data.", "Now, a particular Pix2Pix GAN also has a Generator and a Discriminator model. But here both of them are not as same as those used in DCGANs. The Generator network utilizes a U-Net architecture and the Discriminator network utilizes a PatchGAN architecture.", "A U-Net architecture is basically a vanilla Encoder-Decoder network with an enhancement of skip connections in between the layers. The argument of adding skip connections could be that the model would then equally learn the encoded as well as decoded features at each layer. The U-Net architecture used in Pix2Pix Network (specifically in the tensorflow tutorial on cityscapes dataset) can be visualized as-", "Now comes the description of the Discriminator network! The Discriminator network is a PatchGAN network. But what is a PatchGAN network at the first place? A PatchGAN network comes under the class of machine learning classifiers that learn to classify the high frequency structure in the input data. They penalize structure at the scale of patches. These models use patches being extracted from the images for classification tasks. The Discriminator uses an N x N patch to identify if an image is real or fake. Usually a 70x70 portion of an image is being used for classification because it yields better results. This is evident from the explanation in the original paper.", "The Discriminator loss is obtained by calculating the sum of cross entropies of the outputs from real and generated images. Generator, in addition to calculating the loss for the generated image, also calculates the L1 norm of the distance between the target image and the generated image.", "Cyclic GANs are one of the most widely used class of GANs. Before diving into Cyclic GANs, let us talk something about Unpaired Data. Consider the following image-", "The pair of images on the left side have a certain degree of correspondence between them and are known as Paired data as we already discussed. The image on the right side does not have any correspondence between them and are known as Unpaired Data. In many cases we would be getting Unpaired data only as the cost of creation of paired data is more and is not very easily available.", "Only for training of Unpaired Data, you are implementing a brand new architecture? Can\u2019t we learn unpaired data using the previous approaches?", "The answer to this is yes, you can use previous approaches but that would not prove to be much beneficial in terms of performance. Hence we needed a new approach to deal with this kind of data. Not only unpaired data but we can also use CyclicGANs for learning from the paired data and it yields very promising results with it.", "Let us now consider some of the reasons for using CyclicGANs-", "We are considering two sets of images viz X and Y as the two domain between which we want to translate images.", "Both of these issues have been resolved by CyclicGANs. Let us now understand the architecture of CyclicGANs.", "A particular CyclicGAN consists of two Generator networks and two Discriminator networks.", "The two Generator Networks viz G and F are inverse of each other. G learns a mapping from images in set X to Y, G:X \u2192Y, and F learns a mapping from images in set Y to X, F:Y \u2192X.", "For classifying the outputs of the two Generator networks as real or fake, we have two Discriminator networks i.e. Dx and Dy. Dx basically classifies the image being generated by F as real or fake and Dy classifies the image being generated by G as real or fake.", "The Discriminator loss (Adversarial loss) and the Generator loss is implemented as-", "Note that we usually multiply the Discriminator loss by 1/2 due to which it learns slowly as compared to the Generator network.", "In addition to these loss there is also a cyclic consistency loss that completes up the objective function for CyclicGANs. Cyclic consistency loss addresses the problem of reverse mapping that we encountered earlier. This loss makes sure that the image which is mapped from set X to set Y has a reverse mapping to itself. Let us have some words from the paper that talks about the why cyclic consistency loss should be introduced-", "With large enough capacity, a network can map the same set of input images to any random permutation of images in the target domain, where any of the learned mappings can induce an output distribution that matches the target distribution. Thus, adversarial losses alone cannot guarantee that the learned function can map an individual input xi to a desired output yi.", "The incapability of adversarial networks to not guarantee the desired output lead us to introduce cyclic consistency loss. Consider the image below-", "Considering the left side of the image, we can see that it generates an image y_hat from an image x using G and we again passed this generated image to obtain an image x_hat using F. The exact opposite is being done in the right side of the image.Now consistency loss basically measures the similarity between x and x_hat (for the left side) which we also called as forward cyclic consistency loss and the loss calculated on the similarity between y and y_hat (for the right side) is also called as backward cyclic consistency loss. This loss is basically the L1 (or Manhattan) norm between the distance of real ({x, y}) and generated ({x_hat, y_hat}) images.", "The cyclic consistency loss could be implemented as-", "So, [adversarial losses + lambda * (forward cyclic consistency loss + backward cyclic consistency loss )+ generator loss] together comprise the complete objective function for CyclicGANs. Here lambda is a hyperparameter to be tuned.", "Note that the choice of other hyperparameters for model building in any of the approaches discussed above is completely scenario specific. But in my view, the values specified in the original paper usually holds better results.", "Although GANs are pretty much awesome in their architecture as well as working, there is much more to find out with these. We don\u2019t need to think that GANs would take up jobs or something. GANs are pretty much cool at their place but still depend on humans for various tasks.", "I hope that I am pretty much successful in keeping my point clear to you. I\u2019ve tried my best to explain ideas from the original paper. However if you\u2019re still having doubts in any of the sections or feel that I\u2019ve described a thing incorrectly, feel free to write that in comments.~Happy Coding~", "Your home for data science.
