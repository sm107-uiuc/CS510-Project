ConvNets are the superheroes that took working with images in deep learning to the next level. With ConvNets, the input is a image, or more specifically, a 3D Matrix.", "Let\u2019s start by looking at how a ConvNet looks!", "In a nutshell,A ConvNet usually has 3 types of layers:1) Convolutional Layer (CONV)2) Pooling Layer (POOL)3) Fully Connected Layer (FC)", "Let\u2019s look at each of these layers in more detail:", "Convolutional Layer is the first layer in a CNN.It gets as input a matrix of the dimensions [h1 * w1 * d1], which is the blue matrix in the above image.", "Next, we have kernels (filters).Kernels?A kernel is a matrix with the dimensions [h2 * w2 * d1], which is one yellow cuboid of the multiple cuboid (kernels) stacked on top of each other (in the kernels layer) in the above image.For each convolutional layer, there are multiple kernels stacked on top of each other, this is what forms the yellow 3-dimensional matrix in Fig 2, which is of dimensions [h2 * w2 * d2], where d2 is the number of kernels.", "For each kernel, we have its respective bias, which is a scalar quantity.", "And then, we have a output for this layer, the green matrix in Fig 2, which has dimensions [h3 * w3 * d2].", "Let\u2019s throw light on some obvious things from above.1) The depth (d1) (or the number of channels) of the input and of one kernel is the same.2) The depth (d2) of the output is equal to the number of kernels (i.e. the depth of the orange 3-dimensional matrix).", "Alright, so we have inputs, kernels and outputs. Now let\u2019s look at what happens with a 2D input and a 2D kernel, i.e. d1=1.", "For each position of the kernel on the image, each number on the kernel gets multiplied with the corresponding number on the input matrix (blue matrix) and then they all are summed up for the value in the corresponding position in the output matrix (green matrix).", "With d1 > 1, the same thing occurs for each of the channels and then they are added up together and then summed up with the bias of the respective filter and this forms the value in corresponding position of the output matrix. Let\u2019s visualize!", "And this is forms one (of d2) matrix of the output layer.", "This entire process is repeated with all the d2 kernels which forms the d2 channels in the output layer.", "There are two types of pooling:1) Max Pooling2) Average Pooling", "The main purpose of a pooling layer is to reduce the number of parameters of the input tensor and thus- Helps reduce overfitting- Extract representative features from the input tensor- Reduces computation and thus aids efficiency", "The input to the Pooling layer is tensor.", "In case of Max Pooling, an example of which is shown in the Fig 6, a kernel of size n*n (2x2 in the above example) is moved across the matrix and for each position the max value is taken and put in the corresponding position of the output matrix.", "In case of Average Pooling, a kernel of size n*n is moved across the matrix and for each position the average is taken of all the values and put in the corresponding position of the output matrix.", "This is repeated for each channel in the input tensor. And so we get the output tensor.So, a thing to note is, Pooling downsamples the image in its height and width but the number of channels(depth) stays the same.", "Fully Connected Layer is simply, feed forward neural networks. Fully Connected Layers form the last few layers in the network.", "The input to the fully connected layer is the output from the final Pooling or Convolutional Layer, which is flattened and then fed into the fully connected layer.", "Flattened?The output from the final (and any) Pooling and Convolutional Layer is a 3-dimensional matrix, to flatten that is to unroll all its values into a vector.Let\u2019s visualize!", "This Flattened vector is then connected to a few fully connected layers which are same as Artificial Neural Networks and perform the same mathematical operations!", "For each layer of the Artificial Neural Network, the following calculation takes place", "where,x \u2014 is the input vector with dimension [p_l, 1]W \u2014 Is the weight matrix with dimensions [p_l, n_l] where, p_l is the number of neurons in the previous layer and n_l is the number of neurons in the current layer.b \u2014 Is the bias vector with dimension [p_l, 1]g \u2014 Is the activation function, which is usually ReLU.", "This calculation is repeated for each layer.", "After passing through the fully connected layers, the final layer uses the softmax activation function (instead of ReLU) which is used to get probabilities of the input being in a particular class (classification).", "And so finally, we have the probabilities of the object in the image belonging to the different classes!!", "And that is how the Convolutional Neural Network works!!And input images get classified as labels!!", "Now, let\u2019s visualize how to calculate the dimensions of the output tensor from the input tensor.", "where,W1 \u2014 is the width / height of the input tensorF \u2014 is the width / height of the kernelP \u2014 is the paddingS \u2014 is the strideW2 \u2014 is the output width / height", "Padding?Usually, the input matrices are padded around with zero so that the kernel can move over the matrix uniformly and the resultant matrix have the desired dimension. So, P=1 means that all sides of the input matrix is padded with 1 layer of zeros as in Fig 4 with the dotted extras around the input (blue) matrix.", "Stride?The kernel moves over the matrix 1 pixel at a time (Fig 4). So, this is said to have a stride of 1. We can increase the stride to 2 so that the kernel moves over the matrix 2 pixels at a time. This will, in turn, affect the dimensions of the output tensor and helps reduce overfitting.", "And what happens to the number of channels of the output tensor?Well, in case of a Convolutional Layer, it is equal to the number of kernels.And in case of a Pooling Layer, the channels in the input tensor and the output tensor remains the same!", "Your home for data science.
