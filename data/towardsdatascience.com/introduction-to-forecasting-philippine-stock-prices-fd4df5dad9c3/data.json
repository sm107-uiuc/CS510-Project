Why? Because your ability to make money in the stock market is dependent on your ability to predict what the price is going to be in the future.", "In this post, I will demonstrate a quick way to forecast the daily closing price of a Philippine stock, Jollibee Foods Corporation (JFC), using the powerful Prophet package on python. Prophet is an open source forecasting tool made by Facebook that speeds up the standard forecasting workflow from something that typically takes days or weeks to something that takes as little as a few minutes (assuming you already have data in the correct format).", "All relevant data and code can be found in the time-series directory of this repo.", "We will follow the workflow below:", "All we need is a file that we can read into python as a pandas DataFrame which contains 2 columns corresponding to the stock\u2019s closing price and date.", "For this introduction, I\u2019ve saved a copy of JFC\u2019s closing prices from 2013\u201309\u201301 to 2019\u201304\u201326 (along with the rest of the code here) in the time-series directory of this repo. We can access the data by cloning this repo and navigating to the time-series directory.", "For this, we can use the basic plotting functionality accessible straight from the pandas DataFrame.", "You will notice that JFC\u2019s closing price moves in cycles of upward and downward movements, but the overall trend is still going up. One of the strengths of Prophet is that it can automatically account for the seasonality found in trends when making its forecasts.", "Now, we can train the Prophet model! To do this, we have to first filter the DataFrame to have only two columns: the date, \u201cCHART_DATE\u201d and the closing price, \u201cCLOSE\u201d. Then, we change their names to \u201cds\u201d and \u201cy\u201d, respectively, since Prophet automatically reads the \u201cds\u201d column as the date and the \u201cy\u201d column as the variable being forecasted. Finally, we train the model on the training data, which refers to the data before the beginning of a specified holdout period. In this case, \u201cHOLDOUT_START\u201d is the date corresponding to the beginning of the holdout period (set at 2019\u201303\u201301).", "Note that the data for the holdout period will be treated as our validation set and will be used in assessing the performance of the trained Prophet model.", "In Prophet, we do this by first creating a future dataframe, where we specify how far into the future we want to forecast; in this case, we set it to 336 days. Next, we call the predict method found inside the trained prophet model (using the future dataframe as an argument) and this returns the predictions.", "The forecasts along with historical closing prices are shown above. The blue line corresponds to the forecasted closing prices, while the black dots correspond to the historical closing prices from the training set. The forecasted closing prices for the holdout period indicate that prices will go down for that period (2019\u201303\u201301 to 2019\u201304\u201326).", "The shaded blue region corresponds to the forecasted 95% confidence intervals. You will notice that forecasts that are further away, also have wider forecasted confidence intervals.", "To assess the accuracy of our trained Prophet model, we will compute the root mean squared error (RMSE) of our predictions on the holdout set from 2019\u201303\u201301 to 2019\u201304\u201326. To visualise performance in more detail, we also plot the predicted JFC closing price vs the actual JFC closing price for the 57 day holdout period.", "As stated earlier, the forecasted prices (blue) for the holdout set indicate that prices would go down overall for the duration of the holdout set. Interestingly, the actual prices (orange) also showed an overall decrease in JFC\u2019s closing price, although sharper than the one predicted.", "In addition, the short term movements also appear to be reflected by the forecasts. The actual trend shows an initial increase up to April 8, and then a drop leading to April 26. Again, the forecasts show similar movements, although not as sharp.", "The calculated root mean squared error (RMSE) of 5.56 tells us that on average (with increased weight on large errors) the Prophet model\u2019s JFC closing price predictions are wrong by PHP 5.56 for the holdout set from 2019\u201303\u201301 to 2019\u201304\u201326. Is this error small enough for us to trust the predictions? That will depend on our willingness to take on risk, but a conservative rule of thumb is to only make trades on forecasts that indicate a profit opportunity even at the expected downward deviation from the forecasted price.", "Congratulations! You now know how to execute a basic forecasting workflow using the powerful Prophet package. This involved the following steps: 1) installing and importing the necessary packages, 2) getting the data, 3) plotting the time series, 4) training the Prophet model, 5) predicting the future using the model, and finally, 6) assessing accuracy. This same workflow can be applied using other forecasting models and for use cases other than predicting stock prices.", "It\u2019s important to note that there are still many ways to improve our current forecasting workflow:", "Above are only some of the many ways to improve our current forecasting workflow and I plan to discuss these in more detail in future blog posts. If you have any suggestions on which ones to start with, feel free to comment or email me at lorenzo.ampil@gmail.com.
