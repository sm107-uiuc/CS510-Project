It wasn\u2019t much, but it might be enough for a reasonable estimate.", "\u201cDo you lose more clients in the area of long or short-term projects?\u201d, he asked.", "The businessman needed a moment to find the right table and display it on the screen. He looked at the numbers and replied, \u201cShort-term.\u201d", "Domnall opened his eyes, reached for one of the notepads lying around and began to sketch.", "\u201cSo here we have your customer data\u2026 financial flows here\u2026 a connection to the third-party data here\u2026\u201d He glanced at the database specialist who, not wanting to miss any detail of the reasoning, leaned towards the drawing so hard that she was practically lying on the counter. \u201cWhich of these data lakes will be the easiest to connect?\u201d", "\u201cThese two.\u201d The woman pointed to the sketch without hesitation. \u201cWe could make it production-ready in about half a year.\u201d", "Domnall smiled to himself. He drew a few lines and crossed out several others. He looked at the woman again. She blinked in surprise, but a second later she nodded approvingly.", "\u201cIn this configuration, we could do it in a quarter.\u201d She threw her business colleague an asking glance. \u201cProvided that we could temporarily suspend the development of the new reporting system.\u201d", "The businessman froze staring at the drawing.", "\u201cIf I understand it correctly, within half a year we may either get a tool allowing us to identify the highest risk projects or in three months a churn predictor?\u201d When the interlocutors nodded, he finished slightly disappointed, \u201cBut the latter is at the expense of reporting, right?\u201d", "\u201cThat\u2019s the way I see it,\u201d confirmed Domnall. \u201cBut I need to warn you that I base my assumptions on partial data I received with your technical test. At this moment I cannot promise the solution will work, and even if it will, what level of precision we will be able to achieve.\u201d", "The troubled businessman massaged his temples. The database specialist mentally drifted away to her tables probably already forging an action plan for the upcoming weeks.", "Domnall felt a pang of enthusiasm. The company, although small, had a well-thought-out strategy and was well managed. While the interaction with the managerial and technical staff to date proved to him that employees not only showed a high level of competence, but also respected common sense; and that Domnall valued the most.", "\u201cVery well, very well,\u201d a young representative of the human resources department interrupted the conversation unexpectedly.", "Until now Domnall did not pay any attention to her, because she was silent as the grave, entirely absorbed with some cosmetic detail of her absurdly long hybrid nail. Now she folded her hands on her chest giving the applicant a broad smile, both charming and insincere. \u201cI think that\u2019s enough for today.\u201d", "Domnall felt a shiver crawling down his back. Her last sentence was pronounced in a pleasant tone, but neither that nor the mask of delight on the girl\u2019s face was able to hide the resentment lurking underneath.", "\u201cVery well?\u201d Domnall frowned. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t know why, but I feel that you think I shouldn\u2019t get this job.\u201d The Girl\u2019s apparent confusion confirmed his supposition. \u201cMay I ask why?\u201d", "\u201cI have the right to veto all and any candidates,\u201d she chirped sweetly as soon as she regained her composure. \u201cMy role is to assess their soft skills and I think that you simply lack empathy.\u201d", "\u201cEmpathy?!\u201d Domnall\u2019s eyes widened in surprise. \u201cLike in the ability to empathize? To harmonize with the interlocutor\u2019s emotions? Absence of which is called psychopathy? I just showed that I can sense your emotions towards me, despite your wide smile and kind words!\u201d", "\u201cBut your inept communication has clearly discomforted my people; me too.\u201d She sent him an offended glance, then added harshly, \u201cSuch behavior is unacceptable. I won\u2019t even mention, that when a difficult topic came up, you closed your eyes clearly avoiding eye contact.\u201d", "\u201cI was just thinking about a solution to the presented problem.\u201d Domnall looked at the other participants in disbelief, seeking support. The businessman and the database specialist scrupulously studied cosmetic details of their own nails. He murmured hopelessly: \u201cLike they are now.\u201d", "\u201cVery well! As all is clear now, thank you very much,\u201d the HR girl announced in triumph. \u201cWe will call you.\u201d", "Episode 6: Passionate, more passionate, hired!", "Domnall is a brilliant guy.
