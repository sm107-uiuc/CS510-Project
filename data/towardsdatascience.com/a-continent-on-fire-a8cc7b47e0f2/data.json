To put it in perspective, that is an area larger than the size of Scotland or South Korea. The scale of the destruction has been truly unprecedented. The fires have claimed dozens of lives and over half a billion animals.", "This weekend, as I watched the rain over Sydney harbour, I couldn\u2019t help wondering if there was a way for me to be a part of some long term solution to this challenge. Fires have always been a feature of this land and are only likely to get worse. As a small first step, I wanted to at least visualise where these fires were happening.", "BigQuery hosts a variety of different data sets that can be accessed publicly. It\u2019s a wonderful resource for data exploration. In this repository, I found a dataset from NASA that provided data on the locations of global wildfires.", "The dataset covered the locations (latitude and longitude), and various attributes of the fire it had detected from the past week. For those wishing to dive a bit deeper, I\u2019ve plagiarised the blurb from the NASA website below. I could not have said it any better.", "The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) 375 m (VNP14IMGTDL_NRT) active fire product is the latest product to be added to FIRMS. It provides data from the VIIRS sensor aboard the joint NASA/NOAA Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (Suomi NPP) and NOAA-20 satellites. The 375 m data complements Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire detection; they both show good agreement in hotspot detection but the improved spatial resolution of the 375 m data provides a greater response over fires of relatively small areas and provides improved mapping of large fire perimeters. The 375 m data also has improved nighttime performance. Consequently, these data are well suited for use in support of fire management (e.g., near real-time alert systems), as well as other science applications requiring improved fire mapping fidelity. Recommended reading: VIIRS 375 m Active Fire Algorithm User Guide", "The size of the dataset was approximately 40mb. This is laughably small compared to the terabyte and petabyte-scale datasets Bigquery is capable of handling.", "I decided to copy all of the data into a project with a simple SQL statement.", "I needed to convert the latitude and longitude data (FLOATvalues) into a GEOGRAPHYdatatype. This was the only bit of preprocessing required to shape the data and make it ready for BigQuery Geo Viz. I scheduled the query to run every Monday and update the dataset with the latest data from NASA.", "BigQuery Geo Viz is a web tool for visualization of geospatial data in BigQuery using Google Maps APIs. You can run a SQL query and display the results on an interactive map. It\u2019s a lightweight tool and allows you to explore spatial data quickly and interactively. I cannot stress how painless it is. No configuration or loading of base maps.", "The query below loaded all the fires in the dataset which were detected with high confidence. I\u2019ve zoomed in on the East coast of Australia to provide a working example. The styling is strictly for example purposes only.", "Since the underlying base map is powered by Google Maps, there are a lot of rich textural features available to the user such as views that provide terrain and satellite information.", "There are some limitations to the tool which you should know.", "I found the last limitation incredibly disappointing and I hope the product team will make this available to GCP customers in the future.", "Looking beyond Australia, I wanted to see if there were fires burning in other parts of the world. At first glance, it appeared as if large parts of Central Africa and South East Asia were on fire. Surely this would have made the global news?", "I briefly looked this up online and the fires you see are very likely low-intensity agricultural fires. Farmers routinely set crop fields alight to burn off the leftover grasses and scrub plants. This burning helps maintain rich soils. I remember this from my time in Tanzania.", "False alarm? Perhaps, but we wouldn\u2019t know for sure as many parts of the world go unreported or under-reported.", "Your home for data science.
