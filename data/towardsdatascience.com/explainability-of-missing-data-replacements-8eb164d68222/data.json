There are a few common approaches to tackle this problem. Some of the popular methods include removing the instance with missing values, creating a separate category for missing elements, or using mean imputations. They are not necessarily effective, and there are other algorithms such as KNN, MICE, MissForest, or GANs which can impute missing values more accurately.", "During my research internship project, I have noticed that classifiers trained on datasets which were imputed with KNN, MICE, and MissForest, achieve higher accuracy, usually by 3-4%. That is a quite substantial accuracy gain and there are few existing Python libraries which implement those algorithms. Sounds like a way to go, right?", "Unfortunately, there is a trade-off between getting a higher accuracy and having explainable results. In this article, we will have a look at how missing data imputation affects the explainability of ML models. Part of my article will be based on this research paper [1]. Let\u2019s get started!", "What I love about Towards Data Science, is that it attracts many like-minded people who are passionate about AI and Data Science. That\u2019s why it would be great to connect with you on Linkedin!", "Keeping information about the missingness might be sometimes useful for the ML model. It can also make the model more explainable.", "Imagine a dataset with information about hospital patients, who were tested for an occurrence of a certain disease.", "Patient 3 wasn\u2019t diagnosed as sick. That is why the doctor decided not to do further lab tests for Symptom_A and Symptom_B. The missingness here has a meaning: Patient is not sick so other measurements are missing. Imputing values, as in the Figure below, for Patient 3 is wrong and it doesn\u2019t make sense.", "To retain information about missingness, it might be a good idea to one-hot encode data and add new features to indicate the occurrence of missing values, as below. (we should probably remove Symptom_A_No and Symptom_B_No to avoid dummy variable trap but let\u2019s keep it here for simplicity)", "We have to be careful and think before imputing datasets first. Does the imputation make sense? Will there be a significant information loss if we do so? If yes, in this case, it will be more difficult to explain the results of the ML model trained on this imputed data.", "The important thing to note that the accuracy of ML models, contrary to our intuition, might get a lower accuracy score if we keep information about missingness as another feature. This depends on the nature of estimator\u2019s algorithm and how they handle data during the train and test stage. It also the trade-off between explainability and accuracy that I have mentioned at the beginning of the article.", "Data can be missing in 3 different ways: MCAR (Missing Completely at Random), MAR (Missing at Random) and NMAR (Not Missing at Random). It is out of the scope of this article to explain all of them in detail (have a look at this article if you want to know more). Instead, I will focus on NMAR which has usually the most negative effect on the explainability.", "NMAR is a type of missingness where the missing data depends on the feature itself. For example, imagine a survey conducted in the USA people\u2019s income:", "Some survey participants didn\u2019t disclose their salary. However, we somehow got that data from a confidential source. The full (true) dataset, without missing values, looks as follows.", "Now we know why they didn\u2019t mention their salary! They simply earn more than most people and they probably didn\u2019t want to share that information with other people. That is exactly what NMAR is. The missingness of data is related to the feature itself. In this case, people whose income is above a certain threshold didn\u2019t disclose information about their income in the survey.", "The imputation of data can go really wrong in NMAR case. The problem is that imputation algorithms don\u2019t know what is the distribution of these missing values. They will assume that it is similar to the distribution of the whole dataset which is clearly wrong!", "Let\u2019s have a look at how a simple mean imputation handles this case:", "In the case of NMAR, the explainability of these imputations will suffer and the accuracy of the model can go down. As data scientists say: \u201cGarbage in, garbage out\u201d.", "Data imputation is a very important step in the machine learning pipeline because it affects the quality of data. There are different ways of how data imputation can make machine learning models less explainable. Sometimes, information about missing values should be preserved by creating an additional feature to indicate when values are missing. NMAR, the type of missingness of data, can make imputation less explainable and incorrect. It is also good to remember that more complicated imputation algorithms tend to impute data in a less explainable way which affects the explainability of the ML model.", "Your home for data science.
