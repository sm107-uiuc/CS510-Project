I want to probe you to think what if we want to compare the volatility of two or more data sets, is it feasible to do that right now with 2-number summary measures?", "The answer is we can\u2019t compare them without bringing the spread measure on the comparable scale (Standardize). This is what leads to the need for a Coefficient of Variation (CV) measure to identify which data set is more volatile relatively.", "*Coefficient of Variation has no units.", "Spread around a central tendency for a given dataset will not be comparable to another dataset\u2019s spread measure because the latter is being calculated with reference to its own central tendency. To bring them both on the same scale of comparison, division by their central tendency is performed and multiplication by 100 converts the measure in a percentage form. We will see an appropriate example of how Standard Deviation measures alone can be deceiving.", "Data set: Weekly stock price movement of 03 companies:", "Company 1\u2019s stock price is the most volatile as depicted by the CV of 31.94 % followed by company 2 and company 3.", "Looking at the standard deviation alone for all three companies and comparing will obviously lead to false interpretation. I hope now you have realized the importance of CV and its reliability when comparing the volatility among different datasets.", "What is \u2018Covariance\u2019 and why do we need it as a statistical measure?", "Whenever there is some information in the data which we are unable to capture using our previously discussed measures, a new measure is being discussed to capture the same. Aligning with the same approach we will first look at the data sets which will seem identical with previously discussed measures in hand but upon visualizing we will come across some patterns which shall be captured using additional statistical measures. This measure however will lead to the bivariate domain of statistics where two variables interact and show some pattern visually. So far we were dealing with the descriptive statistics of only one variable (Target Variable i.e. Heights, Stock Price) but now we will have extra variable/s that will try to explain the variation present in the Target Variable. Need and definition of Covariance shall be demonstrated below with an appropriate example:", "If we try to get the 2-number summary of the Target Variable(Y-axis) or Predictor Variable(X-axis) of both the datasets above, they will have identical (Same means and standard deviations) but it is clearly visible that both of them are distinct data sets. The slope factor comes into play when a variable is plotted against some other variable, the visible slope reflects the co-movement of both the variables as they increment.", "Let\u2019s take our target variable as Weight (Y-axis) for both datasets,", "Predictor Variables \u2014 Jogging speed (X-axis) for data set 1 and Height (X-axis) for data set 2.", "Time to see a 2-number summary of all three variables:", "Just by looking at the summary above, one might think both sets are exactly identical which is not true actually. Time for the covariance measure to pitch in, again it will be explained graphically.", "Assume 4 hypothetical humans having 3 attributes (Weight, Jogging Speed, and Height):", "-Top right quadrant will have points with a value of X & Y greater than X mean and Y mean", "-Top left quadrant will have points with a value of X less than X mean & Y greater than Y mean", "-Bottom left quadrant will have points with a value of X & Y less than X mean and Y mean", "-Bottom right quadrant will have points with a value of X greater than X mean & Y less than Y mean", "This means if we multiply the X & Y coordinates of a point after changing the reference of distance calculation from origin to their respective means, all the points in the top right quadrant will have positive values(+,+), top left quadrant will have negative values(-,+), bottom left quadrant will have positive values(-,-) and bottom right quadrant will have negative values(+,-).", "Now we shall compute the same for dataset 1:", "By now you may have got the idea as to why this measure is helpful in determining the direction of co-movement (negative sum of product value \u2014 downwards, positive-sum of product value \u2014 upwards). We will now compute the product value for dataset 2 as well to make things ultra-clear:", "One last thing before we can officially call this measure Covariance, we need to take the average of the sum of the product output by dividing it by the number of data points (N = 4 in this example, assumed as population). This also means that you can\u2019t calculate the covariance between two variables with different data points count. Units of Covariance(Cov) are the product of the units of the X & Y variable.", "Note \u2014 All the calculations done above are assuming data sets as population sets. The most discussed & debated topic related to the denominator of such measures i.e. why it is N-1 for the samples and why N for the population will be explained comprehensively in the upcoming blogs.", "Finally, the major confusion arises when people refer to these statistical measures using their short forms and end up confusing \u2018Cov\u2019 for \u2018Coefficient of Variation\u2019 and \u2018CV\u2019 for \u2018Covariance\u2019. The best way to overcome this is to remember that the short form of Covariance is it\u2019s stemmed version:", "This way you will never end up confusing the two distinct statistical measures.", "Ending this blog here, hoping the intended message has been conveyed and confusion associated with these two measures has been eliminated forever.", "Your home for data science.
