Even more obscure is how exactly to reach \u201cmathematical maturity\u201d. In this post, I want to share some insights I\u2019ve gained along my math-filled journey.", "Disclaimer: If you\u2019re in a class and you don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on, none of the below will help. Basic understanding is a hard prerequisite for mastery. Read the textbook, go to lecture (and pay attention). Start with the minimum, then strive for more.", "It might seem obvious, but you really do need lots of practice. Repeated exposure to the material helps ingrain the mechanical operations into your muscle memory. Practice also helps to eliminate simple algebraic mistakes that plague many students in middle and high school. Eliminating these mistakes is an early indicator of progress on the path to mathematical maturity. But simple practice is not a sufficient condition to deep conceptual understanding. The rest of these tips improve off of \u201cbrute-force\u201d practicing to encourage mindful practice that is more efficient and goes beyond the ability to replicate a series of mechanical steps.", "Brute-force problem solving seems quite daunting, because it suggests that excellence can only be obtained through thousands of hours of practice problems (10,000 hours perhaps?). Rather than simply treating problems as rote tasks to complete and move on, a much more intelligent and efficient manner of approaching problems is to constantly reflect during and after assignments, be they homework, in discussions, or on tests. Ask yourself, \u201cWhat was I thinking at this step?\u201d, \u201cWhy did I mess up on this problem?\u201d; ask of the problem \u201cWhat is this problem asking me to do?\u201d, \u201cWhat general approach will I use to solve this problem?\u201d, \u201cWhat pattern does this problem fit under?\u201d, \u201cWhat formulas do I need to solve this problem and how will I use them?\u201d", "A practical tip is to do everything once without solutions and then once with solutions. For homeworks, never look at solutions \u2014 the struggle of wrestling and grappling with a problem until it yields is where the true learning occurs. If you are really stuck, ask a friend for help. If they don\u2019t know, discuss approachs and ideas, roping in as many other friends as it takes until you figure it out. After exams (or homeworks where you didn\u2019t have answers available), go through the entire exam, redoing problems that you missed. If stuck, look at solutions and then write down the solution. Writing down the solution isn\u2019t the actual goal: what matters is understanding where you went wrong, which turn you missed, and why the right path is indeed correct. Writing this down is simply a method which tends to encourage this understanding, but copying alone will get you nowhere.", "This practice of ex post facto examination is very important and extremely underutilized. It takes significant discipline and a fair amount of \u201cunassigned\u201d work i.e. work that is not explicitly assigned or graded, but offers significant benefits. This is why classes should enforce or incentivize regrades for assignments, because it explicitly encourages students to go through this reflection and reevaluation exercise.", "After all this reflection and analysis, it is important to then reinforce the lessons you learn from your mistakes. How? By doing more practice and having more exposure to the same content. After each round of practice and reflection, you should hopefully see the number of mistakes diminish and the elimination of common mistakes over time. If not, then you are not actually applying what you learn \u2014 slow down before doing each problem and try to see if it matches other problems you\u2019ve seen before, so you know what the common pitfalls you fall into are.", "Even the most difficult high school problem will only require at most one (1) unique perspective and two (2) significant substitutions or steps. Once you identify these, all that remains is algebraic manipulation. The heavy-lifting can be done before a pencil is lifted; once the road ahead is clear, the rest is mechanics.", "This high-level approach is important because many times students get lost in the brush of the algebra and forget where they\u2019re trying to go. Understand what your goal/target is and identify the way forward \u2014 then step forward with confidence. If you can find the correct path at this stage, the problem is already solved. Even if you can\u2019t solve the problem at that current moment e.g. the problem is too complex, just the act of identifying the goal posts and thinking about possible steps is a good initialization to actually wrestling with the problem.", "Oftentimes, formulas are considered as rote memorization. But many of the formulas you come across can be derived from basic axioms. Being able to derive and prove statements helps to deepen intuition for why statements are true. It is also arguably more efficient than memorization, because if you ever forget the formula, you should be able to derive it back again. Of course, you also shouldn\u2019t memorize proofs, as that would defeat the whole purpose. Instead, just remembering the general array of \u2018tricks\u2019 and concepts used in a proof is sufficient. Indeed, having a good toolkit of algebraic \u2018tricks\u2019 is a valuable asset for problem solving because they often appear in many different contexts. Finally, practicing proof methods is essentially a subset of practice for problem solving in general.", "When doing problems, I encourage you to make sanity checks often throughout your work. For instance, if you\u2019re working with probability, make sure your probability is between 0 and 1; for calculus, do a few checks on the sign of your derivative, etc.", "A couple motivations exist for sanity checks. First, when using math in science, checking that the units of your final symbolic answer match the expected units is a good check on algebra and also gives you practice with converting units. Sanity checks also require a moderate conceptual understanding: you can\u2019t check your answer if you don\u2019t have an expectation for what it is supposed to be. Finally, sanity checks are also good ways to bring in tangential concepts and utilize them in your sanity checks, which is a good way to weave together concepts and see applications across different topics.", "Teaching is an excellent way to further your understanding. When teaching, you are confronted with not just your own questions about the topic, but by an entire class of students, who will see and misunderstand the problems in their own way.", "From an information theoretic perspective, teaching is intelligent information compression. Answering students questions requires you to clearly identify the point of misunderstanding, determining the right answer, and finding a succint and clear i.e. compressed manner to explain the answer. Being able to do this efficiently means you have found an efficient \u201clatent space\u201d representation or \u201cmanifold\u201d i.e. mastery over a concept.", "Finally, teaching is an inherently social activity. In the modern technological era, it is even more important to be able to communicate ideas clearly to others. Consider this as valuable practice to not only explain concepts clearly but also to motivate and inspire students who might not otherwise see the point of these exercises.", "In a related vein to visualization is the idea of abstraction. The ability to think abstractly, to rise above simple algebraic manipulations and visualize the direction of you want to go in a problem, is an inherent part of problem solving. How exactly do we abstract? By imposing modularity \u2014 specifically, by identiying the different components of each problem, how they relate to each other, and figuring out the plan of attack for each component separately.", "Once we see these different modular blocks/components of the whole problem, we can discriminate or segregate the problem with other problems we\u2019ve seen before that have the same blocks/components, except maybe in a slightly different configuration. Many problems simply permute which blocks are given or known and ask you to solve for the other components/blocks. This ability to discriminate a problem and say \u201cYou are really just a slightly different version of another problem I\u2019ve seen and done many times before\u201d allows you to take all your previously acquired knowledge and skill and throw it at this new problem, albeit in a slightly different manner.", "Hierarchical organization is really an ordered form of modularity, where the individuals modules are organized in order of complexity. Abstract concepts build up off of simpler concepts, where each layer of hierarchy is separated by barriers of abstraction. Learning to explicitly think in terms of hierarchy is an efficient way to built up conceptual understanding because much of math can be organized in such a manner.", "An explicit example of this hierarchical abstraction can be taken from linear algebra. The base layer of abstraction is vector-vector multiplication, matrix-vector multiplication, dot products, outer products. Next comes gaussian elimination techniques and basic matrix transformations such as inverse, transpose, and determinants. Note that at even this relatively low-level of hierarchy, there are complex connections and ways to intuitively understand inverses and determinants. Next comes vector spaces and eigenvector decomposition. And then various matrix factorization techniques, etc. Obviously barriers of abstraction are not as strong as in software development, but as an organization tool, still invaluable.", "Although mathematics is often referred to as the \u201cQueen of the Sciences\u201d, a more descriptive metaphor might be that the modern scientific method writes in the language of math. You will often find that the math taught in math classes are generally much more advanced than the math used in science classes. For example, high school mechanics is really just algebra and chemistry is even simpler than that. Nonetheless, this \u2018simpler\u2019 math is enriched because the variables and functions are imbued with real world meaning and implications.", "Personally, I\u2019ve taken various engineering classes and done well in them, not because I had previous knowledge or because I necessarily worked harder than anyone or because of some innate talent, but because I had honed my ability to understand formulas, equations, functions \u2014 the language of science. Science is really a contextual wrapper around the language of math; suddenly variables have units and meaning associated behind them. The characteristics of a function have significant real world meaning and the final result says something fundamental about the world around us. The fact that an answer has a positive or negative slope, that the order of magnitude is less than 1, these mathematical properties suddenly have great physical meaning. But these insights are not available to us if we don\u2019t have a solid grasp of the language they are written in, which is why mathematical maturity is important, not just for mathematicians, but also for scientists and engineers.", "A lot of the approachs discussed here are really quite general. The idea of abstraction, modularization, and discrimination is based off my experience with software design, but the problem solving approach is quite general. In life, we can approach problems as finding patterns in methods and approachs.", "Even non-technical fields, such as argumentative/persuasive writing, philosophy, and debating also require this similar modularity in thinking, but in a slightly \u2018looser\u2019 way. I don\u2019t mean this in a negative way \u2014 in fact, I find this kind of thinking to be even more difficult. The parallel between solving a problem and making a good argument is interesting, but unfortunately requires another post to explore.", "So how are the tips that I give above different from general problem-solving themes? I would argue that the primary differentiator is the rapid and concrete feedback loop in mathematics \u2014 you can easily verify that your work and your answer is correct. This is not true of philosophy, or in many fields of science, or in writing, or in fixing a toilet (although arguably there are parallels with computer science, the main difference being that good software engineering and syntax is not inherently obvious and requires teaching).", "Hopefully this post has served as a roadmap or at least a valuable tool to inspire more mindful practice the next time you sit down to do your math homework. And many of these principles are quite general, applicable to any problem you find yourself having to encounter often.", "\u201cMathematics is the cheapest science.
