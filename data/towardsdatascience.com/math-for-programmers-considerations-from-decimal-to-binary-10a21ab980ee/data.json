Also, why computer use binary."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["It is well known that binary numbers are the basis of the classic computer world that is built by John von Neumann. Yes, when I say the classic computer, it is the device you\u2019re using at the moment unless you\u2019re working as a researcher in the quantum computing area.", "What are the considerations between the two different number systems? And why binary is used but not decimal? It is not difficult but important as the basic knowledge of computer science. In this article, I\u2019ll share some considerations about decimal and binary number systems.", "I still remember when I was a kid, the teacher starts to teach us some numbers larger than 10. When she mentioned 11, I wrote down \u201c101\u201d on my paper and thought that would be correct. Unlike \u201cten\u201d and \u201cone\u201d that is different from \u201celeven\u201d in English, in my mother tongue, the pronunciation of 10 followed by the pronunciation of 1 is exactly how to say 11.", "After that lesson, I realised that the digit at a certain place has its own meanings strictly :) However, if we\u2019re using the Roman Numbers, writing the ten \u201cX\u201d followed by one \u201cI\u201d is exactly 11 -> \u201cXI\u201d.", "Of course, the place of the digits plays an important role in Arabic Numbers. In the decimal number system, we have 10 different numbers that are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.", "Consider the number 3105 shown above, it can be written into the form as follows.", "You must have already found the patterns:", "Therefore, we can use the exponents of 10 to re-write every decimal number, and they must follow the patterns as above shown.", "Then, how about the binary number system?", "Do you still remember we have 10 different digits in the decimal number system? In the binary number system, we have only two numbers: 0 and 1.", "Similarly, we can also re-write a binary number using the same technique, following a similar pattern, but not exactly.", "The differences in the binary number are shown above in bold text.", "By knowing such, we can convert a binary number into decimal using the pattern we have found. For example, we want to convert the 3105 from a decimal number to binary. We can firstly prepare a list of exponents of 2 as follows.", "Then, we can select the maximum number that is smaller than closest to the number we want to convert. 4096 is larger than 3105, so we have to select 2\u00b9\u00b9 which is 2048.", "So, we have selected 2\u00b9\u00b9, 2\u00b9\u2070, 2\u2075 and 2\u2070. Recall that the exponents 11, 10, 5 and 0 mean the places, so we just need to right 1 on these places and 0 for the other places.", "There is an easy way if you don\u2019t want to prepare a list of exponents or the number is too large. The method below can decide 1 digital by each time you divide the number by 2.", "Every time we divide the number by 2, the reminder has to be either 0 or 1. The reverse of the reminders will be the binary number converted from the decimal number.", "To understand why the binary number system is used in computer systems but not decimal, we need to start from the number of types of digits we need.", "As above-mentioned, the decimal number system needs 10 different digits to express a number. In other words, there are 10 different possibilities for each place. However, in the binary number system, we just need 2.", "Suppose that you got a switch, it is very easy to have two different statuses: On and Off. Yes, that\u2019s how we express 1 and 0 in the computer world. Is that possible to design such a switch that can have 10 different statuses? Well, I\u2019m not an electronic engineer. I would say it might be possible but the complexity gonna be much higher.", "Let\u2019s use the addition operation as an example because it is the basis of others such as multiplication. In the binary system, the addition table is as follows.", "However, if insist to use the decimal number system, we have to let the CPU to understand the addition table as follows.", "Are there any drawbacks for the binary number system? Of course, think about the number 3105 we\u2019ve just converted into a binary number, which is 110000100001. Suppose you and me, all of us can read binary numbers, we need to write 12 digits to express such a number. When you want to tell me the number three thousand one hundred and five, you have to say one one zero zero zero zero one zero zero zero zero one. I don\u2019t think I can follow\u2026", "Therefore, the drawback of a binary number is that it has to use too many digits to express a number that is not that large.", "However, this drawback is not for computer. No matter how many digits we have, they will just be stored in the CPU cache. So, computers do not care how many digits there are. On the contrary, they are not good at dealing with too many rules, such as the addition tables above-shown. Therefore, the binary system becomes a perfect option for computers.", "In this article, I have explained the different number systems in my understanding, decimal and binary. Our humans use decimal because it has more types of digits, but we don\u2019t have to use too many digits to express a number. Also, we all have 10 fingers which are intuitively used for counting. In other words, decimal has an almost perfect balance between the number of digits and the number of types of digits. Computers use the binary system because they do not need such a balance. Instead, they need as few rules as possible, and they do not care about the number of digits. Therefore, binary is on the extreme side of \u201cfewer rules\u201d and become the perfect choice for computers.", "If you feel my articles are helpful, please consider joining Medium Membership to support me and thousands of other writers!
