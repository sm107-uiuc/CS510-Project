The decoder takes the encoded data from the encoder as an input along with the start-of-string <START> token as the initial input to produce an output sequence.", "Here the source sequence is a sentence in Hindi, and the target sequence is generated in English. You don\u2019t want any random English translation, but you would like the best and most likely words to be selected for the translation that matches the meaning of the Hindi sentence.", "I have examples in Hindi as that is the other language other than English that I know.", "How do you select the best and most likely words for the target sequence?", "A simple approach would be to have a vocabulary of words in the target language, say 10,000 words then, based on the source sentence, get a probability for each of the 10,000 target words.", "There could be multiple likely translations of the source sentence in the target language.", "Should you pick any translation randomly?", "Our goal is to pick the best and most likely translated word, so we choose the target word with the maximum probability based on the source sentence.", "Should you pick only one best translation?", "Greedy Search algorithm selects one best candidate as an input sequence for each time step. Choosing just one best candidate might be suitable for the current time step, but when we construct the full sentence, it may be a sub-optimal choice.", "The beam search algorithm selects multiple alternatives for an input sequence at each timestep based on conditional probability. The number of multiple alternatives depends on a parameter called Beam Width B. At each time step, the beam search selects B number of best alternatives with the highest probability as the most likely possible choices for the time step.", "Let\u2019s take an example to understand this.", "We will select the beam width =3; our vocabulary of English words is 10,000.", "Step 1:Find the top 3 words with the highest probability given the input sentence. The number of most likely words are based on the beam width", "Greedy Search will always consider only one best alternative.", "Step 2: Find the three best pairs for the first and second words based on conditional probability", "Step 3: Find the three best pairs for the first, second and third word based on the input sentence and the chosen first and the second word", "We continue this process, and we pick three sentences with the highest probability. The top 3 sentences can vary in length or maybe the same length.", "We finally pick the output of the decoder as the sentence with the highest probability", "Will a higher value for the beam width give a better translation?", "A higher beam width will give a better translation but would use a lot of memory and computational power.", "When we had a beamwidth of 3 and 10,000-word vocabulary, we evaluated 30,000 combinations at each time step, created three instances of the encoder-decoder, and max sentence length was 9. Creating multiple copies of encoder-decoder and calculating conditional probabilities for 30,000 words at each time step needs lots of memory and computation power.", "A lower beam width will result in more inferior quality translation but will be fast and efficient in terms of memory usage and computational power", "Beam search is the most popular search strategy for the sequence to sequence Deep NLP algorithms like Neural Machine Translation, Image captioning, Chatbots, etc.", "Beam search considers multiple best options based on beamwidth using conditional probability, which is better than the sub-optimal Greedy search.", "Your home for data science.
