Successful testing requires accurate assumptions (response rates, anticipated difference between variants) along with finely tuned execution parameters (audience size, test/control split, test iterations and timing).", "The test design phase is arguably the most critical and requires timely collaboration between marketing strategists, statisticians, data analysts and operations experts to agree on the right parameters for successful execution. This article details an easy-to-implement approach to accelerate this design phase and get all key stakeholders aligned. In this post we\u2019ll cover:", "1. Functions to calculate test power and effect size", "2. Visualizations to lay out all possible design options", "This approach increases the speed and ease of effect size calculations across any number of scenarios, allowing marketing strategists to quickly rule out doomed test designs and hone in on the right parameters to maximize the chances of a successful test.", "Formally speaking, A/B testing is used compare two or more versions of a single variable. Recent work with a large retailer lead our team to employ A/B testing to compare the effectiveness of different email campaigns at bringing existing customers back into the store. Our goal was to make each campaign as personalized as possible to the desired audience (and as always to execute quickly). For example, we may want to target 20\u201330 year old men who bought their first suit in the last 3 months and compare an offer for tailoring services against a discount on dress shoes. We need to put this test into market quickly because the holiday season is fast approaching, and we have a backlog of additional test ideas lined up as soon as this one is done.", "While the marketing strategists are ideating on creative content, the objective of the data scientist is to assess whether or not the proposed test has a good chance of yielding a detectable difference between A and B. If the design is unlikely to yield a result, the whole team needs to quickly pivot to a different design and the assessment will begin again.", "A number of factors make the design phase a complicated task for the data scientist:", "1 Each test is designed for customers who exhibit very specific behaviors, so we are constantly hamstrung by small audience sizes", "2 With highly personalized tests, there is a large variability in baseline response rates based on unique customer cohorts", "3 Tests often carry additional costs of implementation (e.g. promotions) which means we need the right test and control group split", "4 The agile framework is designed to launch multiple tests per week, meaning limited time for design", "Now, many great resources are available for determining the audience size or the effect size needed given specific input values (for example: https://www.evanmiller.org/ab-testing/sample-size.html). However, plugging in 30 combinations of inputs into these calculators and comparing results is cumbersome at best (and executives don\u2019t want to watch you plug-and-chug on a conference call).", "To make the design phase easier for everyone, we came up with a process to see how big of a difference in response rate between A and B we would need to confidently confirm or reject a test hypothesis under any number of input scenarios.", "The main inputs we need to assess a potential design are simple:", "1. Audience size: The customers who qualify for the test (e.g. 20\u201330 year old men who just bought a suit)", "2. Test proportion: The split between Test and Control groups (Test receives A content, control receives B)", "3. Baseline response: The historical response rate (e.g. the typical rate at which customers purchase) measured as a probability between 0 and 1", "Our test design assessment should quantify the difference between A and B needed in order to confirm or reject our test hypothesis that one version works better than the other.", "Let\u2019s continue with the suits example. We want to promote a new tailoring service in our store, so we define our hypothesis that a 15% off promotion for services will cause more customers to use the tailoring service than a purely informational email promoting the service. The test group will get the 15% off promotion while the control will get a standard email informing them about tailoring.", "Audience Size: Our ideal target audience is the 10,000 customers who bought a suit as their only purchase in the past year. If needed, we could loosen our criteria to include the additional 10,000 customers who bought a suit and shoes in the past year, or even the additional 55,000 customers who bought dress shirts but did not buy a suit. So for our assessment, we\u2019ll look at audience sizes ranging from 10k to 75k.", "Test Proportion: The test campaign includes a 15% off promotion which decreases profit margin, so we favor an unbalanced test to minimize the number of customers receiving the test promotional content as much as possible. For our assessment we\u2019ll look at a full range of splits: 10/90, 20/80, 30/70, 40/60, and 50/50.", "Baseline Response: Finally, we know the general baseline response rate is 12% for existing shoppers to use similar services. While we know that promotions generally increase response rates by 1\u20133 percentage points, we want to be conservative with this test because the tailoring service is new, so we\u2019ll leave this constant at 12%.", "Effect size calculation: Since our test is comparing two probabilities (our response variable will range between 0 and 1), we need to use a two proportion test design. We use Cohen\u2019s h formula for effect size since we\u2019re comparing differences between two proportions (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cohen%27s_h). Because our test/control split may not be 50/50, our test is considered unbalanced. Note that we\u2019re using a power of 80%. Because the cost of sending an email is negligible, we can afford to have more room for error than the standard 90% or 95% thresholds.", "The first function uses the pwr package in R to calculate the effect size needed to test our hypothesis. The second function solves the effect size formula for the required test response rate needed to confirm or reject our hypothesis.", "Note: this approach accommodates variability in the primary effect size parameters of audience size, test proportion, and baseline response rate and is built for two-proportion, unbalanced tests. Other test types, such as comparison of a continuous outcome, have not been explored here, but could be accommodated within the same framework.", "Now we set our input parameters and apply the functions. Adjust these based on the test design options.", "Now we have a clean table showing the test audience size (test_n), along with the percentage lift over the baseline response rate needed in order to confirm or reject the hypothesis (lift_needed). This is technically all the info we need, but no one likes to read a boring old table\u2026", "Using ggplot and plotly visualization packages, we can create an illustration of all the test options with interactivity to let us hover over different options to see all the pertinent details.", "Looking at the resulting plot, we can quickly see the pros and cons of each design option. Using the 10,000 suit-only shoppers, our campaign would need to drive at least a 9% lift with a 50/50 test and control split. That type of lift is unlikely given our knowledge of past campaigns, and because of the promotional offer we would much rather limit the test recipients to less than 50% of the audience. Because of that, we might suggest relaxing the audience criteria to include the additional 65,000 suit + shoes and dress shirt shoppers to reach a 75,000 audience size with a 20/80 test and control split, where we need a much more reasonable 5% lift to confirm or reject the hypothesis.", "We have just looked at an example using specific audience sizes based on three initial sets of criteria. But what if we go a step further and see how the required lift changes across a broad range of audience sizes and varying baseline rates? We can adjust the inputs and see. Note for this exercise we\u2019ll hold the test proportion constant at a 50/50 split.", "As expected, the smaller the baseline rate, the higher the amount of lift you would need to see to detect a difference. What\u2019s interesting for the marketing strategist is the non-linear relationship between audience size and lift required. This relationship is important to consider when designing extremely personalized campaigns targeting small audiences. For example, with a baseline response rate of 10% and an audience of 1,000 customers, you would need to see at least a 34% lift to confirm your hypothesis. However, increasing that audience by 5,000 customers reduces the lift needed to 13%. With the same 10% baseline and 20,000 customers in your audience, you would need a 7% lift and the benefit of an additional 5,000 customers is a relatively small difference of 0.7 percentage points.", "This article lays out an approach for A/B test design that accelerates sample and effect size calculations across any number of design scenarios and provides an interactive visual of all possible designs. This approach greatly increased the speed at which our test and learn team can rule out doomed test designs and hone in on the right parameters to maximize the chances of a successful test.", "Your home for data science.
