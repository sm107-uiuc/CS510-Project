As a Data Analyst, I use SAS and SQL on a daily basis but don\u2019t currently use the far superior R - which is great for visualisation, more advanced statistical analysis and machine learning. Given the desire to improve the aforementioned skills, I\u2019ve decided R is a good place to start in order to achieve my goals.", "As there\u2019s no time like the present (quite literally at the moment), I\u2019m going to get stuck in!", "First off - what to analyse? Sure, I could find something online, there are plenty of interesting Covid-19 data sets flying about to get started with. However, for me, when learning something new it\u2019s good to have some degree of familiarity so the task at hand seems less daunting. In this case, that familiarity took the form of my data set; an export of the last 5 years of my Strava activity. That\u2019s 355 runs, 7 cycles and 3 swims (any guesses on my preferred discipline? Should probably pick up the other two a bit if I\u2019m to complete my Triathlon this year!). It\u2019s important for me to use my own dataset because if I make a mistake, I\u2019m far more likely to be able to spot it if I know and understand the data. Clearly this isn\u2019t always going to be the case when dealing with huge data sets, but it\u2019s a good place to start whilst I\u2019m a complete R Novice.", "Whilst I would normally like to set objectives for what I\u2019m trying to achieve with the data (in order to provide clarity and direction), in this case I\u2019ve gone off piste and whilst I get familiar with R, my main aim is simply to understand the programme better whilst *hopefully* pulling out some interesting insights.", "As I\u2019ve never used R before I did some searching on Google for beginners Tutorials. I found this Introduction to R and R Studio really useful and easy to follow. Rather than using the sample dataset like the rest of the class, I followed with my own data and just applied my own variables and fields to the functions instead of the given ones from the tutor. This was a great place to start to get comfortable with R, and after a couple of hours learning the basics I felt ready to start building my own insights.", "Full disclosure, I am definitely still getting to grips with R but wanted to share my thoughts and findings with the plots I have managed to create thus far.", "The first graph I managed to create was this Histogram. This was relatively easy to do (code below image), but it does a nice job of showing the frequency of my activities that fall within each bin. As you can see, the vast majority of my activities are 5km.", "I then moved onto the scatter plot which took me a while, mainly because I was dealing with dates and this proved to be a massive pain. My CSV download from Strava generated the Activity Date as a date with a timestamp, formatted as \u2018Jan 01, 2016, 07:30:00\u2019 and was passed into R as a character. You would think it would be straight forward to convert to a date class, but because of the timestamp at the end this unfortunately was not so simple. After having tried to work out how to do this for a couple of hours, I was really close to giving up and changing the raw data in Excel instead which would have probably been much quicker. However, I persisted and got there in the end using the \u2018mutate\u2019 function. I\u2019m not sure if I overcomplicated this - I think time series data is notoriously difficult to work with in most programmes - but would welcome any thoughts on the best way to go about this.", "I like the output of this plot. It\u2019s a great way of showing how my behaviour has changed over the years. This graph quite clearly shows that from 2018 onwards (roughly when I first got my Garmin) my activity frequency increases significantly. You can see that a considerable number of the activities sit around the 5km mark. You can also see that from mid 2019, swim and rides start to appear on the chart (just after I entered my Triathlon!).", "The Box and Whisker plot. Again this was not too difficult (thanks to the abundance of forums, websites and posts on Stack overflow). I could spend a while messing around with colours and formatting but in the interest of time I abstained. I found this website useful for colour options.", "What you can see here is that the swim box plot is comparatively short compared to running (albeit there are only a handful of swims in the dataset). This suggests that my swims are of a similar distance whereas my runs vary in distance more widely.", "The interquartile range of my runs (the middle 50% of the data) sits between 5 and 7km. That means that 50% of the runs I\u2019ve done are between 5\u20137km.", "I wanted to group my data to see trends by month and year. I initially thought it would be difficult to sum my daily distance by month but was pleasantly surprised that this was reasonably straight forward.", "This is a nice chart to quickly pull out insights and tell a story with. I can see a decrease in my activity from the beginning of 2019, particularly in February when I was injured. I can also see a huge spike in the sum of my distances for March 2020, when we were told to work from home and went into lockdown, meaning more time and need to exercise. I exported this data at the beginning of April, but I imagine that April\u2019s bar will be even higher than March\u2019s by the end of the month, as running has been one of my primary sources of solace throughout lockdown.", "It\u2019s also interesting to see how each July my activity drops off significantly. This was a bit of a surprise at first but when I think about it, it makes sense. For one, it\u2019s my Birthday in July, secondly, for the last three consecutive years (2017\u201319) I\u2019ve been a Bridesmaid for my sister and two of my best friends Wedding\u2019s in July and plus it\u2019s (sometimes) hot and I\u2019m more likely to want to be outside with a Gin and Tonic than running long distances. All these factors mean running can and has taken a back seat (quite rightly). However, I bet if I plotted the count of activities (rather than the distance) it wouldn\u2019t look quite so different. I imagine it\u2019s less that I am not running as frequently, but more that I am running shorter distances (I mean, who wants to do a 15km run when its 25 degrees and there\u2019s fun to be had with family and friends? Not me).", "I\u2019ve focused mainly on distances here but there\u2019s so much more that can be done. I think next I\u2019ll be looking into the speed of of my runs and how this varies by time of day, season, year etc. For example, I could look into whether I\u2019m more likely to run faster in the morning, afternoon or evening and whether this is significant.", "It\u2019s been challenging but I\u2019ve really enjoyed getting started with R and I\u2019m looking forward to doing more sophisticated analysis with it soon.", "Your home for data science.
