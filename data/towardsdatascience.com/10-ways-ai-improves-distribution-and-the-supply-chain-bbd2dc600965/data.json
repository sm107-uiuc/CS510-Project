A McKinsey study of more than 2,000 participants found that 58% of respondents use AI in at least one process. This impressive adoption rate isn\u2019t baseless, either, as AI can improve areas like supply chain management in several ways.", "Logistics is a fast-moving and essential industry, one that many other sectors rely on to function. As such, it stands to benefit from thorough and timely data analytics. AI makes this possible.", "Some AI technologies have already seen widespread adoption in logistics, while some are just now emerging. Here are 10 ways AI is and can improve the supply chain.", "Data analytics are essential to the modern supply chain. Logistics companies need to analyze vast amounts of information to find inefficiencies and potential ways to improve. This process doesn\u2019t require AI, but it does it much faster.", "Combing through information manually to make insightful connections can take a lot of time. In a business as time-sensitive as logistics, that can be a problem. Since AI systems can analyze multiple data sets at once, they can give supply chains results in a fraction of the time.", "Managing inventory is often not as straightforward as you might think. If a warehouse incorrectly estimates future demand, it could end up with too little or too much of a product. Either case could represent a substantial monetary loss, but AI provides a solution.", "Through predictive analytics, AI systems can use past trends and market signals to forecast demand. Warehouse managers can use them to see what they need to store more or less of. They could then avoid surplus and deficit, maintaining a consistently prepared operation.", "Amazon uses AI at nearly every level of its supply chain, but especially in the warehouse. Its AI predictions about customer demands are part of how it manages to stay on top of the e-commerce industry. It helps it fill orders faster than most, if not all, of its competitors.", "Amazon uses AI at nearly every level of its supply chain, but especially in the warehouse. Its AI predictions about customer demands are part of how it manages to stay on top of the e-commerce industry. It helps it fill orders faster than most, if not all, of its competitors.", "Generally speaking, AI systems are often better at data-heavy, monotonous work than humans. Assigning such tasks to AI doesn\u2019t just save time, but it also saves money. When AI take care of these administrative jobs, it frees human employees to work on other projects at the same time.", "Tasks like filing paperwork manually can cost businesses 6,500 hours a year, a substantial time loss. Imagine everything a company could accomplish with more than 6,000 additional hours to work. This productivity advantage is too beneficial for logistics businesses to ignore.", "Many companies use technologies like RFID tags to track products through the supply chain. Sometimes, though, items ship without these tags or events cause them to be unreadable. By using AI, businesses can still offer shipment updates to customers.", "When tracking technology fails, AI can calculate delivery so companies can still provide an estimate. These programs can analyze things like average shipment times and weather patterns to offer accurate results. Supply chains can then understand their progress and maintain customer satisfaction.", "Countless other factors affect how efficiently the supply chain runs, but a poorly managed warehouse hinders success from the beginning. Despite this urgency, only 20\u201330% of warehouses are running as effectively as they can. Using AI to manage operations can help.", "Automated warehouse management systems (WMSs) can find inefficiencies through data analytics. Since AI is often better at making insightful connections between data points, this can eliminate human errors in management. Small changes across the board can lead to a substantial increase in efficiency.", "Supply chains need to make the most of their shipping to deliver products on time. Often, this means planning the fastest, safest way to get from point A to point B. In yet another application of predictive analytics, AI is ideal for this job, too.", "AI systems can look at traffic patterns and weather to determine what the best course of action is. Since factors like this are dynamic, the optimal route may change from day to day. As a result, supply chains need tools like AI that can analyze data and plan routes quickly.", "UPS has used a system called ORION to optimize its routes since 2012. Since then, this AI has saved the company 100 million miles and 10 million gallons of fuel per year.", "UPS has used a system called ORION to optimize its routes since 2012. Since then, this AI has saved the company 100 million miles and 10 million gallons of fuel per year.", "Supply chain management isn\u2019t just about ensuring products arrive on time. Logistics companies also need to ensure that goods arrive undamaged and unspoiled, which can be challenging with some items. AI can determine the lifespan and risk factors for sensitive products, helping businesses ensure their quality.", "If there are any unforeseen delays, AI systems can determine if they need to readjust routes to protect some products. If a shipment contains food or plants, they may need to change their path to deliver those first. Without AI, companies may not know to make these changes on the fly.", "Selecting the right product supplier can be a gamble for some supply chain managers. If they can\u2019t deliver consistent quality or are prone to scandal and ethical issues, it could harm logistics companies\u2019 public image. With the help of AI, though, they can get a better understanding of each business\u2019s history and potential risks.", "AI systems can determine if going into business with a company would be a financial or PR risk. Supply chains can then make informed decisions about supplier selection.", "One of AI\u2019s most common applications is in chatbots, most often in customer support roles. Roughly 40% of American consumers have engaged with a chatbot in the past year. They enable supply chains can provide customer support around the clock.", "By handling customer engagement with AI, logistics companies free their human employees to focus on other tasks. Not only does customer support improve, but so does overall efficiency. These AI make information more readily available to customers, too.", "DHL allows customers to check their order status with Alexa, giving them quick, reliable answers. On top of being a fast, hands-free gateway to information, smart speakers are already present in many homes. People used to using these technologies will appreciate being able to learn about their orders through them.", "These AI make information more readily available to customers, too.", "DHL allows customers to check their order status with Alexa, giving them quick, reliable answers. On top of being a fast, hands-free gateway to information, smart speakers are already present in many homes. People used to using these technologies will appreciate being able to learn about their orders through them.", "As AI technology improves, it will eventually enable fully autonomous shipping. AI is the key to self-driving vehicles, and driverless delivery would improve shipping times. Self-driving trucks don\u2019t need to stop to rest, so they can drive longer stretches in less time.", "This technology isn\u2019t available yet, but researchers are getting closer. It will improve with further AI adoption, leading to faster development and implementation.", "Fully autonomous shipping may not be a reality right now, but several companies are working on it. In 2017, Rolls-Royce partnered with Google to develop self-driving cargo ships. While the technology isn\u2019t available yet, it will improve with further AI adoption, leading to faster development and implementation.", "Data-centric supply chain management is essential to improving the logistics industry. AI comes hand-in-hand with that, as it allows companies to use data to its full potential. As AI sees wider adoption in this sector, the industry will continue to improve.", "The supply chain is the backbone of many industries.
