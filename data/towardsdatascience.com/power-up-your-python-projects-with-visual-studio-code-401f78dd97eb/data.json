But what about for people doing data science who aren\u2019t deploying to PyPI or conda-forge?", "If you\u2019ve been using Python for any length of time, you\u2019ve had the frustration of a cluttered development environment with too many packages installed. You don\u2019t need them all at one time, and trying to figure out which ones are necessary for your project is frustrating to do by hand.", "Packages don\u2019t always get upgraded at the same time, and many are not compatible with each other or even with the version of Python or Anaconda that you\u2019re running. Packages from the different channels within conda aren\u2019t even guaranteed not to conflict. If you\u2019re downloading everything into the same big environment, it\u2019s inevitable that you\u2019ll end up with inconsistent dependencies, and things will break.", "Not to mention the various tools like pip, pipx, conda, poetry, hatch, pipenv, pyenv, virtualenv, pyvenv, pyenv-virtualenv, virtualenvwrapper, pyenv-virtualenvwrapper, and venv\u2026 which, despite sounding very much alike, often aren\u2019t even compatible with each other.", "Further reason not to use anaconda outside of a container \u2014 you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re running. In some bizarre cases, anaconda\u2019s activation script so badly mangles the system\u2019s environment pre-pyenv cleanup that the only quick way to fix the problem is to prepend HOST=$(hostname) to the .zshrc.", "Python has a fantastic open source community, but that also means a proliferation of tools and methods for everything.", "If you provide the exact versions of the libraries that you used in your scientific analysis, your results will be more verifiable. In fact, this dependency management can play a vital role in accountability and accuracy. Sometimes, errors in Python packages have been shown to be the root cause of computational errors in statistical models. It\u2019s important to be able to trace whether you\u2019ve used the erroneous packages so that you can verify or correct your results when necessary.", "Being able to freeze your requirements \u2014 and only those packages that are really requirements \u2014 for a given project, and provide it as an environment file for future reference, makes you a better collaborator and a better scientist. You\u2019ll know exactly what your models used, when, and why.", "I\u2019ve written a (totally not comprehensive, guaranteed to break) guide to setting up your system with pyenv and pyenv-virtualenv here. It\u2019s my favorite way to manage multiple installations, though because it\u2019s:", "If you don\u2019t want to read the whole thing, I\u2019ve distilled it into a cheat sheet here:", "I also use Arq Cloud Backup, which works similarly to git, and is pretty cheap and nearly automated, to protect important files before setting up a new system with this method. For Zotero, dotfiles, and smaller files I want more direct access to, I use Sync (essentially an end-to-end encrypted, GDPR-compliant Dropbox).", "Once you have your pyenv installation set up, you create some really cool workflows for data science development in virtual environments. Let\u2019s walk through creating a project with an Anaconda distribution to see how you can use Visual Studio Code to develop Jupyter notebooks and convert them to .py scripts.", "You should have a directory for every project, and a virtual environment for every directory. This structure does two important things:", "Here\u2019s the TL;DR version of project setup:", "If you run the one-liner below every time you create a new project, you should be able to cd in and out of directories and have your virtual environments automatically activate and deactivate. (Of course, you\u2019ll need to change the environment name and Python interpreter.)", "Here\u2019s a GitHub gist with a script that will do it for you. Download it (you may need to run chmod +x newproj.sh to make sure it\u2019s executable). Then just use it to create new projects by passing it the python version you want to use and the name of your project:", "Visual Studio Code can do a lot of cool tricks. For one, it can automatically select the right virtual interpreter for your project directory, if you set things up according to the instructions above.", "To get started, brew cask install visual-studio-code.", "Then, go into VS Code\u2019s settings:", "You\u2019ll notice that when you cd in and out of project directories in the integrated terminal, the python interpreter will automatically detect your venvs, as long as there is a .python-version file present (which there should be, if you used pyenv-virtualenv correctly).", "You can also explicitly tell the app which Python interpreter to use by clicking on the name of the Python interpreter in the bottom toolbar or by opening the command palette and typing Python: Select Interpreter.", "Because we\u2019re in a terminal, we can also create and activate new venvs as we normally do from here.", "To use notebooks, just open an .ipynb file or select Python: Create New Blank Jupyter Notebook from the command palette while inside a conda environment. You can then run cells and create notebooks as normal, but with the added benefit that you\u2019re not dependent on your web browser.", "You can also quickly convert a notebook to a Python script with one click, or with Python: Convert to python script:", "This is really handy for turning exploratory analyses into runnable, reproducible programs.", "Now, when you start a project, you\u2019ll be able to control the packages in your development environment, turn your conda envs into requirements.txt files with ease, and clean up your notebooks into production-worthy scripts much more efficiently. VS Code offers even more tools, like syntax highlighting, code linting, test integration, and interfaces with GitHub, Docker, various databases, and more, to power up your projects. Add these tools to your data science workflow to be a more effective programmer and developer.", "Your home for data science.
