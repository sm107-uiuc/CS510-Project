Not necessarily drinking it but using it. Just like with everything else we possess in abundance, we usually don\u2019t think about water. And yet it\u2019s ubiquitous and essential in our lives. We literally need it to live, we need it for other basic sanitary needs and of course we need it for cooking & washing. Yet on the other hand we are acutely aware of droughts and water shortages which are even predicted to be among the chief causes for future wars. So a discussion seems to be in order about the issue of water usage. Given that we use water freely on a daily basis, do we need to reconsider our habits for the sake of the environment? Not to give too much away but saving water can be considerably advantageous for the environment \u2014 even though the places where you can save water may be different from what you might expect. And there\u2019s even a financial benefit for you in saving water in some ways. But before we go into the payoff, we first need to have a look at how we actually use water, both directly as well as indirectly.", "The average person in an average European country such as the UK directly uses around 150 liters of water per day in their household while the numbers are significantly higher for countries such as Australia or the US. This may not sound like much but in Europe household water usage accounted for 18% of total water usage. It\u2019s especially noteworthy if you consider that 150 liters is about three times as much as is estimated to be required for basic human needs. The relative proportions on what people spend this water on in their household vary but roughly a quarter is taken up by showers, toilet flushes and kitchen stuff, respectively. Other items for instance include washing clothes & irrigation. Contrast this with poor countries such as Rwanda or Haiti, where people only have two to 15 liters of water per person per day at their disposal. Not even a tenth of our daily water consumption!", "There are a couple of trends to unpack here regarding water usage. First and quite obvious: the richer a country, the higher the daily water usage per person on average. You can clearly observe this in the increasing water consumption after World War II. All these fancy water-using appliances from the humble flushing toilet to dishwashers and swimming pools are expensive by global standards. Another observable trend is that water usage per person decreases with the size of the household (all else being equal). Contrast a single individual washing their three shirts and one pair of jeans in a half-empty washing machine with a family properly loading up their washing machine and you can easily see why this is the case. A lot of our water usage scales quite well (though of course items such as toilet use don\u2019t scale better in households than for single persons). The last trend in direct water usage is technology. Fortunately, technology progresses and so do our household appliances. In general, this leads to more efficient versions of dishwashers, toilets, etc. which use less water (especially in recent eco-friendly years). The exception of course pertains to qualitatively new technology (such as the invention of the first flushing toilet which initially presumably increased water usage) which in the beginning requires further tweaking to arrive at their energy- and water-efficient state.", "Given these trends, what dominates household water usage? Overall, it seems to be wealth. Though there have been periods, especially recently, in which water consumption has risen at a slower rate or has even decreased. So are there possibilities to save water? Absolutely. For reasons we will go into in the next section reducing direct water usage doesn\u2019t do much for the environment. But it certainly can help in saving you some money! The obvious first steps are of course showering instead of bathing & turning off the water when brushing your teeth. Slightly less obvious, in the UK around 75% of households routinely boil more water than they need to, which translates to about 68 million pounds of unnecessary expenses per year. In the US, about 17% of households water their garden too much. Remedying that could reduce outdoor water usage by around 16%, especially critical for dry regions such as California. And don\u2019t underestimate details: a dripping faucet can add up to around 15 liters of wasted water each day! In total, around one third of our direct water usage can be slashed by eliminating wastefulness on average. Estimates find that you can save around $140 per year if you save ~3500 liters of water per month. With a family of four that\u2019s less than 20% of the average monthly water usage and even less if you live in a country using lots of water in their household such as the US.", "So why is it that reducing direct water usage doesn\u2019t significantly impact the environment? The reason is of course that other factors are responsible for the vast majority of water usage. Globally, we use around 9 trillion cubic meters of water per year. One cubic meter of water equals 1000 liters. You do the math. Next to these numbers, the 150 liters of daily water usage in households pale in comparison. Also, most countries are not as wealthy as the UK and therefore use less water per person per day. So globally, an astonishing 92% of these 9 trillion cubic meters is used for agricultural purposes. Therefore, the food you eat has an absurdly higher impact on global water usage than your direct water usage. Just to give you a glimpse into this world: one kilogram of beef has a water footprint of over 15 000 liters. For a UK citizen, that\u2019s more than 3 months of their direct water usage. A single banana is responsible for more indirect water usage than the daily direct water usage of the average UK citizen!", "And there are good reasons why you should care about this water footprint. Usually, water footprint is split into three categories: blue (water from surface or groundwater reservoirs), green (water from precipitation) and grey (water used to dilute pollutants). Agricultural products mostly have a green & blue water footprint, with blue water making up about one trillion cubic meters of global water usage annually. You can imagine this as a loan taken from the land and, in some form or another, returned to the cycle. Yet a big enough loan can break any bank if you run into liquidity issues (pun intended). Because a liter of water in lush landscapes or in arid deserts is certainly not equivalent. In a way this goes back to the argument of growing food where you have the best conditions to grow it. Growing tomatoes in a dry environment will have a vastly higher water footprint due to necessary irrigation.", "So what exactly happens if the bank breaks? If we take more water from a region than we should? One consequence is the intrusion of saltwater into depleted groundwater reservoirs, turning them into brackish water unfit for consumption. This can be frequently seen along coastlines. Vast swathes of Mediterranean coastline suffer from this issue as these areas in countries such as Spain or Italy are quite dry to begin with, necessitating large loans from groundwater deposits.", "With that in mind, let\u2019s talk about things you can do in the here and now to manage your water footprint. The most general one of course is to be conscious about indirect water usage, which is so much more important than your actual direct water usage. And be conscious about consumption items in your life with an exorbitant water footprint. Take beef for instance. A 200g beef burger patty would have a water footprint of roughly 3000 liters, while the same amount of chicken meat would only carry about one fourth of this aqueous burden. And an equivalent patty made from soy would be even \u2018cheaper\u2019 in terms of necessary water to produce it. There\u2019s an argument in favor of vegetarianism if you were looking for that. But even if you don\u2019t, consider where your beef patty came from, as beef from an arid region will necessarily have a larger water footprint than beef from drenched regions. And it doesn\u2019t stop at beef. Basically everything you own or consume has a water footprint to it and it\u2019s usually quite a bit larger than you would have guessed.", "If you\u2019re not concerned yet, consider this: according to estimates, global fresh water demand will outstrip supply by a whopping 40% by 2030. Wars have been fought over less. And water scarcity already affects billions for at least one month of the year. In order to have a real impact on consumer behavior, the water footprint of a given item should be legally required to be disclosed. Just like the number of calories, this number would facilitate comparison between functionally equivalent products and would make it easy to be water footprint-conscious. Until we have that, here\u2019s the TL;DR:", "If you care about your water / energy bill: cut direct water usage in your household. If you care about the environment: cut indirect water usage by conscious consumption of items with low water footprint.", "Your home for data science.
