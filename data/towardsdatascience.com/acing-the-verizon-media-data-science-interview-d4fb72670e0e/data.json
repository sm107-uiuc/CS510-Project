The subsidiary emerged in the wake of Verizon\u2019s well-chronicled acquisition of two companies that played a massive role in ushering in a host of widely-used digital services for online communication and web-browsing during the dotcom boom of the mid-90s \u2014 AOL and Yahoo!", "Until early 2019, AOL and Yahoo! formed part of a Verizon company division known as Oath Inc. which later went on to be christened with a new name \u2014 Verizon Media. Today, Verizon Media serves as the major media and online advertising division of the company and runs a myriad of recognisable digital brands, in addition to the two it already acquired, which includes HuffPost and TechCrunch. As any other digital media and marketing services company sitting atop tons of consumer data would, they readily seek the expertise of qualified data scientists. This is how the data science interview for an entry-level data science role at their headquarters in Paris, France goes.", "The job description for data scientists at Verizon Media is very typical. One is expected to have a Bachelor\u2019s degree, at least, in Computer Science, Accounting or any related STEM field. One should also have expertise in business intelligence and prescriptive analytics as well as data visualisation with tools such as Tableau. A new hire should be able to carry out predictive modelling and implement machine learning (ML) algorithms in Python or R, know about data warehousing in a cloud environment e.g. Amazon Web Services (AWS) or the Google Cloud Platform. One should know about database management and querying hence a decent level of SQL skills is good to have.", "While the role is advertised as that of a data scientist, the requirements easily spill into the expected duties of a data engineer as well as that of a data analyst. This has some implications \u2014 the new hire will need to wear more than one clearly-defined hat as a data scientist and possibly have the know-how to fulfil a diverse range of data-related tasks to avoid the team having to hire for a whole new employee just to provide specific expertise. A multi-faceted role is likely to end up being good for one\u2019s development either way.", "Hence, one will be expected to carry out extensive research to design and implement business solutions, carry out complex statistical and computational analysis, apply ML algorithms to customer data to optimise digital services and marketing platforms as well as communicate the results of the research and analyses\u2019 to business stake-holders. It is a tall order and one\u2019s general suitability for the role will be judged at the initial phone-screen.", "The next step is likely to be a phone screen interview. During a thirty-minute phone-screen, the candidate is asked to provide background information on their expertise in data analytics and data science. As per usual, the aim to is to obtain an overview of their technical skills, career interests and previous experience. At this stage, the questions are not likely to get very technical save for one or two brief questions to test one\u2019s comfort level and competence in explaining mathematical and/or statistical concepts. One may be asked to explain the difference between independence and mutually exclusivity of a pair of events to a layperson, for instance. Just one of many questions that would demonstrate that the candidate understands a concept well enough to elaborate or clarify it to someone without the same knowledge-base.", "The first section of the take-home test will further assess one\u2019s ability to communicate concepts to software engineers and stakeholders alike. The assignment is likely to be delivered in a Jupyter Notebook and/or Python script containing questions such as,", "The assignment will also require the candidate to demonstrate their technical abilities as a data scientist or machine-learning engineer in the data modelling section. For this, one will need to be comfortable with the following concepts and tools,", "The take-home assignment is meant to be completed over a few hours to a week, all depending on one\u2019s commitments.", "Passing the take-home assignment requires one to complete every question given correctly or to the satisfaction of the hiring team-lead. After a successful pass, one final stage in the interview process stands between the candidate and the job offer. This is the onsite interview which may also be administered online. At this stage, one\u2019s ability to communicate complex concepts to people at various levels within the organisation will be verified once more as one answers questions on developing technical and business strategies. The final interview will serve as an opportunity for the team to get a feel of the candidate\u2019s work and communication style and how well of a team-player they can be.", "Having passed the first two stages, the final interview should be smooth sailing. Of course, as is often the general case with interviews, a lot of luck is involved in achieving that final offer.", "Okay, we can end it here. In summary, I have provided an overview of the requirements for the data scientist position at Verizon Media as well as the stages within the interview process that lead up to a final job offer. My hope is that this information will be helpful to you at some stage in your job search and give you at least one data point to improve the regression model of your ultimate data science interviewing strategy.", "Your home for data science.
