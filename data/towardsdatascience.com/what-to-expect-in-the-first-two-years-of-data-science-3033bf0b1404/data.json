I have shared some of my biggest mistakes. And I have shared about some of my favorite days.", "This article is for anyone interested in understanding what types of work tasks they should expect from a career in data science. I also recommend this article for anyone interested in evaluating their own career. Comparing your experience to mine (or others) may assist in bringing you a sense of perspective. Below, I invite you to contact me if you are interested in entering the field. I made a late-in-life transition to data science. I would be glad to help others do the same.", "There are roughly four broad high-level categories of work that data scientists perform. These include planning, tooling, science, and dissemination. A question I get often is, as a data scientist, how do you spend most of your time? I have learned from experience that the answer to these questions depends, at least in part, on how long you have been in the role; how you spend your time, changes over time.", "This article will review each of these four high-level categories of work, and then explain how the distribution of work among these categories will start out and then change over time.", "Here is a plausible breakdown of how you will spend your time on each of these four tasks categories in the first few week.", "Planning: The processes associated with selecting a question that needs to be answered. Sometimes finding a question is better framed as selecting a problem that needs to be solved. Planning also involves checking whether anyone else has already answered the question or solved the problem.", "Tooling: Tooling involves selecting the tools that will be best suited for answering the question or solving the problem. This means reviewing existing tools and methods. Tooling also often means customizing existing tools or building new tools.", "Science: Arguably, science could be defined as the process of asking and answering a question and then disseminating it. For purposes of this article, I define science as the time and attention given to collecting data and executing the plans laid out earlier in the process. This means, applying the previously selected tools and methods to that data. A little more in detail, this involves tuning models and parameters, plus interpreting and comparing output results.", "Dissemination: This is the process of reporting results. Reporting results can occur in many ways including publication or articles or reports. This might also involve presentations for small or large groups. Dissemination is where you share the original question or problem, reveal your answers or solutions, describe your data and methods, and also be transparent about the relative strengths and weaknesses of your work.", "When you spend 30% of your time on planning, over a 40 hour work week, it equates to about a day and a half or 12 hours. Over a month that that includes about 20 working days, you will spend 6 of them on planning.", "Likewise you can expect to spend the same amount of time on tooling, and science. This leaves 4 hours in the week for dissemination. Or in a 20 working day month, that will be about 3 days of work on dissemination.", "How you spend your time, changes over time.", "The following image provides extensive information about the work of data science and how the nature of the work changes over time. It shows that The amount of actual science performed tends to be limited towards the beginning of the cycle. The job is not even 50% science until well into the second year (Q 2.1 and Q 2.2). Then, immediately following that boost in time spent on actual science, the amount of science drops significantly. Following the boost of science, the work immediately shifts to dissemination of the preceding results and then more planning for the next cycles ahead.", "This image portrays a version of events that shows the amount of time and effort spent on planning to return to around 30% in the 3rd and 4th quarter of the second year. Late in the second year, there is less tooling because the tooling work executed early in the first year should be reusable. The time that was spent on tooling early in the first year can now be spent in dissemination of the preceding results.", "Following the initial two years, a routine will likely set in. There is a natural cycle. This cycle begins to resemble a rotation where you spend about two quarters on disseminating and planning. The dissemination regards recent past findings and planning relates to executing next steps. Then, two quarters will focus on science which involves executing the plans. And ultimately then returning to a couple quarters of planning and dissemination.", "This article reviewed four high-level categories of work in data science including planning, tooling, science, and dissemination. This article also explained how the distribution of work among these categories will start out and then change over time.", "A disclaimer is that this information is based on my experience. Your experience or results may differ. One reason your experience may differ is that earlier in my career I worked for a non-profit organization that thought it would be smart to hire a data scientist. One scientist. One.", "Science is a team sport. I believe that starting out solo forced me to spend more time on planning and tooling. If I had been in a team setting that planning and tooling work could have been divvied out among our team members. Additionally, tooling and planning goes better and faster in a team setting.", "This information is important to consider if you are thinking about a career in data science. For example, if you are currently an engineer who builds tools and your favorite work tasks are related to building those tools, it might turn out that you are initially happy in a data science role. But, later when your work turns away from tooling you might experience a reduction in your work satisfaction.", "As a prospective data scientist, this information may also help as you interview positions. A good question to ask a prospective employer or client is, how much of my time do you want me to spend on planning, tooling, science, or dissemination. Some organizations will place responsibility for portions of this work with others who are not data scientists. For example, dissemination may be something the marketing team does for you. Or, you might find that the executive team prefers to disseminate your work while you remain in the background. Discussion these dynamics are one of the many discussions I recommend you have with prospective employers or clients before you accept an offer or sign a contract.", "For anyone looking to hire a data scientist, or build a team of data scientists, this information is also helpful because it will help you understand what you can expect from that scientist or team. For example, you should not expect results right away. Your scientist or the team will need time to plan and tool. Then they will need time to do the science. And if all goes well, there will be meaningful results eventually \u2014 not right away.", "Thanks for reading. Send me your thoughts and ideas. You can write just to say hey.
