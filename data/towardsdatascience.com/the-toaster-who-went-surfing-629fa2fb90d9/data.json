Such toasters connect to the internet, surf the web for updates and also allow their owners to control them remotely. Welcome to the world of the Internet of Things (IoT).", "The idea behind IoT is to create devices (such as toasters, fridges, ovens, lightbulbs, doors, cars, etc.) with the capability of connecting to the internet and transfer or receive data over a network without requiring human interaction. The value of the global IoT market was $200 million in 2019, but it is expected to reach the $1.6 billion in the coming five years.", "IoTs have a lot of applications, and the following are some examples;", "The list can go on forever since there are around 23 billion IoT devices worldwide. Of course, these are just some of the mundane usages, and one can find more complex examples which make use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) like the following;", "If all of this sounds like science fiction, then I suggest you inform yourself about IoTs. All the smart devices mentioned earlier can be purchased online and installed in any house today. The four case studies which use IoT and AI, have been implemented successfully somewhere near you. The leading mobile operators have already geared up for this new revolution, and their application is only limited to your imagination.", "However, the possibilities of IoT are endless. In the coming years, we will experience more innovative applications.", "As can be seen, the possibilities offered by IoTs are endless. The cost of the individual devices is also rather low, thus providing a low-cost entry point. However, the benefits are endless and range from simple automation to the use of complex AI.", "In the end, it\u2019s not just the toaster that\u2019s going to surf the internet, but most of our household and industrial devices.

It will become smarter, efficient and much better for everyone.", "This article was originally published by the Malta Financial Services Authority (MFSA)", "Prof Alexiei Dingli is a Professor of AI at the University of Malta.
