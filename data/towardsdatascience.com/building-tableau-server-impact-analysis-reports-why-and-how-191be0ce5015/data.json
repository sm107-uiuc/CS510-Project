The saying goes: garbage in, garbage out. While your many Tableau assets (workbooks, datasources, etc.) represent the front-end of your data ecosystem, all bets are off when the backend fails. Your visuals are what the end-users see and interact with, but that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg.", "For many teams using Tableau, every day begins with a roll of the dice. They connect their workbooks to database tables, set their extract refresh schedules, and hope that everything will succeed tomorrow like it did today. But hope is not a good strategy.", "A good strategy, in the context of managing your Tableau Server environment, is knowing exactly how changes in your data pipelines will impact your Tableau workbooks and datasources. In many organizations, some of this awareness exists \u2014 but it tends to be unofficial tribal knowledge.", "A better strategy would include building interactive Tableau workbooks that your data teams can reference when they are making changes to tables and schemas, so that anyone can track precisely which content and teams will be affected. In other words, our best weapon against backend changes is to build something interactive that allows us to visualize the impact of a database change with literally the click of a button.", "This article is the first in a series on how to build impact analysis reports in Tableau. Here we will outline what sort of information is available to us, provide an overview of how we can tap into the relevant data, and set the stage for a series of tutorials on how to go about using the tools available to us in the Tableau ecosystem to shape metadata from our Tableau environments into valuable assets that can improve the productivity of all our Tableau-related workflows and teams.", "Over the next several weeks, these tutorials will be posted and links to them will be added here. We can think of this article as both an introduction and a table of contents.", "Having worked as a consultant within numerous Tableau environments for many years, I have yet to see a one-size-fits-all solution that comprehensively addresses the unique needs of each environment.", "That\u2019s not to say one-size-fits-all solutions don\u2019t exist. They certainly do exist. However, it\u2019s rare to find a client who is enthusiastic at the thought of cookie cutter solutions. Every organization\u2019s data management is unique, and the complexities surrounding how their data ecosystems have evolved often require complex solutions to adequately meet their goals. Good luck pulling that type of solution out of a box.", "Having said that, there are some \u2018out of the box\u2019 products available to you in a standard Tableau Server deployment, for a price. One of those tools is the Data Management Add On (DMAO). This product (specifically, the metadata aspect of it) is good to know about.", "I encourage you to try out the DMAO, and Tableau is doing excellent work on developing new tools all the time. However, these tools are designed to be generally applicable to any environment, so they may not scratch the specific itches your team has.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at what the DMAO provides, as this will help steer our conversation towards the underlying Metadata API and how it is invaluable to us when building tailored impact analysis reports.", "The DMAO is a licensed product in the Tableau product lineup. It includes the Tableau Catalog and Tableau Prep Conductor.", "In Tableau\u2019s own words, here is how they define the product bundle:", "The Data Management Add-on is a collection of features and functionality that helps customers manage Tableau content and data assets in their Tableau Server or Tableau Online environment.", "You can use Tableau Prep Conductor to leverage the scheduling and tracking functionality of Tableau Server or Tableau Online to automate updating flow outputs.", "Tableau Catalog is included in the Data Management Add-on, making a variety of additional features available to you in the data management space. You can use Tableau Catalog to discover data, curate data assets, communicate data quality, perform impact analysis, and trace the lineage of data used in Tableau content.", "Curious what that looks like? Tableau Prep Conductor is out of the scope of this article, as it is geared towards providing Tableau users a familiar interface for managing their data pipelines, so let\u2019s focus on the Tableau Catalog.", "In the image above, we can see that the Tableau Catalog provides a front-end interface for us to explore the associations between various assets. The underlying metadata knows that if you\u2019re using workbook A, it references datasource B. Likewise, datasource B taps into database C and uses tables X, Y, and Z. Want to know the columns existing in the table? No problem. Want to know how many other workbooks use these tables? Sure thing.", "The fact that this metadata is available to you is massively helpful. The best part is, you can tap into the underlying metadata through the Metadata API even if you don\u2019t own the DMAO product. That means you can fetch the data yourself and use it however you want. Freedom!", "The Metadata API comes standard if you\u2019re on version 2019.3 or higher, batteries included. Check out this tutorial on using the Metadata API if you want to dive right in.", "While it does have a futuristic ring to it, metadata is more than a buzzword. In the context of Tableau, metadata provides information about your content, your users, how content is accessed or used, and pretty much everything in between.", "As an example of metadata in action, consider this: Tableau recently hosted a community challenge inviting participants to use metadata to scan workbooks on Tableau Server, identify poorly named calculations, and email the owners of the workbooks asking them to rename the flagged calculations.", "Until the introduction of the Metadata API in Tableau Server version 2019.3, solving that challenge in a straightforward way was not possible. The ability to look under the hood of workbooks and query details about their calculated fields is a wish the Metadata API granted to all of us.", "And that\u2019s barely scratching the surface. Another powerful capability we gain with the Metdata API is peering into our workbooks and datasources to see the database assets fueling our visuals.", "I can\u2019t even count the number of times I\u2019ve heard an analyst grumble about being asked to compile a list of all the database tables being used in Tableau. When you think about it, that seems like a pretty good question from a managerial perspective: what is being used in our Tableau dashboards? How can we make sure people are using the right sources of data? How can we ensure that it\u2019s safe to modify a table in the database without breaking our dashboards? How many dashboards will break if we prune old tables from our database?", "In the past, those questions would die a painful death in the backlog of some overburdened analyst\u2019s task list. Not today. Today, you\u2019re a few queries and a dashboard away from having all those questions answered.", "The stage is set, so let\u2019s introduce you to the actors. There are three stars in this show that you\u2019ll want to be familiar with:", "These are the tools we will use in the upcoming tutorials to collect data from our Tableau environment and build impact analysis dashboards. We\u2019re extracting data from our Tableau environment, feeding that data back into Tableau visuals, and using those visuals to better manage our Tableau environment. I doubt the word \u2018meta\u2019 has ever been more appropriate.", "The Metadata API will be the lead actor in any scene where we need to identify relationships between content. While some of this information can also be extracted from the REST API, the Metadata API benefits from GraphQL, a querying language that gives us freedom to dynamically define our queries in ways the REST API implementation does not support. The Metadata API allows us to define exactly what data we want to pull, and makes it possible to search every nook and cranny of our Tableau environment.", "I don\u2019t mean throw any shade at the REST API; it has its own part to play. In fact, the REST API is our gateway into the Metadata API and the vehicle all our queries will pass through. The REST API allows us to fetch data and publish, update, or delete content in an automated fashion. Using the REST API, we will be able to publish the data extracted from the Metadata API as Tableau datasource files or extracts. That\u2019s a very necessary step in building our impact analysis \u2014we need datasources to plug into our dashboards.", "The third Musketeer in this story is Tableau Server\u2019s internal PostgreSQL database. This contains a wealth of information, and while 90% of what we need will come from the Metadata API and the REST API, the repository database will add valuable context to our impact analysis. For example, we can add information describing how frequently specific content is accessed, what actions users take on specific content, which content is accessed interactively versus through email subscriptions, and much, much more. When it comes time to truly tailor your impact analysis, the PostgreSQL database will be your huckleberry.", "Since I mentioned Musketeers\u2026 the fourth Musketeer (D\u2019Artagnan) would be the Hyper API. This will be more of a cameo, and it\u2019s more of a best practice than a necessity. Rather than publish CSV files as the datasources for our impact analysis dashboards, we will use the Hyper API to create .hyper files. These are high-performance extracts, and the API supports appending data to .hyper files. That leaves the door open to tracking historical trends in our metadata, without needing to fuss with housing our data in a massive CSV or worry about storing the data in a database.", "Milestone 1 (ETA is 4/24/2020): using the Metadata API to collect data for our workbooks (views and dashboards), datasources, and flows. For each of those three families of content, we will identify all relevant database assets.", "Milestone 2 (ETA is 4/29/2020): build upon Milestone 1 with supplemental data from the Tableau Server Repository to provide the number of interactions associated with each workbook (views and dashboards), datasource, and flow.", "Milestone 3 (ETA is 5/6/2020): convert the combined output of Milestones 1 & 2 into a .hyper extract using the Hyper API and publish the contents to Tableau Server (or Tableau Online).", "Milestone 4 (ETA is 5/13/2020): build our first impact analysis dashboard using the datasource published in Milestone 3.", "That concludes this article and sets the stage for our exploration of building custom visuals to provide our teams with easy-to-use impact analysis dashboards! Stay tuned as we check the boxes on the milestones listed above.", "Here are a few relevant tutorials if you want to get started using tableau-api-lib, the Python library I use to interact with Tableau\u2019s APIs.", "Tableau Server on tap: getting started", "Tableau Server on tap: authenticating with a personal access token", "Tableau Server on tap: sending GraphQL queries to the Metadata API", "How to load Tableau Server metadata into a Pandas DataFrame", "Your home for data science.
