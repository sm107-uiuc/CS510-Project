Automation solutions often involve a lot of moving parts that depend on each other and are subject to break. Typically, this process will involve three steps:", "These steps sound simple in theory, but in practice create a tangled web of files and applications relying on one another. Typically the correct tool very much needs to be used for the correct job in these situations, but understanding your options, and the tools available to you is a huge part of the battle. From getting data to deploying the API, each piece of this puzzle will need to be tightly integrated, starting with getting Data.", "\u201c Generating\u201d might be the wrong term, but creating data that can be accessed for training is a huge part of the challenge. The best tool by-far for this is Python. Running a Python script to populate a database is certainly viable, and this can be done quite easily with RDS. On the regular Linux VPS end spectrum though, I recommend using Python in tandem with CronJob.", "CronJob will show its name a lot in the steps following, and this is for good reason. CronJob allows you to schedule tasks to run at allotted times, which is particularly useful for server automation. This is done using a recurring \u201c Cron\u201d timestamp consisting of the minute, hour, month, day of the week, etc. CronJobs can also be scheduled in shorter or longer timeframes depending on your use case. If there is one valuable tool I would consider learning inside of the Linux space, CronJob is very likely one of them. You can use CronJob for so many different things on a Unix system, and knowing how to use CronJob can definitely put a lot of power into your server administration and deployment.", "Usually, Python and CronJob working together will be more than enough to get your job up and running and have an SQL database, or locally stored data file be constantly populated with new data. Typically this data will be extracted from APIs using Python, and pushed into either a JSON or CSV format or more ideally \u2014 to an SQL database.", "Automated retraining is where CronJob really shows its ability. Though you could certainly get away with training on Flask routes \u2014 it certainly isn\u2019t ideal. Firstly, training on routes will drive CPU and RAM usage up the wall, making the system extremely unusable with a lot of requests, as well as denying many of those requests. Additionally, depending on your model, it can take upwards of ten minutes to train, which is not even remotely ideal for a GET request.", "So typically, the solution will be to use CronJob or an AWS Lambda solution. Of the two, CronJob is most certainly", "Whenever I deploy an API, scalability is always my primary concern. With that in mind, it\u2019s hard to justify a solution that increments in expense with usage. Running a CronJob on a VPS can definitely be a great way to go in this regard, as all of the problems of AWS Lambda can be entirely avoided while adding very few issues along-side that. So typically for this as well, a combination of CronJob and the language of your choice is your deadly weapon.", "Of all of the steps listed, deployment is certainly the easiest, but deployment is also the most complicated. There are a lot more steps involved with deployment that will require everything discussed previously to fall perfectly into line. Unfortunately, this can be quite nerve-racking, as one break can leave your entire system irrelevant.", "First thing you\u2019ll need is a web-server, to which I always use Nginx. Usually, the other choice falls to Apache, but I choose Nginx for some key reasons:", "Typically deployment on an Nginx web-server will involve editing a text file inside of /etc/nginx/conf.d, and if you\u2019d like to know more about that, I\u2019ve written an entire tutorial you can find here:", "This article also covers Supervisor, which will be the next essential piece of the deployment puzzle. Supervisor allows for commands to be run in the background from artificial users inside of dedicated work groups. Supervisor will hold the command that will run our web-server, be it Django, Genie, or Flask. Supervisor configuration also is relatively simple with a very similar configuration file in /etc/supervisor/conf.d easily editable and accessible.", "Flask is a great option for deployment that is light and simple, which makes it great for returning predictions for GET requests on a web-server. With a Flask API, it\u2019s typically as easy as predicting and returning to get the data in and out with a GET or POST request.", "The last piece of the puzzle will be Gunicorn. Gunicorn is the client-side server that will run your Flask applications. You can install Gunicorn through both Pip, and some package managers (it\u2019s in Apt, but not Dnf)", "This is the command that will be run from the supervisor configuration file. Then with a simple", "you\u2019ll be entirely deployed and ready to go!", "With all of these valuable tools at your disposal in the year 2020, you can create some pretty cool models and some pretty awesome automation on your server. Having a model that is constantly retrained on live data is going to be very valuable and very scalable, and a solution which does so is certainly optimal!", "Your home for data science.
