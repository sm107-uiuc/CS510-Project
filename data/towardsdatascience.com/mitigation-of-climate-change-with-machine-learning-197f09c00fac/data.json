At the International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML) in June there was a clear focus on climate change on one of the conference day the 14th of June. All the videos and presentations from the conference can be accessed online. I will however speak of one post made the 10th of June in connection to this conference on climatechange.ai (this page is useful!). I will take a brief look at some segments of the paper posted on arXiv called Tackling Climate Change with Machine Learning.", "The paper is 53 pages long so I will only provide a glimpse into what is discussed. The paper focuses on different areas of which I will cover three areas in relation to mitigation, simply summarising a few points to help you understand whether it would be valuable for you to dive deeper into the paper itself. The three areas I will outline is:", "What I perhaps like the most about this paper is that it is framed immiediately as a call for collaboration. The authors emphasise that machine learning is not a \u2018silver bullet\u2019. The applications they highlight are impactful, but they simultaneously argue no one solution will \u201cfix\u201d climate change. \u201c\u2026technology alone is not enough \u2014 technologies that would reduce climate change have been available for years, but have largely not been adopted at scale by society.\u201d", "Authors of the paper are: David Rolnick, Priya L. Donti , Lynn H. Kaack , Kelly Kochanski, Alexandre Lacoste, Kris Sankaran, Andrew Slavin Ross, Nikola Milojevic-Dupont, Natasha Jaques, Anna Waldman-Brown, Alexandra Luccioni, Tegan Maharaj, Evan D. Sherwin, S. Karthik Mukkavilli, Konrad Kording, Carla Gomes, Andrew Ng, Demis Hassabis, John C. Platt, Felix Creutzig, Jennifer Chayes, and Yoshua Bengio.", "The paper starts by outlining a few known facts within the area of climate change with rising emissions that show no trend of decreasing. Then it rolls into the idea of mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable consequences). These diverse problems can be seen as an opportunity to have an impact.", "Mitigation is the focus of this short article.", "Shortly after the introduction they outline this paper as aimed towards these different groups:", "The paper is easily structured and breaks down the different categories with a set of tags such as high leverage, long-term and high risk. As such it would be helpful for you if you find an area you want to explore further and dive into that specific area of the paper. You will be happy to see that it is well structured and gives an easily accessible overview of topics.", "Electricity systems is the first area listed where machine learning techniques could make a difference. \u201cAI has been called the new electricity, due to its potential to transform entire industries. Interestingly, electricity itself is one of the industries that AI is poised to transform.\u201d", "They outline key actions society must undertake in the energy sector:", "These can be done and are further outline in: (1) Generation and demand forecasting; (2) improving scheduling and demand; (3) accelerated science for materials; (4) nuclear fission and fusion; (5) nuclear power plants; (6) reducing life-cycle fossil fuels emissions; (7) reducing system waste; (8) modelling emissions; (9) improving electricity access; (10) low-data settings; (11)", "After running through improvements in energy they move to transportation working in the same fashion stating what needs to be done:", "Again this can be explored in: (1) understanding transportation data; (2) modelling demand; (3) shared mobility; (4) freight routing and consolidation; (5) designing for efficiency; (6) autonomous vehicles; (7) electric vehicles; (8) alternative fuels; (9) passenger preferences; and (10) improving low-carbon options.", "The energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related emissions, however in the paper they claim a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art solutions could reduce emissions for existing buildings by 90% (optimistic!). It is possible today for buildings to consume almost no energy. In this section they are not as clear at outlining what needs to be done, however I will try to compress it based on the structure. Its main focus seems on two aspects:", "Further subsections include: (1) energy use models; (2) smart buildings; (3) district-level energy use; (4) gathering infrastructure data; (5) data for smart cities; and (6) low-emission infrastructure.", "As I mentioned in the introduction I am writing up some notes on this to encourage you to dive deeper into the paper. This text is of course not comprehensive and only meant to outline a few of the issues. In the conclusion they say the following:", "\u201cMachine learning, like all technology, does not always make the world a better place \u2014 but it can. In the fight against climate change, we have seen that ML has significant contributions to offer across domain areas [\u2026] we emphasize that ML is only one part of the solution; it is a tool that enables other tools across fields. Addressing the problems of climate change has the potential to both benefit society and present new directions for the field of machine learning. The solutions we envision require dialogue with fields outside and within computer science, which will lead not only to novel application domains but also to new methodological insights applicable across ML.\u201d [bold added]", "As such in the spirit of their conclusion I can draw my following reflections:", "The report makes another set of recommendations in their conclusion which I will outline here too:", "Albeit brief I certainly hope this article was helpful in some way shape or form.", "Thank you for reading.
