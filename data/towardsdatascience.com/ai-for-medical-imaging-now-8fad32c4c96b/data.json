Demand for imaging outstrips supply of qualified radiologists and this trend is likely to continue with an aging population and growing access to technological healthcare solutions in emerging markets. Is AI and computer vision ready to help?", "For the first time, a computer can diagnose patients without a doctor\u2019s interpretation.", "AI and computer vision have long been envisaged as a root to faster, more accurate diagnoses. Stringent regulatory requirements for certification and validation of medical devices mean that it can be slow for new technologies to enter front-line clinical practice. Decision support tools based around deep learning are gaining acceptance, however, and several are already in use in clinics and hospitals. In this article we will examine six products that have already been approved for clinical use, looking at their route to market and any publicly available details of the underlying algorithms.", "All medical software \u2014 including AI decision support tools \u2014 must be compliant with the relevant standards. Certification can be a costly exercise, requiring clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy.", "US medical device regulations (FDA) are more specific (and arguably clearer) than their UK equivalent (MHRA) when it comes to the regulatory classification of decision support software, breaking it down into two groups:", "Most CAD products have had to go via the lengthy pre-market authorisation (PMA) route to certification required for De Novo products. Recent FDA guidance has relaxed the rules slightly, and certain categories of medical imaging analysis software will be allowed to use the more streamlined 510[k] pathway.", "Following a a De Novo classification request, devices that are classified into class I or class II through may be used as predicates for future premarket notification [510(k)] submissions.", "Let's look at some of the AI and machine vision technologies that have already been approved for clinical use:", "This computer-aided diagnosis (CADx) software assists radiologists in the assessment and characterisation of breast abnormalities using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As well as highlighting areas of interest using image segmentation, a proprietary metric (\u2018QI Score\u2019) is calculated that is correlated to the likelihood of malignancy", "On review, the software was classified as a Class II medical device, with additional \u2018special controls\u2019 \u2014 one of which is to monitor usage and demonstrate that using the software provides improved detection rates over unaided diagnosis.", "Once a lesion has been identified the software performs an automated image segmentation \u2014 although this appears to use traditional image processing methods, rather than deep learning-based tools such as Mask R-CNN.", "Image features are extracted from the lesion area, such as sphericity, homogeneity, volume, contrast, and a machine learning-based classifier determines the QI score and likely prognosis. A library comprising scans from patients with known outcomes can also be queried, and the most similar cases reviewed.", "This CADe/x software analyses mammograms for lesions suspicious of cancer. A breast tomosynthesis scan produces a set of 2D images, each a narrow cross-section through the body. Areas of interest are extracted from the separate planes and blended together so they are visible as a single image. Clinical study indicates an 8% improvement in detection rates when the software is used.", "During analysis, the algorithm uses deep convolutional neural networks to classify lots of small patches (256 x 256 pixels) from each image. Four classes are used: positive and negative masses, positive and negative architectural distortions.", "Further reading: Detection of soft tissue densities from digital breast tomosynthesis: comparison of conventional and deep learning approaches", "This CADx software program analyzes images of the eye for signs of diabetic retinopathy. Crucially, IDx-DR is the first device authorized that provides a screening decision without the need for a clinician to also interpret the image or results. This makes it usable by health care providers who may not normally be involved in eye care.", "Diabetic retinopathy is the most common cause of vision loss among the more than 30 million Americans living with diabetes and the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults.", "IDx-DR was granted Breakthrough Device designation, meaning the FDA provided intensive interaction and guidance to the company on efficient device development, to expedite evidence generation and the agency\u2019s review of the device.", "OsteoDetect is software that analyzes wrist radiographs (X-rays) using machine learning techniques to identify and highlight distal radius fractures.", "Deep convolutional neural networks are used in the detection algorithm. The U-net architecture is used to segment the image, and produce a heat map of suspected fracture locations. This is superimposed on the original image for display to the user.", "Further reading: Deep neural network improves fracture detection by clinicians.", "ContacCT is an AI algorithm to analyse computed tomography (CT) images for biomarkers indicative of a potential stroke. The software uses deep learning to identify large vessel occlusions (LVOs) in scans. Time is particularly of the essence when treating strokes, so a mobile app provides notifications directly to clinicians.", "Although details on the underlying implementation are hard to come by, the system appears to use convolutional neural networks for image segmentation", "Our last example is a machine vision system based around an iPad, using the camera to estimate blood loss during surgery as collected in surgical sponges and dressings. While not medical imaging per se, it is an interesting example of machine vision applied to the clinical environment.", "Traditionally, blood loss during surgery is estimated either by:", "Neither of these approaches are perfect, and it is difficult to account for the effect of other fluids that might distort results, such as saline.", "The Triton system works by using colorimetric image analysis algorithms and cloud-based machine learning to quantify hemoglobin (Hb) mass on surgical sponges and dressings as they are removed from the patient, providing a more accurate result than weighing.", "Computer-aided diagnosis will have a growing influence on medical imaging. Perhaps at some point, the idea of interpreting scan results with the unaided human eye may appear quaint, even unsafe.", "The certification pathways for AI-enabled medical devices are increasingly well understood. A plethora of predicate devices and new guidance from regulatory bodies may mean that the next generation of decision support systems have an easier route to market.", "What are your thoughts?
