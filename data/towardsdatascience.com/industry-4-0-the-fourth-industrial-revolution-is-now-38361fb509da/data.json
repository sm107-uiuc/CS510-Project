The need for data has lead to exponential growth in gathering it.", "Data Analytics and business intelligence already require a sophisticated command of information technology, mathematics and statistics. AI and machine learning algorithms have the capability to automate and optimize analytics processes, which in turn creates transformative business insights.", "In the last two years, the world produced 90% \u2014 2.5 quintillion bytes a day \u2014 of all the data out there.", "This data is different from content.

This is where the focus of product development and technology is done with a \u201czero\u201d negative impact on the world. This can involve everything from cars with zero emissions and zero accidents to carbon-neutral cities. Already, Copenhagen has said that it is working toward being the first carbon-neutral capital in the world.", "Smart products will be everywhere, from smart clothing, watches, and phones, to smart buildings and smart cities. One smart product that is expected to vastly improve people\u2019s lives will be smart cities: the industry is slated to be worth $2.57 trillion by 2025.", "These smart cities rely on the Internet of Things to collect data, which can then be used to provide insights for better managing assets, resources, and services. These include everything from garbage collection systems to urban planning.", "With two-thirds of the world\u2019s population expected to be living in urban areas by 2050, smart cities will become essential to allocating the necessary resources for populations. There will also be the rise of \u201cmega districts,\u201d which will be key centers for investment, leading to the idea of \u201ccity as a customer\u201d strategies for businesses \u2014 as opposed to focusing on targeting nations.", "Already, a report from ABI Research is urging a more aggressive deployment of 5G in cities to open up new economic value.", "The technology is slated to generate $2.5 trillion in direct contributions, $866 billion in indirect contributions, and $3.2 trillion in productivity gains by 2028.", "While Zhengfei was optimistic about the Fourth Industrial Revolution technology during the Davos tech session, historian Yuval Noah Harari was noticeably not.", "\u201cOn the most shallow level, it could be a repeat of the nineteenth-century industrial revolution, when the leaders had the chance to dominate the world economically and politically,\u201d Harari said. \u201cI understand the current arms race as an imperial arms race\u2026You don\u2019t need to send the soldiers in if you have all the data on a country.\u201d", "The increased reliance on technology in how society functions, leaves it more open to cyber-attacks and various other cyber-threats.", "An increase in security, especially related to the Internet of Things, is vital for the Fourth Industrial Revolution to flourish. That\u2019s because these cyber threats can do everything from compromising physical security to creating production downtimes, leading to significant financial losses.", "On the social front, however, perhaps the greater threat will come in the form of increased inequality.", "And Schwab isn\u2019t the only one concerned about the possibilities of the Fourth Industrial Revolution leading to greater inequality in the world.", "\u201cInequality in the adoption of the technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution as a result of a different starting point with regard to access to the internet, access to finance and technological capabilities, could result in further unevenness in economic growth,\u201d states a report by Common Fund.", "Such inequality can also have a snowball effect as automation and artificial intelligence continue to replace more and more people in the workplace.", "No matter if the changes are for the betterment of humanity and the planet, or come at great costs to both, Industry 4.0 is like none of its predecessors.", "Schwab argues that the exponential pace of the change and rate of introduction of new technology will have unprecedented levels of impact on society.", "Think of it this way: it took 75 years for 100 million people to start using telephones. The game Pokemon Go had that many users in a month.", "The adoption of new technology is happening more rapidly than at any other time in human history.", "As the world hurtles further into the Fourth Industrial Revolution, data is everywhere.

However, the insights that can be gleaned from it will continue to power the smart world of the revolution.", "To create better products and serves \u2014 as well as make better business decisions \u2014 your team must be data literate. Additionally, you need systems in place that can coordinate various artificial intelligence systems to prevent artificial intelligence islands.", "At this point in the revolution, 85% of data science projects fail, and 92% of such failures are due to people and process obstacles.", "Join the Cangler early adopter program to be a part of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.
