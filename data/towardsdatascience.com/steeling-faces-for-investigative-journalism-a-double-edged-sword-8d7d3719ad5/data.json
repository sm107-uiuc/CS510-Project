I signed up to FindClone.ru, a Russian service allowing anyone with a phone number to search profile pics of VK social media accounts (the Russian Facebook). You provide an image, they\u2019ll tell you who\u2019s profile pic it is.", "FindClone can be extremely useful in journalism investigations. I am using it for work. Aric Toler mentioned it in his expose for Bellingcat (to see it in action. Christo Grozev, Bellingcat lead on Russia, used it to reveal the identity of a GRU hacker).", "I wondered if FindClone has anything to offer on my own face. I uploaded an old profile image and low and behold, there was a match. Someone stole my face and made it theirs.", "Funnily enough, my date of birth isn't far off from the one the imitator used (but the year is completely wrong, the real me is younger, wink). Also, the impersonator says he is single and I am not. Evgeny even got one follower, an account under the name Elena Agonkova, who got blocked for violating VK\u2019s terms and conditions (I wonder if that account was fake, too).", "My image this Evgeny guy used was taken at the British BFI at Southbank in London. It\u2019s the one on the top left, me in a white-collar shirt (with a light green circle around). I signed up with a UK phone number to FindClone, added my image until a number of suggestions came up. There was one true positive match and a number of flattering false positives. For example, I was matched with the face of Borat (row 7, from a movie poster pic) and Ryan_Reynolds (row 5, recognised from an Eau de Cologne box).", "I am not depressed that someone stole my photo but I think it\u2019s still weird and unethical. Much more irksome I find is that FindClone\u2019s facial recognition algorithm matched me with Borat and Ryan Reynolds (neither one of them, I can really fond of).", "As an investigative journalist with an interest in disinformation and fake news, I am intrigued by the potential FindClone and facial recognition offers.", "The police keep tabs on us with facial recognition software. As ethical investigative journalists and citicsenas, we can now keep tabs on them (of course, only within the remit of what\u2019s legal).", "How common is impersonating online, especially among phony social media account? It\u2019s VERY common. Typical services struggle. Online dating services such as Tinder do the most. Spurious individuals lie the heck out of the platform. Facebook tightened its requirements to use your real identity.", "As an investigative journalist, setting up a spoof account is a way to remain undetected until enough information is gathered (it\u2019s also fairly common). When researching a controversial story it can help to stay under the radar until enough evidence is in your bag for your editor.", "When you do it, do yourself a favor and be inventive when choosing a fake profile/name/image (or no image at all). As investigative journalists, we still have to respect the privacy of others.", "Faking social media profiles with stock images is very common. Let\u2019s imagine we are compelled to sign up for VK with a fake identity. The wrong move would be to use a stock image from a free stock image platform such as Dreamstime (I hope you get the broader hit, here. Don't do it). It\u2019s a popular option among fake accounts.", "FindClone can be helpful to our investigation. Let us search for \u2018macho man grunge background male fashion\u2019. I know, it\u2019s quite specific. But bear with me. We get this guy on the screen, a blond male model with distinct facial features.", "Let\u2019s head over to FindClone and upload the model\u2019s image.", "Do you see what I see? The guy is not only popular as a stock image model. A plethora of, presumably fake accounts employed his face to assume (false) identities. If you are investigating disinformation and phony social media accounts \u2014 you found a series of recently established Twitter account that you want to check \u2014 comparing stock pics might give you first clues.", "That\u2019s because imitators and pranksters might also just be lazy humans (unless they are not, either human or lazy).", "One famous example where a simple face check could have helped is the case of Mia Ash. It was a fake female profile turning out to be an Iranian hackers. The disguise was badly but together (I know that because, for a piece, I investigated the circumstances and interviewed the expert at SecureWorks).", "The experts who worked the case say that it is rare that \u201chacker groups go to the trouble of building such a long-running, fleshed-out persona\u201d. But still, the images could have been easily disputed if compared with other open-source data.", "Searching through the VK account results I receive for the male stock model, we find one, what seems genuine private photo of our man. It shows him with two acquaintances or friends. We could #OSINT analyze the background to check where the image was taken. I refrain because I respect the guy\u2019s privacy, who has done nothing wrong.", "In short, FindClone is extremely powerful to support the verification of questionable accounts. It could prove extremely useful for fake social media account analysis. I recently encountered a case where I was approached by an account that claimed to be interested in my work. He or she only befriended investigative journalists on Linkedin, had no track record (either in journalism, nor in any other way) and almost matched another account with the same name, same education and from the same areas, to a hair. After pointing it out to the person behind the account (we chatted for a while), the account vanished mysteriously on the platform. Coincidence? It\u2019s possible. But the chances are so slim. It warrants to be cautious.", "There is evidence that Linkedin became a tool of choice for spy agencies to recruit operatives on it. A New York Times investigation found evidence that Chinese agents contact foreign citizens using the platform, which also includes former government officials. But beware, there is always a chance for false positives (there is a hand-full of other Robinson Zhan g profiles on Linkedin).", "It\u2019s so easy it\u2019s scary how simple it is. Let\u2019s go one step further and build a facial recognition database from the images I found (in me) via FindClone. Let\u2019s assume you came across a new face and want to check whether it matches an entry in your database of images of people (that\u2019s the image of myself I first uploaded to FindClone).", "I quickly screenshot 23 images from the FindClone results. The 24th is the one I know is me (stolen by Evgeny Plyushkin).", "We quickly install a python library called face_recognition. It\u2019s the simplest and easiest kid on the block right now to toy around with plug-and-play facial recognition software.", "We run the following command, which compares the images from the FindClone search result (the \u2018known_images folder) from FindClone with the \u2018new\u2019 one (my image in the My_Image folder).", "When I run the command, I get five options back. One is the face the fake VK social media account stole from me. The others are close matches. In other words, we reduced our hitlist of possible Mes to an overseeable bunch of accounts.", "This can be useful if you run an investigation with hundreds or thousands of possible matches of images and you want to reduce the list of suspects.", "On my Medium account, I show up with an image where half of my face is covered with a bright red bar, a reference to my commitment to wear a facemask in public.", "If we run a test on the image from my Medium account and five other images (random Mes from Google Images), the system is good enough to produce matches.", "The algorithm is sophisticated enough to locate two out of the five images I throw at the algorithm.", "The fact that glasses and facemasks are no big barrier to match faces, I don't have to explain how incredibly powerful this is for #OSINT investigations (also, how concerning for the area of law enforcement).", "Imagine you only have access to one image from bad video footage for an individual wearing a facemask or a heavy beard. You can potentially still match it to a set of images in your repository of suspects.", "Let\u2019s see if a beard matters. I got also one where I am much younger. Does headgear, like a cap, matter?", "The image where I am wearing a cap is easily matched with an image from the other pile of pics I got off the internet.", "The winter hat image is matched with the one I wear the antlers and the one with the beard.", "The image of me as a ten-year-old got no match. This limits the use of #OSINT investigation a bit. But there are always workarounds, like making people age (one online tool is called Changemyface, e.g. if you are looking for an older person but you have only an image at hand when they are younger).", "Other stuff spotted: I get no direct match for the self-portrait of the image in the blue suit (either validating my shitty drawing skills or a problem in the AI?, I am not sure). But it did find a match for self-portrait and the black-and-white one with glasses.", "This is either incredibly good or incredibly bad. The python library claims it has a model accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark (it\u2019s a public benchmark for face verification, also known as pair matching).", "Generally, the system has difficulty to match people with a beard, I noticed. Again, if you search on the web for some solutions to remove beards or add them (I could images there is a similar case to be made for wearing makeup. There are places where you can add it to an image).", "Also, if you get multiple hits for your images, it\u2019s possible to increase or decrease the tolerance value in order to make face comparisons more/less strict. You can even calculate the \u2018face distance\u2019 in case you are after a data-driven approach. There are tonnes of other examples. I\u2019d recommend you going through them in case there you stumble across a specific use case for your OSINT investigation (again, stay on the ethical side when you do it).", "For instance, you could run a video and let the python library alert you when it finds a face familiar to the one in your repository. That could save you tonnes of work if you have a long video of, for instance, demonstrators or cops in a crowd (a nifty video explainer offers this tutorial, showing how to work the camera with the python library).", "On June 4/5 news outlets reported that a peaceful elderly protester got pushed by the buffalo police and fell to the ground where he started bleeding. It was a case of unnecessary and unspeakable police brutality. The victim is still in critical condition at the time of writing.", "Two officers got suspended and two officer are now charged with felony assault. Two officers were being identified, one by journalists because his name tag on his uniform was clearly visible in the video (Aaron Torgalski). But there is a third officer, someone who is also instrumental to the whole video (which was taken by WBFO, a local radio station).", "He is the one who came into the scene when he ran towards the two other officers to, would seems to be helping to shove the protester.", "He was also the one who pulled back the officer who attempted to kneel down to help/inspect the conditions of the bleeding protester. On his helmet, this police officer had written \u2018PL1\u2019.", "The video went quickly viral. The image of this officer is very blurry. Let\u2019s see if the python system can match the faces of Robert McCabe (officer one) and Aaron Torgalski (officer two) \u2014 te headshots provided by Erie County District Attorney\u2019s office \u2014 with the third officer.", "What we can also do is to test the facial recognition algorithm on the video at hand to another image, a blurry one. There is one photo taken from a different camera angle, what I presume is by a reporter/photographer, after the incident.", "It\u2019s clearly the same guy (J. Losi). But imagine the comparison image came from a blurry Instagram or Facebook photo (FYI, I checked the entire Buffalo Police Department Instagram and Facebook accounts, the guys isn't there. On their website, there is no photo from this guy either. If you have clues, do reach out).", "The algorithm is able to make the right connection.", "We now see how powerful the facial recognition software can be that we have at hand at our free and unlimited disposal. We tested how well it can perform in various ways and what caveats there are. It\u2019s now time for your own investigative journalism.", "A quick update on this story. The third officer, the one with the unreadable name tag, is called John Losi. The name tag reads J. Losi. The officer also appears in a different photo where he is kneeling down with fellow officers. Let\u2019s quickly check whether the algorithm can recognize him from the video.", "We get a match. Despite the helmet, the algorithm can pin down Losi from the video to the other images.", "Clarification: I want to stress, this analysis is not about putting blame on the third officer (although, it is visible that he pulled up his fellow colleague \u2014 who intended to check on the victim \u2014 officer Robert McCabe, to move him on). From the video it is not directly visible whether Losi intended to help to push the victim. He could have only tried to prevent Robert McCabe to push the victim in the first place. I am not here to judge that. All this work shows is that it\u2019s possible to confirm connections between identities and faces and automate the process.", "There are clearly some ethical battles this kind of software needs to fight. It is risky to put such a powerful tool in the hands of criminals or any state hackers and agencies with evil intentions (or with the plan to keep restrict journalists).", "But, for open-source investigations, we need to be practical and we have seen where and how the system can excel.", "The concerning side of it: The scary part is that anyone can build a facial recognition system on their own terms. Scraping data from public websites, like social media platforms, has never been really difficult. But professionals can scale it up. That\u2019s a problem.", "Social media companies have tried to make it harder for anyone to scrape images and personal details from social media accounts.", "Facebook explicitly now warns you at the very beginning of their robots file (a file that tells search engine crawlers which pages or files the crawler can or can\u2019t request from Facebook). It says \u201ccrawling Facebook is prohibited unless you have express written permission.\u201d", "Instagram is image-heavy, and relevant to the facial image recognition setup that we talked about in the post. Other #OSINT experts (notably Jake Creps) mentioned Instalooter , a tool to scrape Instagram images. I am not sure if it's still running but it could be of help in case you are working a case.", "Experts point out that, alongside Facebook\u2019s data lockdown in 2018, Instagram has suffered from restrictions on data access, making it less reliable (again, if you do it, protect peoples\u2019 privacy and be sensible).", "GDPR is worth a consideration, too. Experts stress that the odds increased to get sued if you\u2019re trying to scrape personal data off a social media platform. You, the law-abiding #OSINT investigator, shouldn't take this lightly. Officially in the EU, an individual must give you permission (explicit consent). Otherwise, it's illegal to scrape personal data of an EU resident under GDPR.", "But let\u2019s not fool ourselves. If a professional agency or tech-savvy hackers want to save images on social media, there are always ways to go about it (we journalists should keep tabs on such operations).", "More on FindClone: FindClone is a fairly moderate version of an online facial recognition application. It replaced a professional (and much more worrying) option, a service called SearchFace. In the past, SearchFace offered questionable characters a stage to inform families of women who starred in pornographic movies, sharing their secrets. This is unethical and immoral at best. The perpetrator did so to cause \u2018moral outrage, claiming that women in the sex industry are corrupt and deceptive.\u201d That someone can use such a service that easily against innocent people is deeply worrying.", "SearchFace as a service for users was taken down last year but since the organisation behind it seems active again. It\u2019s now actively promoting its capabilities to hunt Covid-19 lockdown breakers, another potentially questionable/unethical/immoral endeavor.", "The algorithm underlying NtechLab\u2019s solutions has shown a great deal of effectiveness in identifying those who violate quarantine while tracking the social interactions between the potentially contagious and promptly notifying respective authorities, the ad claims.", "I am not sharing their view that facial recognition should be commercialized in order to hunt those breaking lockdown rules. It is a topic investigative journalists may want to look into in more depth.", "Thanks for reading this.
