Using everything that\u2019s happened in your past to predict the future; learning from mistakes in the past and adjusting accordingly. Instead of relying on people\u2019s memories and gut feelings, Machine Learning uses computers and statistics to do the heavy lifting. With the proper support structure, it can be a powerful tool, but it\u2019s by no means perfect.", "It is not a crystal ball.", "In an ideal world, everyone in a business would understand all the nuances of the work and what it entails, but that isn\u2019t true at all. That isn\u2019t true of most jobs. And this lack of understanding is bound to cause issues.", "Requesters may not know how everything under the hood is working- especially considering it\u2019s not their job- but they know they should be using it. There\u2019s a reason Machine Learning jobs are in such high demand and it\u2019s because of the impact it has on decision-making. However, there is no doubt that many companies are only looking into these roles because they know competitors are. The term \u201cMachine Learning\u201d has been cited as beginning in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, but the job itself has mainly been taking off in recent years. So naturally many people will not know exactly what Machine Learning entails and the legwork behind the scenes.", "For some, the Machine Learning process is merely a black box. Ask a data scientist for an answer and return later for their projections. That\u2019s it.", "Requesters not understanding what their request truly entails is by no means a new concept, its been around as long as \u201cbusiness-casual\u201d has been a thing. And that\u2019s not to say that there aren\u2019t many requesters that do know what a Machine Learning project entails. There\u2019s just an imbalance and if realistic expectations can be set then everyone\u2019s work would be improved.", "Some people treat Machine Learning predictions as 100% accurate without flaw and act surprised when something doesn\u2019t come true. Others want to include information in the dataset that the company doesn\u2019t have access to.", "This is not by any means on the shoulders of management alone. Not effectively communicating expectations is a responsibility that data scientists should be wary of. Management isn\u2019t the expert in your job so it's up to you to explain what you\u2019re doing to them.", "By clarifying to management what you\u2019re actually doing behind the scenes and explaining how your models should be utilized would not only help them make better decisions but also ease the process for data scientists and avoid issues down the road.", "Below I\u2019ll go over five concepts that can help bridge this gap and potentially improve the workflow for everyone involved.", "Make it clear to decision makers that issues with the data will carry over into the model, either reducing predictive power or potentially invalidating the whole process.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re performing a study on students in your class. Its a basic survey including questions about demographics and opinion, anonymous too. After collecting all the papers you scan through the responses and notice a survey that checked off Eskimo, Indian, and Choose Not To Say for their ethnicity. You scan the room, maybe someone really is all three, but you\u2019ll have to be wary of that survey. Is it so out of the realm of possibility that a high school student didn\u2019t take a survey seriously?", "Maybe you\u2019ll exclude some of the more questionable surveys\u2026", "As organizations collect more data, managing the quality of that data becomes more important every day. After all, data is the lifeblood of your organization.", "Ask any DBA, especially those at large corporations, about the accuracy of their data and they\u2019ll probably sigh and shrug. It\u2019s not their fault, once databases start to get large, caveats and issues start to accumulate and there just isn\u2019t the time or resources to ensure that everything is 100% accurate.", "Data quality is always a concern. It's better to make a decision knowing there could be issues with the data than making a decision assuming the data is good. The model doesn\u2019t care if the data is accurate to the real world, it has to assume it is in order to make its assessments. Checks can be put in the code for outliers and high-leverage values, but even these checks will only fix so much.", "Data validation on your dataset is a good first step. However, depending on the size of the data it may take quite a bit to even to check a sample of the data. On top of that, if some of the data is outside of your expertise, working with those who can perform sniff-tests on the data and make sure everything checks out on their end is greatly appreciated.", "Tell decision-makers that the model is limited to inputs you put in (and all derivatives of that data). If it\u2019s not in the input then it is not fully accounted for.", "A predictive model only accounts for trends and information that it is given. If you want to factor in other variables, they\u2019ll need to be accounted for in the training data the model is built upon.", "Say you developed a model for predicting the amount of customer service calls your company will handle in the following months. You include values related to sales growth, time of year, and staffing. Happy with your forecasts, you hand it to your boss.", "\u201cLooks great! Does it account for the service app we\u2019ll be launching in Q4?\u201d", "Your heart sinks a little. How do you even quantify that? You know you don\u2019t have any of that info in the data warehouse either. Maybe you can scrounge something up to project how much call volume will be reduced and see how much that will free up the staffing numbers.", "You say you\u2019ll do what you can\u2026", "While some portions of a variable can explain some of the impacts of another variable, such as staffing and time of year, without explicit mention of a specific factor one cannot confidently claim that the model accounts for it. Adding new variables will not only change the prediction, but the impact of the other variables included. Coefficients and errors will change.", "To combat this, make it abundantly clear what is and isn\u2019t factored in your model. Get a list of some variables management wants to include/factor in and see what you can do. That way you at least have a baseline of what they want to look into and be able to tweak.", "While fun to joke about, make it clear that you are not actually looking into a crystal ball to make your forecasts. Some variables would be great to add to a model, but if they can\u2019t be quantified in some form then you\u2019re out of luck.", "Believe it or not, predictive models aren\u2019t actually looking into the future. They\u2019re just a bunch of statistical calculations and computer algorithms created by people way smarter than everyone else and implemented by other extremely smart people.", "Even for more advanced processes like image processing, while not a number on its own, it is a numerical process. Behind the scenes, images are broken down to pixel level and assigned values before comparing the patterns in those pixels to the labels they were assigned.", "The limits of what can be included in a model are what can be turned into a number. If it can be quantified, then great something can most likely be done to account for it. As long as the person designing the dataset can get it into the appropriate format then you\u2019re fine.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to predict how well-received a book will be. It would be easy to include factors related to genre popularity and average Amazon review of other books by the same author. However, adding something like the pace of the book or how entertaining the plot is would be a bit more complex.", "Another aspect of concern is that models and statistical tests require certain assumptions to be met. If you build a model that ignores them, well your results may be fine or they could be completely wrong in the long term. This is a trap that amateur modelers (like myself) often skip on (like myself).", "Take for example the assumptions for a linear regression model. Thanks to StatisticsSolutions for not making me memorize them.", "Linear regression is a simple and straightforward model that can often be implemented with one or two lines of code. Making sure all the underlying assumptions are met is often more trouble than a modeler will want to deal with, but we really should every time. Not meeting these assumptions could mean a model one thought was going to be highly predictive is actually biased towards one variable or another.", "For a model to be statistically robust, it will need to have all its parameters met to a somewhat acceptable level. What that level is is up to the person crafting the dataset and model.", "If a model needs to have x, y, and z to be true in order to make accurate predictions, only having x and z might not cut it.", "A third idea is that most predictions and forecasts offer a confidence interval of some kind for every prediction. The idea depends on the exact type of predictions you\u2019re making, but this is usually true in some form for most types. There is a cone of uncertainty surrounding forecasts. There is no such thing as a 100% surefire prediction (unless it is a solved problem) and as a result, there is some wiggle room even for highly likely predictions.", "Most forecasts are merely giving the highest likelihood event, that isn\u2019t to say that it still attributed a smaller chance of occurrence to another event.", "When you play the lottery, a model would essentially predict you would not win every single time you bought a ticket and it would be right. However, there\u2019s a non-zero chance of winning the lottery so eventually, someone will win despite the odds being stacked completely against them.", "For that lottery winner, the model would be wrong, but that isn\u2019t to say that it still isn\u2019t right every other lottery participant.", "In terms of resolutions, be clear with management that adding easily quantifiable (and available) data is a more straightforward process. Sometimes placeholder factors can be made to address certain variable shortcomings, but one should be careful in making sure that the placeholder is representing what you think it is. When management wants to add a new factor ask if they have any idea of how to quantify the variable of interest. Perhaps they know something you don\u2019t.", "This is a quote that you always see in investing and it applies to predictive modelling as well. Even if you have data all the way back to the prehistoric age, with accurate columns, and billions of variables being accounted for, it just isn\u2019t possible to give a 100% accurate prediction all the time. At least not yet. There\u2019s just too much to be factored in order to get a prediction.", "One case often brought in investing is in regard to General Electric [NYSE:GE].", "Back in the early 1900\u2019s GE was a cornerstone of American households. They mass-produced various appliances and even helped in Allies\u2019 efforts during World War II. From 1981 to 2001, the company\u2019s value went from $25 billion to $130 billion. GE was lauded as one of the safest picks of the stock market. Buy in and receive solid financial growth for years to come.", "GE was too big to fail.", "Then the Great Recession struck. GE\u2019s stock fell and dividends dropped. Thousands of jobs were cut to compensate and stocks fell even more at the news. By November 2018 GE was valued at $72.63 billion. To this day GE is still doing its best to recover and return to the top that it once held for decades.", "For the average investor, GE was a surefire bet for solid returns before 2008. While there were people who predicted the Great Recession, there was no way the average investor even considered that GE would get hit so hard.", "It\u2019s tough to make predictions, especially about the future.", "Nothing is perfect, especially a prediction. If you\u2019re projecting how many customers your sales department is going to add on next month, then you\u2019re probably running under the assumption that sales calls aren\u2019t outlawed next week (politics can be a strange space). So unless you forecasted for sales being outlawed, your model runs under the assumption that sales calls are legal.", "Factors aren\u2019t known to be impactful on a target until they have an impact and unless you can predict when these other factors will change then you can\u2019t have a 100% accurate model.", "Models are always run under the belief that there is still a chance for error. These models are not magic, unforeseen events by their creators will not be accounted for in models. All they can rely on is the past and known changes.", "Make it clear to management that predictive models generally assume that current trends continue. Everything not specifically accounted for in the model is sort of tacked on as random error. It\u2019s difficult to account for the unexpected because, well it was unexpected.", "To check the success of a model in production it makes sense to compare what actually happens with what was predicted at the time. However, it must be kept in mind that actions taken to correct for the predictions will alter the outcome.", "If not explained properly, management might believe a model is wrong entirely and write off the predictions.", "A boat is about to partake on its maiden voyage. Right before its send-off, a navigator points out there will be a massive storm on their route. The people on board hear of the prediction and worry for their well-being. The boat sets sail with everyone nervous for the fate of their trip.", "The voyage ends up going smoothly, a beautiful voyage with plenty of sun and no clouds. Upon reaching their destination, the people condemn the navigator for making them all worry and note how there wasn\u2019t a single raindrop the entire trip.", "Unbeknownst to the passengers, the captain had changed course to a much safer, route that circumvented the storm entirely.", "A prediction that does not match the outcome is not necessarily wrong. Predictive models will choose the most likely outcome given current trends and as soon as decision-makers hear of these predictions, of course they are going to take action on them.", "However, people might think this is a way to remove accountability from the data scientists entirely and in a way it does sound like that. Either the predictions are right and I\u2019m a genius or they\u2019re wrong and it\u2019s not my fault.", "It\u2019s a slippery slope. When a model is first developed, it is easy enough to validate the model with other past instances to check a model\u2019s accuracy. However, once the model is productionalized it will be difficult to discern the predictions being wrong or appropriate action being taken. You\u2019ll need to go back, adjust the appropriate inputs, and see how close the newly revised predictions now match reality.", "The point of many Machine Learning projects in business environments is to see where the company is currently headed while also providing some \u201cwhat-if\u201d analysis on different factors like competitor and customer patterns.", "Make it clear to requesters that any changes made after the prediction was made and before the event has occurred was not accounted for in the prediction. For you to accurately test the model against what actually occurred you will need to go back and include adjustments made after the initial forecast was done.", "The five concepts we covered will hopefully offer some tempering of expectations in regards to Machine Learning with requesters.", "Now, this is by no means a comprehensive list, more like ideas that I wished I had made clear to my higher-ups earlier on in the process. As a part of a larger business, people\u2019s understanding of your expertise is just as important as the expertise itself. It\u2019s unfortunate, but it is something that can be addressed through proper communication and cooperation.", "If you have any other suggestions, feel free to share them below (or give them to me in an angry email).", "Your home for data science.
