It was founded in 1929\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The Spanish football league commonly known as La Liga is the first national football league in Spain, being one of the most popular professional sports leagues in the world. It was founded in 1929 and has been held every year since then with the exception of the period (1936\u20131939) due to the Spanish Civil War. At his foundation, it only consisted of 10 teams. Currently, it is made up of 20 teams quite evenly spread across the country but mainly from the most developed regions: Madrid, Barcelona, and Basque Country. The top four teams are qualified for the Champions League while the three lowest placed teams (positions 18\u201320) are relegated to the second division. As in most European countries, the winner of the game gets three points and both teams get 1 point if they draw.", "This article is a journey through the history of the Spanish league. Analyzing historical data (all classifications from 1929 until 2020), we will be able to answer many questions about La Liga. What teams nearly won La Liga? Do referees favor Real Madrid and Barcelona? Is La Liga becoming too soft? When did Barcelona and Real Madrid\u2019s hegemony start? Since when is Barcelona catching up Real Madrid?", "The historical data of La Liga (from 1929 until 2020) was scraped from Bdfutbol.com. This website contains national and international football rankings.", "To scrape the data, we have used BeautifulSoup which is a popular Python library for extracting information from an HTML page. After obtaining all the data, we have stored it in a Pandas data frame for further processing.", "The programming code used in this analysis is available here. You can take a look at it as you read the article.", "Data Cleaning is the process of transforming raw data into a standardized form that can easily be analyzed with data analytics tools. In this particular case, before analyzing the data using Pandas, we have performed multiple cleaning operations. We have removed unnecessary columns and renamed the remaining ones using English terms (remember that data was scraped from a Spanish website). During the exploratory data analysis, we have noticed that in some cases multiple names were used to refer to the same football team. Over the years, some football teams have changed their names obligated in most cases by law. For instance, during the Spanish Second Republic (1931\u20131939) was not allowed to use the royal symbols. As a consequence, many football teams modified their names which contained the word \u2018Real\u2019 (Royal in English) to avoid being convicted for praising the monarchy. Real Madrid was not only renamed just Madrid but also lost the crown of his shield. Subsequently, during the Franco regime, they recovered the word \u2018Real\u2019, but a new law affected other team names. The dictatorship banned the use of foreign words from 1941 until 1972. Consequently, teams such as Athletic Club, Racing de Santander, and Sporting de Gij\u00f3n were forced to modify their historical names for 30 years to Atl\u00e9tico de Bilbao, Santander, and Real Gij\u00f3n.", "After cleaning the data, we obtain a Pandas data frame that can be easily processed to extract conclusions. As shown below, the data frame contains information such as the number of games won, drawn, and lost, the number of yellow and red cards, the number of points, and the position in the ranking of all teams that took part in La Liga from 1929 until 2020.", "Now, we are ready to analyze the data! :)", "The Spanish league has been played by more of 60 different clubs; however, only nine of them got their hands on the trophy. The following plot shows the Spanish league winners from season 1928\u201329 until 2019\u201320.", "As shown above, Real Madrid is the most successful club in the history of La Liga with 34 titles followed by Barcelona with 26 leagues. However, as we will see later, Barcelona is catching up. Apart from these two clubs, the Spanish first division has been won by other 7 clubs, including Atl\u00e9tico Madrid (10), Athletic Club (8), Valencia (6), Real Sociedad (2), Betis (1), Sevilla (1), and Deportivo de La Coru\u00f1a (1).", "It is heartbreaking to be a runner-up. For Real Madrid and Barcelona to be second is a shameful failure that could easily end up with the dismissal of the coach or with multiple multi-millionaire signings for the next season. For other teams, it is just a dream that almost comes true, but definitely not a failure. Failure, after all, is just a matter of expectations.", "Additionally, we can also observe that Barcelona has been on more occasions runner-up of La Liga than Real Madrid.", "There are only 3 football teams that have never been relegated to the second division: Athletic Club, Barcelona, and Real Madrid. Espanyol and Valencia played 4 seasons in the second division, and Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid 6.", "All teams from the image above are currently in the first division with the exception of Zaragoza (since 2012\u201313 in the second division).", "The number of teams in La Liga has steadily increased from 10 to 20 teams with the exception of the seasons 1995\u201396 and 1996\u201397, during which 22 teams played.", "Currently, 20 teams play the Spanish league. The same number of teams play the Serie A (Italy), the Ligue 1 (France), and the Premier League (England). On the contrary, 18 teams take part in the Bundesliga (Germany), the Primeira Liga (Portugal), and the Eredivisie (Holand).Evolution of the number of leagues", "It is said in Spain that La Liga is played by two teams the rest is ornamentation and in my opinion, that is totally true \ud83d\ude22. Since 2000, Real Madrid and Barcelona have won 17 out of 20 leagues, being for other teams almost impossible to compete against them. But has always been the Spanish league that boring? Has always been dominated by Madrid or Barcelona? When did the Real Madrid and Barcelona\u2019s hegemony begin? Let\u2019s clarify all questions with a simple plot.", "The following plot shows the evolution of the number of leagues by team.", "As shown in the plot, in the first years of the league, although we can observe the slight prominence of Athletic Club, La Liga was not as hegemonic as it is nowadays and it was not clearly dominated by any club. In the late fifties, we start to see the beginning of Real Madrid\u2019s dominance with the signing of Di Stefano. The Argentinean completely changed the fate of Real Madrid which at that time was an average team and had not won the league in 20 years.", "From the 1960s onward, Real Madrid took control over the league winning 14 titles in only two decades. At the time, \u2018El Cl\u00e1sico\u2019 was the match between Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid and Real Madrid since Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid was the only serious rival of The Meringues winning 4 leagues between 1960 and 1980.", "From the nineties onwards, Barcelona has dominated the Spanish league winning 16 titles. In the 1990s, under the supervision of Johan Cruyff (1988\u20131996), Barcelona ended with the overwhelming dominance of Real Madrid in the last years. Johan Cruyff created a possession-based football style that continued to be imitated by Barcelona\u2019s subsequent coaches, Louis Van Gaal, Frank Rijkaard, and particularly Guardiola. From the 2000s on, the hegemony of Barcelona continued powered by home-grown players such as Messi, Iniesta, Xavi, Busquets, Puyol or Pique.", "All the aforesaid can also be observed in the following plot which shows the number of leagues by team and decade.", "The following plot shows the difference in leagues between Real Madrid and Barcelona over time. As shown below, the maximum difference in favor of Barcelona was in the season 1952\u20131953. At that time, Barcelona had 4 leagues more than Real Madrid. However, in the mid-fifties, the luck of Real Madrid was about to change. From this time until the nineties, Real Madrid clearly dominated La Liga and the difference in leagues between The Blancos and Barcelona was increasing over time reaching its maximum in the season 1989\u201390 (15 leagues). From the 1990s onward, we observe how the difference in leagues is decreasing over time as a consequence of Barcelona\u2019s hegemony. Currently, Real Madrid has 8 leagues more than Barcelona.", "There is one thing that most football fans across the world take for granted: the use cards. However, it was not until 1970 at the World Cup in Mexico that the yellow and red card system was used for the first time in football. The system was invented in 1966 by the English referee Ken Aston who noticed that many times football players did not understand or just ignored the warnings made by referees which at the time were orally communicated. Then, inspired by the colors of the traffic lights (red and yellow) and their meanings, Aston created a color-coding scheme to clearly indicate that a football player has been cautioned or expelled.", "But as Hemingway said, Spain is different. The Spanish National team did not take part at the 1970 World Cup in Mexico where the card system was first used. The Spanish Federation of football thought that yellow cards were actually white so that is how they looked like in black and white TVs of the time. In January 1971 red and white cards were introduced in the Spanish League until 1976 when \u00fdellow cards finally replaced white cards.", "The following plot shows the total number of red cards per season. As I previously said, before the year 1971, the referee announced to the player his fines verbally. In the figure below, prior to 1971, red cards represent football players that were expelled during the match only with words (without using cards).", "We observe a growing tendency until the mid-nineties. From that moment on, the total amount of red cards is steadily decreasing over time.", "Likewise, the plot below shows the total number of yellow cards (including white cards) per season.", "The total number of yellow cards per season has grown steadily from 1971 until the mid-nineties. From this time on, the number of cards remains nearly constant around 2000 cards per season.", "Prior to the use of cards, players often did not receive penalties. Only in special cases (really strong fouls), football players were expelled from the game.", "In Spain, it is said that referees favor Real Madrid and Barcelona in the last years. But is that really true? Let\u2019s see the numbers :)", "The following plots show the average number of red and yellow cards by team from 1990 until 2020. As said, Real Madrid and Barcelona received on average fewer cards than other strong teams such as Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, Valencia, Sevilla, or Athletic Club. Maybe their success is not only a combination of money and good players but also a little bit of help \ud83d\ude06", "The following plots show the performance of Valencia, Real Madrid, Barcelona, Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid, and Athletic Club in the last 10 years. As shown below, Real Madrid and Barcelona score on average more goals than the other teams.", "However, if we analyze the goals against, we observe that Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid is defensively the strongest team, even better than Barcelona, and the person responsible for all of this is Diego Simeone.", "The Argentinean is the manager of Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid since December 2011. Under his supervision, Atletico de Madrid has developed a distinct identity based on a strong defensive style. With Diego Simeone as coach, Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid has won La Liga, La Copa del Rey, the Europa League twice, and the UEFA Super Cup also twice, currently being the only serious rival of Real Madrid and Barcelona.", "The Spanish league has been clearly dominated by Real Madrid and Barcelona for a long time. In the beginning, the league was not as hegemonic as it is today and it was not clearly dominated by any club. From the mid-fifties on, Real Madrid took control over the league, being Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid his only serious rival. In the season 1989\u201390, Real Madrid had 15 leagues more than Barcelona. However, in the 90s, under the supervision of Johan Cruyff, Barcelona ended with the overwhelming dominance of Real Madrid. From that time on, the difference in leagues between them is gradually decreasing. Nowadays, Real Madrid and particularly Barcelona clearly dominate La Liga, being really hard for other teams to compete against them.", "A more plural league would be also a more interesting one. However, in my view, this situation is not likely to change any time soon. The Spanish league is highly monetized and there is an especial interest in the hegemony Real Madrid-Barcelona, as they are the teams that generate the most benefits.", "Although I like football, I have never been a big fan of it. I selected the topic nearly by chance without expecting to discover so many interesting things. I hope you have enjoyed reading this article as much as I enjoyed writing it.", "Lastly, I would like to thank my parents for their support. Without the long conversations about football with them, it would not have been possible to write this article. Thank you \ud83d\ude0a. And yes, we all support Atl\u00e9tico de Madrid \u2764\ufe0f", "Your home for data science.
