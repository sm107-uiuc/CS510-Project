As someone who has been following the progress of this framework for a while, this is exciting news and you should be excited, too.", "If you want to watch a video instead, check this out:", "With the 1.0 release, ML-Agents is available in Unity\u2019s Package Manager, which means you can install it right from the Unity Editor. Additionally, the syntax you learn now will probably not change drastically in the future. This is a huge relief for beginners who don\u2019t want to relearn everything, every time a new version gets released.", "To get started you just need to download Unity 2018.4 or beyond. That\u2019s it, for now. Later on, we will install Python to train our own networks but for inference (running the models) Unity is all we need. First, let us start a new project and install the package.", "Just select the ML-Agents package and hit install. Believe me, this has never been easier which is great.", "To get started quicker, we also need to download the examples. Sadly, there is not an optional sample download included in the Package Manager (Unity, please \u2764), so we have to download the repository. Decompress and open the downloaded repo, open up the Assets folder under Project, and simply drag the ML-Agents folder into the Editor. Now under Examples, you can find the 3DBall Scene. If we open it and press play we can see it is already working with a pre-trained Machine Learning model by Unity. The simplicity of this Framework really is its biggest strength.", "As you can see the blue agents are balancing the ball pretty much perfectly. This behavior is not hard-coded, it is learned. We will train our own version of this shortly.", "Now let\u2019s dive in a bit deeper and check out how this thing works. There are 12 Agents in this scene \u2014 they are all pretty much identical and just used to speed up and stabilize training. If we open one up, we can see it contains a child GameObject called Agent \u2014 this is where the magic \ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f happens. The two important scripts on this GameObject are the \u201cBehavior Parameters\u201d Script and the \u201cBall3DAgent\u201d script.", "In the ML-Agents Framework, Agents are the actors and the Behavior they are linked to determines how they act. An Agent requires a Behavior to function but it is also possible for multiple agents to be linked to the same Behavior, which comes in very handy in many situations like adversarial self-play.", "The Agent is responsible for collecting observations, executing actions, and assigning rewards. The Behavior, on the other hand, receives the collected observations and rewards and is responsible for determining the action to execute.", "There are three types of behavior:", "There are many ways of setting up your Agents and many more ways to train them, which drastically changes the outcome but there is only so much we can cover.", "Now that we have some basic knowledge \u2014 let\u2019s start training our own model. We will just use the default settings, for now, tweaking comes later.", "To train our own model, we need to install some prerequisites first. Make sure you have Python 3.6.1+ installed. If not, click here. Then all you have to do is a simple", "and you are done! No more installing. Now, cd into the previously downloaded repo, execute the following command:", "Wait for a few seconds. If everything went as expected, the message \u201cStart training by pressing the Play button in the Unity Editor.\u201d should appear and this is exactly what we do.", "Congratulations, you are now training an A.I. \ud83c\udf89 \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89", "As you can see, getting started with ML-Agents is really easy. There are complex concepts you need to grasp to master this framework but this is for another day. I hope this was helpful to you!", "Check out my Youtube Channel for A.I. related content.", "Your home for data science.
