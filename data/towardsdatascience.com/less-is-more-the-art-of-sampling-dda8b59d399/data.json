In every spare of life, we are using data science. It is an integral part of Machine Learning, IoT, Big Data, etc. Behind the scene, statistics drive all of these. It is the brain of the modern techniques. If you are moved by statistics, it\u2019s easy for you to make wise decisions. A statistical decision can also backfire your system if you are not an expert statistician. The sample is an essential element of statistics, which guides data scientists to analyze the whole topics more easily and effectively. Most often, it is almost impossible for a large data set to be processed and this is where a sample makes things\u2026 happen!", "\u201cI think it\u2019s being innovative and very creative to stay away from flat-out sampling somebody else\u2019s record. To me, that doesn\u2019t show too much of your creative side unless you take a little piece and add it, almost like spice on a chicken\u201d-Missy Elliott.", "A perfect quote to be followed to create an optimum sample for a better model.

We will discuss the following sections:", "The whole world takes a rest with the outbreak of the corona pandemic. Even the world still does not know how to behave with the pandemic.", "At November-17,2019, the first person was affected by coronavirus[1]. The medical specialist considered the case as pneumonia as it was not seen before. This virus spread out geometrically. And within a month, the virus affected many people. On 31 December 2019, WHO was informed of a cluster of cases of pneumonia of unknown cause detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province of China[2]. Now, the cases are increasing dramatically. According to WHO, statistics of the current situation is shown below.", "Find the updated statistics of coronavirus.", "Here, the knowledge of statistics comes in. At the beginning of the stage, the corona cases were a small number. Anyone could easily analyze the cases individually. What if when it turns into an epidemic! When the area of occurrence will become large, it goes beyond our capacity to analyze the individual case. Then what will we do in these circumstances? Will we give up? Not at all.", "For instance, we asked a data scientist to help us out there. And told him to find out the death rate of the coronavirus affected people. Then he requested us to collect the data of 300 confirmed cases. He also added, \u201cThese 300 cases are enough to know the behavior of all the corona cases.\u201d These 300 cases are the sample of the overall affected people in the world. If we consider all the 234073 confirmed cases (confirmed total), this sample will turn into a population. So, the population defines all the data of a specific case. The concept of sample and population may change if we change the question. How? Seems confusing!", "Whether a group of data is a sample or a population depends on what kind of question we are trying to answer. The image depicts that the total number of coronavirus confirmed cases is 234073 in the world. If we try to find out whether the people of the world are affected by the coronavirus, then group formed by 234073 coronavirus affected people is a population. Because the total number of coronavirus affected people is 234073. On the other hand, if we try to find out whether the people of the world are affected by any virus, then the group formed by 234073 people is a sample.

So, we should keep it in our minds while sampling.", "There are 5 types of players in the dataset. If we observe the column \u2018Pos\u2019 of the WNBA Player Stats Season 2016\u201317 dataset, we will find the following types of players.", "Only random sample selection may select some players which won\u2019t contain all 5 types of players. It may lead to a poor representative sample model. We can stratify all the 5 types of players.", "We can pick an equal number of players from each stratum(each stratified group is known as stratum) to make a sample. The best choice is to select the element proportionally. And this strategy is known as proportional stratified sampling.", "We can also stratify with other parameters. At the final step, we should select the best-stratified sample which provides the best-desired result.", "Sometimes, our dataset may not be well organized as like WNBA Player Stats Season 2016\u201317 dataset. It may be distributed or difficult to collect. In those cases, Cluster sampling helps to analyze the data efficiently.", "Let, you are dealing with coronavirus cases. You need to analyze the data of the whole world. Moreover, there is no central data center by which you can get data from the whole world. Now, you need to collect data on coronavirus cases from individual countries\u2019 websites. It may take a couple of months to collect data from all the countries of the world. And it is impractical. With such type of case, you need to select some countries randomly, considering a country as a cluster. Now, your task is to collect data from those selected countries. Such type of sampling is known as Cluster Sampling.", "Don\u2019t get worried, you are on the right track. we just gave a few examples of sampling.

Your boss asks you to find out the customer category according to the transaction. Applying proper sampling techniques, you can easily find out your desire result.", "You may also come across a situation where the use of API is limited and you need to create an analysis model for the whole system. In these cases, you are forced to sample.", "There are also so many cases where sampling is a must in data science.", "Sampling is a huge topic in statistics.
