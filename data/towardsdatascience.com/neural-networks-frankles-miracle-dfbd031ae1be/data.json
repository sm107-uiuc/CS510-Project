And, the method is dead simple. When you add up the utility gained at the edge, these researchers are worth their weight in Californium. No exaggeration.", "Paul Erdos, one of the greatest and by far the most prolific mathematician of the last century, would fall in love with those proofs and theorems which, by their utter simplicity, elegance, breadth of impact, and insightful technique, must have come from \u201cThe Book.\u201d", "By that, Erdos meant that scroll of truths God used to make the world. Mathematicians gather around these proofs like pilgrims to religious shrines. They are what inspire us to spend decades in fruitless struggle. So, when I heard the news and saw Frankle\u2019s paper, his comment gave me chills: \u201cIt\u2019s\u2026from the Book.\u201d I suspect that he feels as if a golden gift fluttered into his lap. These truths are so simple that they seem to be the wrong turn in a maze, yet they open to impossible new vistas.", "And, when we look at the cascade of impacts that evolve from this sort of fundamental shift, it should become clear that this is a mighty tool \u2014 the Anvil of Hephaestus.", "To illustrate what\u2019s so valuable about Frankle\u2019s pruning, imagine you just spent $1,000 on an autonomous car, to earn income on the side as a taxi. That car, to pay itself down in six years, needs to put aside 50 cents a day \u2014 profits need to be more than that, and if profits are MUCH larger, that incentivizes more taxis.", "Now, compare that to a $1,000 CNC machine that spits out another autonomous taxi every two weeks. Whoa. That\u2019ll pay for itself quick, and generate enormous profits. Everyone would want to buy that CNC, because the cost of it is spread across a growing number of autonomous taxis.", "Not only are you incentivized by those profits; the increased supply lowers prices, and the lower capital costs per unit let you continue to profit at those prices. So, both the consumer and producer walk away with more money in their pockets, and at the same time, taxi services are hyper-abundant, generating huge value themselves.", "So, how does a pruning algorithm do that kind of thing for neural networks?", "When Google trained its most recent natural language model, it had to be run on massive parallel racks of specialized processors for weeks. Same deal with other recent behemoths; each one absorbs the use of the computer \u2014 one supercomputer, one instance of useful service at a time. If the demand for that service goes up, you\u2019ll need many more racks, so it remains expensive, partially depressing demand, which means the total value it provides to the market is diminished.", "In contrast, if you can shrink that titan to fit in a teacup, then each person\u2019s phone or laptop is sufficient to generate that useful service. And, rolling that service out to hundreds of millions of users is practically free. So, the initial supercomputer time generates more dollars per \u2018FLOPs.\u2019 Additionally, and most importantly, that computer can go on to develop more phone-app sized AI, pumping them out like our CNC machine that makes autonomous taxis. Each one of those apps provides utility to so many people, at minimal cost, that it will drive investment into every tailored application much faster than it would otherwise.", "This ties-in with Jevon\u2019s Paradox \u2014 when machines become more energy-efficient, then each dollar of energy generates more revenue, so you end up using more energy because it\u2019s efficient. Total demand for energy increases. Considering how many orders of magnitude cheaper Frankelated networks are, and how easy it will be to roll-out numerous specialists, I expect that demand for energy, compute, data, talent, insight, will multiply greatly, accelerating development and deployment across the entire industry.", "As our global crisis painfully illustrates, an exponential curve that is even just slightly steeper quickly becomes overwhelming. And, if you can delay an exponential for even a brief moment, that percent loss is carried through every future moment, with a cumulative discounted cost at least 8 times greater than the loss apparent at the moment of delay. And so, disease that doubles every three days, delayed for six, has one quarter as many sick at all future times.", "Similarly, if you take a leap ahead in an exponential, you have a huge cumulative discounted gain. Increasing the steepness of that exponential does even more. As far as I can tell, Frankle\u2019s beautiful bonsai is a leap up a steepening curve. If 1 billion people benefit more than 35 cents a day, each, then it\u2019s worth trillions, over the course of the trend, as a conservative estimate. A supercomputer AI on every phone will likely help much more than that.", "What amazes me most is that this technique can exist at all! What was it within the abstract, vaporous world of mathematics that allowed this method to succeed? Frankle must have heard the whispers of Ramanujan\u2019s angels. It\u2019s the sort of beautiful, mysterious coincidence that makes me nod solemnly to stories of Pythagoras \u2014 \u201cThe Universe is Made of Number.\u201d", "Your home for data science.
