Visualizing data related to important topics like this in the form of graphs is usually a great way to get a better grasp of the situation.", "However, when studying a topic, especially if it\u2019s as complicated as this one, one figure is usually not enough, and you might want to plot the same figure across different target variables as well. So, instead of doing that, in this post, we\u2019ll be going over how to use Plotly Dash to create an interactive dashboard containing all the information you\u2019ll want to show. You can follow along through Google Colab.", "The datasets we\u2019ll be using to build our dashboard on the pandemic and how a country\u2019s income and education level might have impacted how they dealt come from the COVID-19 Worldometer Daily Snapshots and The World Bank\u2019s 2020 Human Capital Index, both of which are available on Kaggle.", "As to keep things simple, we\u2019ll be using the columns on the total cases, deaths, tests, and recovered cases from the first dataset and the income group and expected years of education columns from the second one.", "To get our final dataset, which we\u2019ll be using to make our interactive dashboard, we\u2019ll first need to work out some issues.", "The COVID-19 dataset has 2 instances, each for a separate date. As we only want to work with the most recent data, we\u2019ll be dropping everything that comes before. We\u2019ll also be converting the names of the columns to snake case, which should make working with the data easier.", "The country names for the same country can differ between datasets. To fix that we\u2019ll be using the Pycountry library to map them all to the same format. Then, we can finally merge both datasets using the Pandas merge() method.", "To finally get into making our dashboard, we\u2019ll need the Dash libraries as well as Plotly, since that\u2019s what we\u2019ll be using to plot the graphs.", "Plotly can be installed with the following line:", "The Dash libraries can be installed as follows:", "When creating a Dash app, the first thing you\u2019ll have to worry about is setting up your application\u2019s layout, which is done in HTML. Luckily, Dash provides us with functions that act as HTML tags, allowing us to create Divs, Headers, and other components through the dash_html_components library.", "You can even use CSS through the style argument of the methods. To use it, you pass it a dictionary with the keys corresponding to the CSS properties in camelCase and the dictionary\u2019s values corresponding to the values you want to give to each property.", "Aside from the HTML, you can also add graphs and various types of input components from the dash_core_components libraries. The graph components will be our plots. If you don\u2019t plan on making the dashboard interactive, you can simply attribute a plot made in Plotly to them via the figure argument of the methods. But in our case, we\u2019ll instead define their ids so we can use them interactively.", "With our layout out of the way, we can get down to making the plots and having them receive data from the input components, which are, in this case, a Dropdown and Slider components from the core components library.", "We associate our graphs to our input components via the callback functions. When using one of these, we list our output and input variables through the Output and Input functions from the dash.dependencies module, which takes in the unique ids we gave them when building the layout, as seen above.", "The code will then execute the following function using the input variables and link what it returns to the output variable, which is, in this case, our graphs.", "When defining our function to plot the graphs, we can simply plot them as we would normally but replacing the variables we want to be interactive with the input variables the function takes in.", "And then, finally, we write the code to run our dashboard and get the final product of all the code we wrote so far.", "Looking at our final dashboard, which I have hosted on Heroku for ease of viewing, we can notice that the cases of COVID-19 are higher in countries with a higher income, which makes sense given that they\u2019re more economically active and tend to have more people in constant circulation, and a higher education level doesn\u2019t outweigh that.", "And, more importantly, we have learned how to make visualizations that can more effectively reveal those insights by gathering all the relevant information into a single place.", "How to host a Plotly Dash app in Heroku:", "Your home for data science.
