The progress of artificial intelligence in optimisation and the creation of new use cases is undeniable, making it a commodity today. The capabilities to see patterns in complex data and the ability to reason on huge datasets result in global industry adoption.", "The transition from academic research to broadly applied use cases is blazing fast. Once a new algorithm or computer chip is presented to the public, you hear about another technology already being announced for release in the next quarter of the current year. In this vertigo, there are three types of machine learning which are, supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning. The first two have seen the biggest adoption in the industry so far. These methods utilise huge datasets often already found in enterprises, making it look like natural progress.", "Reinforcement learning is the third pillar of AI", "The third area of learning utilises software agents, performing actions in an environment to get the biggest rewards. This is the field of reinforcement learning (RL) that requires even more data for training and learning. To utilise RL, you need an environment that provides constant flows of data to give feedback to the software agent that is a part of the RL concepts. With lots of sensors and high dimensional and continuous input vectors, the needed data requirements might be extremely huge. To achieve a usable outcome, you could often not rely on historical data, but you need to create a simulation environment where the training takes place.", "The effort is huge, but the possible gain is incredibly large. Reinforcement learning is seen as a way to create really smart machines that could solve problems in a man-like fashion. It is seen as the right key to autonomous driving, flying, and swimming. It will make robots move using more complex patterns and help machines to understand what they are asked for. In complex systems like turbines or power grids, in optimised enterprise environments with immense high speed and real-time dataflows, reinforcement learning understands patterns and comes to meaningful conclusions.", "What is happening in RL now?", "It sounds too good to be true that we are at the verge of reducing labour costs to zero. No more supervision of factories and production facilities will be needed, employees could no longer be exposed to dangerous workplaces. Despite the priority and current success of other deep learning approaches, the reinforcement learning community is also a very vibrant one. A lot of academic research, promising use cases, and early industrial adoption are taking place in 2020.", "When we talk about algorithmic research the main reinforcement method is deep reinforcement learning. Algorithms are optimised constantly, and their performance tested against established algorithms. Two of the latest successful algorithms are deep Q networks (DQN) and Soft Actor Critic (SAC).", "A DQN algorithm was part of Google Deep Mind\u2019s AlphaGo system, which beat Lee Sedol in the game Go in 2015. This successful DQN led to further Algorithms like double DQN (DDQN), dueling DDQN, or DDRQN-AD. This DDRQN-AD, an abbreviation for \u201cdeep distributed recurrent Q-networks with action discovery\u201d, for example, was applied in Guangdong, China. There it was tested for the optimisation of safe and economical operation of the interconnected power grids.", "Another algorithm you could not bypass is SAC. A lot of research and experimentation shows the superiority of this approach which fosters more freedom in exploration. The Soft Actor Critic algorithm maximises the \u201centropy\u201d in a RL policy. This is a strategy that enriches the expected reward from the environment. So, it gives the policy more randomness which helps with better robotic movements for continuous and discrete actions.", "With a SAC-based algorithm, Google and UC Berkeley trained a four-legged robot in just under two hours to walk nicely. This robot also learned to generalise, so it could react to things and situations unseen before. The speed of learning in this example shows that real-world learning in non-simulation environments is possible in a feasible amount of time.", "For the heavy industry, a lot of use cases are ready to utilise reinforcement learning. Oil and gas, mining and discrete manufacturing are three main areas to start the trend. The most prominent is the autonomous movement. Things have to be moved around in the industry all the time and often this transportation occurs in dangerous or hazardous environments. RL is the best-suited approach to develop vehicles that perform very well in complex terrains. So, we will see drones that do inspections on-site, haul trucks and trains transporting overburden and ores. These systems go beyond traditional automated guided vehicles (AGV). The RL-trained smart self-driving vehicles feature flexible navigation, autonomous dispatching, and they optimise themselves all the time. One good example is an adaptive control of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). All these systems can follow higher abstraction commands and orders.", "The second predominant batch of use cases is the real-time process management and optimisation of energy flows. Everything from the world of power grids could be optimised with RL. From operations and maintenance of microgrids to the optimisation of emergency control procedures, RL could be applied to all the control flows. Heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems (HVAC) are another candidate for optimisation, as energy consumption is a huge cost factor for all industrial sites.", "The third big fields where the utility of RL comes into play are complex movements and short training times for robots. Robots and supporting machines are present in all areas of industrial activity. Most of the robots and automation systems do quite simple and repetitive tasks. The next big steps are robots that could make movements as smooth and dexterous as human workers. When you look at the manual work at a slaughterhouse for example. There happens a lot of dangerous cutting and chopping on complex structured slaughtered animals. Every piece of meat is different and to optimise production the workers need a lot of experience on how to proceed. With RL robots will learn to swing the knives as good as their human coworkers. When you look at the tedious task of programming industrial robots in a conventional way, there is a lot of headroom for optimisation. With RL the robots could follow the movements of humans in a way similar to athletes following an instructor at the gym. The teacher takes the arm of the robot and moves it in the correct way. The robot follows and optimises the given movement to its own capabilities.", "Further, the RL helps with transportation on the factory, optimises the flows in pipelines and transportation routes and even automates drilling process. It might be carefully tested in industrial process control applications as well as in-vehicle routing, fleet management, job shop scheduling and other optimization tasks.", "As of today, reinforcement learning is not being applied industry-wide. However, there are a lot of ready to implement solutions available. There are AI-powered platforms and providers who have industrial clients using RL already. And there are a lot of individual solutions that are in the final stage their pilot phases. These solutions are far beyond prototyping and have proven themselves in the field. In total, there are two main approaches for RL adoption.", "On one side, there are engineering and high-tech companies developing individual solutions for specific industrial problems. The most widespread solutions are specific autonomous vehicles fulfilling tasks. One specialised case is inspection drones. They\u2019re quite popular, as the drone technology is quite mature and inspection payloads have proven themselves ready for industrial use. These solutions may not focus on the cutting edge of RL technology, but they offer the optimisation of use cases and they create new value propositions. Despite the lack of taking the latest developments in research of RL into account, these approaches show the feasibility of RL application.", "On the other side, there are platform providers like pathmind or bons.ai. They offer reinforcement learning services from an ecosystem perspective. These IT companies provide expertise in algorithms and data management for application in specific industries. They make enterprise solutions to support each company\u2019s subject matter experts. This helps the experts in their daily work and support optimisation projects.", "For 2020 the main applications of RL are autonomous vehicles and enterprise or network-wide solutions. Power grids and enterprise AI show the closest connection to pure IT and have lower hurdles for implementation. They need less traditional engineering effort for operation. However, hypersmart robotics and highly specialised solutions are on the way and beyond prototyping.", "The speed in the progress of new developments in artificial intelligence, in general, is very high. And so is the speed of improvements in reinforcement learning. Despite the peak of hype in AI has passed in the recent year, 2020 promises a lot of fruitful developments in machine learning. Due to the massive attraction AI created in the past years, a lot of the technology and algorithms are ready to be applied in the industrial context. However, for large companies the way from the pilot project to enterprise-wide integration is long. A lot of competence is needed to be developed by the core employees and some disruptive AI approaches require the change of production and business processes.", "Beyond the hype or when to opt-in", "But, from leaders in technology, nobody is waiting. Elon Musk is pushing a whole industry with Tesla Inc. This is possible because the core technology for autonomous driving hardware and software is held by Tesla itself. So, they can integrate the latest update in AI algorithms without delay. They control the data.", "Alphabet Inc. the parent company of Google is pushing the limits of AI in various fields. They have created showcases like AlphaZero which outperforms human excellence. And Microsoft is bringing AI technology and solutions to all industries and cares for their needs. These examples are only the peak of IT industry giants fostering the development of AI.", "Then there are myriads of AI startups coming up with new solutions every day. They\u2019re solving specialised problems and help with new methods of costs saving and production optimisation. This marketplace is still growing fast. So, an evaluation of these new options could not be ignored by any company.", "One of the most important questions for companies surely is the future of production. How can the production process be optimised further, and how can we save more costs? Here labour costs are still one of the dominant factors. Despite the myth that all labour could be replaced by robots, there is a significant change in the jobs at a connected efficient production plant. The employees lose their traditional jobs to do, but they\u2019re required for new challenges.", "When the decision to start with AI systems and reinforcement learning has been made, reinforcement learning systems must be trained. So, there needs to be a culture and skillset for robotics training. This releases the heavy industry from the burden of carefully protecting employees in a harsh environment and giving them extensive rest times. The workers are now needed as trainers and overseers. This changes the working hours as a lot of the shifts could be done by robots alone. But all this has to be done in a smart way to keep the operation at high levels of performance.", "The high speed of change in AI and the popping up of new solutions could put some pressure on decision-makers. They could not ignore AI technologies, as the chances to make a big leap in performances are too great. Independent of the evaluation of RL solutions and the new technology-based ecosystems, some basic activities and precautions should be taken by all enterprises.", "Company-wide data sources should lead to a single data lake. A data lake is a structure of databases where all incoming and historical data is collected as one pool. The layout of the data lake needs to be prepared for future AI projects, as it\u2019s the sources all projects depend upon.", "And a more important step is to have some people ready to maintain and understand the company\u2019s own data lake. In this way, the gap between state-of-the-art artificial intelligence, including reinforcement learning innovations, and the company\u2019s own expertise is not widening. The company has at least had to be ready to start RL projects when the decision will have been made to proceed in AI. These preparatory steps help to keep more options open for future developments.", "Another important task is to evaluate your own pace. Investigate what are the company\u2019s strengths and weaknesses. Look at your employees and estimate their willingness and capabilities to embrace AI. This gives you insights on how quickly new RL systems could be implemented and what other training activities need to be planned. In this way, you\u2019ll find the right pace that suits your enterprise.", "The recent progress in RL is especially seen in the main fields of its application. You could not think about autonomous vehicles and robotics without reinforcement learning. Here the practical value at the production site and for a lot of other tasks could not be denied. And the solutions are ready for deployment.", "The second field where RL is used today is power management and energy flows. HVAC systems and microgrids could be easily upgraded with RL based control systems. Here especially Chinese companies are leading the field. RL control systems show their superiority in managing sustainable energy sources. With the daily growing impact of climate change and stricter regulations and requirements for the industry, RL offers good solutions for compliance.", "At the moment there is the transition from academia and research to real-world prototypes and pilot projects happening in reinforcement learning. With the needed competence and employee aptitudes required to roll out a successful RL project, it always takes a decent amount of time to get everything running.", "So, when is the right moment to start with reinforcement learning in your enterprise? How much effort should you put in solving problems and optimising processes with RL? How could you utilise the promises in increased performance for your specific use case?", "This is an individual question and needs deep analysis. The pressure is high, and IT companies are offering new RL solutions on a quarterly basis. A solid plan and early evaluation seem to be a good approach for your reinforcement learning strategy. Today RL is not an off-the-shelf solution. Some RL modules and components could be integrated as black boxes right away, but the deeper transformation takes time. There is a chance to fall behind, but waiting for others to prove the solution could also be a feasible option. However, you need to be prepared for taking action in this fast-paced world.", "A full reference list is available here.", "AI Solution Architect at Zyfra.
