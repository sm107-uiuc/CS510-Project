The process was as follows:", "Utilizing an ROC curve, this former process had an area under the curve of 95%. An ROC curve is a standard way of visualizing comparisons between different classification models by juxtaposing the True Positive Rate (TP/P) and the False Positive Rate (FP/N). This method works well when right and wrong are the only important outcomes. Predicting the Super Bowl from regular season data with 32 teams is not an easy task; therefore, the testing system should reflect that variability and award points for close predictions, even if they are not true positives. It was concluded that the ROC curve was not an effective measurement tool.", "As I mentioned in my previous post, there were some areas where I wanted to delve deeper, namely points six through nine. This article highlights an entirely new robust testing system, two column selection techniques (Random Forest and a novel \u201cRFE Loop\u201d method), as well as an additional algorithm/model (Neural Network). My previous article included data for the first 13 weeks of the season, but with the completion of the regular season, this article includes my final prediction for the Super Bowl winner of the 2019\u20132020 NFL season.", "As a reminder, Figure 1 shows the data sources used.", "Each team\u2019s stats are independent events relative to that team for a specific year. This means that all calculations or comparisons were performed after grouping by year and performing range normalization in order to clearly rank each team within each stat for that year.", "The new testing system reflects a cumulative total of each year\u2019s predictions to ensure unbiased scoring and award points for predictions that are \u201cclose\u201d but not necessarily correct. The scoring rules are set in Table 1.", "The new system calculates scores for each year that contains a Super Bowl for a maximum yearly score of 30 points. This process is repeated for all years, which yields a maximum score of 1590 for the 53 years of the Super Bowl era. For each year, the data for that year is held for testing, while the rest is used for training.", "The rationale behind the scoring system is that the \u2018Winning Conference Score\u2019 and the \u2018Losing Conference Score\u2019 represent whether the model can accurately predict the contenders of the Super Bowl. Predicting the correct Super Bowl winner earns 10 points in order for the testing system to favor Super Bowl winner predictions. There are 12 teams that make the playoffs, 6 from the AFC and 6 from the NFC. Due to this playoff structure, the maximum feasible distance for any team would be 5 spots from the top of the conference. If a team exceeds this distance, the model would be predicting a team that did not make it to the playoffs resulting in negative points.", "To further understand the scoring system, I will walk through an example of scoring the predictions for the 2018 Super Bowl (with fake numbers for illustration purposes). The winner of the 2018 Super Bowl was the New England Patriots, while the loser was the Los Angeles Rams. The example predictions follow in Figure 2.", "In the predictions with both conferences together, the Patriots are ranked second and the Rams are ranked fourth. The teams are separated into their respective conferences because ultimately, the winner of the AFC will play the winner of the NFC. Once separated, the Patriots are now first in their conference and the Rams are second.", "With the new testing system in place, several column selection techniques were attempted to improve the model. The widely used Random Forest and newly established \u201cRFE Loop\u201d (described in detail below) were both added to the list of tested methods which previously included the RFE method along with the \u201cinitial columns\u201d. The initial columns featured in the last article were discovered through a combination of RFE and information gain.", "The Random Forest algorithm can be used for feature selection as well as for classification. The idea for a decision tree is that all observations can be split by any of the attributes in terms of a True or False statement (e.g touchdowns > 30). Random Forest is a combination of decision trees (1000 in our case). The algorithm randomly selects a column, and then uses the Mean Decrease in Impurity (MDI) otherwise known as the Gini importance to maximize the split (Breiman 2001). \u201cIt is defined as the total decrease in node impurity (weighted by the probability of reaching that node (which is approximated by the proportion of samples reaching that node)) averaged over all trees of the ensemble.\u201d (Lee 2017). Essentially, the algorithm looks for the features that will split the data up the most.", "Utilizing the Recursive Feature Elimination method, I developed a novel method for choosing the important columns in the dataset. RFE selects a random subset of all of the columns and employs a decision function that decides which columns of that subset are the most important columns. It repeats this process until the number of columns left equals the number specified by the user.", "To select important columns of the dataset, I have developed a novel method using RFE which I have called RFE Loop. In RFE Loop, a dictionary keeps track of a count of the important columns, for each year being tested. Once all years have been tested, the dictionary is checked and the columns (number of columns specified by user) with the highest counts are chosen as the most important columns. This technique works very well when paired with a K-fold or hold one out test method because of the repetition that the algorithm is already running through.", "In addition to two new column selection techniques, a neural network was built using Keras from TensorFlow to try and compete with the Logistic Regression model. Neural networks generally work well with high dimensionality data, as well as large quantities of numeric data. The NFL dataset that I have scraped does not have a large quantity of data (1579 observations), but it does have high dimensionality (137 columns). The model was created several times, using different numbers of hidden layers and with parameters:", "As demonstrated by Figure 3, the best combination of techniques / methods is the Logistic Regression, with the missing values being handled by the previously computed by MICE file, and the Initial columns featured in my first article Super Bowl Prediction Model. This combination is best for both the number of correctly predicted Super Bowls and Total Score. Figure 3 includes:", "The RFE Loop method has a Total Score that is slightly less than the Total Score for the initial columns. In addition, the initial columns correctly predict two more Super Bowls. The baseline model is the Logistic Regression with all of the columns and the mean for missing values. This baseline does slightly better than some of the other combinations when it comes to correct Super Bowl predictions, but it loses to almost all of the other models for the Total Score. The only exception is the neural network with all of the columns, and the previously computed MICE values. Figure 3 visualizes the different combinations of models and how well they perform, while Figure 4 breaks down the different methods in terms of Total Score when compared to each other.", "Figure 4 clarifies the degree to which each technique contributes towards the Total Score when compared to each other. For the model selection, on average, Logistic regression scored about 2.7% higher than the Neural Network. For column selection, the RFE loop performs 20% higher than when all of the columns were used, 3.3% higher than the next highest method of initial columns, and 10.9% higher than using just RFE. The Random Forest technique performs marginally better than the plain RFE method. It is important to mention that the RFE method takes about 45 seconds per year (53 years total) while the random forest technique takes about 5 minutes per year. This time difference is not worth the slight gain in Total Score.", "Moving on to data imputation, the previously computed MICE values perform 6.2% higher than just using the mean. To highlight the slight variation among each of the MICE computations, the difference between the previously computed MICE values and the newly computed MICE values is about 3%. This reveals that results may slightly vary if the previously computed values are not used.", "Overall, it is clear that the Column Selection has the highest impact given the wide range of Total Scores possible for the different methods used. When it comes to model selection, the steps that lead up to the final algorithm are far more important than the \u201cmodel\u201d chosen. Each part of the modeling process can greatly affect the outcome of the prediction capacity, but the most important part is the column selection, according to this project. Column selection is most likely the most important part of the modeling process due to the number of statistics captured by the NFL. The ability to discern which statistics are the most meaningful is the epitome of this project.", "The 20 columns selected by the RFE Loop technique are shown below in Table 5.", "After all 12 models were tested, I was curious to see if there were any years that most of the models predicted correctly. It turned out that six years (1972,1979,1985,1991,1996, and 2003) stood out where all 12 models predicted them correctly.", "1979: 12\u20134 Pittsburgh Steelers tied for the best record with the San Diego Chargers", "1996: 13\u20133 Green Bay Packers with 37 more touchdowns scored by the Offense than allowed by the defense. The next highest was the 49ers with only 18.", "Record clearly has a large influence for prediction in that teams with good records tend to have other good stats. Visualization of the entire testing process can be seen below in Figure 6 after selecting the best methods discussed earlier (Logistic Regression, RFE Loop, and previously calculated MICE values).", "Figure 6 shows the predicted winner, actual winner, and Super Bowl contenders for all years. This demonstrates that even when the model is incorrect, it may just be predicting the loser of the Super Bowl as the winner. For example, in 2015, the Carolina Panthers played the Denver Broncos in the Super Bowl game. The model predicted the Carolina Panthers, when the actual winner was the Broncos. Therefore, although the model was incorrect, it still predicted a team that participated in the Super Bowl.", "To conclude, the new testing system allowed model comparisons that previously were not possible. The system allowed a comparison between a neural network and the previous Logistic Regression. In addition, two new column selection techniques were tested, with \u201cRFE Loop\u201d taking first spot for best average Total Score. The overall model change is shown in orange in Figure 7.", "Using this improved prediction model, the 2019 Super Bowl predicted winner as of the divisional round, is the San Francisco 49ers with a 36% chance of victory as shown below in Figure 8.", "A fully automated model version is posted on my Github at https://github.com/kelandrin/Superbowl-Prediction-Model/", "Please feel free to download and play around with the different features!", "Just make sure that the appropriate packages are downloaded (Listed at the top of the main file) and then run the main file and you are good to go!", "Your home for data science.
