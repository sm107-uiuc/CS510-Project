Like Spotify\u2019s. In that particular dataset, each row has very important information about songs like energy, acousticness, danceability, etc. While those variables present the attributes of a song, a song can also be expressed entirely, as a composition in the form of data.", "To understand how we can make datasets from musical pieces, it is important to understand some basic stuff about music theory. I will try to explain that very briefly for those who are not much familiar with the terms.", "A note is a musical sound. There are 12 notes in music: C, C # (sharp) or D flat, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, and B. After B, a new octave starts from C again. Notes are played in a particular tempo. Tempo determines how fast or slows that particular music piece is. There is another thing called \u2018Time Signature\u2019 which determines the number of beats in each \u2018Bar\u2019 of a particular piece of music. A bar is a segment of time. For example, if the time signature is 4/4 (4 by 4), that tells us that there are 4 beats in a bar and it takes 4 bars to complete a \u2018cycle\u2019 of music. When more than one note is played together, for example, when C, E, and G are played together, it forms a chord.", "Expressions are an important part of the music. There are different dynamics involved when someone plays the piano, a guitar, or any instrument. It is about how the sound of a particular instrument or human voice is \u201caltered\u201d. There are many ways to do this. For example, pianissimo is a subtle expression where the sound is very lightly expressed which is the opposite of fortissimo, which is a very loud sound. There are also expressions like a slur, staccato, crescendo, etc. All of these expressions make music a \u2018language\u2019 to interact and helps to convey certain emotions.", "Let\u2019s take a look at what is already happening with data and audio.", "Sonification of data is a popular topic in recent days. There are many examples out there.", "Just like data can be seen visually, data can also be heard! The pitch of the sound follows a particular curve as the curve goes up and down. Some follow a chromatic pattern and some represent the data through a scale. If compared to visualization, I think of these scales as \u2018colors\u2019 used in a graph. There are even programs like TwoTone and MIDITime to convert data to sound.", "On the other hand, converting audio to data is also widespread research that has been happening and made tremendous development through deep learning.", "However, there are differences in various contexts of sound and music. Turning sound into music requires thought and an artistic approach which makes the difference.", "The answer is simple: Yes! But things can get more interesting when other properties of music are brought into consideration.", "When we look at a piano, we see white and black keys on it. Those are nothing but those twelve notes that I mentioned in the beginning. Now, when someone plays a piece on the piano, s/he is pressing those reeds. While composing music on a computer through various production software, these piano reeds can be seen in a MIDI sequencer. It\u2019s called \u2018piano roll\u2019.", "We can see bars on the x-axis and the notes or piano reeds on the y-axis. Those little boxes are telling us which notes are played at what particular point of a bar.", "This particular piece can be converted into a simple dataset if we just rotate the Piano Roll!", "The reeds will be columns or features and the notes or the boxes are just like binary values. We can make a dataset with corresponding notes as TRUE or 1. Just like we treat each row in a dataset as observations, here the observations would be bar or time.", "But a piece of music can have other attributes.", "For example, how loud or soft a note is played. In monophonic music, that requires just another column to express the dynamic in numbers. It can be from 0 to 128 where 128 is the loudest.", "Also, Articulations! There are many different articulations used in music. Some of them are instrument specific. These are like different consonants or vowels of speech. For example, different kinds of sounds can be produced on the violin, just by using the bow differently. For monophonic music, this is also a matter of including another column in the dataset.", "Now let\u2019s see Twinkle Twinkle Little Star\u2019 in a dataset format. It looks something like this", "In the dataset above, we can see those twelve notes of a single octave as columns and each beats as observations or rows. Also, Dynamic in each note is expressed as numbers joined by Articulations, assuming this piece is played by a violinist.", "Until now the inclusion of the notes was simple. But it can be challenging in the following contexts", "I was wondering whether the design of datasets can be modified from having only rows and columns to include something in the Z-axis. Because making a dataset of a musical piece of multiple voices including the articulations and dynamics of every single note requires lots of columns for every single second or beat. Each note can have individual dynamics and articulation. So that becomes even more complex for polyphony in a single instrument and you can guess the level complexity when it comes to an orchestra or ensemble.", "This is not the end. Other music genres are based on sound designs. Where there are more synthetic elements involved. Just like the soundtrack \u2018Home\u2019 from the movie \u2018Dunkirk\u2019. There are scopes of further research about how the music of this kind can be turned into a dataset.", "Now, the question is what can be done with these datasets which are pieces of music? Audio recognition and implementation of AI is already there.", "Possibilities are endless. We can extract granular information about music and art from music datasets. That can open doors for new research for the music industry and also for the record labels, artists, producers, and technicians behind it. These datasets can also be used to analyze the reaction of listeners to particular parts of a song. Or simply, they can be used just to preserve music for computation which can give birth to a lot of interesting unknowns about music, musicians, and how they connect each other through data.", "Your home for data science.
