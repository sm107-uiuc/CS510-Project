As an interviewer, you are in a position of privilege. With that privilege comes a responsibility \u2014 of going through the interviewee\u2019s resume in detail, of preparing some basic questions, of understanding what kind of work they\u2019re coming from and what kind of work they\u2019re looking for. I came to the conclusion that I should \u2014", "Ask questions from the work they have done, not from the work you have done", "I read somewhere how Elon Musk hires his team. Of course hiring a data engineer is not the same as hiring a rocket scientist, but there\u2019s definitely some overlap in hiring for any field of work. He says \u2014", "What I\u2019m really looking for is evidence of exceptional ability. Did they face really difficult problems and overcome them? And of course you want to make sure if there was some significant accomplishment, were they really responsible or was someone else more responsible. Usually, someone who really had to struggle with a problem, they really understand it and they don\u2019t forget.", "According to research, anxious people usually get a low performance rating on an interview. So, before you get into any technical stuff, be sure to make them feel calm and comfortable. Ask if they want water. A thirty-second chit chat doesn\u2019t hurt. Simple things help.", "For data engineers and data analysts, one can obviously assume that they\u2019ll know SQL and maybe a little bit of basic Python (or something similar). If you\u2019re interviewing someone in the early stages of their career, they might not know the different flavours of SQL, so be open to accepting T-SQL, PL/SQL, SQL-92, use of session variables in MySQL, use of CTEs and whatnot. For example, if you have asked them to write a query \u2014", "Check their grasp on the subject and not if they can write the exact query that you are drooling over in your mind", "Many years ago, I interviewed for a campaign management firm in Gurgaon. The technical interviews were mostly about SQL. They were working on MS SQL Server, I was well versed in Oracle 11g. They had asked something specific to MS SQL Server but then saw that I was going in the right direction and just kept observing where I was going. They asked me to explain what I was trying. I did clear that interview.", "If they understand how to query, if they are able to think on the spot, chances are they\u2019ll grasp whatever new flavour of SQL you want them to work on. Unless you\u2019re hiring for someone who\u2019ll fix everything there\u2019s wrong with your architecture, you won\u2019t need an expert who has 10 years of experience on a specific ETL tool.", "Overall experience and breadth of knowledge matter more than specialization in just one thing", "Never forget to ask something very basic about databases and applications. You\u2019ll get an idea if they\u2019ve just developed a skill with sheer brute force or do they have some understanding of how things work. For instance, a database engineer should always be able to answer questions about transactions, types of databases. Similarly, a SQL data analyst should always be able to write simple queries like the standard third highest salaried people in every department of a given company and so on.", "If they get stuck with a query or a piece of code, help them. Don\u2019t be a sadist and laugh inside", "While asking them to write a query or some piece of code, do remember to help them along the way. I appeared for an interview for one of the FAANGM companies long ago. I didn\u2019t get in but I remember the interviewers being so very helpful. They were helping me out where I was making a mistake or when I was going the wrong way. The whole experience was great.", "Never forget the fact that as you are interviewing multiple people for the same position, they\u2019re also interviewing for other positions. Many people want the job you have to offer. Many people want the interviewee who\u2019s in front of you. Get inside the room with a positive, approving mindset. Look for the positives rather than the negatives first.", "Once that\u2019s taken care of, try to sell the job to them even before you ask your first question. It\u2019s important that this message gets across \u2014 that you are taking this interview as seriously as they are. Finding good data engineers and data analysts is hard anyway. Don\u2019t make it harder on yourself by being an ignorant interviewer.", "What I have shared is not just from taking loads of interviews but also appearing for them. Sitting on both sides of the table gives you perspective. The questions I talked about were mostly about assessing the technical skillset of an interviewee. For behavioural questions, follow a more generic guide on conducting interviews.", "I hope some of this is useful.", "Your home for data science.
