Looking back at my bookshelf, I found three more books that have helped to program in Python. This past year, I worked to architect new tools and technologies for data scientists within my company to leverage and have found resources like these to be valuable when I get stuck on an issue. The three books I have found the most helpful to date are Python for Everybody: Exploring Data in Python3, Python Cookbook, and Clean Architecture.", "Even if you\u2019ve been programming for a while, this is an excellent refresher book. Python for Everybody first walks through why you should learn to program and what it means to program. This book is a great introductory read for anyone who has little to no experience programming. After walking through why you should program and what programming is, the book goes into detail about variables, expressions, and statements. This introduction leads nicely into how you can work with conditional executions, functions, and iterations. Towards the end of the book, the author discusses object-oriented programming, interacts with databases and SQL, and goes into a brief introduction to data visualization.", "If you are getting into programming or need a refresher of the basics, I highly recommend taking a read. It is a great book to help clarify specific programming points in Python and aids in reinforcing the basic programming principles. The author has straightforward and clean examples that are easy to understand.", "Author: David Beazley and Brian K. Jones", "Python Cookbook has been on my bookshelf for a while now and is a great reference to have when you need quick examples of everyday Python tasks you may encounter. This book breaks down topics chapter by chapter with several detailed examples in each section. Upon reading the book\u2019s preface, you will note the author wrote the book for more experienced Python programmers looking to understand Python and modern programming idioms better. Each recipe in the book is written as a skeleton example to provide essential information to the reader. You are given a baseline understanding in which you can then go off and do more in-depth research on a topic if needed.", "I gravitated towards this book initially based on how the recipes were setup. Each recipe stands alone in its subsection of a chapter. For example, Chapter 8 focuses on Classes and Object, and Recipe 8.9 discusses creating a new class or instance attribute. In each recipe, you will find three sections: problem, solution, and discussion. The first section details the problem statement. Then, the solution goes into a code example and a brief description of the output. The discussion will get into more detail on the solution and any concerns, downsides, or disadvantages of this method. These examples are not all inclusive recipes, but they are a great starting point for understanding a concept and deciding if you need to research further information for your problem at hand.", "In my last article, I discussed the book Clean Code by the same author as a perfect book for software engineers and data scientists. Alongside that book is Clean Architecture, which is another excellent addition to your library. I purchased this book this year after developing different tools and libraries at work. In this book, the author breaks down what it means to have design and architecture for software and brief discussions on different programming paradigms. He goes into great detail on how to design software architectures and how to approach business rules.", "By reading this book, you will better understand what it means to architect code and how you can use different paradigms and principles in your work. Each section details various aspects of developing clean architecture, such as Part 3, where he details SOLID principles in terms of architecture. Overall, it is a great read that discusses how business logic should be self-contained within a clean architecture code-base. All in all, this is a great reference to add your bookshelf if you want to learn more about architecting code.", "If you read my last post on the topic, you would know the first three books I recommended for someone interested in data science and software development would be:", "As you continue on your journey, the next three books I recommend are:", "In that order, you will get a great introduction to Python first. As you get more into the language and look for more complex examples to explore, you can walk through the Python Cookbook. This book is a great resource to walk through skeleton examples to common problems. Moving out of the skeleton examples, you can begin to understand ways to architect your code and make better design decisions cleanly.", "Do you have any go-to books sitting on your shelf? If so, what are they?", "If you would like to read more, check out some of my other articles below!", "Your home for data science.
