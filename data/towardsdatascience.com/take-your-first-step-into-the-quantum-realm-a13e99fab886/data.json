Everywhere I looked said, to get started, I need to have some good knowledge about quantum physics, quantum mechanics, and basic linear algebra. Once I did, I needed to learn how to use Qiskit (Python library to program quantum computers) or another programming tool to start building quantum circuits and implementing quantum algorithms! And don\u2019t let me get started on needing to learn how quantum algorithms work!", "Things got very complicated very fast, which can be quite discouraging! \ud83d\ude16", "What if I told you that you could start building quantum circuits, with only basic knowledge of basic quantum gates and without any kind of coding?", "You read it correctly; we will build quantum circuits without using any code what so ever.", "The way to do that is by using special tools called quantum circuit simulators. To use any of those tools, you only need to know the definition of the three basics of quantum computing, qubits, superposition and entanglement, and what some basic quantum gates do.", "We will start with the basics of quantum computing:", "You can find more in-depth information about qubits, superposition, and entanglement in my article \u201cThe Three Pillars of Quantum Computing.\u201d", "Now that you know the fundamentals of quantum computing, we can start talking about basic quantum gates and then start building some circuits using them.", "There are many quantum gates out there; you can even create your custom gates once you fully understand the basic ones. Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits. They are operators that perform a specific function on one qubit or more. They are the quantum equivalent to classical logic gates, which are used in all technology today. However, unlike most classical logic gates, quantum gates are reversible, which means you can undo their effect by reapplying on the same qubits.", "Mathematically, quantum gates are represented using unitary operations. Unitary operations simply are square matrices (matrices with an equal number of rows and columns). On the other hand, the state of qubits is represented as a vector. Vectors, geometrically speaking, usually have an amplitude and a phase the represents its 3D location in space. To find the results of applying a gate to a qubit in any state, we simply multiply the gate\u2019s matrix by the qubit\u2019s state vector.", "We will start now talking about one-qubit quantum gates. Those are gates that operate on only one gate at a time. These gates can be extended to run on more qubits, as we will see shortly. In this article, we will cover the six fundamental quantum gates: the Identity gate, the Hadamard gate, Pauli (X, Y, and Z) gates, and the Controlled-not gate.", "The Identity gate (has a symbol I) is a single qubit gate that leaves the state of the qubit unchanged. Which may seem useless, I mean, why would we have a gate that does nothing? The I gate is useful for two reasons:", "The Not gate (X) is a single qubit gate the flips the qubit it operates on. If we give it |0\u27e9, it returns a |1\u27e9, and if we give it|1\u27e9, it will return a |0\u27e9. In applications with many superposition states, this gate is used to isolate particular states from the overall states.", "The Hadamard gate (H) is the magic gate \ud83c\udf1f. It is the gate responsible for creating the superposition of states. This gate puts the qubit in 50/50 superposition of states |0\u27e9 and |1\u27e9 despite whether the input state was |0\u27e9 or|1\u27e9. The H gate is probably the most import quantum gate, and it is the fundamental building block of many quantum algorithms.", "If the H gate is given |0\u27e9 as an input state, it will produce a superposition state that \u2014 quantum people \u2014 refer to as the plus state |+\u27e9. Wheres if we give the H gate a |1\u27e9 state, it will generate the minus state |\u2013\u27e9.", "The Y gate, similar to the X gate, is also a flip gate. The difference between those gates, however, is that the Y gate flips the state |0\u27e9 and then multiplies the results by an imaginary number j (adds a phase to it). This additional phase change makes this gate very useful for the creation of specific constructive/deconstructive interferences that are used in some algorithms.", "The Z gate is also a flip gate; however, this gate doesn\u2019t flip the value of the state; it instead flips its phase. This gate leaves the state|0\u27e9 amplitude\u2019s unchanged while multiplying the phase of state|1\u27e9 by -1.", "The Z gate\u2019s power comes from the fact that it only affects the |1\u27e9 state while leaving the |0\u27e9 untouched. This gate is frequently used for highlighting some states in the system while leaving others unaltered.", "All the single gate qubits we just walked through can be extended to controlled gates by adding control and target qubits. An example of how that might work is the controlled-not gate.", "The controlled-not (CX or as shown in the GIF) gate is our first gate that operates on two qubits. This gate is a conditional gate that performs an X gate on the second qubit (called target), if and only if the state of the first qubit (control qubit) is |1\u27e9. In combination with other gates, the CX gate will allow us to construct all kinds of multi-qubit operations.", "Okay, now that we got the basics down, let\u2019s talk about how to use these gate \u2014 and more \u2014 to build a quantum circuit. We will do so using a quantum circuit simulator.", "Quantum circuit simulators are special tools that allow you to build and simulate quantum circuits without needing to write any code or perform any mathematical tricks! Since quantum computing is an ongoing research field, new tools are developed frequently to help people get familiar with quantum gates and quantum circuits and prepare them to when the Quantum Era arrives. The best and easiest browser-based (no installation needed\ud83d\ude01) quantum circuit simulators, in my opinion, are:", "For the rest of this article, I will use the IBMQ circuit composer to simulate two simple circuits. Nevertheless, you can use any of the above simulators to experiment with quantum circuits.", "Once you open the IBMQ Circuit Composer, you will see this screen:", "You can apply gates to specific qubits by simply dragging and dropping them. If you need more qubits, you can click on the small + sign under the last qubit, which will add one more qubit to the circuit. You can remove a qubit by clicking on the qubit and pressing the DELETE key on the keyboard. On the right-hand side, you can see a bar chart showing the resulting state of the circuit. An empty circuit has a state |0000\u27e9. Every time you add a gate, the resulting state will change accordingly.", "We are now ready to build our first quantum circuit! Let\u2019s start with an easy one.", "Assume we want to create a circuit that flips the last qubit of any given state only if it was 1. For example, the state |1011\u27e9 would become |1010\u27e9 because the last bit was 1. However, if the input state is |1100\u27e9, the circuit won\u2019t make any changes and will return the same state. How can I achieve that?", "Initially, all qubits are set to the |0\u27e9 state, so we need to create the starting state, ex, state |1011\u27e9 first, and then apply some gates to flip the last digit of that state.", "Before we start, the way states are usually read is from right to left, which in the composer goes from top to bottom.", "Step 2: Flip the last qubit.", "To flip the last bit, we will add one more qubit to the circuit. This additional qubit will act as a control qubit. First, I need that qubit to be in state |1\u27e9 only if the last qubit of the circuit is 1; otherwise, it will be in state |0\u27e9. This can be achieved by using a CX gate on q[3] and q[4].", "As you can see, the resulting state now is |10111\u27e9; we can ignore the last one since it\u2019s an additional qubit we just added to help us achieve our goal. Which means our state is still unchanged. Next, we will use q[4] as a control in another CX gate and use that to flips q[3].", "But, what if I input a state with the last qubit equal to 0? Let\u2019s see what is going to happen!If we input the state |1000\u27e9 to the circuit, the resulting state will be the same as our input state.", "Yay! You just built your first quantum circuit without getting into quantum mechanics or writing in code! \ud83d\udc4f", "You can build any circuit if you know how it is supposed to work using circuit simulators, and once you get comfortable enough, you can start using code to create your circuits as you go deeper into the quantum realm.", "Your home for data science.
