Having worked at a few companies (business, finance, and tech), I can say that some companies completely do not use Tableau, especially the Data Scientists working there, while some companies can expect to have their Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers working with Tableau a few days per week. Ultimately, it depends on you, your team, and your business, if you want to utilize Tableau. Just because it is not already implemented in your current process, does not mean it cannot still be added whenever it feels like it is necessary to use it. Therefore, I am going to highlight what Tabeau could improve on, and what it is great at \u2014 in terms of Data Science and Machine Learning. Tableau as a Data Analtyics and visualization tool is outstanding and I recommend it. For Data Scientists, there are pros and cons and I will be describing those below.", "Tableau [2], is a useful tool, primarily for Business and Data Analysts. Some positions at companies even have a designated Tableau Developer that will only focus on creating reports and dashboards for their respective audiences or stakeholders. Some of the important ways that you can \u201cchange the way you think about data\u201d with Tableau are the following:", "I love using Tableau, personally, when creating visualizations quickly. I can use fancier Python packages, but sometimes, utilizing Tableau\u2019s SQL database connection services allows you to query, and essentially drag and drop to describe or visualize your data so that you can tell your story with style. Here is the link to the webpage for Tableau:", "Here\u2019s what Tableau doesn\u2019t do well for Data Scientists.", "Keep in mind, I am not saying this for general Data Analysts, what Tableau is intended for, I am highlighting these points for Data Scientists. These are three points that come to mind when working with Tableau \u2014 as you will see later on, there are plenty more positives or pros than possible improvements to be made:", "As Data Scientists, integration and automation are key. You like to or are used to having a process that unites all your processes together so that when you perform your business problem use case, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building, and deployment, you can easily refer to these steps all in one place or all in one process that is connected. I would enjoy having a way to display the visualizations made in Tableau to be shown in a Jupyter Notebook, or some type of similar integration.", "However, the fact that you can have a live database connection for direct SQL querying and report generation in Tableau is both awesome and useful.", "Now, this point may not happen to you at all, but sometimes you can find yourself with several tabs or sheets and dashboards, and all of a sudden you have this giant Tableau workbook that freezes, and is somewhat frustrating to keep on making new dashboards without deleting old ones.", "As a work-around, sometimes I start with a sample dataset and make the dashboards as a proof of concept, and then will apply the whole dataset for the final form.", "This point is not necessarily bad, since Tableau is not a Data Science tool. It does have some awesome applications that I will discuss below, but it would be interesting to see a separate Data Science section in the future.", "Here\u2019s what Tableau does do well for Data Scientists.", "EDA is often overlooked in Data Science processes, and it can make or break your model. Having the ability to visualize your data quickly before building the model (not having to write any Python code), is extremely beneficial. It is also useful to display charts, graphs, or other forms of visualizations for your Data Science or Machine Learning model metrics (like average accuracy per day).", "A neat feature is that you can set up alerts if the value of the graphed data is below or above a certain threshold \u2014 say you want to get an email that alerts you that your model just went under 80% accuracy for the first time in months, this alert could then be investigated where before it would be overlooked.", "Sometimes it takes a lot of work, or a lot of Python code (I do not use R so I will not speak to that), to create a somewhat unappealing chart. With Tableau, you can make fancy visualizations in a few seconds without coding.", "I spoke to this point a little above, but want to stress that you can visualize your model metrics or output easily with Tableau \u2014 assuming your results, confidence score, suggestions, etc, are stored in a SQL database. You can, perhaps, output all of the categorizations from your model that had a low confidence score so that they can be manually reviewed by subject matter experts in your company, furthering your accuracy improvements along the way.", "What you can do in SQL, you can do in Tableau, essentially. You can paste your queries and reference them to make anything in Tableau \u2014 you can also use a static Excel/CSV file, for example, if you are working with data that does not necessarily need to be live.", "I saved the best for last, this benefit of Tableau is awesome. You can perform a clustering model [3 ] without any code! Yes, since you are not building it yourself, it will not be as tunable,", "\u2026but you can make a Data Science model in less than a day with this awesome feature of Tableau.", "A great use case for clustering in Tableau is a quick and easy way to find similarities between groups of customers so that you can market towards them differently \u2014 think marketing campaigns.", "Ultimately, Tableau was not intended for Data Scientists, so it is rather impressive how useful it is for us. There are several more pros than cons that I have discussed, and most likely even more pros with some creativity. As someone who is a visual learner and presenter, I really enjoy using Tableau. It is a nice break from Python code for me, and I appreciate that the visualizations can be as easy as dragging and dropping columns from your data.", "I recommend using Tableau, and yes, it is useful for Data Scientists.", "Thank you for reading my article. I hope you found it useful. If you enjoyed it, please let me know, and if you have any recommendations or comments, feel free to submit those down below. Thank you!", "Your home for data science.
