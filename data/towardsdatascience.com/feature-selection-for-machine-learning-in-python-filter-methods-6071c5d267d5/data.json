The rigor of that proverb extends to modern days, yes, even in Machine Learning.", "Have you ever wondered why the performance of your model hit a plateau no matter how you fine-tune those hyperparameters? Or even worse that you only see a mediocre improvement on performance after using the most accurate set of data you could ever find? Well, the culprit might actually be the predictors (columns) you use to train your models.", "Ideally, predictors should be statistically relevant to the output data a model intends to predict, and those predictors should be carefully hand-picked to ensure the best-expected performance. This article will give you a brief walkthrough on what feature selection is all about, accompanied by some practical examples in Python.", "Feature selection is primarily focused on removing redundant or non-informative predictors from the model. [1]", "On the surface level, feature selection simply means discarding and reducing predictors to the sweet spot of an optimal subset. Some rationales why feature selection is important in machine learning:", "There are generally three methods for feature selection:", "Filter methods use statistical calculation to evaluate the relevance of the predictors outside of the predictive models and keep only the predictors that pass some criterion. [2] Considerations when choosing filter methods are the types of data involved, both in predictors and outcome \u2014 either numerical or categorical.", "Wrapper methods evaluate multiple models using procedures that add and/or remove predictors to find the optimal combination that maximizes model performance. [3] Generally three directions of procedures are possible \u2014 forward (starts with 1 predictor and adds more iteratively), backward (starts with all predictors and eliminates one-by-one iteratively), and step-wise (bi-directional).", "Embedded methods are models where the feature selection procedure occurs naturally in the course of the model fitting process. [4] Put simply, this method integrates the feature selection algorithm as part of the machine learning algorithm. The most typical embedded technique is tree based algorithm, which includes decision tree and random forest. The general idea of feature selection is decided at the splitting node based on information gain. Other exemplars of embedded methods are the LASSO with the L1 penalty and Ridge with the L2 penalty for constructing a linear model.", "In this tutorial, we will be using the Scikit-learn package to perform the filter methods in Python, which means they are all performed using statistical techniques.", "The complete Python codes can be found on Github as well as the raw data used in the example for categorical data.", "2. Numerical input, categorical output \u2014 ANOVA with f_classif()", "3. Categorical input, categorical output \u2014 Chi-squared with chi2()", "For the categorical example, a dataset for car evaluation is used. It consists of 6 features \u2014 buying price, maintenance price, (number of ) doors, persons (capacity), luggage boot (size), safety (rating) to determine the acceptability class, distributed across 4 different possible outcomes.", "3.1. Categorical input, categorical output \u2014 Mutual Info with mutual_info_classif()", "In this post, you discovered how to choose filter-based statistical measures for feature selection with numerical and categorical data. You also learned how to implement them in Python.", "Some people may ask \u2014 what if there is a mix of numerical and categorical data in my predictors? Well, then you have to split the two types of data and then apply the methods based on the output variables.", "Is there an ideal number of predictors? Nope, at least not universally. It depends on the size of data \u2014 the number of rows vs the number of columns (predictors), the ML algorithm used (SVM is more susceptible to overfitting than tree-based algorithms), available computing resources, and of course time for the project. The rule of thumb is to consider all of the points mentioned and see what best fits in your situation.", "The article covers the first approach in feature selection \u2014 filter methods using statistical measures.
