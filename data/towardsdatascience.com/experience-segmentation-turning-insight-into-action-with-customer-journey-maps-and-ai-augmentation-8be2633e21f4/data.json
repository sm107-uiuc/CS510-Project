Indeed, a lot of the time when I speak with current or prospective clients they highlight how important it is to them that consultative or conceptual works are positioned so that tangible executions are naturally forthcoming.", "In a recent meeting in which we were discussing the strategic significance of creating clear Customer Journey Maps (\u2018CJM\u2019), the executive at the table exclaimed how CX consulting efforts, while valuable in terms of generating insights and creating focal points, \u2018just end up gathering dust in my bottom desk draw\u2019. This highlights the frustrations that even my executive level clients have with putting into practice any of the CX advisory services they procure.", "Admittedly, the outcome of many investigatory CX efforts can yield advice or ideas that require highly transformational actions (i.e. high effort) to be taken by organisations which simply cannot be supported in the short or mid-term. Consequently, a recently revved up team of individuals committed to improving their customer\u2019s experience slowly divert their attention and efforts elsewhere \u2014 resulting in a non-event.", "A core product of these investigative efforts is usually a shiny and beautifully designed CJM that clearly identifies your customers needs, motivation, pain-points and all the touch points these things relate to. The exercise in itself is highly valuable as it forces organisations to take an empathetic approach to their customer experience as they are forced to create the CJM from their customer\u2019s perspective. Additionally, it allows organisations to understand how traditionally siloed departments effect this customer experience and creates opportunities to harmonise them and maximise value. Finally, and perhaps most importantly in the context of measurement, it allows organisations to understand what an \u2018ideal\u2019 or future state of their customer may be.", "While these outcomes are valuable in an assortment of ways, they will not drive action in of themselves, and often leave a CJM merely as an artefact of that time the team got together and aligned on their customers pain-points and motivations. While there are a number of ways in which one can solve the problem of CJM wall-art relegation, organisations can maximise their chances of success in utilising this core output with a small amount of effort to begin with by simply creating a framework of measurement and incorporating fairly simple data analysis pilots into the business.", "This article will outline one such method of analysis as a working example of what such an operationalisation could look like.", "I will show how you can begin measuring customer journey maps by creating internal consensus on the key metrics and success of these metrics, structuring your data and running simple deep learning mechanics.", "For the purposes of this article we will assume that you have the right infrastructure in place to measure your customer interactions. With the plethora of digital tools available, these feedback loops can be seamlessly integrated into your digital platforms. If it\u2019s necessary to collect data for journeys in a physical environment or a combination of both invest smart devices or processes which facilitate this.", "Note that the entire premise of this article crumbles if you do not have high quality data. The ease in which one can actually collect data with the powerful tools on the market does not predispose that the process and strategy are easy to design. Without strong data retrieval methods, hygiene and volume the ideas in this article will be rendered useless in respect to the cluster analysis method. However, other and more simple methods could be used to ensure that your CJM is in operation and always improving.", "As we touched on before \u2014 the CJM activity is a great opportunity to align members across departments which may be siloed from each other. There are numerous benefits to this such as greater #synergy across the business, greater internal empathy and hopefully the emergence of powerful insights about how the customer journey is affected by a company\u2019s internal and external process. Leverage off this moment of alignment and aspirational excitement to nail those moments where you can triple down on your customer\u2019s experience. This is a key moment to ensure that your teams align on the type of customers and their journeys, what metrics matter to those customers universally and how we can measure the performance of these metrics.", "We can identify these segments and their specific journeys with a number of techniques such as:", "Say we have come together as a team and we have mapped out the type of customer segmentations and their corresponding journeys. Let\u2019s take a large online retailer as an example and show he process we could go through to understand what kind of data we are collecting and what needs to coincide with the customer segmentations and corresponding journeys.", "In the context of our examples we come to these segmentations and journeys:", "At this point we have aligned and gained consensus on: the types of customers and their corresponding journeys which is a win. But critically we need to gather consensus on two more fronts.", "Firstly: the metrics which we can measure these journeys by. In this example we can lean on universal diagnostics which would play universally into a retailers journey, these metrics are:", "As a team we have gained consensus for these metrics as being key to our diagnosis of each customer journey and how they correlate to the customers steps in the journey (i.e. their experience). This leads us to the second and more granular step in regard to forming company consensus around how we measure the performance of these metrics. A simple (note: not easy) way of doing this is by agreeing on an index a certain metrics performance as a team.", "For instance let\u2019s take \u201cCustomer Effort\u201d:we can index this performance based on how long the total time for transaction occurs like so:", "Or for a \u201cquestions\u201d analysis we could index such as:", "We could make the indexes more complex. For instance, we could measure the delta between a moment of uncertainty and the requisite clarification using advanced analytics; however, the purpose of this example is to simply express that an index is a clear and uniform measurement of performance of a certain metric. Critically, the team needs to have consensus on this index.", "Now, what we have is a way to consistently measure our segmentation and journeys in a uniform basis. People have been doing that for a long time \u2014 heard of customer insights? That being said, at the very least we can begin using our CJM because we now know what a customer journey looks like in the present state and we can decide on what we want the customer journey to look like in the future state.", "We can look for quick wins, big innovations \u2014 or somewhere in between.", "Most importantly, we can begin tracking, measuring, tweaking and using our CJM as a focus point to measure our internal initiatives in a way that we know a cohesive and impactful effort can be produced by the team. Where and when we pick our efforts as an internal team can be done in a strategic way, and with data backing us up, we can do this in a uniform way while ensuring that we create feedback loops to iterate and maintain our CJMs to be relevant.", "Okay, you\u2019re not entirely wrong. But remember, the point of this thought exercise is about transposing our CJM into something more than a reminder. We want it to DO something.", "However, if you remain unimpressed, why don\u2019t we push this now treasure trove beautifully indexed data that we can match to each of our customer segments to allow us to start creating experience segmentations.", "That\u2019s right, we are going beneath the hood of each of our solid and sound customer journeys and going to attempt to segment each of these customers by their actual experience.", "What data do we need to do that? We have it already \u2014 it\u2019s our CJM performance indexed data.", "Okay, but how can I work out the experience segmentation? It will be highly variable per customer and event, and it will be very difficult to pair these in a meaningful way. We are going to use the might of the machine, of the soon to be omniscient AI to wrangle our data, chop it up into an unfathomably complex way, in a ridiculously quick time, and have it cluster our customers based on their experience.", "Let\u2019s use the iris data set but pretend that instead of dealing with species we have groups of distinct customer experiences based on their interaction with a companies product or services.", "Lets convert the original flower measurements to scores between 1\u20135 (1 dp) for 4 quantifiable metrics that all relate to the experience of the customer with respect to the product/service.", "Here is the output: we have uniform metrics to measure outcomes based on our above activities!", "What we can discern from the above table is that Customer most of our customers have had good experiences across all metrics except for questions \u2014 which needs work across the board.", "We can run some light (easy, if you\u2019re a hack like me) data-viz to see if there are any natural clusters of scores.", "Looking at the data, we can see 2 clear customer \u2018experiences,\u2019 to keep it simple say, \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad.\u2019", "From this data, can identify these distinct experiences?", "Lets load in the big guns. Unsupervised learning module running the popular \u201ck-means\u201d model.", "From our quick look at the above plot we can see there\u2019s two distinct groups so we can tell our computer to look for 2 clusters (\u2019_clusters=2').", "Then let\u2019s distinguish if it was a good or a bad experience (Cluster 1 v Cluster 2).", "Here are our sample of results:", "We can see that the cluster analysis has identified and separated our clusters nicely. Just from a quick squiz I can see that 2 is #bad experience and 1 is #good experience (hint: look at the metrics).", "As you can see there\u2019s clear groups. The machine has found \u2018complex\u2019 patterns in the data which, due to our data engineering above, represent a good experience or a bad one.", "This means it can actually start predicting when a customer\u2019s experience will be a good or a bad one.", "And hence the term: \u201cexperience segmentation\u201d.", "Now that we have identified our \u2018experience segments\u2019 we can train a #machinelearning model on them so that we can classify new customers based on their interactions with our product / services (ideally in real-time as they are using the product!!).", "The key idea is that if we can do this, we may be able to take action in real-time to prevent a customer having a \u2018bad\u2019 experience, while leaving those customers who are going to have a \u2018good\u2019 experience.", "Let\u2019s set the features up (our tables with the experience) and what our target is (1).", "Now it\u2019s just your standard TTS work through. We just need to train our model to predict what will be good and what will be bad, then test it against our data set.", "Train the model first. Let\u2019s find our cluster analysis model again, and then fit it against the two data sets we made above.", "We can determine how accurate the score is by have our cluster predict what the X outcome with be (on \u2018X_test\u2019) and then actually calculate the accuracy by comparing the performance of \u2018y_pred\u2019 and \u2018y_test.\u2019", "What this means is, we now have a model that can analyse our data and predict what kind of experience a customer is having.", "IF we can deploy and automate this in production \u2014 we can trigger functions to increase the likelihood of a good experience OR salvage a bad one.", "(Note: you could have much richer data that could help you push much further, but for the sake of simplicity we have used the above set).", "What the above (simplified) execution has allowed us to do is find abstract and complex patterns in data that applies to different customer segments real time journeys, which we can describe as an experience segmentation. We have created a model that can find these patterns and group \u2018similar\u2019 experiences together to describe something which usually escapes us \u2014 what the customer (in a specific segment) is actually going through at a particular time. The designers will call it empathetic and the marketers will call it personalisation. I call it an opportunity.", "As an example lets imagine we are an online retailer.", "Imagine we have modelled the behaviours of the \u2018browser\u201d \u2014 someone who goes online, looks at their favourite brands, has a high degree of consumer knowledge, but ultimately has a relatively low conversion rate to the amount of activity they have on the site. We can assume that \u2018wait time\u2019 and emotional experiences (\u2018pain points\u2019) of the customer remain fairly constant. After all we could assume they find their leisurely browsing cathartic and not overly stressful.", "They like taking their time to understand their favourite brands or certain pieces of clothingand do their own informal research to construct the exact piece they want. They construct the \u201cperfect\u201d item in their mind and know exactly what they are after \u2014 willing to spend high amounts of big ticket items.", "As a company, we have been monitoring this type of behaviour. We understand the customer segment. We monitor their behaviour on a macro level, and can easily mine down to what a certain customer type is doing on a personal level (i.e. personalisation). Here, they want to buy a cashmere blend winter coat in the right cut and the right colour. We know that as a customer segment they are specific, long tailed buyers that have many purchases in mind but don\u2019t convert easily. However, when they do convert, they buy high ticket price items. It doesn\u2019t cost much to acquire this customers attention \u2014 they are sophisticated buyers who know what they like \u2014 but it is difficult to push through the mental barrier to purchase regardless of optimum UX.", "Our clustering analysis, running in real time, with built in automations has been testing and training on this certain segment. Our model knows it\u2019s a \u2018browser\u2019, and it also knows the grouping of metrics, at the right timings will lead to a good or bad experience. In real time, the cluster can manage to keep the customers experience in the \u2018good zone\u2019 (conversion) and away from the \u2018bad zone\u2019 (off to browse another day). The margin for buying is thin but as a business, driven by our CJM and experience segmentation research and development, we pop up a chatbot which reminds our customers of our return policy and a corresponding video showing the fit and poise that our \u2018browser\u2019 so admires.", "Our UX efforts correspond directly with the experience, unobtrusive and not pushy, but clear and direct; therefore, removing the barriers to purchase the \u2018browser\u2019 so often experiences. The browser is compelled to complete the purchase as our model has managed and triggered key functions or features which greatly improve the right metrics. The browser converts, and the coat is bought as a result of having carefully managed the segmentation of our customer experience with our CJM as a backbone and operationalised it in a manner that allows us to execute powerful machine learning applications to manage the customer\u2019s experience accordingly.", "This data-led approach to CX (or any other design lead process) allows us to implement initial design analysis in a way that can be effectively monitored, measured and augmented. Allowing internal teams or clients to make decisions, validate business cases and (hopefully) push business cases further and further to achieve true innovation. Most importantly, it allows us to make decisions \u2014 in this instance in real time \u2014 that can actively ensure that our customers have a good experience, or obviate a bad experience every time they interact with us.", "Your home for data science.
