There are Ensembling techniques available that try to combine the best of all the worlds (models) but they come with a cost. The cost here may be time, effort and making things complicated. A good machine learning modeler will always prefer to keep things simple.", "This post is about how to compare between Machine Learning models with a high level of confidence", "Let\u2019s say we have two machine learning models built, Model \u2018A\u2019 and Model \u2018B\u2019. Both models were properly trained and tested on the validation set.

In other words, the difference in the mean accuracy of Model B and Model A is greater than 0 with 90% confidence.
