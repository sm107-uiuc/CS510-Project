Autoencoders are a type neural network which is part of unsupervised\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["In the wonderful world of machine learning and artificial intelligence, there exists this structure called an autoencoder. Autoencoders are a type neural network which is part of unsupervised learning (or, to some, semi-unsupervised learning). There are many different types of autoencoders used for many purposes, some generative, some predictive, etc. This article should provide you with a toolbox and guide to the different types of autoencoders.", "The basic type of an autoencoder looks like the one above. It consists of an input layer (the first layer), a hidden layer (the yellow layer), and an output layer (the last layer). The objective of the network is for the output layer to be exactly the same as the input layer. The hidden layers are for feature extraction, or identifying features that dictate the result. The process of going from the first layer to the hidden layer is called encoding. The process of going from the hidden layer to the output layer is called decoding. The process of encoding and decoding is what makes autoencoders special. The yellow layer is sometimes known as the bottleneck hidden layer.", "From here, there are a bunch of different types of autoencoders.", "The first few we\u2019re going to look at is to address the overcomplete hidden layer issue.", "The important part to note is that there are more hidden layers than input/output layers. One would need this if they have more features than usual in their data. The major problem with this is that the inputs can go through without any change; there wouldn\u2019t be any real extraction of features. Check out the example below:", "No real change is occuring between the input layers and the output layers; they\u2019re just staying the same. In addition, two of the hidden layer nodes aren\u2019t being used at all. To avoid this, there are at least three methods:", "In short, sparse autoencoders are able to \u201cknock out\u201d some of the neurons in the hidden layers, forcing the autoencoder to use all of their neurons. It can no longer just memorise the input through certain nodes because, in each run, those nodes may not be the ones active.", "We altered the hidden layer in sparse autoencoders. Another option is to alter the inputs. In denoising autoencoders, some of the inputs are turned to zero (at random). Once it is fed through, the output are compared to the original (non-zero) inputs. This serves a similar purpose to sparse autoencoders, but, this time, the zeroed-out ones are in a different location.", "We changed the input layer, the hidden layer, and now we will change the output layer. Autoencoders train through a method called backpropagation; when doing this algorithm, in contractive autoencoders, the outputs are slightly altered, though not completely zeroed-out (like in the past algorithms). This alteration to the output layer while backpropagating is what prevents pure memorisation.", "Some of the practical applications for these networks include labelling image data for segmentation, denoising images (an obvious choice for this would be the DAE), detecting outliers, and filling in gaps in images. Many of these applications additionally work with SAEs, which will be explained next.", "Enough with that problem. Now we\u2019re going to mention other variations of autoencoders that are more powerful.", "Stacked autoencoders are starting to look a lot like neural networks. In essence, SAEs are many autoencoders put together with multiple layers of encoding and decoding. This allows the algorithm to have more layers, more weights, and most likely end up being more robust.", "Something handy to know about not only SAEs but also the other forms of AEs is that the layers can also be convolutional and deconvolutional layers; this is more convenient for image processing.", "Some uses of SAEs and AEs in general include classification and image resizing. These are two practical uses of the feature extraction tool autoencoders are known for; any other uses of the feature extraction is useful with autoencoders.", "This is perhaps the most used variation of autoencoders: the generative one. It\u2019s also much more complicated than the others.", "In short, VAEs are similar to SAEs, but they are able to detach the decoder. In the centre, there are two vectors, which then combine to make a latent vector. What does this mean? Well, if one were to theoretically take the just the bottleneck hidden layer and up from an SAE and asked it to generate images given a random vector, more likely than not, it would generate noise. There\u2019s a lot of randomness and only certain areas are vectors that provide true images.", "Since the chances of getting an image-producing vector is slim, the mean and standard deviation help squish these yellow regions into one region called the latent space. This, in turn, gets sampled from to produce a final image. Everything within the latent space should produce an image.", "From here, one can just take out the encoding part, and the result should be a generator.", "This is a runoff of VAEs, with a slight change. This will basically allow every vector to control one (and only one) feature of the image.", "Note how, in the disentangled option, there is only one feature being changed (e.g. turn left, turn right, distance, etc.). However, in the entanglement, there appears to be many features changing at once. The ability for a single change to change a single feature is the point of disentangled VAEs.", "The way to do this is to add another parameter to the original VAEs that will that into consideration how much the model is varying with each change in the input vector. From there, the weights will adjust accordingly.", "And\u2026 that\u2019s it for now. I hope you enjoyed the toolbox. I used loads of articles and videos, all of which are excellent reads/watches. If there\u2019s any way I could improve or if you have any comments or suggestions or anything, I\u2019d love to hear your feedback. Thank you!", "Note: Unless otherwise mentioned, all images were designed by myself.", "Your home for data science.
