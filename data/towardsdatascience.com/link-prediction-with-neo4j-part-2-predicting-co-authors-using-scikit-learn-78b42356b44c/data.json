I wrote a blog post explaining how to import the full dataset, but in this post we\u2019re going to focus on the data from a few Software Development Conferences.", "We can import that subset of the data by running the following Cypher statements.

This can easily happen when working with graphs because pairs of nodes in our training set may be connected to those in the test set.", "Instead we need to split our graph into training and test sub graphs, and we are lucky that our citation graph contains time information that we can split on. We will create training and test graphs by splitting the data on a particular year.", "But which year should we split on? Let\u2019s have a look at the distribution of the first year that co-authors collaborated:", "It looks like 2006 would act as a good year on which to split the data, because it will give us a reasonable amount of data for each of our sub graphs. We\u2019ll take all the co-authorships from 2005 and earlier as our training graph, and everything from 2006 onwards as the test graph.", "Let\u2019s create explicit CO_AUTHOR_EARLY and CO_AUTHOR_LATE relationships in our graph based on that year. The following code will create these relationships for us:", "This split leaves us with 81,096 relationships in the early graph, and 74,128 in the late one. This is a split of 52\u201348. That\u2019s a higher percentage of values than we\u2019d usually have in our test graph, but it should be ok.", "The relationships in these sub graphs will act as the positive examples in our train and test sets, but we need some negative examples as well.

This will give us a much more manageable amount of data to work with.", "We can generate these pairs by running the following query:", "This query returns 4,389,478 negative examples compared to 81,096 positive examples, which means we have 54 times as many negative examples.", "So we still have a big class imbalance, which means that a model that predicts that every pair of nodes will not have a link will be very accurate.", "To solve this issue we can either up sample the positive examples or down sample the negative examples. We\u2019re going to go with the downsampling approach.", "For the rest of the post we\u2019re going to be working in Python with the py2neo, pandas, and scikit-learn libraries.", "The py2neo driver enables data scientists to easily integrate Neo4j with tools in the Python Data Science ecosystem.

This method is well suited as our data set will be comprised of a mix of strong and weak features.

We can do this with the following code:", "Our model is now trained, but we need to evaluate it.", "We\u2019re going to compute its accuracy, precision, and recall.

We can now run the following code to see which feature is playing the most prominent role:", "We can see above that Common neighbors (cn) is the massively dominant feature in our model. Common neighbors returns us a count of the number of unclosed co-author triangles that an author has, so this perhaps isn\u2019t that surprising.", "Now we\u2019re going to add some new features that are generated from graph algorithms.", "We\u2019ll start by running the triangle count algorithm over our test and train sub graphs. This algorithm returns the number of triangles that each node forms, as well as each node\u2019s clustering coefficient. The clustering coefficient of a node indicates the likelihood that its neighbours are also connected.", "We can run the following Cypher queries in the Neo4j Browser, to run this algorithm on our train graph:", "And the following Cypher query to run it on the test graph:", "We now have 4 new properties on our nodes: trianglesTrain, coefficientTrain, trianglesTest, and coefficientTest. Let\u2019s now add these to our train and test DataFrames, with help from the following function:", "These measures are different than the ones we\u2019ve used so far, because rather than being computed based on the pair of nodes, they are node specific measures.", "We can\u2019t simply add these values to our DataFrame as node1Triangles or node1Coeff because we have no guarantee over the order of nodes in the pair. We need to come up with an approach that is agnostic of the order", "We can do this by taking the average of the values, the product of the values, or by computing the minimum and maximum value, as we do here.", "We can apply that function to the DataFrame like this:", "And now we can train and evaluate:", "Those features have been helpful! Each of our measures have improved by about 4% from the initial model. Which features are most important?", "Common neighbors is still the most influential, but the triangles features are adding some value as well.", "This post has already gone on a lot longer than I intended so we\u2019ll stop there, but there are certainly some exercises left for the reader.", "Can you think of any other features that we could add that might help us to create a model with even higher accuracy? Perhaps other community detection, or even centrality algorithms might help?", "At the moment the link prediction algorithms in the Graph Algorithms Library only work for mono-partite graphs. Mono-partite graphs are ones where the label of both nodes are the same. The algorithms are based on the topology of nodes, and if we try to apply them to nodes with different labels, those nodes will likely have different topologies, meaning that the algorithms won\u2019t work so well.", "We\u2019re looking at adding versions of the link prediction algorithms that work on other graphs. If you have any particular ones that you\u2019d like to see, please let us know on GitHub issues.", "If you found this blog post interesting, you might enjoy the O\u2019Reilly Graph Algorithms Book that Amy Hodler and I have been working on over the last 9 months.
