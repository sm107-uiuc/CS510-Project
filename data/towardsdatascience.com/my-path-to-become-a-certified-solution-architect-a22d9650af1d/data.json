At work, I design and implement cloud-native machine learning architectures for fin-tech and insurance companies.", "I started to work with AWS 2 1/2 years ago. Since then I had built many projects both privately and at work using AWS Services. I like the Serverless services of aws the most. For me, Serverless first always applies.", "In short, I have several years of professional and part-time experience with AWS, but no certificate. I know that hands-on experience and knowledge are more important than certificates. But sometimes you need a sheet of paper to prove that.", "This article won\u2019t show how everyone gets certified in under 30h of studying. Instead, it should motivate others who have the same experience as me but are too lazy.", "So a few weeks ago I decided to do the \u201cAWS Certified Solutions Architect \u2014 Associate SAA-C02\u201d certificate.", "The \u201cAWS Solutions Architect \u2014 Associate SAA-C02\u201d certificate validates the ability to architect and deploy dynamically scalable, highly available, fault-tolerant, and reliable applications on AWS. The exam takes 130 minutes and consists of 65 questions.", "First I researched, what are the exam criteria. According to the AWSSolution_Architect-_Associate_SAA-C02_Exam_Blue_Print it consists out of those 4 topics.", "Second, I researched online courses and summary/ cheat sheets. I quickly found an online course as I was already familiar with a cloud guru. After some googling, I found Jayendra\u2019s Blog, which has a cheat sheet for almost every topic.", "Initially, I watched the \u201cAWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate SAA-C02\u201d course on a cloud guru. Due to my experience, I watched the course at 2x speed. Every episode that contained a lab have I implemented independently afterwards.", "After I completed the course I did one practice exam from a cloud guru and achieved 78%. Therefore I booked my practice in 3 days. In these 3 days, I studied 4 hours a day, did 10 practice exams, and learned with the cheatsheets.", "In total it took me 7 Weeks and ~28h to complete the \u201cAWS Certified Solutions Architect \u2014 Associate SAA-C02\u201d certificate.", "On the day of the exam, I took the last practice exam and did every quiz from the a cloud guru course. I took my exam at home through PearsonVue. As an exemplary examinee, I fulfilled all requirements in advance and was ready for my exam. The check-in was very easy and the Instructor was very kind. It took around 10 minutes to start.", "It took me 80 minutes to finish and pass the exam.", "Practice exams are good, but due to the fact that AWS is developing so fast, they don\u2019t have to be accurate. In my case, I had around 8\u201310 Questions about storage gateway, efs, fsx and in the practice exams way less of them. My learning from this is I should rather do one less practice exam and read some more documentation.", "My second learning is that the confirmation of your abilities is something great to be proud of.", "Thanks for reading and a special Thanks to Jayendra\u2019s Blog and a cloud guru.", "If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
