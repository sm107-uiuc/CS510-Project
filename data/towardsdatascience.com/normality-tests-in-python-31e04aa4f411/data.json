It is a symmetric distribution where most of the observations fall around the central peak and the probabilities for values further away from the mean taper off equally in both directions with fewer outliers on the high and low ends of the data range.", "The term \u201cGaussian distribution\u201d refers to the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss.", "A normal distribution has some important properties:", "A normal distribution is the most important probability distribution in statistics because", "In statistics, normality tests are used to check if the data is drawn from a Gaussian distribution or in simple if a variable or in sample has a normal distribution.", "There are two ways to test normality,", "Various graphs can be used to test the normality of a variable. Using graphs/plots we can visually see the normality but graphs are not very accurate as statistical methods.", "It plots two sets of quantiles against one another i.e. theoretical quantiles against the actual quantiles of the variable.", "If our data comes from a normal distribution, we should see all the points sitting on the straight line.", "Box Plot also know as a box and whisker plot is another way to visualize the normality of a variable. It displays the distribution of data based on a five-number summary i.e. minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3) and maximum.", "If your variable has a normal distribution, we should see the mean and median in the center.", "One of the popular and commonly used plot to visualize the distribution of the data is a histogram. It also allows us to inspect data for its underlying outliers, skewness, etc. It divides the data into bins of equal width. Each bin is plotted as a bar and height of the bar depends on the number of the data points are in that bin.", "If your variable has a normal distribution, we should see a bell curve.", "On the other hand, there are many Statistical Tests to check if the distribution of a variable is normal/gaussian. In this section, I am not gonna talk about the math behind but I will show you the python code for each test.", "We should start with the Shapiro-Wilk Test. It is the most powerful test to check the normality of a variable. It was proposed in 1965 by Samuel Sanford Shapiro and Martin Wilk.", "D\u2019Agostino\u2019s K-squared test check\u2019s normality of a variable based on skewness and kurtosis. It was named by Ralph D\u2019Agostino.", "Skewness is a measure of symmetry.", "Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution.", "Anderson-Darling Normality Test is another general normality tests designed to determine if the data comes from a specified distribution, in our case, the normal distribution. It was developed in 1952 by Theodore Anderson and Donald Darling.", "It gives a range of critical values, at which the null hypothesis can be failed to rejected if the calculated statistic is less than the critical value. In our case, at each significance level, the data has a gaussian distribution.", "Another way of checking the normality of a variable is with Chi-Square Normality Test. It is not as popular as other methods.", "The Lilliefors test is a normality test based on the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. As all the above methods, this test is used to check if the data come from a normal distribution. It is named after Hubert Lilliefors, professor of statistics at George Washington University.", "The Jarque-Bera test tests whether the sample data has the skewness and kurtosis matching a normal distribution.", "NOTE: This test only works for a large enough number of data samples (>2000).", "Performs the (one sample or two samples) Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for goodness of fit. The one-sample test performs a test of the distribution F(x) of an observed random variable against a given distribution G(x) (i.e. a normal distribution).", "We create Machine Learning models to mimic a process in the universe/population by training on a sample taken from the population. The process could be detecting cancer, fraudulent transaction etc. We presume that the distribution of the population is normal and the sample represents the population. A good sample that represents the population works well in production. So, before training a model, it is recommended to check whether a sample is a good representation of the population (i.e normal distribution) with Normality Tests. There are plenty of methods to check the normality of the variable. One can choose plots which makes it easy to understand by visualizing or select statistical tests, that gives p-value to check the normality.", "Any feedback and comments are, greatly appreciated!", "Some of my other posts you may find interesting,", "Your home for data science.
