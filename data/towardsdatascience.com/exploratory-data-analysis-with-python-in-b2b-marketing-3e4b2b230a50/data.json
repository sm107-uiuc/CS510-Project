We will use data from Olist, an e-commerce platform that connects small and medium business with top Marketplaces in Brazil, as an example. Besides providing the method and the code, I also want to discuss the fundamentals in B2B Marketing and how these insights from EDA can help Olist to make a better marketing decision. All the Python code is provided on my GitHub.", "Olist is a platform that connects small and medium business with the marketplaces in Brazil (Extra, Shoptime, Walmart, Submarino, .etc) and helps the merchants to sell at these marketplaces. Unlike in some countries, the fast-growing e-commerce sector in Brazil is dominated by a number of large-size marketplaces rather than by a few marketplaces (Ex: Amazon and Ebay in the U.S.). Therefore, a merchant has the incentive to operate in multiple marketplaces to maximize their revenue. With the limitation in human resources as the main pain point, the merchant would want to use Olist to manage its sales channel in different marketplaces and streamline the stock management and the order fulfillment process.", "With this B2B2C model, Olist\u2019s marketing team have 2 main objectives:", "The scope of this analysis focuses more on the seller side (B2B) of Olist. With a given dataset, I will conduct the exploratory data analysis (EDA) that can bring some helpful insights into Olist\u2019s B2B marketing team.", "Marketing & Sales process for B2B:", "The datasets were obtained from Kaggle. You can download it here.", "Channels: The majority of MQLs come from organic_search channel, followed by direct traffic and social. Other, other_publicities, referral and display are the sources that bring the least MQLs to Olist. The organic_search MQL is significantly increased in 2018\u201302 and declined after that. This can be the result of a big event/PR campaign.", "The conversion rates for these channels are varied. Organic_search, paid_search and direct traffic are the sources that enjoy the highest conversion rates (12.5%, 11.5%, and 11% respectively). Email, other_publicities and social have the lowest conversion rates (3%, 5%, 5.5% respectively). This means that SEO and Google Adwords are the most effective marketing channels for Olist. This result seems to be relevant to a couple of surveys illustrating the most effective marketing channel for B2B companies.", "Olist used 495 landing pages to capture MQLs. Even though the sales team is responsible for converting an MQL into a won opportunity, the marketing team can affect this likelihood from the top of the funnel by providing relevant messaging and benefits on the landing pages. From figure 4 above, there are 2 landing pages that have a very high number of MQLs (~800 MQLs) as well as very high won rate (~20%), meaning that 20% of the MQLs captured from these landing pages become Olist\u2019s sellers.", "Learning from these landing pages can help Olist to replicate the success to other landing pages.", "Targeting is very important in B2B marketing. There\u2019re segments that will be very interested in Olist and vice versa. The following graph shows that by using the sales cycle (how long the sales process is) as the indication:", "Business segments such as Home_decor, health_beauty, household_utilities, construction tool for house and garden, car accessories and electronics are the majorities of the sellers with the sales cycle typically around 50 days. Some segments that have a long sales cycle than others are perfume and watches. However, since these 2 segments only have a small number of MQLs (7 & 10) so Olist should probably wait for more MQLs to have a more accurate observation.", "Regarding the Lead_type variable, Online_medium is the most popular type among Olist MQLs. There is no significant difference between the sales cycle of these business types.", "Olist can also base on the sales cycle to evaluate the performance of a Sales Rep. From Figure 7, It seems that the number of leads an SR has, the shorter the sales cycle. This can be explained that an experienced sales rep (more MQLs) will perform better (shorter sales length) than a new sales rep.", "The table below is the description of each behavior profile, based on DiSC, a behavior assessment tool developed from DiSC theory of psychologist William Moulton Marston.", "48.3% of lead behavior profiles are cat \u2014 steadiness, meaning that this person places emphasis on cooperation, sincerity, and dependability. Understand the characteristics of the leads can help Olist team to create relevant personas, making it easier for them to craft contents, messaging and stories to the targeted audience.", "There are 2 business types: reseller and manufacturer. Reseller accounts for 69.7% of total MQLs. Therefore, there is no surprise when reseller appears the most among the business segments. However, in the home_decor segment, 56% are manufacturers.", "Most sellers have to wait less than 50 days to have the first order from Olist since the day they agree to join Olist platform (figure 10).", "Main business segments such as heath_beauty, home_decor, household_utilities, audio_video_electronics,\u2026typically wait for 50\u201360 days to have the first order since won date. We also see some other segments such as food_drink, handcrafted and fashion_accessories have significantly longer time before its first order.", "Figure 12 is the top 10 product categories that have the highest sales from Olist. Since health_beauty, computer_accessories, furniture_devor, housewares, auto, and garden_tools are also the main business segments among MQLs, the sales values from these segments also on top. The only thing that surprises me is Watches. Though only have a small number of sellers from Watches segment, revenue from watches is really high in comparison with other segments.", "We look at Olist seller side marketing from different angles: channels, messages (landing pages), targeting (business segment, lead behavior, business type,..), sales process (sales cycle, sales rep), closed deal performance to indicate the platform usage. Each angle can add value to how the team can optimize marketing campaigns.", "About the author: I\u2019m an MBA student at the University of California, Davis.
