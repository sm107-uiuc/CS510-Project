And, said differently, the two events (asking for hot water and getting some) are \u201cdesynchronized\u201d.", "If you want to reach a specific temperature at the \u201ct\u201d instant, you have to anticipate how long it will take for the water to run through the pipes.", "When you are extracting historical data, you usually get a time series with a timestamp as an index. This timestamp corresponds to the time when the values were recorded:", "Let\u2019s assume that the \u201cviscosity\u201d of a product is your targeted feature and that there is a 200 meters pipe between your temperature sensor and your viscosimeter.", "When you measure a viscosity of \u201c61\u201d at 06:06, is the temperature measured at the same time (10.8\u00b0C) contributing to this result? Unless the flow is really fast, probably not! So what temperature should you take into consideration when building a Machine Learning model?", "From an engineering perspective, you could try to determine the flow rate, the pipe diameter, etc. and make your best guess on how many seconds it takes for the product to go from A to B.", "As usual, nothing better than a simple example to understand how we can cope with this problem.", "We will create 3 cyclical features (x1, x2 and x3) and the corresponding target \u201cy\u201d, as the weighted combination of all of them.", "Let\u2019s calculate the (obviously strong!) correlation between x1, x2, x3 and y:", "Now let\u2019s introduce a random lag between the x features and y because, as in real life, it should take a couple of seconds, minutes, or even sometimes hours before a change on \u201cx1\u201d, \u201cx2\u201d or \u201cx3\u201d does impact the measurement on \u201cy\u201d.", "The lag here is now \u201cvisually obvious\u201d but let\u2019s keep in mind that real cases are much more tricky!", "We can now consider this dataset as our baseline because \u201cde-synchronized features\u201d are what we would get in real life. As you can see below, the correlation between features has dropped drastically:", "Now it is only a matter of looping on each feature and increasing the shift value to observe how the coefficient correlation evolves.", "When it reaches its peak, then it should be the actual lag between the target and said-feature:", "This does match the initial lags introduced into the dataset!(If you have not seen them, they are written below the code which performs the features shift.)", "We can also have a look at the rows between 15 and 40 to double-check that these ranks actually correspond to the correlation peaks:", "We are now in a position to take the initial dataset and shift every feature according to its corresponding lag. Thanks to that, the Machine Learning algorithm will create a model where the target and its influencing parameters are well synchronized and get the best potential results!", "As usual, before we close this article, a few comments:", "Your home for data science.
