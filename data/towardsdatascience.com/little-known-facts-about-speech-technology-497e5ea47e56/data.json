Try: Hey Poodle, Hey goo goo, Ok boo boo, Ok Noodle, Hey Poodle, Hey frugal, Hey Doodle or even Cocaine Poodle [1].", "The simplest solution would be to use ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) API and whitelist the phrase you\u2019d like to use to call your Assistant. There are a couple of problems with this solution:", "In this blog post you can read more about a typical approach to Trigger word detection which is a base for more advanced techniques. Input to the neural network is a frequency spectrogram computed from the audio stream. The Neural network consists of one convolutional 1D layer, 2 GRU layers, one dense, and sigmoid. It has a binary hotword/no hotword output. To make the training set more balanced, 50 consecutive time steps were labels as 1 (hotword detected).", "Oftentimes when I say I work on Speech, people respond with a question whether it\u2019s NLP. Nowadays, with deep learning being successful in traditionally different disciplines, we see researchers moving between Speech, NLP, Computer Vision, Self Driving Cars etc. A clear differentiator between them is the type of data they deal with: Speech deals with Audio, NLP - text, Computer Vision - images.", "I remember the times when a robotic voice would give me driving directions or I heard a dissonance when pre recorded audio from a voice talent was merged with the synthesized audio in one sentence. Now synthesized speech sounds very natural and it\u2019s hard to differentiate human speech from generated speech. Nowadays the audio recorded by voice talents is used for the model training and audio played to users in production is synthesized (with some exceptions). A very popular method of converting Text to Speech (TTS) is called WaveNet.", "Is there a technology which uses a different prosody model when reading news and different one when reading stories for kids? Yes, there is. Check out this research blog post on Expressive Speech Synthesis [2] or listen (very expressive) synthesized audio samples. This style transfer technology is text-independent. It takes as a reference audio clip spoken in a specific style, creates style embedding, and transfers this style to any target phrase we choose.", "I found synthesized Voice Conversion audio samples here [3] with a link to a paper on Discrete Representation Learning. As can be heard from the samples, the synthesized speech has the same content as the original sample, but with the voice from the second speaker. One of the Representation Learning experiments was conducted on audio with speaker labels. Authors trained a Vector Quantized Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE) model that has a dilated convolutional architecture similar to WaveNet decoder. The encoder maps audio to a latents consist of one feature map and a 512-dimensional latent space. The decoder is conditioned on both the latents and a one-hot embedding for the speaker. At inference, the latents are extracted from one speaker and then reconstructed through the decoder using a separate speaker id.", "Speech models and products have been advancing rapidly since 2010 when first speech deep learning models of industry scale came along so it\u2019s interesting to write about recent trends.
