The project that we will discuss in this article revolves around this idea. The dataset used in the analysis has been provided by a German company, Arvato, which develops and implements innovative solutions for business customers around the globe. The statement of the problem is as follows :", "A mail-order company, one of the clients of Arvato, sells some organic products and wants to acquire new clients. For that purpose, they are planning to conduct a marketing campaign with an aim to attract more and more people to their product. Now, the question is how can one do that efficiently?", "We do not want to reach out to every individual residing in Germany (highly time-consuming and inefficient) or target people arbitrarily (risk of losing potential customers). Instead, if we can somehow separate people more likely to turn into customers from the rest, the job is done! This is where the power of data comes into the picture. The company has attributes and demographic information of their existing customers. A similar set of data for the people in Germany is also available. One can match the customer data with the general population data to identify individuals with high probabilities to become customers of the company.", "As you might already have guessed, this is essentially an unsupervised learning problem. One idea to address this problem is to use available information of both the present customers and the general population to form clusters of people characterized by a certain set of features in each case. Since the customer and general population datasets have an exactly similar structure, clusters formed from these datasets are going to be equivalent. The rest of the problem is then straightforward. One can then use these clusters to identify parts of the general population that are closer to the existing customers in the feature space. These people, therefore, are going to be the targets of the company during the marketing campaign.", "In this section, we break down our entire analysis into small substeps.", "This is the most challenging and time taking, not to mention important, part of our analysis. The datasets that we are considering here, have total 366 distinct features associated with each individual uniquely identified by an id number. The preprocessing of data involves the following steps :", "We replace all these unknown values by NaNs. After this, we recheck the percentage of null values in each column as well as row which might get increased due to this replacement. If any row/column is found to exceed the threshold, we drop it.", "Even after data cleaning, we find that there are still a large number of features present in the data. It is, therefore, a good idea to try to reduce the dimension of this dataset while preserving as much as information possible. This can be achieved by using the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) technique in which we transform our dataset from the original feature space to a new space spanned by uncorrelated principal components. These principal components are linear combinations of original features that account for variance in the data. In the present analysis, we choose 150 principal components that explain more than 85% variance in the data.", "We find that both positively and negatively correlated features are present in principal components.", "By looking at the feature description file, we find that the top features in the first principal component are related to the financial status of an individual, e.g., how many houses they own, the number of cars, which class of the society they belong to, total income, and so on.", "On the other hand, the third principal component is mainly dominated by the features linked with characteristics of an individual, e.g., age, traditional mindset, dutifulness, social involvement, and so on.", "Finally, it is time to group people based on their distances in the feature (or the principal component) space and for this, we use clustering techniques specifically k-means clustering. The most important hyper-parameter of this algorithm is the number of clusters to be formed, n_clusters. A conventional method to find this number is to use the elbow plot, which is the distribution plot of the metric \u2018within-cluster sum of squared\u2019 (wcss) as a function of cluster number. As the number of cluster increases, wcss, which is the sum of squared distances between the centroid and other data points in a cluster, decreases. The optimal number of clusters can be chosen from the plot as a point beyond which either the metric does not change any more or the change is not substantial.", "For the present analysis, we choose 12 clusters and run the k-means algorithm with n_clusters=12 on both population and customer data to form clusters characterized by different feature sets. Recall that we aim to identify which part(s) of the population is most similar to the existing customers. One can achieve this by comparing the fractions of the population and customers in each cluster.", "If for a cluster, the customer fraction is greater than the population fraction, people belonging to that part of the feature space are more likely to turn into customers of the company and hence is the target base of the company. As we can see from the above plot, the company should target people in clusters 3, 8, 5, 6, and maybe 11 (in that order) for the upcoming marketing campaign.", "The last part of the project requires us to build a model which, given a set of features associated with an individual, will be able to predict how likely that person is to respond positively to the campaign. Two datasets are provided \u2014 one for training and one for testing the model. The datasets are severely imbalanced with very few examples (~ 1%) from the positive class (i.e., people who responded).", "Therefore instead of predicting the class to which an individual belongs, it makes much more sense to compute the probability of a person to turn into customers so that the company can target people with high response probabilities. Hence, we compute the area under the ROC curve (False Positive Rate vs True Positive Rate) to evaluate a model\u2019s performance.", "In this analysis, we have considered 4 classification algorithms \u2014 Logistic regression, Random forest classification, Adaboost classification, and finally XGB classification and perform grid search on each of them to find out the best model with the best set of parameters that gives the highest score on the left-out data during grid search.", "Although Adaboost and XGB classifications produce almost equivalent ROC scores, we choose the XGB classifier since it took less time to train the model compared to the Adaboost classifier. Some of the important features for our model (computed using the feature_importance_ attribute)are shown in the below plot:", "Clearly, the feature \u2018D19_SOZIALES\u2019 is dominating over rest of the features. Although no description of this feature available to us, it is most likely related to social issues associated with an individual (thanks to Google!). The next important features like \u2018GEBURTSJAHR\u2019, \u2018KBA13_HALTER_35\u2019 are related to the age, information about car sharing of an individual.", "The only remaining part is to predict the response probabilities of each individual in the test dataset. The below table shows the response probabilities of a few individuals (identified by unique id numbers in the LNR column) that we get after running the model on the test dataset.", "The datasets that we have worked on in this project contain a large number of features. This allows us to play around with them to get more and more precise results. Some areas that might require further attention are as follows:", "You can check the entire code of the analysis on my GitHub repository. Happy coding!", "Your home for data science.
