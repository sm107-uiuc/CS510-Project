It appeals to both developers and data scientists with easy-to-use AWS pre-made models and a framework to put custom-built models behind web endpoints.", "Many updates were announced last December at re:Invent 2019. I have summarized some of the important ones and compiled the links if you want to learn more.", "I hope you find it useful!", "Note: If you are new to SageMaker there are plenty of articles around Medium to introduce you to it. (start here)", "Prior to the release of multi-model containers, each SageMaker model would be stood up in a separate docker container. This is inefficient for two reasons: 1) Sometimes your application has more than one model and you want to group all the models together as one unit. 2) Many ML applications will have the same/similar dependencies, it might not make sense to spin up 4 different docker containers that all have the same requirements.txt file.", "Did I mention the cost savings? (learn more)", "So you\u2019ve built a machine learning model. Then you struggled for months trying to figure out how to get it in the hands of business users. After you finally figured out how to integrate it into an existing software and business process\u2026 Now you are done, right?", "Wrong. The world is constantly changing. And you do not want your model to become obsolete or accidentally make inferences or recommendations on bad data.", "Queue SageMaker Model Monitor. This will take a look at your training data and automatically generate rules & statistics about what each variable should look like (you can also enter these yourself), then monitor the input data coming into the model.", "If there is anomalous data, it will send you a message. If variables start to drift away from what the model was trained on, you can have it automatically spark a re-training job. (learn more)", "There have been a few tools out there to help track ML experiments (see Domino and Cloudera), but not very many open-source ones. Many data scientists would just write there own experiments scripts or modules in (insert your favorite ML framework here).", "AWS released SageMaker Experiments, along with a Python SDK to help data scientists build and track ML experiments. Here are some of the major concepts from the framework to get you started. (learn more)", "Experiment: A collection of related trials that you wish to compare", "Trial: A description of a multi-step ML workflow. Each step is described by a TrialComponent", "TrailComponent: A description of a single step in a ML workflow", "Tracker: A python context manager for logging information about a single TrialComponent", "Once you\u2019ve made it easy to build models, run experiments, deploy endpoints, and monitor production ML applications; you might as well automate the entire process. The biggest difference between AutoPilot and other AutoML software is transparency. There used to be a dichotomy between black box AutoML that was easy to use but hard to trust, and built-from-scratch models from a data scientist that was easier to trust but more difficult to build.", "AutoPilot is completely transparent with what algorithms, experiments, parameters, and everything else that it is doing. This should help jump-start the data scientist\u2019s workflow, not replace it. Data scientists will now spend more time interpreting results, understanding the underlying business problem, and feature engineering to improve results; while spending less time figuring out which split criterion to use in a random forest or what kernel to use in a support vector machine.", "Finally, an IDE for data scientists. What sets SageMaker Studio apart from other IDE\u2019s is the focus on visualizing data and tracking ML experiments. It leverages other popular tools like Jupyter Notebooks and integration with git. Everything that a data scientist needs to know is available in a single pane of glass. It also seems to tie in well with the other SageMaker tools for experiments, deployments, and monitoring. (learn more)", "Under the hood, SageMaker is a docker container. When you build a SageMaker model from scratch, you are just conforming your ML application structure to how SageMaker expects the container to be structured. This makes it a great match for Kubernetes, which is a very popular tool for orchestrating containerized applications.", "SageMaker operators give a way for companies and people to integrate work done in SageMaker with their K8\u2019s system. You can now interact with ML training, tuning, and inference containers from the comfort of the Kubernetes API or with kubectl commands. (learn more)", "Now you can invoke a SageMaker model directly from a SQL query within AWS (Athena or Aurora). This is meant to make ML models more accessible to analysts, developers, and business stakeholders throughout your organization.", "This seems good for some use cases. But to be honest\u2026 If you have a view of your data that is cleaned in a way that your ML model can take in, it makes more sense to run a batch prediction job, then save the predicted values to that table in another column. That way you are only invoking the model once per record, instead of every time the query is run for every single record. (learn more)", "When SageMaker was launched in 2017, it was behind some of the other early MLops data scientist tools. Since then it has made leaps and bounds of progress with new features and functionality. One can only expect things to change at a faster pace as these tools become more robust.", "Your home for data science.
