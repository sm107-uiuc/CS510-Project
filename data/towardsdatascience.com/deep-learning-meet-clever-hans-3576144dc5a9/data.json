Indeed, in public demonstrations, the horse, called Clever Hans, was able to answer all of its owner\u2019s questions correctly, by a sequence of taps of its hooves.", "Oskar Pfungst, a psychologist of the time at the University of Berlin, did not quite believe the animal really possessed such human-like capabilities and designed a set of experiments to prove the farmer\u2019s claim wrong. In 1907 he published his famous report on the matter, making a surprising observation: Clever Hans would only give the correct answer if the answer was known by the experimenter asking the question!", "The horse had not actually learned to solve the question by calculating or reading, but rather it recognized subtle cues in the experimenter\u2019s body language to figure out what answer was expected of it.", "To this day, the phenomenon of (human or animal) test subjects\u2019 actions in psychological studies being affected by the experimenter\u2019s expectations is known as \u201cClever Hans phenomenon\u201d. Typically, special care is taken to prevent the subjects from giving the right answer without solving the real task.", "Wait. I thought this article was about deep learning?", "Indeed, in modern-day, cutting-edge deep learning systems (and even simple regression) we encounter the same problem! The Clever Hans phenomenon, or in traditional statistics literature spurious correlations, can occur when there is a feature in the data that is highly correlated with the correct outcome (like the experimenter\u2019s body language), but is not the cause for the answer being correct (e.g. a correct calculation).", "A recent Nature article by Lapuschkin et al. beautifully illustrates that this effect is really occurring in modern deep learning models, e.g. for image recognition or playing ATARI games. (See below for more examples.)", "So, why should we care what information the model is using? The model is outputting the correct answer after all.", "Well, for your training and test data it does.", "But is it still correct at deployment? Can it be fooled easily because it relies on the wrong features?", "For example, imagine you have an algorithm distinguishing Wolves and Huskies, but it mainly tells them apart by the presence of snow in the image. Or, imagine you want to identify trains and boats (e.g., given the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset), but your algorithm actually learns to recognize water and rails. This would spell disaster for any serious application. You can actually find plenty of examples in the literature if you pay attention:", "Now, you could still argue that it\u2019s not all that bad; after all the network is solving the task correctly, just that the problem is not posed in a good way \u2014 just fix the data! And if you do, you\u2019re in good company. L\u00e9on Bottou, an acclaimed researcher currently at Facebook AI, thinks that fixing our problem statement can go a long way.", "So what\u2019s the big deal? Why are Clever-Hans-type mistakes so bad that we have to care about them independently of typical classification mistakes?", "The fact is, that that it is really not easy to find out whether your network is making Clever-Hans-type mistakes, precisely because they are not reflected in the classification error. Basically, you have to rely on having a bias-free dataset or a test-set of sufficient quality. Not very reassuring, given the examples above.", "If you are employing interpretability methods, and know what to look for, you might find Clever-Hans-type mistakes by just looking at what features the network is actually using. But for big datasets, this is infeasible. Researchers are starting to address the issue in a scalable way, but there is still a long way to go.", "As researchers and practitioners, it is important to have an awareness of Clever-Hans-type mistakes and to know where to start (trying) to uncover them. Beyond that \u2014 good luck out there!", "I hope you learned something useful!", "Your home for data science.
