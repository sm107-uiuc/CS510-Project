A good visualization is very hard to produce. Often during a presentation, people don\u2019t understand well enough the data, or the statistics involved but showing them a good visualization will help them understand the story we are trying to convey them. Therefore, they say a picture is worth a thousand words.", "I believe that visualization is one of the most powerful means of achieving personal goals. \u2014 Harvey Mackay", "The whole code for this tutorial can be found on my GitHub repository given below. Go check it out:", "One of the best and the most commonly used library used for visualization is called matplotlib. This library produces publishable quality plots. Throughout the tutorial, we will use the pyplot module. If you are using a jupyter notebook then you can directly import the library otherwise, you can use the below command to install it manually:", "The current new version of matplotlib is 3.2.1. You can refer to the official installation docs here.", "If you are using a jupyter notebook then you might want to add a \u201c!\u201d at the beginning of the command. This is just informing the kernel that the command is being entered.", "A bar plot or bar graph is a plot/graph that represents the value of categorical data with rectangle bars. The rectangle bars can be horizontal or vertical. Categorical data here can be the name of the movies, countries, football players, etc. Correspondingly the values can be the count of the movies that won Oscar, GDP of a country, players who scored most goals, etc.", "Below is the general syntax of the bar plot:", "The \u2018*\u2019 represents alternative parameters, I will mention only the most used parameter such as:", "The bar function returns all the containers in the form of bars (horizontal or vertical).", "Now, from here on I will explain the concepts via examples so that you will clearly understand its usage.", "Here to plot the bar plot, I will use the data from worldometer, which is coronavirus total death counts from the top 6 countries. The data was taken on 8\u20136\u201320, at 10:18 AM (CST).", "On executing this code on your notebook environment, you will get an amazing bar plot, with minimum details:", "In the below plot, let us add some spices to the plot, spices in the sense of adding some more parameters and making the plot look better and more informative. Also, there are some attributes that we can use to make the bar plot more informative. Below are some things that I would add:", "The \u2018Text\u2019 here can be replaced by the string of your choice, and the \u2018Path\u2019 represents the path where you want to store the plot.", "Yes, you read it right. By adding one extra character \u2018h\u2019, we can align the bars horizontally. Also, we can represent the bars in two or more different colors, this will increase the readability of the plots. Show below is the code with the modifications.", "At times you might want to stack two or more bar plots on top of each other. With the help of this, you can differentiate two separate quantities visually. To do this just follow.", "In the above plot, we can see two different variations of the data being plotted which are the total deaths and the total cases.", "Often many-a-times you might want to group two or more plots just to represent two or more different quantities or whatever. Also in the below code, you can learn to override the name of the x-axis with the name of your choice.", "In the above plot, we can easily visualize which country is doing well in terms of recovery or active cases, etc.", "The bar plot is one of the most simple and interesting plots available in the matplotlib library. It\u2019s fun to learn, I hope you guys have completely understood the in and out of the bar plot. Below is the brief table of contents I covered in the above part of the tutorial. Go take a look and make things clear in your head and come back to me if not.", "Thank you guys that\u2019s it for this tutorial \u201cMastering the Bar Plot in Python\u201d.
