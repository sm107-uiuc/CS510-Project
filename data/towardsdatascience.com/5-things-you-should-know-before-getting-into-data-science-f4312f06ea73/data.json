According to the January report from Indeed, there is a 29% increase in demand for data scientists year over year and a 344% increase since 2013.", "Companies are constantly looking for data scientists who are able to solve business problems. The tasks could be on saving operating costs, mining valuable insights from data, improving customer experience when using apps or websites and etc.", "Since data scientist\u2019s job is getting more popular, are you looking to get into the data science field? Before you are considering to switch or land your career in the data science field, I hope you can read this article till the end. Hence, you will know whether you like or is suitable for you.", "You will need to be independent. Not saying that you could not ask any help from your colleagues, but most of the time, you will need to solve by yourself. You will face a variety of issues all day long.", "For example, you wrote a program which is running smoothly for a long time. However, the program suddenly stops running. Or maybe your current production machine learning model out of a sudden performs poorly. You will need to find out the reasons and solve them by yourself.", "Besides, when you are reading academic papers, you do not understand the concept the author is trying to tell or having difficulties to implement the author\u2019s idea in code. You can still choose to consult your colleagues, but they might not have so much time to explain to you. They are able to give some samples to refer to, but you are still on your own to solve them.", "This is very important. Maybe you are okay to code, but you do not wish to face the screen with codes all day long. Then, data science might not be so suitable for you. You will spend most of your time staring at the codes either you are fixing bugs or coding.", "Let\u2019s say you are currently working a business intelligence. Your daily job is to fulfill business needs or requests. You have a mix of business and technical requests. Technical requests here means you have to write code to accomplish the task. Therefore, if you find yourself always switch your task to business tasks when you are bored with technical tasks, you should look before you leap.", "If you want to enjoy more in coding, start some projects which you find very interesting. Make sure you need to keep you motivated to finish the project. A program is nothing more than a tool, don\u2019t learn for the sake of learning it, learn it to create value.", "Technology is constantly changing. There will be new machine learning models release frequently or emerging new programming languages. In order to keep up with the technology, you will need to continuously learn.", "Besides, everyone is talented in the data science department. They will have at least one very strong skill, could be visualization, modeling, web crawling, communication, software engineering, debugging and etc. Therefore, prepare to adapt to the stressful yet exciting environment.", "Challenges could be fun at the same time. You will be able to learn a lot in a short period of time. If you are a person who embraces challenges, you will find a lot of fun in the data science department.", "You could not expect to find great satisfaction every single day. Being a data scientist is a lot like being a research scientist. Always experimenting with different methods to see which methods work.", "You will be spending your day looking through and understanding your data. Then, you will be able to obtain the important features for your model to perform well. After that, you experiment with different approaches or models to improve your model\u2019s performance. It may seem just consist of a few steps to arrive at the result, but this actually takes quite a long time.", "Be patient and keep working will be the key to your work to bear fruit.", "Communication is an essential skill no matter which job you are working in. You will need to communicate with the product team, operational team or etc to agree with the project details before starting the project.", "After back and forth discussions on how the service should look like, imagine that you have achieved the result with your sophisticated model. Now, you will have to explain it in a high-level term so that they will have some ideas or confidence in your service.", "Besides, when data is predicted wrongly, you will need to explain it in a very high-level way. For instance, you are working with the product team to train a model that is able to classify listing\u2019s reviews into good, neutral or bad reviews.", "One day, one of the product team members question why this review: \u201cCould you tell me whether the quality of this bag is good?\u201d is classified as positive news? This review should be classified as neutral. One possible explanation could be because the model recognizes the word \u201cgood\u201d as a positive feature.", "I hope that you will find it useful when you are considering whether to switch to the data science field.", "Although data scientist is the sexiest job in the 21st century according to the Harvard Business Review, think carefully before you are considering to switch to data science.", "If you love your work, if you enjoy it, you\u2019re already a success. \u2014 Jack Canfield", "Thank you for reading till the end and comment below on which topic you are interested to discuss on! Stay tuned for my post the next week!", "If you are interested in getting great proxies, feel free to check out this service!", "Low Wei Hong is a Data Scientist at Shopee. His experiences involved more on crawling websites, creating data pipeline and also implementing machine learning models on solving business problems.", "He provides crawling services that can provide you with the accurate and cleaned data which you need.
