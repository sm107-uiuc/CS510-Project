The project is focused on the question of whether or not we can create a model to predict winning teams based on performances. I tried to use logistic regression and other models to predict the match outcomes. Features were extracted from the data that Riot Games API exposes\u2013including champions picked for the game, player role information, and mastery levels for the players\u2019 champions (pre-game knowledge) as well as in-game player statistics. I found out that using only prematch knowledge (champions, masteries, roles, spells) from the very start is only a weak predictor of the match\u2019s outcome, but using in-game statistics, the model becomes a strong predictor.", "Just as they did with traditional sports, the collection, analysis, and use of all kinds of data are starting to change the way that online competitive games are played and concepted. Nowadays, as the E-sports have become more and more popular, data analyses on E-sports games have also become much more common.", "In this project, I chose the famous online game League of Legends (LoL), developed by Riot Games in 2009, as a case study. The main reason is that I had played and enjoyed the game since its 5th season and would like to bring a more informed view to this project than I would with another case study. An other important motivational point was the Riot Games\u2019 API, which allows the public to easily make queries and pull information from their servers.", "As League of Legends is a popular game, there are already a couple of applications that exist in the data analysis sphere. Websites like League of Graphs and MetaSrc collect basic stats and information from the League of Legends API and use it to construct simple analyses like what is the most popular champion and what is the win rate of two champions when they play together... What these existing applications do not currently do is the prediction of a currently ongoing game with all of the features of that game in mind, and that\u2019s what the project is attempting to fill.", "League of Legends is a Multiplayer Online Battleground Arena (MOBA) style game developed by Riot Games. Each game consists of two teams with 5 players each. Each team starts the game at opposite sides of the arena and the goal is to overcome obstacles (turrets, inhibitors and enemy players) in order to destroy the enemy base (Nexus). There are 5 standard positions for the team players divided across the map: Top, Middle, Jungle, Attack Damage Carry(ADC) and Support. Each match usually lasts between twenty minutes and an hour. The players can choose a unique champion from over 140 champions with different characteristics and abilities. The game represents also a flourishing competitive scene with millions in tournaments prize pools as well as online viewers.", "With so many parameters within each game, it is impossible to say that one factor is going to determine the success or failure of any particular player. Also, with such a large community behind League of Legends, predicting match outcomes for casual players and tournament games would be interesting and valuable for both players and fans.", "League of Legends is an intricate game that requires knowledge of many elements to be played proficiently. In the game, two teams of five players each battle against each other on a battlefield called Summoner\u2019s Rift. There are other battlefields with different objectives and layouts, but they will not be studied in our project. Summoner\u2019s Rift is comprised of each team\u2019s base, three lanes, and the jungle. The goal of League of Legends is to destroy the opposing team\u2019s Nexus, a structure located in the enemy base.", "The gold differential is an example of a raw statistic that can provide a sense of the state of a match at a glance. Usually when a team has more gold than the other team, it means their champions are carrying more powerful items and are more likely to win if they get into a team fight. Combined with individual KDA (Kills, Deaths, Assists) numbers and the overall number of kills a team has accrued, it\u2019s an easy way to let the viewers know who is winning. If we have a look at the LCS broadcast, gold differential is one of the first numbers we see at the top of the screen. But statistics like these don\u2019t tell the whole story\u2026", "I tried to extract data from the public Riot Games API , which allows collection of data about summoners (the LoL term for players), champions, and past matches. Then I gathered it all in a file with .xlsx format containing all the data available for each game played during the 2017 season.", "Remark : The downloaded dataset contained more than 75 variables, some of them were not meaningful. So I decided to get rid of those variables that won\u2019t be helpful in our analysis.", "I uploaded the data on Kaggle, feel free to download it here.", "So, I decided to delete 25 variables that won\u2019t be helpful in our prediction. Now, we have a dataset in .csv format which contains 50 variables.", "In order to interpret the downloaded match data file, you can find here a dictionary containing the variable names and their descriptions.", "Here is a preview of the dataset we are analyzing using the software Tableau Desktop:", "First of all, I tried to illustrate the impressive growth of the game by comparing the number of competitive games in our data with the previous year 2016.", "In 2016, 2429 games took place. League continues to grow with a substantial pace, reaching the unbelievable 3117 professional competitive games in 2017.", "We can also see that the leagues LPL, NALCS, LCK and EULCS have the most games with more than 350 each.", "Calculating the winning percentage is equivalent to estimating a proportion of wins in total number of games. As we can see below, there are teams who have 0% and 100% as a win ratio, and this is not coherent.", "The problem is that some teams have played just few games, others have even played just one game. In order to overcome that problem, we need to calculate the winning percentage just for the \u201cMost Appeared Team\u201d who played more than 60 games in different leagues.", "As we can see, SK Telecom T1, Flash Wolves and Samsung Galaxy possess the highest win rate. I first calculated the wins & loses, then I calculated the win ratio for each team individually:", "Another important factor in this game is the ratio of kills, deaths and assists KDA (kills, deaths, assists). Formula:", "Meanwhile, I also tried to use the linear regression method to see the correlation between Gold earned and Damage made. As shown below, there is a strong linear correlation between Gold and Damage, which means that players make good use of the gold earned in the games, and convert the gold into damage to the enemies.", "In addition, I studied other aspects of the League of Legends games, but I don\u2019t want to explain them here so as to avoid writing a long article. Maybe I can write other articles in the future to present the whole study. Now let\u2019s get to the most important part!", "Can we predict a game\u2019s result?", "Actually, using only prematch knowledge (champions, masteries, roles, spells) from the very start is only a weak predictor of match outcome, but using in-game statistics, the model becomes a strong predictor. That\u2019s why I will try to build our model based on in-game statistics.", "In fact, we\u2019re not sure which of our variables are useful in predicting a result outcome. It\u2019s often helpful to build bivariate models, which are models that predict the outcome using a single independent variable. But the problem is which of the 28 variables is a significant predictor of the Result variable in a bivariate logistic regression model? We need to build different models so as to find the best one with the highest accuracy, or we can use the correlation function to get an idea about the variables that are highly correlated with the variable Result.", "First, I began with excluding the variables referring to stats at the end of the game, because it would be too late to predict a win in that case. Also, I decided omit the variables related to individual stats since it is a team game and one player can\u2019t win by himself.", "I applied Logistic Regression and Random Forest on the same dataset. So I got variable importance (absolute coefficient for logistic regression) and (variable importance for random forest). I tried to combine the two to get a final variable importance. After many attempts, I managed to build a final model (Stacking : Logistic Regression & Random Froest) with the significant variables below:", "Shiny is an R package that makes it easy to build interactive web apps straight from R. I decided to build a web application containing two part:", "In this study, I used data related to one patch of the game because Riot Games attempts to keep champion win rates as close to 50%. Any win rate higher than 50% implies that the champion is giving the player an advantage while any win rate lower than 50% implies the champion is giving the player a disadvantage.", "In order to maintain balance, Riot decides to respectively nerf and buff these champions. That means there is a strong correlation between the number of changes in the patch and the win rate if the team select the same champions.", "We hope that we\u2019ll be able to look at more current data in the future, but this is a great demonstration of how data can power anyone from normal players, to Riot Games professional broadcasts, and even teams looking for ways to best analyze the strengths and weaknesses of enemy teams to make informed decisions.", "None of the existing sites, that mine data through the Riot API and release interesting statistics, can effectively predict the winner team during a game. This study takes on this task using different variables that are related to both teams stats in order to predict the winner.", "I wanted to mention that the Riot API also contains much more information which we ignore but could use for many other purposes."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
