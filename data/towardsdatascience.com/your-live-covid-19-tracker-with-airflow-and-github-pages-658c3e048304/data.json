So, imagine that you load the data and spend good time cleaning it, making exploratory data analyses, and creating impressive visualizations; then you decide to save your charts and share them. So far so good, but what about the next day? Do you manually run the script everyday once the data is updated? And, how can your friends check the charts without having to ask you for them?", "Luckily, there are a couple of tools to make this task quite simple. First, GitHub Pages allows you to create your own website where you can host your amazing new plots (and share them with the world.) Second, Apache Airflow allows you to schedule and automate processes and perform tasks. It is Python-based, but it handles tasks of different kinds (as running C++ or Bash scripts.)", "Let\u2019s take the widely used CSSE COVID-19 Dataset, provided by the Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, to make our visualizations. The first step in our journey is to load the datasets and (as always) clean them a bit: we simply change State and Country column names, group states by country and sum the values.", "That was easy, mainly thanks to the well-organized original dataset.", "Now we must choose what we would like to show. For this post, I decided to reproduce the nice chart at the Financial Times. This plot shows the trend of the Covid-19 deaths by country according to the number of days since each country first passed x number of average deaths. To accomplish this, we need to compute the rolling average of the time series in question. The following code does the trick:", "The original dataset provides the total count of cases each day, so we need to first compute the daily cases by calling .diff() (also notice that we will only show the top 10 countries;) then, we compute the rolling average for each column. By reseting the index and concatenating the rolled columns, we are able to refer the index as the number of x days since we first count n_since values. When calling rolling(n_since=3)[1].head() (deaths), you should see something like this:", "Pandas .plot() will quickly show the chart, but this type of plot deserves way more styling. Among the options, Bokeh is one of the simplest and featureful choices. I do not plan to explain further the capabilities of this library as there are many resources, but to just simply provide you with a customizing function I created (it follows the code above and thus it takes the rolling dataframe as input):", "Now it is time to let the world see it. Creating a Github website is quite simple and can be done by following the instructions in here. Basically, you will need to create a new public repository with the name structure username.github.io.", "You then commit your new Bokeh plot with the name index.html and push it. Finally, you will be able to see it at http://<username>.github.io. You can find mine here: https://hectoramirez.github.io/covid/Daily_deaths_Europe.html.", "So what happens tomorrow when the CSSE data set is updated? One option is to manually run your script and commit/push your plot to GitHub. Everyday. And try to do it early in the morning \u2014 your friends might want to check it during breakfast. Or\u2026", "As mentioned earlier, Apache Airflow allows you schedule and automate processes \u2014 like running scripts at a specific time. More technically,", "Airflow is used to create code pipeline where we can schedule and monitor our workflows. A workflow can be a collection of tasks to be executed like a flowchart.", "There are great resources to learn to use Airflow, including Airflow\u2019s own documentation, so I will guide you to towards our specific goal. Let\u2019s start by installing Airflow \u2014 it can be easily done via the pip tool:", "If everything is correct, by running $ airflow version you should see something like this:", "Airflow should have created a AIRFLOW_HOME folder and, in it, a dags folder (if not, create it yourself.) Within the home folder, we call", "in order to initialize the database related to the workflows.

They are run following a Schedule, using Cron\u2019s syntax.", "Back to our Covid-19 tracker. (This also provides a simple example of a DAG; for more complex tasks, refer to the documentation.)", "We need to create a DAG containing the tasks we want to execute to maintain our tracker updated: inside a Python file dags/covid_dag.py, we import the essential modules and define the default_args as shown below:", "Airflow operators allow to carry out tasks of the specific type. For example, we could copy/paste the bokeh_plot function inside the DAG file and make the PythonOperator call it. Similarly, you can have the function in an external script, import it and call it with the same operator. Another option is to have an external python script with all your functions and make a BashOperator run it for you. This is what we are going to do.", "start_date sets since when the workflow is executed. It can be a date in the past. The retries parameter tells how many times a DAG should be run in case the executing was unsuccessful.", "Next we define the DAG parameters:", "The first parameter is the DAG\u2019s name. schedule_interval tells the excecution frequency \u2014 every day at 1am for our case \u2014 . To avoid common pitfalls, a couple of notes are in order:", "Please take some time to read these entries and save energy in your future endeavors:", "From the starting date to the current one, there could have been several executions according to the schedule_interval. catchup tells whether these executions should be performed when we switch the DAG on.", "Now, we wrap up the full load-clean-bokehplot code into a covid_func.py script \u2014 when run, it should output the Bokeh plot in the same folder where the script is; however, as we want to host it in your GitHub website, you can change the output file by setting the output directory as", "As mentioned, we only want to run the script, so we can call the BashOperator to perform the task. It should look like this:", "Next, we need to commit and push the file. Commiting and pushing files from the terminal requires several steps and, actually, they can be done in Python too thanks to GitPython. Therefore, I decided to write a small script for commiting and pushing and then call it with another BashOperator:", "This requires that git is properly configured, and that you are allowed to connect to GitHub without having to supply your username or password at each visit. This is done via SSH, check this link out for details.", "Side note: Airflow provides a bunch of different operators. One of them is the GitOperator. Feel free to try it yourself if you want.", "We are now ready to add the next task to your covid_dag.py :", "As you can see, I decided to repeat the task just to be sure the pushing happened \u2014 no danger in that.", "Lastly, we specify the order of the tasks with the >> operator.", "Your DAG is now ready! Let\u2019s call $ airflow initdb again to set it up and open the Airflow GUI \u2014 your new covid DAG should be there.

Should anything go wrong, you should be able to track the error in the logs.", "Along this post, we took the widely used CSSE COVID-19 dataset and created a highly interactive Bokeh chart for the daily deaths of the top-10 countries (those with more deaths). We then committed it to GitHub Pages.", "As the data are updated daily, so should the plot. For this, we set Apache Airflow up, created a new DAG with the set of tasks needed to update the figure on a daily basis and started the airflow scheduler.", "I have created several more charts, all hosted in my GitHub website.
