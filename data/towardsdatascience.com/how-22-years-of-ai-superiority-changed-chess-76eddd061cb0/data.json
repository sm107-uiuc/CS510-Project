This was a landmark moment in the development of what we might call \u201cthinking machines\u201d, as a computer had proven itself better than the best human in what was then the world\u2019s most prestigious strategy game.", "The benchmark of a machine defeating a human at chess has mattered for hundreds of years. Famously, the mechanical Turk developed in 1770 thrilled and confounded luminaries as notable as Napoleon Bonaparte and Benjamin Franklin. Simply an elaborate hoax, the human-powered, not-quite-automaton fooled the public for almost 100 years. What made it remarkable was not just the fact it seemed to be an automaton, but that it was a seemingly-genius automaton, one able to beat humans in the Game of Kings. Since then, the pursuit of a machine capable of defeating humans in chess was a constant. In fact, the first wave of computer science pioneers, people like Alan Turing, Claude Shannon, and John von Neumann, all were chess players and all tried to make software that could master chess.", "By the time Deep Blue defeated Mr. Kasparov computers were already beating humans in chess. In the 1980s, for amateur chess players, the Radio Shack brand computer chess set could be a formidable opponent, and one with various skill levels to boot. Deep Blue\u2019s success was the crowning achievement, the point at which machine play fully exceeded human play, never to look back. Some 250 years in the making, we finally had a machine that played a prized strategy game better than we did.", "More recent machine conquests in games like Go, Poker, and Dota 2 make the original Deep Blue victory seem dated. But there\u2019s an important difference. Since it happened 22 years ago we have 22 years of evidence to consider. Deep Blue\u2019s victory did change chess, but not in the ways the people expected or predicted. How machines and humans co-exist in the world of chess, offers a tantalizing preview for what we can expect not just in the future of games like Go, Poker, and Dota 2, but in normal work and life contexts where machine intelligence will be augmenting or replacing human intelligence. While Deep Blue\u2019s technology has little in common with modern artificial intelligence, it is an object lesson in how humans and machines will come together.", "We spoke with Christopher Chabris, a cognitive scientist and chess master who covers the professional chess scene in his Game On! Column in the Wall Street Journal, about Deep Blue\u2019s conquest of chess and how the sport has changed, thanks to further advances in AI in the 22 years since. Chabris had this to share about the impact of Deep Blue\u2019s 1997 victory: \u201cA lot of people predicted that it couldn\u2019t happen or that it wouldn\u2019t happen then. So, I think there was a lot of surprise at Kasparov\u2019s loss. \u2026 Some people predicted that somehow this would ruin chess, that once computers could be really good at something, then humans would lose interest or it would be intrinsically a less rewarding activity for humans to engage in. In actuality, nothing happened. The very next month, the chess world went on. And I believe, if I\u2019m remembering my chess history correctly, Kasparov himself \u2014 after having been visibly devastated by the outcome of that match and having said some intemperate things that he probably didn\u2019t mean to say or wasn\u2019t proud of later on \u2014 he came back and won a strong grandmaster tournament with some of his best games ever, later that same year. [Kasparov] went on to remain the world champion for three more years and I think was still at the top of the rating list when he himself retired from play. Chess pretty much continued on as it had at least in terms of popularity.\u201d", "Of course, today, Deep Blue is no longer the best chess \u201cplayer\u201d in the world, not even close. Twenty years later, your smartphone has a better computer than IBM did for Deep Blue. \u201cHaving one computer that could beat the world champion, that was stored in an IBM research lab didn\u2019t really change things very much,\u201d says Chabris. \u201cBut having everyone with a computer that can beat the world champion certainly has changed things quite a bit. \u2026 Phones are now banned from chess tournaments because it\u2019s much too easy to cheat. If you\u2019re playing in the tournament, if you could just go into the bathroom and look at your phone, you could win every game.\u201d", "While it\u2019s amusing to consider all the ways introducing smartphone machine chess surreptitiously into competition could change outcomes, AI has influenced the way the game is played at a deeper level. For starters, let\u2019s consider the realm of defensive strategy: \u201cComputers are great at defense because they will examine every move. And they will not be emotionally affected by the fact that they have a bad position and they\u2019re on the defense,\u201d says Chabris. \u201cThey will just look at every possibility and analyze it as long as they possibly can. And by doing that, they basically show that a lot of positions are defendable \u2026 that defense was more possible than people have thought.\u201d", "Patience is certainly a hard one for many of us. And while a human might favor an active plan of attack, the computer may pursue a vastly different strategy, focused on slow but steady improvement, waiting for the opponent to slip up. \u201cStrategies of maintaining pressure until the other guy becomes the first to make a significant error \u2014 computers show that those are better strategies than we would have realized,\u201d says Chabris.", "Computer chess has impacted top level play and coaching as well. Coaches use software to help analyze the games of their students and trainees. And top players all have to be prepared for their opponents to play the unique, even inhuman moves learned from machine games.", "Machine chess has changed the way people learn the game in a number of ways. In the past, books and magazines played an important role in a person\u2019s path to improvement and mastery of the game. \u201cThere\u2019s still a huge amount of printed literature in chess,\u201d says Chabris. \u201cIn fact, there are probably more chess books coming out now than anytime in the past, and the more great chess books coming out.\u201d But increasingly chess books are not as important, as strong players can use computers to study, learn, and advance their game. Computer chess programs can evaluate your play, calculate optimal moves, and annotate your game for you. The software can not only point out every mistake, it can also tell you the severity of that mistake and show you what the best move should have been. \u201cIt\u2019s like a really good coach, telling you, \u2018You should have done this. You should have done that,\u2019\u201d says Chabris. \u201cAnd that can be very useful for improvement, just studying and just seeing that.\u201d", "However, computer chess remains an imperfect system, at least when it comes to human learning. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t explain why you should have played that move,\u201d says Chabris. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t explain how maybe you could be better at finding those better moves in the future. It just says, \u2018Here\u2019s your mistake. Here\u2019s what you should have done.\u2019 \u2026 That\u2019s the kind of thing that a human coach might do. And I think eventually computers could do it, too. It\u2019s a matter of research effort being put into it.\u201d Most humans, most of the time, don\u2019t learn merely by being shown the correct answer. There is a learning process. But, in the ways that computer chess is now being leveraged, the two steps forward of perfect and real-time information is accompanied by the one step back of losing the process that best enabled you to learn in the first place.", "Adding the layer of why to chess software probably needs human insight at this point, but weaving that human perspective into the software is just a matter of time, money, and will. The market for chess education may not be lucrative enough to make it happen anytime soon, but it\u2019s safe to say there are not technical barriers to software offering this to the end user, merely limits to what machine learning-generated analysis software can do.", "In a broader sense, the evolution of the game of chess and the process of chess education over the past 22 years, hints at the way in which humans may change, adapt and improve by collaborating with smart machines.", "After recovering from his loss to Deep Blue Garry Kasparov \u2014 considered by many the greatest chess player to have ever lived \u2014 embraced machine chess. He pioneered a game called Advanced Chess, or Centaur Chess, that involved humans and computers collaborating. It never really caught on and is a small sideshow in the larger chess community.", "\u201cAt what point does the divergence between the human\u2019s ability and the computer\u2019s ability becomes so great that it becomes a mistake to insert the human into the system?\u201d asks Chabris. \u201cIn the early days of this, I think the idea that Kasparov had was that, there are certain kinds of situations in chess that the human understands better, and certain kinds that the computer understands better and therefore the optimal combination is to let the human exercise judgment over whether to follow the computer\u2019s advice.\u201d", "\u201cThat proportion has been shrinking over time \u2026 to the point where you start to run the risk that the human might think they know better when they really don\u2019t \u2014 sort of like overwriting the computer, when in fact the computer would offer the best chance of making the best moves. Or in a more critical situation, where the computer has the best chance of driving the car, or landing the plane, or making the right medical diagnosis.\u201d", "What are some broader lessons we can take from 22 years of computers ruling the chess world? \u201cWhen computers get really good in an intellectual activity, it doesn\u2019t kill the activity. In fact, it may even make it more interesting and more democratic for humans because it makes the availability of top-quality performance more universal,\u201d said Chabris. For Chabris, this democratization is a game changer in more ways than one. Prior to machine chess, only a privileged few were able to access top-quality training at an early age. \u201cNowadays, you don\u2019t even need to have that much money or have a trainer,\u201d says Chabris. Perhaps a little ironically, AI chess has in fact leveled the playing field for humans.", "As computer chess continues to improve and is now an accepted pillar of the game, attitudes towards it are changing as well. \u201c\u2018Oh, that\u2019s an engine move,\u2019 or \u2018That\u2019s a computer move.\u2019 That used to be an insult in chess. A computer move was a stupid pointless move that computers made for some obscure reason that didn\u2019t make any sense,\u201d says Chabris. \u201cNow, a computer move means a move that\u2019s so good and yet so unusual that only a computer would see it and see how good it is.\u201d", "There is still, of course, a long way to go, when it comes to learning from machine interaction. \u201cHaving a near objective oracle or something that you regard as objective is not the only ingredient necessary for learning and improvement and better decision making,\u201d says Chabris. \u201cHumans are always capable of ignoring, even objectively good ideas, information, opinions, and so on.\u201d", "\u201cMaybe we also need to learn more about how to make the best use of these kinds of tools, says Chabris. \u201cThey\u2019re new. We haven\u2019t had them around for very long. We need to really learn how \u2026 to use computational tools better and to study the relationships between people and computational tools more.\u201d", "These are all good reminders that AI automation is not something to be afraid of. It won\u2019t quickly kill our work, and it will take time for it to mature from clumsy to effective, longer still to optimal. Because, as we\u2019ve seen, with AI and chess, whether the players be human or machine, the Game of Kings remains an inviting challenge.", "Creative Next is a podcast exploring the impact of AI-driven automation on the lives of creative workers, people like writers, researchers, artists, designers, engineers, and entrepreneurs.
