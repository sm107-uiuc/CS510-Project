Workflows are created in YAML and automatically run right on GitHub repositories. The link below gives an excellent overview of GitHub Actions.", "The documentation above does a great job introducing GitHub Actions along with workflow file syntax. This article introduces a couple basic workflows that are used to add continuous integration on GitHub projects.", "This first example covers a workflow in the py27hash repository.", "All GitHub repositories are ready to go with GitHub Actions. The screenshot below shows the location of GitHub Actions workflows.", "GitHub will automatically run any workflow file that is stored in the .github/workflows directory. For example, the py27hash repository has a workflow file named build.yml.", "The snippet below shows the build.yml workflow file stored in the py27hash repository.", "This build file runs on pushes and pull requests. The workflow runs on a Ubuntu Linux VM, checks out the code and runs a series of Python unit tests. If those are successful, test coverage is sent to coveralls.io.", "Let\u2019s review the syntax below (remember to check out https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions for more detailed workflow documentation).", "Set the actions that trigger the workflow.", "Prepare the build environment. The steps below checkout the code from GitHub and setup a Python 3.6 runtime environment for testing.", "If the tests are successful, send test coverage report to Coveralls. Note the last line, secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN, this is a built-in that authenticates the current user when submitting to Coveralls.", "This is another advantage of GitHub, we don\u2019t need to grant external services access to our GitHub repository.", "The following shows workflow status from the Actions Tab.", "As we can see, two commits to the py27hash repository have triggered the build.yml workflow. The details for each run can be found by clicking on the run. An example is shown below.", "What if our project supports multiple platforms or versions. No problem, GitHub Actions has that taken care of. Next, we\u2019ll review the workflow file that\u2019s part of the txtai repository.", "The build workflow file is below:", "Let\u2019s once again review the workflow syntax, only covering the new items in this file.", "Setting multiple environments is established via a build matrix. The configuration below establishes build environments for Ubuntu, macOS and Windows. This same method could also be used to test multiple versions of Python.", "Each environment by default will run all the steps in the workflow. But conditional steps can also be executed per environment. The steps below install dependencies for macOS and Windows, respectively.", "The remaining steps are the same as above. The only exception is that test coverage is only sent for a single environment (Ubuntu).", "Upon completion, a separate workflow status section is created per environment. The build is only successful, if it\u2019s successful for all environments.", "This article gives a very brief overview of GitHub Actions, covering a couple basic workflows for automated testing. There is a wealth of additional functionality to automate deployment, tagging and other actions.", "The performance has been great and it\u2019s a much simpler, arguably more secure way to run continuous integration, compared to external build systems.
