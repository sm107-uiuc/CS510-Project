I know I definitely have. In fact, let me share a quick story with you.", "Late one night in early March 2012, I was writing code for a class known at MIT known as 6.01: Intro to EE & CS in our (famous?) Building 32: Stata Center, built by the award winning architect Frank Gehry. I was with a close friend who would later fall in love with cryptography, and this stuff came naturally to him. Meanwhile, I was feeling dumber by the hour, and a tendency to social comparison bias was driving me to feel twice as worse about myself. I spent five hours bashing my head against a wall, and felt totally stupid when I realized I was telling my code to access a variable that wasn\u2019t even there\u2026", "Fast forward 7 years, and I write or read code almost every day. I can\u2019t say that I love debugging, but the practice doesn\u2019t activate this circuit of inadequacy like it used to. Looking back, I wish I had someone to let me know that this happens, not knowing how to solve bugs is normal, and give me some tips. So today, on the last Friday of 2019, I\u2019ve put together 3 ways to help you debug your code more effectively, and help you along your journey as you get into software engineering.", "The first step is to figure out how to actually read the stack trace. Now, when I was a budding software engineer and I would get an error, I would often become frustrated, and definitely feel very stupid. Then, after complaining for a little while, I would read my stack trace. So stop that! As soon as you receive or see an error, just read the stack trace. Now, I know that I\u2019ve said that like three times, but I can\u2019t even begin to emphasize that a lot of the secret to solving the problem is right in front of you.", "Now in Python, the three most common types of errors are:", "Now imagine you have an Attribute Error. What does that mean? Well, let\u2019s think in terms of an analogy. Let\u2019s pretend we have an attribute \u201ccat.\u201d What are the attributes of cats? They have fur, they have whiskers. But what about the feature of underwater breathing? Well, unless you have a very rare mermaid cat, you\u2019re not going to be able to actually find that attribute. So, your program is going to get really upset at you and spit back the AttributeError, because the typical object \u201ccat\u201d does not have that feature!", "Now the second error that you\u2019ve run into is the InputError. That one is pretty straightforward. Basically, it means that your program is not able to load the module that you had specified. This usually is fixed by locally downloading those modules using \u2018brew\u2019, \u2018pip install\u2019, or double checking that you\u2019ve imported all the necessary packages that you use in the body of your code.", "The third issue is, the IndexError. Imagine you have a book, but it only has 5 pages. But then, I tell my program to look for page 8. My program is going to get pissed. Why? Because there are only 5 pages in the book. That\u2019s the general sort of idea. You can only search up to the max. You can\u2019t go beyond or out of index.", "Of course, these errors are only a snapshot of the three most common Python errors that occur, a whole menagerie of them may lay ahead of you. Once you\u2019ve identified what your error is, then it\u2019s time for you to move on to step 2.", "My second recommended action is to engage in deep, uninterrupted focus for at least 20 minutes of uninterrupted attention. Typically, this is the hardest part for people, especially if you have a wild monkey mind that has a tendency to think about random shit. I don\u2019t want you guys to do that. If you actually look through your code, you\u2019ll realize that it will often tell you what lines the errors are coming from, as well as modules and what other dependencies are having issues. As you do this, within 20 minutes, you should be able to begin piecing together what your error is, how your error is emerging, and how you can fix it.", "If harnessing the force of will is too difficult for you, then I recommend setting a timer on your phone or in your browser (Google Timer has a particularly annoying alarm). The only rule is that you can only think about the bug for 20 minutes. For those of you productivity hackers out there, this is an application of the Pomodoro Technique to the art of debugging. Now if you\u2019ve already dedicated 20 minutes of uninterrupted, undivided attention, then that leads us to our third and final suggestion for improving your debugging process.", "Now, there are two forms of this community. There is the community directly around you if you\u2019re working with an in-person team, and there\u2019s the community of people accessible through the touch of a fingertip.", "Now, let\u2019s say that you work on enterprise software. IF you really don\u2019t know how to solve the bug, then why not ask for help? For example, that girl sitting next to you may have wrangled with that difficult API you just can\u2019t get, more often than you bought an iced grande black coffee from Starbucks this past month! No really, I\u2019m serious.", "And now, what about this community accessible through the touch of a fingertip? I\u2019m referring to having access to the global software community. You\u2019ll want to first take a look at two key websites: GitHub Issues, and StackOverflow. What\u2019s nice about these communities is that you can ask for help and usually get a response within 24 hours. Likewise, you can often find the answer by looking back at similar bugs and issues that people have encountered over the past. The point of the story is that we can leverage the collective power of community, either directly around us or the online global community.", "Now the question of the day is, how do you debug more effectively?", "Your home for data science.
