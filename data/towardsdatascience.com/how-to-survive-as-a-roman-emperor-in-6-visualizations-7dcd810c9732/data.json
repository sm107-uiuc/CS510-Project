You take it to your living room, and before you have a chance to blow the dust out from the blinking red button on top, a blue light engulfs your body, and suddenly you are being crowned Caesar of the Roman Empire. Your 200 hours of Man vs. Wild won\u2019t help you survive here, so let me give you some advice.", "During one week, I explored the lives and (mostly) deaths of all Roman Emperors since Caesar\u2019s adopted son Octavian (known as Augustus because of his title) seized power in 27 BC until the fall of the Eastern Empire in 1453. The data was scraped from Wikipedia\u2019s List of Roman Emperors and analyzed using Python (mostly pandas for manipulating data and matplotlib/seaborn for plotting). You can see all of the code here.", "After intense research, I have compiled some fundamental things you need to know before your trip to Ancient Rome. Time travel companies have a strict no refund policy in case of tragic death during the period of stay, so read along if you want to save those precious dollars.", "Okay, I get it. You\u2019re thinking, \u201cBeing emperor can\u2019t be that bad. They were the most powerful being on Earth; even Cleopatra didn\u2019t mess with them.\u201d And you\u2019re right, we have all heard about the deeds and glories of these nearly mythological figures. The praise is not unfair; these were one of the most powerful people on Earth. However, with great power comes great jealousy, and we all know about the treasonous fraternal relationships of the time (yes, Brutus, I\u2019m talking about you).", "Let\u2019s take a closer look at your chances of survival by plotting a histogram of the Roman Emperors\u2019 age at the time of death and one of the time they spent in power:", "From the histograms, we see that they had long lifespans in comparison to others in their time, with a life expectancy of around 51 years (the life expectancy in the Roman Empire was about 25 years). At first, this might confirm our expectations that being born in the royal midst really paid off for these lucky bastards. However, the analysis overlooks the fact that infant mortality was the leading cause of death at the time (about half of the population died before the age of 5), and our sample only contains those that were old enough to become emperor. We are considering those that survived the most dangerous part of their lives, but who knows how many royal babies succumbed before being crowned? If we factor infant mortality out of the equation, the roman population of the time actually lived until their late 50s, meaning that our emperors had the same \u2014 if not shorter \u2014 lifespans.", "The second interesting finding from the histograms is that despite having permanent positions, the emperors did not stay in power for long. The average time in power was 10 years, but over half of them occupied the position for only 6 years or less. Let\u2019s compare that to American Presidents: since 1789, there have been 44 presidents, meaning each one spent, on average (2020\u20131789) / 44 = 5.25 years in office with over half of them spending 4 years or less. Not that different, huh?", "Let\u2019s try to visualize the time these emperors spent in power and whether they had a nice retirement. (The graph is somewhat long).", "This plot seems to confirm our suspicions. Except for a few outliers, most emperors died right after rising to power, especially in the first years of the Empire. It seems like receiving total control of the most powerful civilization on Earth was more a curse than anything else. Let\u2019s investigate the causes of deaths for these emperors; maybe they can shed some light on the matter.", "Just as I expected, violence ran loose in the Mediterranean lands. Out of the 121 emperors that I was able to get information on the cause of demise, 74 suffered a violent death \u2014 that\u2019s 61%!", "Let\u2019s use this graph to maximize your chances of surviving by employing techniques that prevent the most common causes of death for each period of life.", "If you are 20 years old or less, be wary! Usurpers will try to use your naivety against you, so be aware of suspicious invitations to battle-themed pajama parties or personal trainers that keep suggesting that you should bath with them.", "By the age of 30, your priorities change: start taking care of your physical and mental health. Maintaining a fit body will avoid common illnesses and make the murderers think twice before dueling with your physique.", "The pause from violence will be well deserved, but not long-lasting, because your 40s are there to remind you that you should never lower your guard. Also, never sign documents without reading \u2014 the roman justice system is ruthless and you don\u2019t want to end up on the wrong side of Colosseum\u2019s balcony.", "If you made it to your 70s, well done. Against all the odds, you have survived one of the most dangerous jobs in history (and with such grace!). As you face the vast lands of your Empire from your bathroom window and remember the golden times, you can brainstorm some derivatives of your name to give to that charming town you visited last weekend.", "According to this graph, yes. Assassinations are the clear winner when it comes to the death trends of the early Roman Empire, especially from 150 to 300 AD \u2014 we had a whopping 17 murders in merely 50 years. After violence stopped being mainstream, we saw a return in natural cause deaths and a small but meaningful preference for head severings. During the last 50 years, the decay of the Empire inspired a counterculture movement where each emperor started trying their own death style.", "Let\u2019s try to condense all of the information from the previous graphs into just one, using Bokeh \u2014 a graphing tool in Python.", "That\u2019s it for today\u2019s survival (and some history) lesson, folks. From these simple graphs, we learned several important things:", "Disclaimer: This article was written for entertainment purposes. I cannot attest to the accuracy of the information discussed.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Aspiring Data Scientist.
