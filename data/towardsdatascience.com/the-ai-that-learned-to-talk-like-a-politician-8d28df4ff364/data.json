I think their platform is an interesting Deep Learning case study, and reveals insights that are relevant to anyone working in Artificial Intelligence and data science.", "When Cloudsight was creating their neural network driven captioning platform, they ran into a training challenge that I think is fascinating. It\u2019s like overfitting, but with a twist. And it inadvertently led to an AI which trained itself to speak like a politician!", "With Cloudsight\u2019s platform, users upload an image, and the system tries to describe it with a full sentence caption. The basic architecture of their system uses Neural Networks in a transformer-based approach to create their captions, drawing on a giant training set of mostly ecommerce images.", "In training their model, they followed the standard protocol for training a NN. You feed it input, evaluate its output, and let it propagate errors back through its nodes, changing the weights of different inputs and hidden layers. Then you do the whole thing again, over and over, for a certain number of training epochs.", "With NNs, there are really no stopping conditions. So the usual protocol is to monitor the output, and see when the error rate plateaus. When that happens, you can be fairly certain the model has found a minima on the error surface.", "Perhaps you run the model again with different starting conditions, making sure you found a global minima and not a local minima. But at the end, you see a clear plateau, and know the model is fully trained and you can stop.", "Cloudsight\u2019s protocol is a bit different, because their evaluation criteria are a bit different. The captions their system generates have to make sense to a person. So to choose the proper number of training epochs, they have to run their system\u2019s output by a person, who decides if the NN\u2019s captions accurately describe an image.", "But here\u2019s the catch. There\u2019s a loophole in this system.", "At first, Cloudsight found that their untrained NN did a good job of generating very specific captions. For the training image at the top of this article, for example, it wrote \u201cman in white crew neck t shirt and green shorts holding tennis racket\u201d, \u201cman holding tennis racket on green field\u201d, etc.", "That\u2019s very specific \u2014 you get a description of the gender of the person, the action they\u2019re performing (generally), and their clothing.", "It\u2019s also wrong. The man is wearing white shorts, not green ones. The model likely saw the green color from the other person bending down, and assigned the \u201cgreen shorts\u201d to the man holding the racket. And he\u2019s on a court, not a field.", "Under Cloudsight\u2019s evaluation criteria, the NN got penalized for producing this incorrect output. So it did something very interesting. With each successive training epoch, it got more general. So instead of even attempting to describe the person\u2019s clothing, the setting, etc it slowly veered towards descriptions like \u201ca person standing\u201d or just \u201ca person.\u201d", "Here\u2019s the thing \u2014 that output is technically correct. The image does depict a person. So the NN would score a \u201ccorrect\u201d on that output, even if the output is very, very general.", "To paraphrase R.E.M., the system had learned \u201ca way to talk around the problem.\u201d", "In effect, as Cloudsight pointed out in their internal reviews, the NN had figured out how to act like a politician \u2014 choosing output that has very little actual content, and thus always avoids saying anything wrong.", "Interviewer: Sir, where do you stand on tax breaks?", "Politician: I feel that all American people have the right to live up to their full potential, in this great land that we call home.", "The issue, of course, is that while the general output is technically correct according to Cloudsight\u2019s evaluation criteria, it\u2019s also kind of useless as an actual caption.", "Sure, the image does contain a person. But it\u2019s the actions they\u2019re performing, what they\u2019re holding, etc. that actually matter.", "Cloudsight\u2019s challenge here was essentially one of overfitting \u2014 but with a new wrinkle.", "Anyone in data science is familiar with the problem of overfitting to training data. Choose data that\u2019s too domain-specific or too narrow, and you can train a regression model or NN that does very well on it. But unleash that model on the real world, and it will do terribly. You\u2019ve \u201coverfit\u201d your model to the training data, and it\u2019s not able to process anything outside your training set.", "Cloudsight\u2019s system faced a different version of overfitting. Rather than overfitting to the training data, it had overfit to the evaluation criteria.", "Instead of actually getting better at describing images, it had gotten really good at producing outfit that gamed the system, satisfying the evaluation criteria (\u201cDoes this caption accurately describe the visual content of the image?\u201d) while missing the actual business/technical use case for the system (providing a human-readable image caption).", "This illustrates the importance of choosing your evaluation criteria very carefully when training a NN or other Deep Learning model. Modern NNs are powerful. They will learn to satisfy your evaluation criteria. But if the criteria are flawed, so will be your output.", "Cloudsight solved this issue by tailoring the number of training epochs \u2014 and thus the accuracy/generality of the model \u2014 to specific customers\u2019 use cases.", "For some users, a more verbose \u2014 but possibly inaccurate \u2014 caption would be fine. Perhaps they have their own humans in the loop, who could catch errors like the green shorts and make a simple change to the computer-generated caption. For these users (like those in the stock photo industry), Cloudsight can train through fewer epochs (an average of 4), skewing the results more towards verbosity and specificity, with a possible loss of accuracy.", "For other users, accuracy is crucial \u2014 they\u2019d rather have a general caption than an inaccurate one. For them, \u201ca person\u201d might be fine, and would be better than a more specific caption that\u2019s more likely to be inaccurate. Basically, they want a politician. This makes sense for users with limited resources for manually checking captions, or users processing tons of images (like for an ecommerce platform). For these users, Cloudsight trains through an average of 18 epochs, making for much more general, but usually more accurate, output.", "Basically, Cloudsight is recognizing that their training protocol has to strike a balance between accuracy and generality, and is setting the threshold and cutoff between the two at different points for different users, by training through a varying number of epochs (between 3 and 20 on average).", "Again, Cloudsight\u2019s experiences underscore the importance of setting your evaluation criteria appropriately when training a Deep Learning system. Just because you\u2019re getting error-free output doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ve actually solved the real-world problem you set out to address.", "It also illustrates the importance of involving a human team in your evaluation process. Humans can spot examples of overfitting, and devise solutions tailored to a specific business case. For Cloudsight, this meant using their overfitting problem as a tool, tailoring the number of training epochs to different customer use cases and thus varying their model\u2019s output.", "For others, it might mean knowing when to ask for more data, to avoid overfitting to a specific dataset. Or it might mean looking for training data beyond public datasets, to ensure that you\u2019re not overfitting to materials which are already available to your competition.", "It\u2019s also probably a commentary on politicians \u2014 but that\u2019s a topic for another article!", "Your home for data science.
