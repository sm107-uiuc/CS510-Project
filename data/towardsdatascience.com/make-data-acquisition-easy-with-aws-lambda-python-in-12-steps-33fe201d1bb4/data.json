This article is written for people with at least basic (and I mean basic) understanding of Python, but you can be brand new to AWS. We will create an AWS account and then have a Lambda function pull data from Craigslist and store it in a S3 bucket for us automatically, daily.", "About Me: Data scientist and enthusiast who is continuously trying to learn new technologies that make my life easier. Like many in the data science community I am self taught and not from a statistics or CS background. In a past life I was a mechanical engineer, but that feels like eons ago. Over the years I have gotten pretty good with Python and AWS (I have a few of the certifications), and because I\u2019ve always learned so much from others I thought it was my turn to contribute to the community. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or check out my Github profile if you find this article useful.", "Often I run into this scenario of \u201cI wrote this Python function and need it to run every day\u201d. You could set up a Cron on your machine, but what if your computer is off? The other option is to turn to the cloud. The old way to do this with AWS was to spin up an EC2 instance, SSH into it, give it your function or maybe a docker image, set up a Cron job there, and so forth. That isn\u2019t too bad, but it is a bit of a pain. Also, if I just need something to run daily do I really need a EC2 instance running all day? Enter Lambda (yes I know you could also use Batch for this, but this is a Lambda tutorial).", "AWS has a ton of services, but perhaps my favorite is AWS Lambda. Basically it lets you focus on writing code and not dealing with annoying things like VPCs, EC2 instances, MySQL databases, etc. Just write some Python, give that code to Lambda, and it will execute that code in the Cloud. Even better, you can trigger that code in a variety of ways: every minute, once a day, when you put something into an S3 bucket, etc. Lambda is totally awesome (and cheap) and has quickly become my most used AWS service.", "In twelve, concise steps we will set up a Lambda function that will automatically pull data from Craigslist every day and store that data (in JSON) in S3. This is just one example, but you could use this tutorial to run any Python function automatically at some interval you specify. Admittedly this article is a bit long, but I wanted to make sure it would be easily reproducible, especially for beginners. If you ever get stuck feel free to reach out to me and we can try to debug it. A final note is everything here should be well within free tier, so it won\u2019t cost you a penny. Lambda gives you a million free requests a month, so unless you plan on firing this baby every second you should be good.", "Head over to https://aws.amazon.com and signup for a free account. Note you will need to verify your phone number, but the whole process should only take a few minutes. At the end select the \u201cBasic\u201d plan, which gives you a solid amount of compute power for free for 12 months.", "S3 Buckets are a place we can store data (or object data to be more specific). It\u2019s basically like a folder on your computer, but in the cloud! Go to Services > Storage > S3 and you will be brought to the S3 splash screen. Click \u201cCreate bucket\u201d and give your bucket a name and pick the region closest to you. I named by bucket \u201cmy-super-sweet-bucket\u201d, and you can name yours whatever you want. Just know the bucket names have to be unique globally, so you can\u2019t have my awesome bucket name. After giving it the name and region just stick with all the defaults (click Next until your bucket is created). This will create your bucket, and make a note of what you called it as we will need it later.", "Now that we have a bucket to store our data from Lambda, it\u2019s time to create our Lambda function. If you hover over Services at the top and under Compute you will find Lambda.", "Since you haven\u2019t made a Lambda yet you will get a splash screen introducing you to the world of Lambda. Click the \u201cCreate a Function\u201d button to make your Lambda.", "Next you will be asked to name your function, specify a programming language, and give it a role.", "Quick Aside \u2014 What is a Role? Amazon Web Services is a vast and mysterious beast, with a lot of things going on. One thing worth noting is nearly everything in AWS uses a rule of \u201cLeast Permissions\u201d, which basically says by default nothing gets permissions to access anything. For example, let\u2019s say you create a user named Bob in your AWS Network. By default, when Bob logs in, he can\u2019t access any AWS service. Bob can login but he can\u2019t use S3, EC2, Lambda or anything else. Poor Bob. Unless it is explicitly stated then no access is given. Anyways, a role is a way of programmatically granting access. Basically it will tell AWS that \u201cThis is my Lambda function and I want it to be able to access S3\u201d. Without this role your Lambda function will be just like Poor Bob with no access. Don\u2019t make your Lambda like Bob.", "Anyways, you can name your Lambda function whatever you want. I named mine creatively \u201cpullCraigslistAds\u201d. Since it\u2019s 2019, and we are modern men and women, we will be using Python 3.7 and not any of that 2.7 nonsense. Note that Lambda can be used with a lot of othe programming languages, but here we will use Python. For now Permissions can be set to \u201cCreate a new role with basic Lambda permissions\u201d. We fix our role later in the tutorial.", "The whole point of Lambda is to have it execute some code for us. Once you\u2019ve created your Lambda function you will notice there is a code editor right there in the browser. Often times youcan just write code right there in the editor. However, in this tutorial we are going to use some outside (not built into Python) libraries, like Requests, we will need to do things a bit different by uploading a zip file. If you don\u2019t need to import any libraries that don\u2019t come with Python you can just write it inline. If you do need to import libraries we will need the Zip file. That is, Lambda can run your Python code no problem-o but what if you don\u2019t need libraries like Pandas, Requests, Matplotlib or anything else you installed with Pip. In this tutorial we will be using the python-craigslist library, so we go with the \u201cUpload .zip file\u201d option.", "Note: If you are in a rush and want to skip some steps you can clone this repository that will provide you the final Zip file you need to give to Lambda. If you just clone the repo you can jump to Step 8.", "If you aren\u2019t lazy and want to follow along then create a new folder anywhere on your machine and save the code below into a file called \u201clambda_function.py\u201d.", "What is this doing \u2014 Basically it is using a Python library called craigslist to scrape Craigslist for us. The first few lines import our libraries. Line 7 is where we define our function, giving it the input of event and context. If you want to get nerdy and read into it, check out the AWS Docs. At a high level, event passes the function meta data about the trigger and context is something that passes runtime info to the function. For this function we don\u2019t need to mess with them much, but in the next part of this series we will need to use event. For example, if we trigger a Lambda when something is put into an S3 bucket we can use event to get that file name, which is often handy.", "Anyways, the rest of the function is fairly straightforward for those who have used Python: instantiate our class, tell it what data to pull, and store that in some JSON. Lines 28 to 31 are how we send that data to S3 using Boto3. If you\u2019ve never used Boto3, it is a Python SDK, or in plain English it is how you can interact with AWS via Python. Boto3 lets you put stuff in S3, invoke a Lambda, create a bucket, etc. If you want to use AWS resources from a Python script than Boto3 is your answer. Here we use one of its most basic features: output to our S3 bucket. On line 29 you will need to update the bucket name to whatever you named your bucket in Step 2. For reference, below is some sample data from our function, which is just data scraped from a Craigslist ad for apartments.", "A final note is that this is just our sample code, but this could be anything. For example, it could call an API, dump that data to JSON and store that JSON in a NoSQL database. Here we are outputting JSON to an S3 bucket but this could be many things.", "Lambda runs Python in the cloud for you, but what does its version of Python have? Anyone who uses Python regularly is highly dependent on libraries, which are open source pre-written blobs of code we can use (\u201cimport pandas as pd\u201d, anyone)? As an example, what happens in our Lambda (if I go back to inline) if I import requests?", "Note: Be sure to save your function before clicking test, or else it is testing the previous version of the code without requests included. A good rule of thumb is to always be saving your Lambda function, it\u2019s easy to forget to do it and then you are debugging the past version.", "Basically our Lambda fails because this Python environment doesn\u2019t have the requests library. So how do we get it (or any library)? There are several ways, but this is how I\u2019ve found it easiest. We already have our lambda_function.py file saved in a folder. Next pip install your dependencies into that same folder. Looking back at our code, the only dependency we have is the craigslist library (json, datetime, os and boto3 are the other libraries required and all are builtin so Lambda already has them). Until recently I had no idea you could do this to pip install to your current directory, but it works quite nicely:", "This will install python-craigslist (and its dependencies) into your folder along with your lambda_function.py", "Thinking back to our Lambda function on AWS, we chose the option to upload a Zip file. Now, my friends, is the time to make the aforementioned Zip file! Select everything in your folder and put it into a zip file, naming it lambda_function.zip. I use 7Zip so I literally just highlight all the files and folders, right click, choose 7Zip and add it to a Zip file. Then I rename it to lambda_function.zip. Your directory should now look something like below, although now all you need is that Zip file.", "First, I can feel you judging me for using Windows and I don\u2019t like it. Anyways, click the Upload button and select your newly created zip file. Once you\u2019ve done, that click the \u201cSave\u201d button in the top right. This will bring your lambda_function.py into the inline editor and your Lambda environment will now have all your needed libraries! Also from this point forward if you need to make changes to the code you can just edit it in line instead of having to repackage your zip file. The only reason you would need to repackage the zip file is if you have a new dependency on another library. If that happens then repeat Steps 6\u20138.", "Going fully into environmental variables is a bit beyond the scope of this already lengthy tutorial, but basically you can do them in Lambda. If you look at our code, we call for an environmental variable \u201cnumber_of_posts\u201d, which is how many posts we will pull. Let\u2019s be nice to Craigslist and not overload their system, so just set it to something low like 5 or 10. This creates the environmental variable that our code will go out and get when it is invoked.", "Step 10: Set your timeout value", "Incoming AWS Developers Associate exam question! By default a Lambda will allow 3 seconds to execute. For this example that simply isn\u2019t enough time. You can change this timeout value under the \u201cBasic Settings\u201d. The max is 15 minutes, but we should be able to get away with 3 minutes. If you were mean and set your function to pull a lot of ads, say 200, you would need more time. Note that Lambda charges you for memory and compute time.", "I\u2019m sure at this point this article is feeling length like a Jane Austen novel, but think back to Step 3 where we created our Lambda function. I let you know that we would need to give Lambda some permissions to put stuff in an S3 bucket. We\u2019ve arrived at that time now. Here\u2019s how we do this (as concisely as possible):", "Finally our Lambda is ready to be tested! So how do we test to see if this article hasn\u2019t been a bunch of baloney and this stuff actually works? Luckily Lambda has a test function built right in! If you look right next to the save button there is a \u201cTest\u201d button. Click that! It will ask you to create a test input, but we are going to skip that for now as it\u2019s not needed when we are just pulling from an API or scraping. Basically if your Lambda is going to respond to a certain type of input you could give it a test input here. We don\u2019t need that, we just need it to run so just give it a name and click \u201cCreate\u201d to test it out.", "Now that you have a Test event click \u201cTest\u201d again and your function should run! If the Gods are good you should see the universal sign for proper execution in the form of a giant green block.", "If we think back to what our function is doing, it is outputting data, in the form of a JSON blob to S3. So in theory we should now have data in our S3 bucket.", "If you go to your S3 bucket you should now have data in there! Huzzah! Let\u2019s move onto our last step: automation!", "The beauty of Lambda is it can be triggered, or invoked, in a variety of ways. You can have Lambda functions happen anytime an object goes to a bucket, when another Lambda executes, or on a time interval. We are going to use the latter here an set it to run based on a time interval. Go to the top of your function and choose \u201cCloudWatch Events\u201d. This is how you can set a standard time interval event to fire our Lambda.", "CloudWatch is many things, but essentially it\u2019s a monitoring tool for getting data about your AWS Environment. If you do want to get any of the AWS certifications you will need to learn about CloudWatch as it comes up in many of the exams.", "Go down to the bottom and keep it as \u201cCreate a new rule\u201d. A rule is basically what governs when this event fires. We will creatively name it \u201cDaily\u201d and in the description, because the creative juices are now really flowing, we will say \u201cRun once a day\u201d. Select \u201cSchedule expression\u201d and put in \u201crate(1 day)\u201d for the value. Note this can either use the rate() function or take a Cron scheduler. Cron is ugly so I am going to go with the rate, but use whatever floats your boat.", "And that\u2019s it! Click \u201cAdd\u201d to apply your new, spiffy rule to your Lambda function and then click \u201cSave\u201d at the top to apply it to your Lambda function. Your Lambda function will now pull data daily and dump it to S3!", "Lambda is wonderful for a developer or data scientist just looking to get data as there\u2019s no EC2, there\u2019s no databases, there\u2019s no hardware or anything else that is a pain. It let\u2019s us just simply write code and let AWS take care of all the annoying stuff. In this tutorial we created a Python function, that we could run locally on our machine, and set it up to run automatically once a day on AWS using Lambda. The first time you go through this it may be slow, but once you get used to Lambda you can start deploying stuff rapidly. AWS and Lambda can be a bit scary when you first get going but stick with it as it has tons of uses for a data scientist, especially for data acquisition with ease.
