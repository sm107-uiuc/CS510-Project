We\u2019ve all seen the many models that simulate \u201cflattening the curve\u201d and projections of COVID-19. Now let\u2019s go over a model that spells the end of COVID-19. In this article, we will walk through the statuses of current interventions, including treatments and vaccines, for COVID-19. We\u2019ll put these together nicely in a comprehensive timeline. Finally, we will briefly explore the similarities of the treatments currently in clinical trials.", "From the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Clinical Trials website, we can see hundreds of in-progress clinical trials related to treating COVID-19. We want to specifically look at interventional clinical trials. Interventional studies include vaccines, medication, and therapies. From these interventional studies, we want to focus on the ones that are most recent and will have a reasonable final completion date, so let\u2019s focus on studies between 2019 and 2025.", "From the NIH clinical trials website, the relevant data we are looking for includes the title of the study, the type of intervention, the components in the intervention, and the estimated completion dates of the interventions. First, let\u2019s look at what type of interventions are currently in trial! This first pie chart shows the different types of COVID-19 interventions, from drugs to biologicals to diagnostics (and more).", "It\u2019s clear that the majority of clinical trials are for drugs and biologicals. Good! This means that there are many clinical trials looking to find a vaccine or treatments.", "The question now becomes what components are used in these interventions. Can we spot a unifying trend and make inferences as to what drugs may be successful in fighting COVID-19?", "To answer this question, every clinical trial must list the components of the intervention described in its protocol. A series of automated requests were used to obtain the relevant component information. These components were then condensed and matched, and below, we use a pie chart to display the components which were included in at least 3 trials.", "It appears that most treatments are currently looking at Hydroxychloroquine and Lopinavir-Ritonavir. Proprietary drugs, such as Remdesivir by Gilead, do not appear many times and thus were not listed in the visualization. It\u2019s important to mention that this visualization includes studies that are merely evaluating the safety of these drugs (not just restricted to Phase 3, 4). Nonetheless, it\u2019s quite interesting to see the different types of treatments in the works.", "Cool! The purported effectiveness of Hydroxychloroquine and other drugs will be rigorously evaluated in many of these clinical trials. Now we\u2019ll ask, how soon will these drugs be available on the market?", "To answer that question, each clinical trial must contain its study start date, primary completion date, and study completion date. Study start date refers to the date the study officially began. Primary completion refers to the date researchers estimate they can make primary outcome conclusions (ie. is this treatment safe and does this treatment work?) and study completion date refers to the date researchers estimate they can make primary, secondary, and adverse conclusions (ie. does this treatment work? does this treatment cause any long-term adverse effects?). There are 4 phases to a clinical trial, and later stages (3, 4) test for clinical effectiveness of the intervention. Below, we will focus primarily on Phase 3 and Phase 4 Clinical Trials.", "The information plotted in this figure is identical to the data plotted in the very first figure at the top. It is specific to clinical trials in Phase 3 and 4, as these would be the most ready for deployment. This general figure (not limited by phase) is also presented in an interactive version in the supplemental section below.", "The salmon-shaded box starting from 02/01/2020 and ending at 04/18/2020 represent the first widespread notice of COVID-19 and the (current) date at which this visualization was made. The 3 bubbles (sometimes 2) represent the study start date, primary completion date (if included), and study completion date. Most studies have begun sometime in this range.", "In this tracker, we can specifically track the Phases of the clinical trials, as well as track their projected end dates. We can look at the distribution of these final study completion dates in the histogram below.", "This histogram displays the estimated final study completion dates of all interventional clinical trials related to COVID-19. It seems that a majority of the trials will end sometime late 2020 and early 2021. It\u2019s likely that we can expect a safe, effective vaccine to be available to the general public sometime in 2021.", "Until we have safe, accessible, and effective vaccines and treatments, we should expect social distancing to remain the norm. This will likely happen sometime in early 2021, based on the completion dates of relevant phase 3 and 4 clinical trials. Especially since we are all attempting to flatten the curve at this time, opening back up the country too soon and before a vaccine is out will have significant ramifications to the public health. Let that sink in: there is no cure or prevention yet for COVID-19. As promising as new interventions in the clinical trials pipeline seem to be, such as Moderna\u2019s novel mRNA approach and Gilead\u2019s Remdesivir to name a few, none of these will conclude their clinical studies until later in the year. Now, more than ever, we need to uphold strong standards of community, take care of those most disproportionally affected by the virus, and remember that this too will pass. It\u2019s in these uncertain times that our bonds as a community are tested, and we will come out on top of this stronger than before.", "Until then, we will continue to keep tabs on the progress of these treatments!", "Code available upon request.
