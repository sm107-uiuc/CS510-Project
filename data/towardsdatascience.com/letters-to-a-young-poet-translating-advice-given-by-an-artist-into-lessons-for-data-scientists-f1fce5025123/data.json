It goes beyond age or culture. It makes us dream about a guide map. And it\u2019s not something new\u2026", "Between 1902 and 1908, Rainer Maria Rilke, a Bohemian-Austrian poet, wrote ten letters to Franz Kappus, a 19-year old officer cadet at Theresian Military Academy. Rainer himself had studied at the same military academy but opted out of the military career. Now, Franz was trying to decide whether or not to go for a literary career and sought advice as to the quality of his poetry.", "In 1929, 3 years after Rainer\u2019s death, Franz decided to publish his letters.", "These letters are packed with wisdom and although poetry and Data Science are not exactly the same, some of the advice given by Rainer to Franz could have been given by Michael I. Jordan (not the NBA Jordan) to Andrew NG or Yoshua Bengio.", "Not everything is as easy to explain as one might think. And some things have no explanation at all. We feel strange feelings. We think strange thoughts. Our lives are so broad that they encompass a multitude of experiences and we simply cannot make sense of it all.", "This is ok, says Rainer, and we must be brave enough to acknowledge and embrace it. Otherwise, we risk not being exposed to the new, the unknown. And this has consequences.", "For instance, our personal relationships may become monotonous. Certain dynamics are set early in the development of a relationship. These won\u2019t change unless we do the following:", "The same is true regarding our journey through data science and machine learning. It is a vast field with an enormous body of knowledge that branches out to many subtopics, each a world on its own. We can\u2019t simply make sense of it all. Moreover, we must actively adapt our approach to new challenges when an old one did not work.", "To admit we don\u2019t understand something is a step forward in our growth. Having unanswered questions in our mind is not something bad but a sign we are actually thinking about it. In fact, some things are not understood by anyone. Similarly, some of our understanding may be wrong. This is to say that you are not alone in not understanding things. We are all humans. Keep a beginner's mindset and keep on questioning what you are taught.", "\u201cThe future depends on some graduate student who is deeply suspicious of everything I have said.\u201d \u2014 Geoffrey Hinton", "The inner self has much knowledge to share. But to learn, we must listen to it. Listen to what comes from within. Our feelings are probably right, says Rainer. If not, the inner self will slowly guide us to new conclusions. There is no need to rush. We must let our opinions and moral values evolve at a natural pace. We must let them mature.", "The inner self does not talk out loud and, for Rainer, there is only one way to be able to listen to it: We must be in solitude. And being in solitude is hard. It is so hard that, in order to avoid it, we are willing to do anything else regardless of how mediocre or meaningless it might be. We have to work against this convenience and comfort.", "Rainer asks us to imagine our existence is space. Most of us only know a corner of this space. This is a safe corner next to a window. To understand ourselves, we must explore this whole space and not fear the traps and chasms that there might because if they exist they are OUR traps and chasms which are for us to find, not others. Only by exploring can we grow and become free to walk around within us.", "In such a fast-moving field, such as ours, it is hard to slow down. In such a connected community it is hard to be alone. There are so many voices shouting out loud what our path should look like and what defines success, that it becomes hard to hear that timid, low voice that comes from within.", "During our journey we must be selective about what information we consume. This selection should contain our own thoughts and feelings.", "Slowing down and introspecting helps to gain a new perspective on things. Our own perspective. And being successful (whatever that means to you) implies searching for our motivations for being in this field. You probably don\u2019t know them yet.", "I am not one of those people.", "So I keep on searching and exploring and believe that this search will get me to a better place as it will help me uncover my internal personal space Rainer talked about. Hope you are uncovering yours.", "These lessons, although simple, are not necessarily easy to implement. They require the ability to focus and the strength to resist external forces.", "There are plenty of take-home lessons from this book and it serves as yet another example of how we can/should look beyond our field in order to find meaningful insights that can help guide us on our journey.", "Your home for data science.
