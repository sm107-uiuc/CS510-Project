Such competition is found in one of the more difficult sectors of Machine Learning, which is time-series forecasting.", "The first library is NeuralProphet that can perform tasks like autoregression, next-step forecasting, multi-step forecasting, specific forecast step, plotting of forecasts, and greater forecast horizon. The next tool is using Google\u2019s AutoML time-series forecasting where you can perform processes like decomposing time-series into the trend and seasonal components, remove outliers from the data, ensemble model creation, and predicting with their AI Platform. I am going to be discussing an overview of these two tools, along with some of their model components, a simple tutorial and example or reference to an example, how they work, outline their pipeline, and describe some of the benefits of using them.", "If you would like to learn about these two time-series forecasting tools, then continue reading below.", "The purpose of this model, NeuralProphet [3], inspired by Facebook and built on PyTorch, is to enable easy-to-use time series forecasting. It includes characteristics or time series components that you would expect from a time series model like trends, seasonality, and auto-regression. Next, there is data preprocessing, like normalization with a z-score, as well as with covariates. When there are missing values in the data, there is also imputation available. Overall, this model is built to make complex time series problems easier to predict. I will be discussing the model components along with a simple tutorial and example below.", "Here are all of the model components:", "As you can see, these are the key components of a time-series model, and this library is no exception.", "Above, we saw how to import the NeuralProphet library, read in your pandas dataframe, establish your model, fit your model, predict using your model, and then plot the forecast. Of course, there are more parameters that you can change in order to customize your model. This approach is quite simple overall and can be expounded and improved upon when referring to the official documentation as well, but it is a good place to start.", "AutoML Time Series Forecasting [5] is a tool that will automate time series forecasting using Google\u2019s AutoML framework. Therefore, this tool is already easier to use as it is automating the process from above. This tool recently featured in the Google AI Blog. There is also documentation on the time-series forecasting with Cloud AI Platform [6] that discusses using AutoML and TensorFlow, including a tutorial with code and plots. There is an overview, introduction to time-series forecasting, setting up your Notebook environment, exploring and visualizing data, customing forecasting model building, as well as training and predicting in the cloud.", "Here are all of the model components:", "These benefits highlight the unique and automated characteristics of this powerful tool.", "Above, was the general method that the process takes from ingesting data to transforming it, as well as tuning it.", "Those were the four main steps of the AutoML pipeline.", "The benefit of using this forecasting tool is that it simplifies that process of not only automating Machine Learning algorithms, but ones of time-series, which are usually much more difficult to automate. Google has also provided some impressive statistics on how it has performed better than 92% of hand-made models from Kaggle.", "I hope you enjoyed reading this shorter synopsis of NeuralProphet and AutoML time-series forecasting tools. They both have great benefits and aim to streamline this complicated process.", "Please feel free to comment down below on your thoughts of either of these time-series forecasting tools. Will you use the newer Google AutoML\u2019s time-series tool, or is simply utilizing the Python library of NeurlProphet much easier and cheaper?", "Thank you for reading!
