Instead of dealing with datasets they deal with images. In the same way that Neural Networks try to process data like the human brain, Computer Vision attempts to see, identify, and process images in the way that human vision does.", "In this article we\u2019re going to detect one of the most used cases of Computer Vision, detecting license plates. They are distinct and easily recognizable, which makes them easy for the computer to pick up and spot. But first we have to let the computer know what makes a license plate a license plate.", "How we tell the computer what a license plate looks like is that we feed it a few hundred samples of a license plate, and samples that aren\u2019t images of license plates. A classifier is then trained on these examples and will output a 1 if the input image contains a license plate, a 0 if not.", "Cascade Classification is used as the classifier because it consists of several simpler classifiers (stages) that are applied subsequently to a region of interest until at some stage the candidate is rejected or all the stages are passed. These simple classifiers detect the edges of the license plates, the lines in the plates and the surrounding features. If one or more of these classifiers cannot be detected in the input image it will reject the image and declare there is no license plate. But if all these features can be found it will classify the image as having a license plate in it.", "To give you an idea of what Cascade Classification is doing, I\u2019m going to show you an example of feature matching. Exactly how it sounds feature matching finds the corresponding features from two images.", "Down below is a picture of a license plate and the back of the car. What feature matching is going to do is find the features of the license plate that correspond to features in the image of the back of the car.", "The image above is the output from feature matching the two images. The lines show where/what features were common in both images. As we can see nearly all the lines go to the license plate on the back of the car. This is essentially how Cascade Classifier works and how it can detect license plates in images.", "After we apply Cascade Classification on the image, if a license plate is detected it will return the x, y location of where it was found in the image and the width and height of the plate. Now that we have the points in the image that show where the license plate is we can draw on the image, a rectangle around it. Using OpenCV, (a Computer Vision library) it has a function where we can draw rectangles on a given image, all it needs is the points of where it should be drawn.", "So from the x, y, width, and height outputted from Cascade Classifier we can change this image\u2026", "But with those points we can do even more applications. What we can do is actually blur the license plate. This is often used in the real world because TV networks that show cars can\u2019t legally show someone\u2019s license plate without their approval. So what happens is that they blur the license plate so nobody can read it. Similarly to drawing a rectangle, OpenCv has a function where given a set of points it will blur the image in that location.", "So our original image gets blurred and now looks like this\u2026", "To understand how we can do this, we have to understand what really constitutes a video. A video is essentially just frames put in succession to perceive that something is moving. You can think of it like a flipbook, when the book is flipped the drawings appear to move even though it\u2019s just the images being changed a little bit at a time. These frames that make up the video are just images that ae slightly being changed. Therefore like we did with the images above, all were going to do is apply the same classifiers on every frame in the given video. If that frame has a license plate a red rectangle will be placed around it.", "The video that is gonna be used is cars driving on the highway in traffic. To show some more applications of Computer Vision, not only are we gonna detect the license plates of the cars in the video below, but we will zoom in on the plates and display them above where each license plate was detected.", "Note: Do not expect the classifier to pick up every license plate in the video. You will see that when a car is too far away it will not pick up that license plate because the features of the plate start to become less clear and fails the classifier.", "Computer Vision is unlike any other. It is a nonstop growing field with data scientists and engineers finding new ways to create impactful visualizations. The example above was meant to give an introduction to those who had no idea what computer vision was and expose them to ideas of where it can go. Hopefully this inspires you to learn more about this fascinating field, like it inspired me to do this project.", "If you\u2019re interested the code for this project can be found on my GitHub: https://github.com/zita9999/License-Plates-and-Computer-Vision/tree/master", "[3]4k Urban Life, 4K Car Driving Relax Video, https://beautifulwashington.com/", "Your home for data science.
