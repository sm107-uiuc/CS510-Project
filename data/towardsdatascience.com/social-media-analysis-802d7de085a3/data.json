It is a place where people shares their opinion about matters or events that are unfolding. The essence of this article is to guide on how to extract data from Twitter and perform basic analysis on it to answer questions like what is the most used hashtags among celebrities? Who is the most referenced Twitter user? etc. I will explain how I got the data and communicate my findings to you. stay tuned\u2026", "This article is structured into 5 sections which are", "In this article, I seek to enlighten and bring to your notice how Twitter can be used and is being used to promote campaigns of product and event. Particularly, I focused on prominent Twitter users in Africa both the political leaders and celebrities. The data used comprised of influential tweets that was scraped from twitter. These users were selected based on some metrics which includes: -", "1. The Popularity Score = No. of Retweets + No. of Likes (per Tweets)", "2. The Reach Score = No. of Followers \u2014 No. of People they Follow", "3. The Relevance Score = No. Status shared + Popularity Score + Reach Score", "With the data, questions like most popular celebrity in Africa based on tweets shared, most popular topics being discussed and who is talking about it etc. were answered with figures and statistics. It was concluded that Twitter as a social media could be used to promote campaigns and products.", "Tweets were scraped from Twitter using the Application Programming Interface (API) provided by Twitter and a Tweepy library to extract tweets shared by an influencer. The tweets extracted formed the base of the data. Each tweet had many elements associated with it like the number of likes, number of retweets, tweets identity, number of replies etc. This information allowed me to be able to perform analysis to answer some prevalent questions like which influencer had the most tweets shared and what was the number of likes and retweets on such tweet. The data also has a Geo-location which enable me to group tweets based on separate regions of Africa as a continent and I was able to determine which topic the influencer in such places was talking about. The data comprises of 7099 tweets for both the celebrity influencers and leaders with the leaders having 1729 tweets and celebrity influencers having 5370 tweets. Each tweet is accompanied with a lot of information, after processing and cleaning the tweets, 23 different information that explains what the text of the tweet is, from which location, etc were used for the analysis.", "Regex Expression was used to extract twitter handles from webpage after the webpage had been scraped and formatted with python Web scraping library Beautiful Soup.", "Tweets of influencers were analyzed, scored and weighted to answer the business question \u201cif twitter could be used to promote a campaign\u201d. There were 829 hashtags that was used by influencers and the most occurring hashtags was COVID 19. Most tweets were sent from South Africa with almost 75% of the tweets originating from South Africa, Johannesburg. The total No of Leaders was 34 and celebrity influencers was 91 making a total of 125.", "News24 a news reporting twitter page has the most number of tweets shared but when compared with other influencers with lesser amount of tweets, it had a significant small number of popularity and reach score.", "On Average, if a tweet contains the hashtags COVID19 and was tweeted by GautengProvince it will have 106 retweets and 191 likes. This shows how people respond to GautengProvince when it tweeted about COVID19 and it also shows how popular the topic COVID19 is. Also if a tweet uses the hashtag Nigeria and was tweeted by MadeInAfrica, it will have a retweet count of 4 and 11 likes. This means that the #Nigeria is not a common word given the numbers of followers of MadeInAfrica and past tweets that does not contain such hashtag. Most African do not use Hashtags in their tweets e. g MBuhari Nigeria President has only used one hashtags in his past 300 tweets and that was on Democracy Day 12th June, 2020. World Health Organization (WHO) has the highest number of reach score but it not the most popular has MagufuliP tops that chart.", "From the analysis and result section, it\u2019s evident that twitter has a lot of influence on promoting business campaigns when the right people are used with the right words. Information spread very fast and wide across the world because of tools like social media and using the right hashtags from a popular influencer will trend such message rapidly. The right Hashtags will make an influencer trend in a matter of seconds and Influencers like entertainers e. g Trevor Noah has a very high popularity and reach score despite the fact that he has significantly low number of shared tweets when compared with the likes of News24 or WHO and Trevor Noah does not use hashtags. Using Hashtags in tweets does not suggest that a tweet will trend and it does not increase the popularity score of an influencer. For a more in-depth and detailed analysis, more data is required. Data like reply counts, information about people who comment on tweets and what their comment was, will enable our understanding in details how people react to a tweet from an influencer. Also, an important factor to be considered for a more in-depth analysis would be hashtags based on what an influencer is feeling or what\u2019s trending in a particular place.", "A complete notebook regarding the analysis and more can be found in this GitHub repository.", "Your home for data science.
