It is also plausible that you have heard of the Monty Hall Problem. If you have not heard of the Monty Hall Problem, then it is a famous mathematical problem that came about from the game show, Let\u2019s Make A Deal when it was hosted by Monty Hall. Contestants on this show will be told to pick between 3 doors, where 2 of the doors will have an unfavourable outcome. After the selection is made, Monty will reveal what was behind one of the 2 unfavourable doors and then ask whether the contestant would like to stick with their initial selection or switch to the remaining closed door. Because one of the doors is now open, the contestant knows that the prize must be behind one of the two closed doors. Thus, there is a 50/50 chance that they will get the prize by sticking with their initial choice and it will not matter if they switch or not, right? Wrong. The mathematics shows that if the contestant were to switch their choice, the probability of winning would increase to 2/3; and therefore, you should always switch if given the option. Okay, but why is this true? And how does it relate to the Na\u00efve Bayes? Well, both the Monty Hall Problem and the Na\u00efve Bayes classifier are rooted in Bayes Theorem and they highly depend on the likelihood of an event occurring. So, the deal is that we will explore both topics throughout this article!", "Suppose that instead of opening doors, we are blindly choosing marbles from a bag. Assume that the bag has 1 red, 1 green and 1 blue, where the blue marble is the favourable outcome. Each marble has an equally likely chance of being selected and the contestant picks one at random but cannot know the colour that they chose. The host then investigates the bag and shows an unfavourable outcome. There are now three possible scenarios:", "The outcomes when the contestant chooses to switch are as follows:", "This shows that the probability of winning when switching is 2/3 while losing is 1/3.", "The outcomes when the contestant chooses not to switch are as follows:", "This shows that the probability of winning when not switching is 1/3 while losing is 2/3.", "The solution to the Monty Hall Problem works because initially, there are more ways of selecting an unfavourable outcome than there are of favourable ones. This is the essence of Bayes Theorem; new information should not determine beliefs in isolation. Rather, new information should be used to update prior information. Bayes Theorem is applicable whenever there exists a hypothesis, evidence relating to the hypothesis, and the question being asked is \u201cwhat is the probability of this hypothesis, given that the evidence is true\u201d. Let us look at the formula. The goal is to find this updated information, or the posterior, which is written as Pr(Hypothesis | Evidence).", "\u00b7 We need to determine the probability of the hypothesis before any evidence is considered. This is the prior information as is written as Pr(Hypothesis). In the case of the Monty Hall Problem, the prior is the fact that each marble has a 1/3 chance of initially being selected.", "\u00b7 After this, we need to consider the probability that the evidence can be seen, given that the hypothesis is true; Pr(Evidence | Hypothesis). This is often referred to as the likelihood and it intuitively represents the number of ways that an event can occur, given that a prior event is true. In the case of Monty Hall, how many ways can the host show an unfavourable outcome, given the contestant\u2019s initial selection.", "\u00b7 These numbers are multiplied because they represent the prior belief of the hypothesis and the probability that the belief fits the evidence. Together, they provide the information necessary to determine the answer to our question.", "\u00b7 Now, it must be noted that the evidence can occur without the hypothesis being true; Pr(Evidence | ~Hypothesis). When added to Pr(Evidence | Hypothesis), we achieve the total probability of the evidence being true; Pr(Evidence).", "\u00b7 Lastly, we must divide the information we have by the total chance of the evidence to determine the probability of the hypothesis, given that the evidence is true.", "The mechanism behind a Na\u00efve Bayes classifier is based on this principle. Na\u00efve Bayes is a probabilistic classifier algorithm that assigns labels to instances based on probabilities. The term na\u00efve comes from the fact that this algorithm assumes strong independence between features. A common application of Na\u00efve Bayes is email classification, spam vs not spam. Let\u2019s work through an example:", "\u00b7 Suppose that there is an email message \u201cyou need money money money now\u201d, would it be classified as spam or not spam?", "\u00b7 It must be noted that Na\u00efve Bayes does not calculate the actual probability. Instead, the formula gives the email a score by determining the total information (and not dividing by the total evidence) and then classifying the email into the class that had a higher score. The actual probability was calculated for example purposes, but the same principles apply.", "Therefore, since the posterior probability of the email being spam is higher than that of it being non-spam, the email would be classified as spam. Notice, however, that if at least one of the probabilities for the words in a spam email were 0, the email would have been classified as non-spam instead. This fact can easily produce incorrect classifications when building models. Because of this, a pseudo-count (or 1 count) is usually added to each word within a set to ensure that 0 is never an output. The pseudo-count will not change the prior, it primarily ensures that the posterior is nonzero.", "So, now you are familiar with Bayes Theorem, you understand simple email classification, and you know how to win on average at Let\u2019s Make A Deal! But the main takeaway from this article is understanding that information can be used to update prior beliefs to then make data-driven decisions. Bayes Theorem is applicable in machine learning and can be used for various processes, and the key to developing an appropriate model of this type is to understand the theory from which it is derived.", "Your home for data science.
