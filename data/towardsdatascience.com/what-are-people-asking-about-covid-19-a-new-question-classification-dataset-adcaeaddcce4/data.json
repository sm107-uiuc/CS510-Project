One of the biggest challenges during large pandemics such as the current COVID-19 pandemic is being able to keep people up-to-date with the latest and most relevant information. Even though reputable sources like the CDC and FDA maintain FAQ websites for COVID-19, users might still struggle to find their questions, and many common questions will remain unanswered.", "I\u2019ve worked with other researchers to compile COVID-Q [Dataset Link], a dataset of COVID-19 questions, in the hopes that this dataset will be useful to other researchers. Our full paper can be found here.", "The Dataset \u2014 General Overview. COVID-Q is a dataset of 1,690 questions about COVID-19 from thirteen online sources. The dataset is annotated by classifying questions into 15 question categories and by grouping questions that ask the same thing into 207 question classes.", "COVID-Q can be used for several question understanding tasks:", "Data Collection and Processing. To collect the data, thirteen sources were scraped to gather questions about COVID-19; seven of these sources were official FAQ websites from reputable organizations like the CDC and FDA and six sources were crowd-based (e.g. Quora, Yahoo Answers).", "Data Annotation. The dataset is annotated in two ways. First, questions that ask the same thing were manually grouped into question classes. Two questions were defined as asking the same thing if they could be answered with the same answer. Next, each question class with at least two questions was given a name that summarized what the question class was asking about. These were then used to place each question class into one of the 15 question categories shown in the figure above. You can also see the distribution of question classes in the figure below.", "Annotation Quality. Now, you might be wondering: If these questions were manually labeled, how can we trust that you didn\u2019t go crazy on the annotations? Well, that\u2019s a fair point. To validate the quality of annotations, the labels were run through two collaborators in two rounds of validation. In these validations, each collaborator independently examined the category and class label given to each question to verify that the labels were correct. In the first round of validation, 67 labels were changed. In the second round of validation, 15 more labels were modified.", "We also validated the annotations by showing 3 random questions from each question class with at least four questions to three Mechanical Turk workers. Given a question, we asked each worker to select the question class that best described the question out of five choices, one of which was our original annotation. For these sampled questions, 93.3% of our labels agreed with the majority vote of the workers.", "Mismatch of FAQs. Something interesting that we found was that the FAQ websites of governmental organizations like the CDC and FDA consisted of a large proportion of questions that did not match questions from any other source. For instance, 44.6% of the CDC\u2019s FAQs were unmatched and 42.1% of the FDA\u2019s FAQs were unmatched. Also, 54.2% of question classes with questions from at least two non-official sources remained unanswered by an official source. These data seem to suggest that there is a mismatch between what organization think people are asking about COVID-19 and what people are actually asking about COVID-19.", "Author-Generated Questions. Since the dataset is small when split into training and testing sets, 249 questions were manually generated. These questions were annotated and validated in the same ways as the other questions.", "Question Classification Tasks. As stated earlier, COVID-Q can be used for question-category classification (what type of information is this question asking about?) and question-class classification (what other question is asking the same thing as this question?).", "Question-Category Classification. The question-category classification task assigns each question to a broad category. For our baseline, we chose 20 random questions per category for the training set and placed the remaining questions into the test set. This dataset split can be seen in the table below.", "We use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) and cosine-similarity based k-Neared Neighbor classification (k-NN) with k = 1 as baseline models for our dataset. These models were evaluated on the questions by obtaining BERT\u2019s average-pooled tokens for each question. We also tested some simple data augmentation techniques. These results can be seen in the table below.", "Question-Class Classification. The question-class classification task requires a test question to be grouped into a question class that asks the same thing. For our baseline, we only consider question classes with at least four questions. We split three questions from each question class into the training set and the remaining questions into the testing set. This dataset split can be seen in the table below.", "For baseline models, we use the k-NN baseline from question-category classification and also use a simple model that uses a triplet loss function to train a two layer neural network. These models were also evaluated on the questions by obtaining BERT\u2019s average-pooled tokens for each question. Similarly, we also run data augmentation for this task. These results can be seen in the table below.", "Conclusion. COVID-Q is a new dataset of 1,690 COVID-19 questions from thirteen sources annotated with 15 category labels and 207 class labels. COVID-Q can directly help train question-answer systems or serve as an evaluation resource. Simple BERT baselines have been included for COVID-Q. Future work includes collecting more questions (perhaps in collaboration with search engine companies) or in evaluating more complex models.", "The full dataset can be found here.", "The full paper can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
