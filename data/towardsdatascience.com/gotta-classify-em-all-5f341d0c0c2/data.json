I would watch the show every afternoon after school, wake up early Saturday mornings to watch more, collect the cards, and of course, play the games on my Game Boy. Often, my friends and I would hang out and play the games on our separate devices, assisting each other in navigating the vast regions and catching the unique Pok\u00e9mon introduced each game. For one of the games, Pok\u00e9mon Sapphire (my personal favorite), I even bought the guide book to help me as I made my way through city by city, gym by gym, telling me secrets about the game along the way. Needless to say, Pok\u00e9mon was a huge part of my life when I was younger. However, unfortunately, as I grew older, Pok\u00e9mon became nearly non-existent in my life other than a few flashes of my favorite pastime every here and there.", "This past winter, I completed a Data Science bootcamp. During this bootcamp, we would be assigned projects in which we would have to find our own data to use for analyses and the reinforcement of various data science concepts. Having done some projects on sports and knowing that I was saving music data for my final project, I pondered what I wanted to do for my classification project. After spending some time thinking of ideas and trying to think outside of the box, my past love for Pok\u00e9mon came to mind as something that a classification model could probably be built on. While I originally was interested in trying to classify Pok\u00e9mon by their types, it became apparent that because of the vast number of types and the unbalanced ratio of Pok\u00e9mon for each type, I decided that classifying them as legendary vs. non-legendary was the route I was going to take.", "This is how I did it:", "For this project, I ended up getting my Pok\u00e9mon data from three different sources to fill my needs for the classification. I used BeautifulSoup and the Pandas read_html function to scrape the data from the below sites.", "Features: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed, Height, and Weight", "1. Correlation heatmap of Pok\u00e9mon features:", "2. Overlapping histograms showing the distributions of all features for non-legendary vs. legendary Pok\u00e9mon:", "As we can see, Special Attack, Special Defense, Height, and Weight were the four features with the highest correlation to the Legendary attribute, and also had the largest separations of their distributions between non-legendary and legendary Pok\u00e9mon.", "1. Set x and y variables for train-test split, where Legendary series was the y variable and a dataframe of the rest of the features was the x variable", "2. Used SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to synthesize fake data due to class imbalance in legendary vs. non-legendary Pok\u00e9mon, since only about 10% of Pok\u00e9mon in the data were legendary", "3. Tried different models to see which had the best results:", "4. Ran GridSearchCV on the best model, which in this case was SVM (Support Vector Machine), in order to find the optimal parameters for the model", "Optimal parameters were: C = 1000 and kernel = rbf (radial)", "*Final model overall displayed 97% accuracy*", "Although recall fell in the final model, I was okay with this because:", "Ultimately, I ended up with a very accurate legendary vs. non-legendary Pok\u00e9mon classification model. After digging into which Pok\u00e9mon were misclassified, it was clear that this was more of a result of those Pok\u00e9mon resembling those of the opposite class (legendary instead of non-legendary or vice versa), and not the model\u2019s fault, per se.", "Doing this project was very nostalgic and made me miss my days of being a Pok\u00e9mon trainer trying to \u201ccatch \u2019em all.\u201d Because of the current state of the world and the quarantine that we are in, I wound up purchasing a Nintendo Switch Lite and the latest Pok\u00e9mon game, Pok\u00e9mon Sword, and revisited the good ol\u2019 days to help pass the time. Even after all of these years, I haven\u2019t lost a step, if I do say so myself.", "Your home for data science.
