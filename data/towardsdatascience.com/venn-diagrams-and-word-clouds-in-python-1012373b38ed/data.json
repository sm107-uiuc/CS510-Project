Are cat names and dog names different, in the same way that cats and dogs are different (on average\u2026 we all have that friend with the cat that runs up to greet you when you come to the door, comes when called, and plays fetch. Or that dog that hides in the rafters when it\u2019s family has a party\u2026)? And pet breeds \u2014 Is every dog in Seattle a poodle mix? How common are these fancy cats that frequent my backyard (yet to be noticed by my pup, Beckham, who has never lived in a ground-floor place before)?", "And are there other disgruntled New York Giants\u2019 fans who named their dog after Odell Beckham Jr. only to be seriously disappointed when he moved to the Cleveland Browns, one of the statistically worst teams in NFL history, where he promptly embarked on his worst year yet? I myself am a proud Seattleite and Seahawks fan, but I married a New Jerseyan Giants fan (who is generously editing this article and using his editorial control to express his disappointment in the Giants\u2019 organization \u2014 a lackluster 3\u201311 so far \u2014 and Odell Beckham Jr.).", "Anyways\u2026along the way, I realized a perfect opportunity for Venn Diagrams, and even a Venn Diagram Word Cloud to help answer these questions.", "I started with a horizontal bar chart to look at the 50 most frequent cat and dog names in Seattle.", "Note some matplotlib tools used here:", "One thing I noticed right away was the heavy overlap between names on the top-50 dog list and the top-50 cat list: what I call: \u201cSpecies Neutral Names\u201d. To visualize this, I made a Venn Diagram.", "Note: you\u2019ll need to pip install or easy-install matplotlib-venn and make sure you have the dependencies: numpy, scipy, and matplotlib, according to the PyPI docs.", "Notice the difference between the cat-only top names (Shadow, Loki, Smokey) and the dog-only top names (Cooper, Sadie, Bailey). Are dogs more likely to be given \u2018human\u2019 names? A question for another day\u2026", "For an example of adjusting the color, I decided to look at how overlapping cat and dog names are in general.", "Note that the label inside and size of the circles are based on the number of cat/dog names not the population sizes, though the registered dog population is larger than the registered cat population in Seattle.", "In my search for a way to display the names inside the Venn Diagram, I came across this lovely package by Paul Broaderson that creates a word cloud inside your Venn Diagram. All you need to do is install matplotlib-venn-wordcloud and you\u2019re off to the races using the same syntax as above. The default color scheme is black and white, but you can add background colors following the same strategy used in matplotlib-venn. Note that the size of the word does not automatically reflect the frequency of the word. See the docs to add that feature.", "Moving on to take a look at breeds, cats seem to have come out on top in the completely unscientific awards for the best breed name (Ragamuffin) and cutest breed name (Munchkin). Meanwhile, the dogs are turning out, surprisingly, to not all be doodles (poodle mixes). Despite what it seems while walking down the street, they actually only make up about 9%.", "Taking a closer look at the most common doodles: labradoodles and goldendoodles, we see that of the 34,882 registered dogs, approximately 10,000 or 28% of registered dogs in Seattle have one of these (labrador or golden retriever) as their primary or secondary breed. Approximately a quarter of dogs identified as having golden retriever heritage are golden doodles, while closer to 15% of those with labrador heritage are labradoodles. And then there are 135 Goldadors. We have zero Double Doodles (labradoodle goldendoodle mix) indicated in our data set, though this is likely limited by the pet registration data collection process, which only allows owners to identify primary and secondary breeds. This points out the inexact areas involved in our Venn Diagram, but overall, it\u2019s a pretty awesome tool.", "Lastly, I wondered, of the poodles in Seattle, how many of them are doodles?", "The answer is: a lot. And matplotlib-venn handles this kind of situation like a champ, only requiring the rightmost patch\u2019s label to be set to \u201c\u201d for aesthetics.", "As always, check out the GitHub repo for more details.", "Parting note: As a person with a dog named O\u2019dell Beckham Jr. Honold (registered as \u2018Beckham\u2019), I am shocked and appalled that there is only one pet registered in Seattle with the name \u2018Ichiro\u2019. But heartened to find that there are 39 Wilsons 39 Griffeys 29 Edgars 22 Shermans, 21 Russells, as well as 6 each: Marshawn, Payton, Dempsey. 22% of these are cats, 78% are dogs, as compared to 32% cats, 67% dogs overall. Is this saying something about the nature of cats and dogs, about cat and dog owners, or both?", "And for Kevin, it turns out there are two other Beckhams, one a Golden Retriever and the other a Short Coat Chihuahua.", "Your home for data science.
