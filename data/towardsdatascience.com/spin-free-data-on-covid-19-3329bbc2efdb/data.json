But what\u2019s presented is often spin first, data second. This is not useful any time, and it\u2019s especially frustrating during a pandemic, when the stakes are so high.", "For the data most relevant to you, do you know how well your state is doing in the fight against Covid-19? States vary significantly both in the data they are providing to their residents and in how clearly they are presenting that data.", "I believe that you have a right to know \u2014 in terms you can understand \u2014 how well your state is doing in the fight against Covid-19. You have a right to know how your country is doing, too.", "Since February I have been participating in a data science discussion group that has examined every practical aspect of Covid-19 data. The group\u2019s mission is to deeply understand the data we\u2019re seeing. We have carefully avoided political discussions because we seek first to understand the data without spin. Each member is free to draw their own political conclusions \u2014 but not inside of our discussion group.", "To make data available to anyone who wants it (and with much support from our group discussions), I have created Covid-19 Open-Readiness Assessments for each state. Here\u2019s an example for my state.", "These Open-Readiness Assessments are available for 50 states and the District of Columbia, and they\u2019re updated 2\u20133 times per week. You can see them at my Covid-19 Information Center.", "Our group has come to a few conclusions about Covid-19 data.", "Graphs that show cumulative totals of positive tests and deaths, like this one, are not worth much, except for shock value.", "Graphs such as this one just say the number of positive tests or deaths has increased over time. It doesn\u2019t describe whether the situation is getting better or worse. It makes it difficult to see whether the curve\u2019s trajectory is changing. When I study a graph I think, \u201cWhat questions does this graph suggest to me?\u201d For this type of graph, the answer is, \u201cNone.\u201d", "Johns Hopkins has provided an invaluable service by making Covid-19 data readily available. But images like the pervasive JHU Covid-19 dashboard, which shows a heat map of total positive tests or deaths, are not very informative.", "If the whole map wasn\u2019t red, it might suggest questions like, \u201cWhy is this area more affected than that area?\u201d But since every populated area is completely saturated, this is another graph that doesn\u2019t prompt any questions.", "Cumulative graphs and maps like these amount to having a car with an odometer, but no speedometer. We don\u2019t need the odometer very often, but we need the speedometer constantly. These graphs and maps provide history about what happened in the past but shed little light on what\u2019s happening now.", "Graphs that show incremental data and trends are more meaningful, i.e., graphs that show daily or weekly tests or deaths. The graph in Figure 4 shows tests and deaths daily, smoothed to make up for day-to-day variations in reporting. The graph makes it clear that, as of June 16, positive tests are slightly increasing, but deaths are still decreasing. It prompts the question of, \u201cWhy are deaths decreasing when positive tests are increasing?\u201d It tells the story of the pandemic in a way that heat maps and cumulative graphs do not.", "Similarly, consider the story of the pandemic as told by Figure 5. This graph tracks a running-7-day-total of positive tests compared to the previous 7-day period.", "This graph shows that the virus hit a clear inflection point in early April, declined rapidly through mid-April, and has progressed through a series of ups and downs since then. That story cannot readily be discerned from the incremental graph in Figure 4, and it would be impossible to discern from the images in Figures 2 or 3.", "The bottom line is that incremental data and trend data provide more information than cumulative data.", "Our data science group has also learned that per-capita numbers are often more useful than totals. The common focus on total numbers means that stories about the most populous states such as New York and Texas dominate the news cycles. But when you examine per-capita numbers, you see different pictures of how well each state is doing.", "Consider the graph in Figure 6, which shows trends in positive tests, state by state.", "The markers with the state abbreviations show the number of positive tests per 1,000 residents in each state over the past 7 days. The solid lines show where the state was 7 days prior to that, and the transparent lines show the 7 days prior to that.", "In contrast to the JHU heat map, this graph allows for easy comparison of how states compare to one another now, and how they have trended over time. This graph prompts numerous questions: \u201cWhich states are getting worse, and which are getting better? Which states are seeing the most dramatic changes? Is there any pattern to which are getting worse and which are getting better?\u201d", "Currently, news stories are emphasizing Texas setting a record for daily Covid-19 cases. But the graph above makes it clear that the states that should be most concerned are Arizona, Arkansas, and Alabama, followed by Louisiana and South Carolina. Total numbers don\u2019t communicate that message; per-capita numbers do.", "Animations can highlight changes over time in ways that static images cannot. This animated version of the chart above provides additional insight into the spread of the disease.", "You can see the disease start slowly in Washington and Michigan. And then see it take off strongly in New York and its surrounding northeastern states. You can see that, through April, virus activity clustered in the northeast, but by mid-May and into June the virus had declined significantly in all parts of the country. Then, in early June, while the northeastern states that had suffered earlier kept the virus under control, several southern states saw surges. As of this moment, the most affected states are in the south.", "When data is presented well, it can be incredibly informative.", "My personal background is that I have been focused for 20 years on understanding the data analytics of software development, including quality, productivity, and estimation. The techniques I\u2019ve learned from working with noisy data, bad data, uncertainty, and forecasting all apply to COVID-19.", "The data used to create the graphs in this article is all readily available from the Covid Tracking Project and JHU. While the data is easily accessed, it is not very comprehensible in its native form. That is why I have created these data presentations.", "My politics related to Covid-19 are simple: I want to know the facts so that I can make up my own mind. This has been difficult to accomplish in Washington state. My dissatisfaction at my state\u2019s data transparency (or lack thereof) motivated me to make better data available to my fellow Washingtonians and, while I was doing that, it was easy to do it for the other states too.", "Please check out the content at my Covid-19 Information Center, and contact me at stevemcc@construx.com any time.", "Your home for data science.
