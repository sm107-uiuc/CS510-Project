This is not a part of any official research and results are not suitable for decision making of any sort.", "There has been a considerable public panic due to the famous Coronavirus (nCov-19). Therefore, in this article let\u2019s have a look at the level of public panic and positiveness (of some people) using tweets people have posted.", "For this experiment, we will be using tweets posted under hashtags #coronavirus, #COVID19 and #CoronavirusOutbreak. 1000 tweets were pulled dating backwards from the 1st of March. These will be saved as a json string into a file named data.json for easy parsing.", "Furthermore, we will be using data from http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~mdredze/datasets/sentiment/ for training purposes. I have used a dataset having item reviews rated from 1\u20135 stars. I downloaded processed_stars.tar.gz file, extracted and gathered all all_balanced.review files in subfolders to a separate path data/processed_stars_all.", "With a little bit of coding, we can easily pull data from twitter. In this article, I have downloaded 1000 tweets. The code would look like this;", "Since we are downloading data from a public source, we must use some preprocessing in order to retain useful wordings for downstream analysis. There are few common techniques of preprocessing natural language content.", "Here we break text into sentences i.e. sentence tokenisation and break sentences again into works i.e. word tokenisation. In this article we will perform word tokenisation at once since tweets are mostly shorter than typical social media content.", "The English language consists of several stop words that add meaning in sentences but not in context. For example words such as is are was has , etc. do not add value for our use case.", "This is the process where we get rid of forms of words thus retaining a single representation. For example; play, playing, playable, etc. can be reduced to \u201cplay\u201d and retain the core meaning.", "There are two forms of this normalisation.", "One of the starting points for machine learning classification is the Naive Bayesian Classifier. In this article, we will be using a Multinomial Naive Bayesian Classifier (MNB). The term Multinomial is important since our training dataset consists of review stars (1\u20135 stars) thus having 5 possible labels.", "Our inputs are in the form of lines in a file in the compressed form feature:<count> \u2026. feature:<count> #label#:<label>. In the first step, I will create sentences and transfer them in the TF-IDF format. This format typically compensates for frequent words that appear across multiple documents. These words are usually less informative due to high abundance. I store this data in a pandas dataframe for querying simplicity.", "Following is the complete code of our analysis. I will explain the process below the code so you can follow quite easily.", "Training can be performed by fitting our data into the model. In our case text_tf = tf.fit_transform(data[\u2018sentence\u2019]) line does it. We perform predictions by transforming our twitter data into TF-IDF form in text_tf_tw = tf.transform(sentences_processed_tw) . Note that we use preprocessed tweet texts here. This transformation will use the word corpus that we used in training. So the new words or tweeters\u2019 slang will not have any impact on our analysis. We do the prediction in line predicted_tw = clf.predict(text_tf_tw).", "This model was only ~70% accurate which is not very good, but a fine model for learning and discovering. A larger data set with more social media terminology would indeed give better training and accuracy.", "As you may have noted in my code, we simply plot a histogram and use the Kernel Density Estimate (KDE) plot to see the nature of the distribution. It looked like below.", "In this plot, 1\u20135 on the x-axis correspond to stars or the positive nature. Thus 1 refers to negative sentiment and 5 refers to positive sentiment. We can clearly see that people have ideas either negative or positive which clearly represents the polarised nature of society (Or maybe not).", "Though I haven\u2019t used any other information apart from the text, we can incorporate time-series data and location information in order to say who\u2019s having bad thoughts and how the panic might be progressing across countries. A serious exploration in this sector would lead to interesting business opportunities such as selling masks (which I am pretty sure enterprises are doing).", "I believe you had a good read and saw the potential power of big data!", "Thanks for reading. Leave your thoughts if you found this intriguing.", "Your home for data science.
