In statistics, this is often referred to as Bessel\u2019s correction. Another feasible estimator is obtained by dividing the sum of squares by sample size, and it is the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the population variance:", "By applying the Bias-variance decomposition and Cochran\u2019s theorem, this article attempts to address these questions. It concludes that:", "We will also go over an experiment implemented in Python to verify our conclusions numerically. Stay tuned!", "Suppose we have a sample x\u2081, x\u2082, \u2026, xi, where all xi are independent and identically distributed (iid) according to N(\u03bc, \u03c3\u00b2).

Assuming we are estimating population parameter \u03b8 and our estimator is a function of data, then we can define:", "Intuitively, bias measures how our estimates diverge from the underlying parameter. Since our estimates change with data, variance measures the expectation of them diverging from their averages across different data sets. MSE is a comprehensive measure and can be decomposed into (Bias\u00b2 + Variance) as follows.", "In the following sections, we will apply Cochran\u2019s theorem to derive the bias and variance of our two estimators and make a comparison.", "Cochran\u2019s theorem is often used to justify the probability distributions of statistics used in the analysis of variance (ANOVA).

We can then write out its variance and MSE:", "In the same manner, we can derive the bias, variance, and MSE for the MLE estimator of population variance.", "From this, we know why we typically divide the sum of squares by (n - 1) to calculate sample variance.
