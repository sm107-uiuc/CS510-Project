Wouldn\u2019t it be great if all we need to do to find the sentiment of the text, tokenize text, find word and noun phrase frequencies, or correct spelling in one single line of code? That is when TextBlob comes in handy.", "TextBlob aims to provide access to common text-processing operations through a familiar interface. You can treat TextBlob objects as if they were Python strings that learned how to do Natural Language Processing.", "NLTK provides some methods to complete those tasks but you might need to call several classes in order to complete different tasks. But with TextBlob, all you need is to use TextBlob(text) in order to access different methods of TextBlob!", "Now all we need to do to supercharge our string is to wrap the text with TextBlob object.", "Let\u2019s find out what we can do with our supercharged string.", "We will borrow some sentences in my article on how to learn data science when life does not give you a break to learn how to use TextBlob.", "Word tokenization splits a piece of text into individual words based on certain delimiters.", "Instead of splitting our string based on different delimiters such as a \u201c,\u201d or a \u201c.\u201d or space, all we need to tokenize our sentences are blob.words !", "WordList can be used as a Python list. To access the first word, use", "A noun phrase is a group of two or more words that center on a noun (e.g., \u2018dog\u2019, \u2018girl\u2019, \u2018man\u2019) and include modifiers (e.g., \u2018the\u2019, \u2018a\u2019, \u2018None of\u2019). For example, \u2018girl\u2019 is not a noun phrase but \u2018a beautiful girl\u2019 is a noun phrase.", "Sometimes, it is important for us to extract all noun phrases in the sentence instead of extracting individual nouns. TextBlob allows us to do that easily", "As we can see, just \u2018learning strategies\u2019 are extracted from the sentence because it is the only noun phrase in the sentence.", "We can also extract the sentiment of a sentence using blob.sentiment", "Polarity is a float that lies within the range of (-1,1). If the polarity is below 0, the sentence is more negative than positive. If the polarity is above 0, the sentence is more positive than negative. Since our polarity is 0.15, it is more positive than negative.", "Subjectivity refers to personal opinion. Subjectivity is a float that lies in the range (0,1). If the value of subjectivity is above 0.5, the sentence is more subjective than objective and vice versa. Since the subjectivity of the sentence is 0.48, it is more objective than subjective.", "Lemmatization is the dictionary form of a set of words. For example, \u2018eats\u2019, \u2018ate\u2019, \u2018eating\u2019 are all forms of the word \u2018eat\u2019. Lemmatization is a popular method to process text before applying other NLP models.", "In order to lemmatize word, wrap the word inside theWord object instead of TextBlob", "Awesome! Some words are converted into their dictionary form. \u2018knowing\u2019 is converted \u2018know\u2019, \u2018excited\u2019 is converted to \u2018excite\u2019, and \u2018makes\u2019 is converted to \u2018make\u2019. Now the NLP model will not regard \u2018knowing\u2019 and \u2018know\u2019 as 2 different words!", "Sometimes, we might find a misspell or two in an article. The misspell is even more common if we are analyzing social media\u2019s text such as Twitter. The misspelling can make it difficult for our NLP model to know that the word learnin and the word learning are basically the same words!", "TextBlob also allows us to correct the spelling with one line of code", "I intentionally misspell a couple of words in the sentence such as neded, swicth, andlearnin. Let\u2019s see how TextBlob correct these words", "Pretty cool! All the misspelling is corrected in a reasonable way.", "We can also correct individual words withWord().spellcheck()", "The misspelling word lanin can be the misspell of many things so TextBlob gives us different results with learning is the word with the highest percentage to be the right one.", "Sometimes, it is important to know the frequency of a certain word in a sentence. TextBlob allows us to find the frequency of a word in a text with ease.", "We will use all of the text in my article on how to learn data science when life does not give you a break. We will use newspaper to scrape the article.", "Since this article is about my data science journey, I anticipate that there will be a lot of the words \u201cI\u201d in the sentence.
