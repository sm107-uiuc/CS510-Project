However, the application of AI does not always have to be so complicated. Differentiating a cat image from a dog image, detecting faces in a given image, or counting the number of particular objects in any given image are all applications of AI.", "One such real-world application is in smart parking systems where the AI detected parking spaces in a given image and determined if a given parking space is available or occupied using a video feed. Such a system is used as an alternative to barrier sensors, infrared sensors and ground sensors, where installation and maintenance costs turn out to be very expensive.", "A smart parking system I mentioned above, that can detect parking spaces in a given image and determined if a given parking space is available or occupied using a camera feed, preferably in real-time consists of two main steps:", "1. Find all the parking spaces: In a given space that the camera covers, it is crucial to know which of the spaces are designated parking spaces. Most of the parking lots specify parking area by drawing white boxes or white lines as shown in the images below. For us, it might be a simple task to identify a parking space, but it is a huge task for a computer to be able to look at those images as say how many parking spaces there are and draw a bod around the parking spaces.", "2. Find if a parking space is available or occupied: Once we know which all are parking spaces, we can then proceed to step two which is detecting if a parking space is occupied or is available. As with the above step, it is easy for us to look at a parking space and say if it occupied or not.", "As part of my experimentation project this month, I implemented an AI algorithm that takes in an annotated image and draws a green coloured bounding box around the parking space if it is available and a red coloured bounding box if it is occupied. This included training a deep convolutional neural network to detect if a parking space is occupied or not.", "The above image shows the result of my smart parking experiment using AI. The training and validation images were taken from PKLot dataset which contains a total of approximately 690,000 images of 173 different parking spaces in different weather conditions [1].", "For this experiment, I took the annotations from the PKLot dataset itself to get the coordinates of the parking spaces for a given image. All the input images I have used so far are from the same dataset, and so they come along with the annotation for the parking spaces.", "Below is a snippet of the annotation file of one of the images from the PKLot dataset.", "By using this file, I was able to get the coordinates of all the parking spaces in an image.", "Now that I had the coordinates of the parking spaces, I was able to get images of individual parking spaces and use it to determine if that space is occupied or not.", "For the classification of the individual parking space images, I trained a VGG model using transfer learning. Then, I used the trained model for each of the individual parking space images obtained earlier for this classification. The trained model was able to achieve 99.5% accuracy on the validation set.", "This can be extended further and turned into a smart parking system where, instead of an image, the algorithm takes in a real-time video feed so as to get the real-time parking availability updates. I will experiment with this algorithm with a live video feed and write about it in the coming weeks.", "After successful completion of this experiment, I learned that whenever you have a challenge that you are looking to solve, break it down into smaller steps, even if they are simple or obvious steps. Breaking down makes the challenge at hand makes it more manageable and can help focus on one part at a time.", "What other use cases of AI do you think are interesting?
