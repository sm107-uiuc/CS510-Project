But after reading the content of the article, I can see where Luke is coming from.", "Luke\u2019s opinion on the disappearance of the Machine Learning role is based on the fact that the responsibilities associated with ML Engineering will merge into the broader Software Engineering role.", "This article is a conversation starter, as the role of an ML Engineer is extensive and differs from company to company. Luke acknowledges the fact that there isn\u2019t an industry-standard description for the role, so he provides three typical requirements for ML Engineering roles you\u2019ll come across on job postings.", "Luke also states an excellent point, and that is that the ML Engineer role could exist due to the ambiguity on what machine learning itself entails. Which leads on the statement that \u201cby consequence, ML Engineers are in many cases half researcher, half engineer\u201d.", "This is a truth that I live every day, although one could argue that the balance is not necessarily 50/50.", "Luke\u2019s point is centred around the notion that as more people begin to understand ML, there might be less need for an ambiguous role such as an ML Engineer and the role itself will be engulfed in the more extensive Software Engineering role requirement.", "I have barely scratched the surface of Luke Posey\u2019s opinion piece.", "Deepfake is retaking the spotlight, especially when world-famous rapper Jay Z takes action against deepfake content portraying attributes of himself on YouTube.", "Dave Gershgorn article centres around the legal aspects of deepfakes and the legal actions that have been taken in the past against the use of similar creative/music style by a party that is not affiliated to the prosecutor.", "Dave article provides an example of an AI-generated song, and it eerily indistinguishable from human-generated music (give it a listen, and you will be surprised).", "The main problem with AI-generated music and deepfakes is the residue of artistic style that\u2019s retained within the music generated. This opens up the world of legal actions and copyright infringement lawsuits.", "Dave provides real-life scenarios of legal cases that involved legal action taken against a party as a result of similarity in the musical style amongst humans.", "It is a blurred line to decide if A.I. is exempt from human laws. It\u2019s definitely a grey area and one that doesn\u2019t have a solid foundation of federal rules and regulation to draw from. At this moment, the case of legal action against deepfakes and A.I. is state decided.", "I\u2019m so glad I came across this article, as it\u2019s much needed.
