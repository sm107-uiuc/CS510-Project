But if you haven\u2019t used themes yet or are not familiar with them:", "Themes control all non-data display and are an easy way to change the appearance of your graph. It only takes one extra line of code in order to do this, and ggplot already comes with 8 separate themes.", "There are three key reasons for making your own ggplot theme:", "Here are a few examples where ggplot themes have been put to good use:", "Before creating your first ggplot theme, it\u2019s good to ask yourself three things:", "2. How familiar am I with R package development? If you want to create a ggplot theme, it will need to live in an R package. This is usually the biggest obstacle for someone when they make their first ggplot theme. If you already have experience developing packages, then you\u2019re in luck \u2014 creating your own theme can be as quick as 30 minutes. However, if you haven\u2019t yet worked with packages, you\u2019ll need to first spend some time to read up on the fundamentals of package development, which could take a few hours. If you think that you\u2019ll be using R a lot in your future, this would be a good time to start learning the basics of package development!", "3. Who would be using this theme? If you work for a company with a lot of R users, it may be good to push for some consistency in data visualization. If your company doesn\u2019t already have a ggplot theme, this could be a clear win for your analytics org and investing time to make a theme should be considered more heavily. If it\u2019s just you that will use the theme, imagine how impressive your graphs will look after and how much time you would save!", "There\u2019s no avoiding this \u2014 your ggplot theme will need to live in a package. Whether it\u2019s a package that already exists, or a package that you\u2019ll need to create \u2014 you\u2019ll want to find the right home for your theme.", "Because package development in itself can fill a series of articles, I won\u2019t get too deep into it for now, but if this is your first time developing a package, I would highly recommend reading through the first six chapters of Hadley\u2019s R package guide.", "Once you have your package, you\u2019ll want to create a separate file in the package directory with the same name as your theme. In general, you\u2019ll want to start your theme name with theme_ . For example, theme_bw(), theme_void() .", "For some guidance on what this file might look like, you can reference:", "This is the most exciting step \u2014you\u2019ll want to start playing around with ggplot theme options here in order to dictate what you want your theme to look like. There are a myriad of parameters, but I would highly recommend reading through the documentation for ggplot::theme .", "To get you started, you can always begin with an existing theme. For example, if you like the look of theme_classic() , you can use that theme as a foundation for your own theme:", "In terms of discovering your theme aesthetics, you\u2019ll generally want to test your theme out with a few different visualizations:", "For this, I would recommend just creating a scratch R file that you can sandbox in and create various graphs in until you start honing in on something that you like. Don\u2019t stress out too much about this step! If you find out down the line that you want to make changes to your theme, that would be really easy to do.", "A few key parameters that you may want to consider customizing:", "This is where you start to fill in the function parameters. For example, your function can look like:", "This is where you want to set your defaults, but also allow for some flexibility in using your theme. For example, for the default font size, you might want to set the default for a size that is best suited for a word doc. But if you end up creating a ggplot for a graph that will be used for a PowerPoint slide, you would also want the ability to increase the text size.", "Another example of where custom parameters could be useful is in the last line of the example above: border=FALSE . To see what this would look like in the function itself as well as an example in practice, see below:", "By giving the user an option to turn borders on/off, they can easily change how the theme works for facetted graphs:", "This is one example of a custom parameter that you can add for a theme. This is where you can be really creative \u2014 if you think that there are ways you might want to change your theme based on the type of graph you are using, you should include it in your function.", "Once you completed making your theme, you\u2019ll want to let others know about it! Here are a few tips on how you can get others to use your theme:", "Hopefully you found this article helpful! Before you go, you may have noticed that I didn\u2019t talk too much about colors.
