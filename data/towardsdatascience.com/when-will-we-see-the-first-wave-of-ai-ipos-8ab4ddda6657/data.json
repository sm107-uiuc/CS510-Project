Shortly afterwards, Google announced its mobile-first strategy in 2010. Since then, we\u2019ve seen a wave of massive mobile app IPOs: Evernote in 2012, Twitter in 2013, King (the company behind Candy Crush) in 2014, Tinder in 2015, Snapchat and Line in 2016.", "Fast forward to 2017, Google CEO Sundar Pichai announced a shift from mobile-first to AI (Artificial Intelligence)-first strategy. He later added that AI is going to have a bigger impact on the world than some of the most ubiquitous innovations in history like fire or electricity. Two years later, today, we\u2019ve seen \u201c7 AI companies exited via IPO or M&A valued at $1B+ \u2014 four of which have taken place in the last 2 years.\u201d Is this the first arriving signal of a giant IPO wave?", "Interestingly, despite a record high funding into US AI startups, we see fewer US companies the IPO pipeline. The two AI IPOs valued over $1B: NIO is a Chinese electric autonomous vehicle maker. And Mobileye is an Israeli company that makes cameras and software to help cars avoid accidents. If you google \u201cAI IPO,\u201d you will see news like \u201cChinese AI startup Megvii plans for an IPO.\u201d and \u201cSouth Korea\u2019s JLK Inspection is going public.\u201d but no mention of US startups on the first page.", "Why are there fewer AI IPOs in the United States? Is it just a matter of time? Or is the US falling behind in the race for AI dominance?", "The U.S. leads in the AI startup scene but not IPO. Why?", "The answer is \u201cAbsolutely not.\u201d In fact, the US is leading the AI startup scene: 77 out of the top 100 AI startups are from the States. In comparison, there are only 8 Chinese companies on the list. In addition, according to the National Venture Capital Association, 965 AI-related companies in the U.S. have raised $13.5 billion in the first 9 months of this year. US AI startups are expected to break funding records in 2019. So why aren\u2019t there more startups filing for IPOs?", "The number of AI startup acquisitions doubled in 2016 and increased by an average of 46% in the following years. And US tech giants are dominating AI startup acquisitions: Apple (acquired 20 startups so far), Google (14), Microsoft (10), Facebook (8), Intel (8), and Amazon (7) are the most aggressive acquirers of AI startups, according to CB Insights. On the other hand, the vast majority of acquirers (431) have only acquired a single AI company.", "But more interesting is when you look at the changes in the market value of these tech giants: a significant increase in value over the past few years, especially since 2017, when you started to see a jump in AI acquisitions. This explains why we\u2019ve seen more AI IPOs in places other than the U.S. AI startups here are more likely to get acquired before IPO.", "In 2013, Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Intel were already among the top 10 most valuable companies in the world. But they weren\u2019t so far apart from S&P 500 (^GSPC, the grey line above) until the last few years. The tech giants have widened their gap over the past few years.", "What does that mean to startups and other companies?", "In the past, every time there is technology innovation, we see major industry reshuffles. Small companies disrupt incumbents and introduced phones, personal computers, digital photographs, and streaming videos.", "Tech incumbents like Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon, are more prepared than anyone else. They have advantages in data, capital, and talents to not only outcompete innovative startups but also disrupt traditional industry players. Among all, retail & CPG has the highest number of AI acquisitions (67 in total since 2010), followed by media & entertainment, healthcare, finance & insurance, and transportation & logistics.", "So far Google, Apple, and Microsoft have each acquired 10+ AI startups. And recently traditional incumbents slowly started to react: Roche acquired Flatiron Health. Nike acquired AI-powered inventory management startup Celect. And McDonald\u2019s acquired personalization platform Dynamic Yield.", "What makes it even trickier for traditional industry players is that AI is invisible. With previous technological innovations like the internet and mobile app, we can easily tell good/innovative products from the bad ones. But it\u2019s not always easy to do so with AI products. For example, you don\u2019t really know if the security robot patrolling your building is fully autonomous powered by AI or remotely controlled by a human.", "Despite all the hype, the truth is that there haven\u2019t been that many AI products on the market yet. Over 80% of the companies are looking into AI but most of them still try to identify use cases that would create actual value. We only started to see AI-enabled robots deployed in the field very recently. And venture capital firm MMC claimed that 40% of European AI startups don\u2019t actually use AI. It\u2019s hard for outsiders to know what\u2019s actually going on.", "AI will no doubt have a huge impact across industries but \u201cAI as a Product\u201d is still in its infancy. It\u2019s probably too early to predicate the first wave of AI IPOs. But it\u2019s clear that traditional incumbents are facing more challenges than ever this time, not only from nimble startups but also from AI-powered tech giants. If you are working for a traditional company and trying to adopt AI, focus on where you can leverage your domain expertise and create practical value. \u201cAI is the new electricity. It will transform every industry and create huge economic value,\u201d said Andrew Ng. But you don\u2019t have to be an electricity company to exploit the value. You just need to know how to apply the technology to your advantage.", "Click here if you want to see more articles like this!", "Bastiane Huang is a Product Manager at OSARO, a San Francisco based startup building software-defined robotics.
