But I always find myself working with high-level frameworks and tools that mostly hide the real structure of the models being used. Mainly due to the variety of existing libraries and frameworks helping developers around the world to quickly start with machine learning code, encouraging them to build endpoint applications that use intelligent models for the purpose of countless tasks, without necessarily helping them to understand what is really happening behind the scenes.", "Unfortunately, acting in that way, people fail to understand the inner workings of the models they are using, and therefore they will not even consider taking time for digging into the science behind it.", "But guess what, it is not that difficult to grasp what\u2019s going on inside a neural network, and the goal of this article is to explain in a very simple and accessible way the mechanics underneath, breaking down the main components, explaining the general architecture and hoping to give you a full insight of how a network behaves from the input data to the expected end result.", "I will break down the topic in two articles so that I can properly focus on each part without overwhelming you with too much information.", "A perceptron can be conceived as a binary model that basically mimics a biological neuron. It was first introduced in 1905 and developed in 1960 by the scientist Frank Rosenblatt, inspired by earlier work by Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts. The perceptron schematizes a decision model that can output different results based on a given set of binary inputs. Those inputs can have different weights to illustrate their level of importance, and hence the idea is to compute a weighted sum of binary inputs that happen to be greater or lower than a specific threshold intimately related to the actual perceptron itself.", "The perceptron can be also represented by a simple algebraic formula:", "A sigmoid neuron is a slightly more sophisticated model than the perceptron. Unlike the perception which can only hold 0 or 1 values, the sigmoid neuron can vary from a range between 0 and 1 so it can hold infinite numbers. The advantage of it is that we increase the output scale enormously and therefore the model becomes more numerically stable because small changes in the input weights cause small variations in the output. In the previous model, no matter how tiny we tweak the input weights, the output will abruptly switch between 0 and 1, whereas with the sigmoid neuron we reach a certain level of smoothness in the output variations.", "To be more clear the neuron here plays the role of a sigmoid function that takes the weighted sum of all the inputs, and outputs a number between 0 and 1. A neuron is activated once the weighted sum is greater than its threshold. The inner threshold is commonly referred to as a bias specifically scaled for each neuron.", "To summarize, a sigmoid neuron computes the weighted sum of its inputs, applies a sigmoid function that squashes the results in a number range between 0 and 1, and finally compares the obtained results with its threshold so it can light up or extinguish.", "Basically stacking multiple neurons together either in parallel or in series constitutes a layer. But as you might obviously expect, there is much more in that than just simply stacking neurons carelessly. Each network is built for a specific task, and therefore it has a different kind of layers assembled in different ways. But generally, there are three types of layers commonly used in multiple architecture patterns, the input layer, the hidden layers, and the output layer.", "In a more scientific way, those layers are involved in the process of generating levels of abstraction. Meaning that, the more logical patterns the network is able to detect and learn, the more its \u201cabstraction capability\u201d is engaged and developed, leading the system to generalize from simple raw data to high level concepts.", "The same generalization process occurs in our brain instinctively, without even noticing. From a dog picture, we immediately think of an animal, because for a dog figure we have learned specific patterns which are related to physiological characteristics that help make the difference between a dog and a cat. And in a sense, the entire process from the image of a dog to a high-level understanding of the idea that a dog represents is built up by assembling multiple layers of abstraction.", "Each network defines its hidden layers depending on the nature of the problem the network is aiming to solve, and therefore multiple designs are available. One architecture can fit very well for a certain problematic, and not perform either well on another.", "What is very interesting with these layers, is that a pattern of activation in one layer causes a very specific pattern in the next layer and so forth. Which means that each layer is accountable for detecting singular patterns within the data. In the case of Convolutional Neural Networks which classify images into targeted labels, they implement a mechanism within their hidden layers that could conceivably combine pixels into edges, edges into patterns and finally patterns into digits.", "You can check an interesting article by Omar M\u2019Haimdat to get hands-on CNNs from a developer perspective.", "Side note: At this stage, if you are looking to dig into the details of CNNs, I wouldhighly recommend you to read Yann LeCun\u2019s paper: Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition.", "The most commonly used activation function in the output layer is the Softmax, calculating the probability distribution of each target class over all possible target classes.", "In mathematics, the softmax function, also known as softargmax or normalized exponential function, is a function that takes as input a vector of N real numbers, and normalizes it into a probability distribution consisting of N probabilities proportional to the exponentials of the input numbers.", "There is a massive variety of network architectures that can be used. But always keep in mind that the architecture depends on the type of problem and the purpose intended. There are actually a lot of design patterns or architectures which have been proven to better suit a specific set of problems. Network architectures are an active field of research, and every year there are multiple papers published in that sense.", "Generally speaking, there are 5 big Neural Network Types:", "I hope this article helped to demystify a little bit the not so hard to understand mathematical concepts behind neural networks and I\u2019m quite sure that with a bit of practice you can easily get quite familiar with those concepts \ud83d\ude09.", "I would like to mention the different sources which inspired me to write this article:", "In the second part, I will cover the way neural networks learn, and we will explore a lot of exciting concepts like backpropagation, gradient descent, and many others. So stay tuned for the next part \ud83d\ude09\ud83d\ude09.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Scientist & ML Engineer | NLP enthusiast.
