We can\u2019t predict what type of error is this? Two types of errors are possible.", "Out of these two errors, for this model, first, one is considered to be risky. Because if a cancer patient is mispredicted, their condition will become worse without treatment.", "If a non-cancer patient is predicted as cancer means, he/she may go for another screening and will get the correct result in the next screening. So, this error is not risky.", "If those 5 misclassified records belong to the first category (Cancer patients predicted as no cancer) means, it will be very risky. From the accuracy metrics, we can\u2019t evaluate the performance of the model.", "So, we go for a confusion matrix which breaks down the type of error also.", "A confusion matrix is a n*n matrix that is used for evaluating the performance of the classification model.For Binary classification \u2014 The confusion Matrix is a 2*2 matrix.If the target class is 3 means Confusion Matrix is 3*3 matrix and so on.", "False Positive(FP) is also known as Type I Error.False Negative(FN) is also known as Type II Error", "Recall is a measure of how many positives your model is able to recall from the data.", "Out of all positive records, how many records are predicted correctly.", "Recall is also known as Sensitivity or TPR (True Positive Rate)", "Precision is the ratio of correct positive predictions to the total positive predictions.", "Out of all positives been predicted, how many are actually positive.", "Both precision and recall are used for evaluating the performance of the model. Which one to chose depends on the problem we aim to solve.", "Cancer Prediction-For this dataset, if the model predicts cancer records as non-cancer means it\u2019s risky.

False Negative should be 0.", "For this cancer dataset, recall metrics is given more importance while evaluating the performance of the model.", "If non-cancer records are predicted as cancer means it\u2019s not that risky.", "Example.

False Positive should be 0.", "If the spam filtering dataset has 100 records, out of which 94 are predicted as spam emails. Only 90 out of 94 records is predicted correctly. 4 good emails are classified as spam. It\u2019s risky. The precision rate is 95%. It should be 100%.
