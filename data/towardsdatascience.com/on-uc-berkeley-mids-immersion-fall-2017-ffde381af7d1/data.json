Currently, I\u2019m the co-founder of a startup, Jobwell.co, where we\u2019re developing a CRM for job hunters. The MIDS program allows me the flexibility to learn about data science and begin applying what I\u2019ve learned at my startup.", "The MIDS program is location agnostic and leverages the Internet to bring together aspiring data scientists of all disciplines from around the world into intimate classrooms of fifteen or fewer students. While the benefits of such a distributed global classroom are many, it\u2019s better still when familiar faces from the online classroom gather in person and doubly so on campus at UC Berkeley. While I was in my first term in the MIDS program, I had the opportunity to meet nearly 100 other MIDS Candidates from around the world when we attended the 2017 MIDS Immersion. The immersion is a 4-day Data Science \u201cChautauqua\u201d full of expert speakers, company visits, and networking with professors, alumni, and other students at Cal. Of my 100 classmates, I already knew a couple dozen of them through classes or from our active Slack channels.", "While I live within driving distance of campus, I had my first tour of the university campus by a kind MIDS candidate who was previously an undergrad at Cal. She showed us around campus and gave us context and history of the buildings. As our tour ended, it was time to head to the University Club at the Memorial Stadium, the perfect venue for meeting more of our classmates, faculty, and staff. We enjoyed music played by the Cal band and were serenaded by an acapella group, followed by a welcome by Oski, Berkeley\u2019s mascot!", "While online instruction time in our classrooms is packed with course material and questions, many of us took advantage of the opportunity to learn more about our professors\u2019 research and got to know more of our amazing MIDS program and School of Information staff. Following these opportunities, some of my newly met friends and I retired to the hotel\u2019s bar and caught up about our classes, careers and interests.", "The following day began with a catered breakfast where we chatted amongst ourselves and learned about new classes and some of the great professors teaching them, as well as strategies for optimizing our course loads. We then launched into our day-long Data Dialogs conference, where the Immersion participants and other members of the UC Berkeley and data science community heard leaders of academia and industry discuss different applications of data science, updates on tools we use as data scientists, where the discipline might lead us as professionals, and what role humans have. For a detailed recap, I encourage you to explore Tiffany Jaya\u2019s excellent post.", "The next day was my favorite: We began with a faculty panel on Deep Learning moderated by the School\u2019s Dean AnnaLee Saxenian; it was fascinating to hear about applications and aspects of data science and some of the School\u2019s faculty\u2019s views and experiences with it. There was a flurry of questions for the panelists from my classmates following the conclusion of the session, and then we began our company visits.", "Our group was split into two, and each half went initially to lunch and to learn from the Data Science teams at Dropbox or at WorkDay. My group started by visiting with the Dropbox team and we heard about some of the thorny data science problems they were working on; it was an outstanding opportunity to learn about data science at Dropbox and how they were growing their team.", "Following Dropbox, we traveled to Airbnb where we were treated to an insightful presentation by a MIDS alum along with several of his Airbnb colleagues. They offered great insights about their projects at Airbnb and their approach to embedding it into different components of the company\u2019s line of business.", "After we left Airbnb, we had some free time to explore the city, where a gaggle of us headed to one of the most iconic buildings in San Francisco, the Ferry Building, and sampled the restaurants, shops, and stalls while further getting to know everyone. As the clock on the Building\u2019s tower struck six, we headed over to the Autodesk Gallery, an interactive museum of sorts, demonstrating the novel technologies, intellectual property, and applications of Autodesk\u2019s software \u2014 along with snacks and hors d\u2019oeuvres where we got to further mingle with our professors and meet local students and alumni. Conversation continued until the museum closed and we returned to Berkeley for the evening.", "The final morning of our immersion was an outstanding capstone to our experience \u2014 beginning with a UC Berkeley lecturer who led us through a series of interactive leadership exercises in finding our authentic voice as a leader, which then gave way to a community lunch where we met more students from the School of Information and faculty and staff. The day wrapped up with a Town Hall, where Dean Saxenian briefed the community on some exciting new developments happening soon, along with taking questions from our community. Following our town hall, heartfelt goodbyes were said, hugs given all around, and we began our departure.", "Immersion was an incredibly valuable experience and provided additional context and community to my online learnings. I\u2019m looking forward to the next immersion I can attend, but until then, I\u2019m excited to continue being part of a global community of UC Berkeley MIDS students and alums, and know that I have friends all over the world.", "Your home for data science.
