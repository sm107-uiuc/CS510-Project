One of the things that makes Quimb so interesting and useful is its ability to perform computations with tensor networks. If you\u2019re not familiar with tensor networks, we\u2019ll talk a little about them here, but you can also check out one of my other articles on them here on Medium \u201cBlack Hole Machine Learning\u201d, where I discuss the history of tensor networks in physics, and their uses in machine learning and AI. If you\u2019re still curious and enjoy digging into a little code, you can also check out my Github repo of Quimb tutorials.", "Quantum circuits are diagrams that closely resemble the staff notation musicians use. You read them from left to right, just like music, and each box on the staff represents a matrix operation performed on the qubits called gates. The wires represent qubits running along in time, passing through the gates. On the far right side of the circuit we usually see little measurement symbols that resemble a speedometer in a car, or a gauge you might find on a bike pump showing the air pressure. They indicate a measurement of the qubit, and they return a state vector for the qubit at that moment in time. These measurements are generally performed many times due to the probabilistic nature of quantum physics. Each time the measurement will return a different value with some probability of being in one of two states. This is one thing that really distinguishes quantum computers from classical computers. They are inherently probabilistic and qubits don\u2019t simply exist as 0 or 1 like the classical binary bits of your laptop or phone. In the quantum circuit above made in IBM\u2019s quantum computing circuit composer, we see a Hadamard gate denoted by a little box with an \u2018H\u2019 that operates on the single qubit q[0]. Next is a \u2018CNOT\u2019 gate which operates on the first two qubits q[0] and q[1]. Third in the circuit is an operator on three qubits q[1], q[2], and q[3], represented by an 8-by-8 matrix. Finally, there is a measurement performed on the qubit q[1]. You can sign up for a free account at IBM and create and run your own quantum circuits on actual IBM quantum computers in the cloud.", "Suppose you have a quantum circuit that can be simulated on a classical computer efficiently (this isn\u2019t always possible due to the fact that the computations become too difficult for a classical computer to simulate in many cases). One way of simulating some quantum circuits efficiently is using tensor networks. Tensor networks are graphical representations of tensor, which can be thought of as multidimensional arrays of numbers. A rank-0 tensor is just a scalar. A rank-1 tensor is a vector. A rank-2 tensor is a matrix, and so on into higher dimensional arrays that become difficult to visualize after rank-3.", "Google has recently released a library that runs with its well known TensorFlow as backend. While having a library built on top of TensorFlow is a huge plus due to the popularity and widespread use of TensorFlow, the TensorNetwork library itself is not the most user friendly At present and can be a bit daunting to newcomers. If you are not already familiar with TensorFlow and if you don\u2019t already have a solid programming background, troubleshooting some of the errors that are thrown when trying to perform anything beyond basic tensor network constructions and operations can be a headache. The library is said to be stable on the Github page but very much still in alpha according to the authors of the code. Depending on how much effort is devoted to the project, it may be some time before the library is ready for wider adoption outside of research in the same way that TensorFlow has been adopted and used.", "Quimb is an open source software for performing quantum circuit simulation and constructing tensor networks, performing operations on tensor networks, developing algorithms using tensor networks, and training tensor networks for machine learning. It has excellent documentation for those already familiar with quantum mechanics and quantum computing, and for those who aren\u2019t, I\u2019m creating a Github repository of tutorials explaining the math and physics behind the code, as well as providing many extra examples and explanations. For a first example, check out the notebook for the first tutorial. What makes Quimb even better is it uses NetworkX, a \u201cPython package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure, dynamics, and functions of complex networks,\u201d to create beautiful tensor network diagram visualizations:", "So, what are tensor networks used for, aside from quantum physics of course? They can be used in machine learning as layers in deep neural networks. This bridges the gap between classical machine learning and the new field of quantum machine learning, which uses quantum variational circuits as quantum neural networks. In many cases, simulating such quantum neural networks using tensor networks improves the performance of machine learning algorithms drastically. So, even if you aren\u2019t planning on delving into quantum computing anytime soon, if you are using neural networks and machine learning, you can still benefit from the use of quantum computing techniques by integrating them into your current machine learning models.", "Your home for data science.
