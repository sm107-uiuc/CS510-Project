Held annually, it comprises of quality papers by independent researchers to breakthroughs by R&D labs of major companies. Due to the pandemic caused by COVID-19 this year, the organisers decided to hold CVPR 2020 virtually, from June 14\u201319. Different though it may be, the virtual aspect has not, in any sense, dampened the sheer quality of papers and research that is presented in the conference.", "At this year\u2019s CVPR conference, the researchers at Facebook AI have succeeded in pushing the boundaries of state of the art models in many important and relatively newer areas of computer vision, primarily among them being new ways in reasoning about 3D objects shown in regular 2D images. Leveraging the numerous functionalities of PyTorch 3D, the open-source machine learning framework by FAIR, the work could help unlock numerous AR/VR augmentations and a key in shaping other technologies in the near future.", "Researchers at Facebook AI and Research (FAIR) built SynSin, a state-of-the-art model that takes a single RGB image and generates a new image of the same scene, from an entirely different perspective. The proposed system works by projecting a predicted 3D point cloud onto another view of the scene, using their novel differentiable renderer implemented in PyTorch 3D. The paper uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to synthesise the output image based on the rendered point cloud input.", "Since SynSin depends on a rendered 3D point cloud as its basis for scene generation, it is able to generate images of varying resolutions owing to the flexibility of the rendered point cloud, with more efficiency compared to contemporary methods.", "We can generate high resolution images and generalise to other input resolutions.", "The projected features by the 3D point cloud are also decoded by the authors\u2019 proposed refinement network to help in-paint missing regions and generate a more realistic, final output image. When compared with recent methods, which often make the use of dense voxel grids, the approach by the authors of this paper is able to scale to synthetic scene generation in complex, real-world scenarios. This is something that most present-day approaches have not been able to achieve with a respectable accuracy.", "The full paper by Wiles, Gkioxari, Szeliski and Johnson can be viewed here for a more in-depth explanation of the nuances of their differentiable renderer and GAN.", "Researchers at Facebook AI built upon the Pixel Aligned Implicit Function (PIFu) method released by Saito et al. in 2019 and created a multi-level neural network to develop a method for generating 3D reconstructions of people from 2D images which is able to capture state of the art intricacies and details and render them as a 3D model. Highly specific details like fingers, facial features and clothing folds are captured using high resolution photographs as inputs for the network.", "The network created can be broadly divided into two main parts, based on their functionalities. The first part (or the first-level network) recreates the 3D structure of a human being by utilising images of lower resolutions. This part is similar to the PIFu method that the researchers built up on. The second network is more lightweight in nature, and makes use of the higher resolution images to capture and render the more finer aspects of the human being.", "By enabling access to the global 3D information from the first level, our system can leverage local and global information efficiently for high-resolution 3D human reconstruction.", "The methods employed by the researchers for such fine-grained reconstructions of human beings in 3D could prove to be a major boost in AR/VR experiences, as well as in several e-commerce applications.", "The full paper by Saito, Huang, Natsume, Morishima, Kanazawa and Li can be found here.", "A paper that deals with more of a theoretical approach rather than an application, researchers at Facebook AI released ImVoteNet, an improved 3D object detection architecture, specialised for RGB-D scenes. They explored how data from 2D images can assist a voting-based 3D detection pipeline. A few recent works (like VoteNet) have shown state of the art performances leveraging just point clouds. The ImVoteNet paper builds upon the architecture of VoteNet and fuse the 3D geometry provided by point clouds with the high resolution and texture of images, to extract both geometric as well as semantic features from 2D images.", "Point clouds, though are useful in effectively detecting objects in three dimensions, usually have inherent limitations in their data. The data obtained by point clouds is usually sparse, lack colour information and sometimes suffer from sensor noise. Fusing the features of 2D images and 3D point clouds by using a multi-tower training scheme helped the researchers to extract the best out of both of the source images. Researchers, successfully extracted geometric and semantic features from the 2D image and leveraged camera parameters to lift them up to 3D. The system built relies on a vohereting mechanism to effectively aggregate geometric information in point clouds. ImVoteNet is responsible for significantly boosting 3D object detection using mulimodal training with gradient blending, in settings where the point cloud is sparse in nature or is unfavourably distributed.", "The complete paper by Qi, Chen, Litany and Guibas can be found here.", "Fascinating though these papers are, CVPR holds a lot more than what is showcased above. Competitions, talks by experts and workshops are what one needs to keep an eye out for. From de-pixelating images to latent autoencoders, some of the most innovative and exciting papers are showcased every year.
