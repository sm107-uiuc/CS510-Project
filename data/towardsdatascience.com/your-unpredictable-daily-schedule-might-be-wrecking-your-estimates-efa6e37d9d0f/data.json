It took 8! Or, maybe it took 13. Or 20. Something that wasn\u2019t 10.", "I mean, you\u2019re a god of software development. You always know the exact amount of work needed for any project. And, obviously, you never have unexpected difficulties, unclear requirements, or changes in energy or morale. All the random variables are out of the equation!", "(Yeah right. But, roll with me here, let\u2019s assume the above is true.)", "So what happened?! Let\u2019s retrace your steps.", "Presumably, you first came up with an estimate for the amount of work, in your head. Then you probably converted it to an irreducible unit of time, let\u2019s say, X total hours of work.", "But, the business wanted it in business days. So you figured, \u201cWell, on average, I get about Y hours of work done on a project, each day, give or take a few.\u201d So you took X divided by Y, and got Z business days.", "There\u2019s the problem! Not all business days are equal. They\u2019re random. You forgot to consider the variance of how many hours you work on a project each day. The \u201cgive or take a few\u201d. Is it consistently close to Y hours of work in a day, or does it vary wildly, is it often 1 hour, and often 8 hours, and it just averages out to 4 only in the grand view?", "But, how much could that variance actually effect the variance of the whole project\u2019s length, anyway? Could it really vary the project length much?", "Let\u2019s continue to ignore the other random variables that affect a project\u2019s length, and focus on this \u201cunpredictable schedule\u201d variable in particular, because, I have been collecting data about the unpredictability of my schedule\u2026", "\u2026and we can use that data, to know how much of an effect it has on the inaccuracy of my estimates!", "For the past 14 months, I have recorded and categorized where my time is going, for every minute of my day at work.", "Here is an example actual day:", "The day is segmented into parts, and each part\u2019s minutes are put into one of six categories. Most of the categories are not important to this article, but I\u2019ll quickly explain them, for the interested.", "If I\u2019m doing something I think is important, but isn\u2019t my \u201cMain Project\u201d, then I\u2019ll put those minutes into the \u201cImportant Stuff\u201d column. If I\u2019m doing something for corporate, like a survey or an all-hands meeting, those minutes are added to the \u201cCorporate\u201d column. If the time is spent on something someone wants me to do but I kind of think it is waste, like most meetings, that\u2019s in the \u201cMeh Stuff\u201d category. \u201cLunch\u201d is lunch. Anything else like walking around, warming up my cold hands, or socializing, is in the \u201cOther\u201d category.", "So, looks like I was a bit of an introvert on July 16, and my hands were not that cold. Very unusual.", "Our main concern in this article is the time spent in the \u201cMain Project\u201d category. On July 16, looks like I spent about 225 minutes on my main project.", "It just so happens that, for me, 225 minutes is pretty close to normal. Looking across all the days I have recorded so far, the average time spent on my main project each day, is 200 minutes (which is, 3 hours and 20 minutes).", "By the way, what do I mean by \u201cMain Project\u201d? On my team, each developer typically has an assigned \u201cMain Project\u201d that they are working on, and giving a lot of estimates for, but the developer typically has other responsibilities like production support, maintenance/upkeep tasks, meetings, etc.", "So, my average time spent on my main project each day, is 200 minutes.", "But it\u2019s the nature of my job that it actually varies a lot from 200 minutes. It is often not anywhere near 200 minutes.", "A great way to visualize this variance is a histogram. This is a bar graph where we put each day into a bucket: we count all the days where I got 0\u201350 minutes of work done, that\u2019ll be the 0\u201350 bar on the bar graph. Then we count all the days where I got 50\u2013100 minutes of work done, that\u2019ll be the next bar on the bar graph. And so on.", "It\u2019s very random looking, not far from a uniform distribution. A lot of variance. But, you can see a central tendency around 275 minutes, with thick tails to the left and right. My actual mean is 200, not 275 minutes, since the tail on the left is thicker and longer, and because there are many days in the 0\u201350 bar.", "There are more details about how the data was collected, in the appendix of this article.", "I only have data about myself, of course, but I\u2019m very curious about other developers. Are there developers with little variance, and each day they work on their main project consistently close to some average?", "Until I started collecting data, I thought I was one of those developers. But it turns out, I am not. And if you think you are, maybe you aren\u2019t either. In fact, maybe yours has even more variance! It\u2019s hard to know. I look at developers around me, and suspect that about half of them probably have more unpredictable schedules!", "After all, don\u2019t we all have questions to answer, code to review, people to talk to, production fires to fight?", "Suppose I\u2019m given a project, and I think about it and decide it will take 2000 minutes to complete. On average, I know I do 200 minutes per day on a main project, so the expected length of the project is therefore 10 days, give or take a few depending on luck.", "I can use my data to simulate how long the project will actually end up taking. And I can simulate it over and over, to see how often and how much it varies from the expected length.", "(Remember, we\u2019re still \u201cassuming\u201d I\u2019m a god developer and all the other random variables don\u2019t exist.)", "Here\u2019s an example run of the sim: On day 1 of the project, we randomly select a day from my dataset, and take its \u201cnumber of minutes on my main project\u201d. OK, we got 150 minutes. Have we reached 2000 total minutes yet? No? Then go on to day 2. Again, we randomly select a day from my dataset. OK, we got 300 minutes. Have we reached 2000 minutes yet? No, only 450 so far. \u2026And so on. Eventually, halfway through the 8th day, we reach 2000 minutes. Therefore on this run of the simulation, it took 7.5 days to finish the project (we only needed half of day 8).", "That was one run, but what we really want to do, is record that we finished on \u201cDay 8\u201d in a histogram, and then do 1 million more runs of the simulation, and record each result in the histogram.", "Hopefully you can see the intuition of why this simulation works: how much \u201cmain project\u201d work I do in a day is a random variable, but my collected data captures the distribution of that random variable. If I have a lot of \u201c0 minute\u201d days, then my dataset will reflect that, and so the simulation will randomly select 0 minute days often. If my collected days were pretty consistent, then the simulation would randomly select days that are consistent.", "Anyway, here is the resulting histogram for simulating this 10-day project using my unpredictable schedule, and finding out how long it could actually take:", "Gorgeous! Right? Here are some examples of fun observations to make.", "That last observation is also known as the \u201cTwo-tailed 95% confidence interval\u201d of my project\u2019s length.", "So, are you surprised? Or does it look about right to you?", "For me, I was surprised. I definitely thought the variance of project length was wide, sure. Wider than this, even. However, I mostly think about sources of variance like \u201cunexpected difficulties\u201d, \u201cunclear requirements\u201d, that sort of thing. I never thought about an \u201cunpredictable schedule\u201d mattering much.", "And yet, the project variance is already this huge without including those obvious other sources of variance! If we were able to include those as well, this graph would be much wider still!", "Many software developers who need to report estimates, prefer not to report the expected average length (10 days), and instead prefer to give the 95% confidence interval (7.0 to 14.5 days). The above graph and observations probably demonstrate why: the estimate of 10 days really doesn\u2019t tell us much, if it\u2019s incorrect by 1.0+ days, in 60.1% of cases! Perhaps these developers have a good intuition for the vast randomness of software development.", "But just look at the size of that 95% confidence interval, it\u2019s 7.0 to 14.5 days of work! If you give an estimated range like that, there are people who will give you dirty looks. I reckon that many people get shocked that the second number is two times the first number, which seems like 100% error, or something like that. They aren\u2019t visualizing the bell curve shape and tails.", "Perhaps that is why many software developers prefer to just report the right-end of the interval (14.5 days). The truth can be scary.", "And yet, in reality, with all the other random variables, this graph would probably be much wider. Maybe absurdly wide\u2026it makes me think there is no such thing as estimating, really\u2026", "It makes me think, that there is no such thing as \u201cbeing fairly sure a project will finish by X date\u201d. There is only setting a reasonable limit, and working up until then. If you do finish before that, great, you got lucky. If you don\u2019t, that\u2019s common, just try to have something working reasonably well when you hit the negotiated limit\u2026because otherwise, you might be working shockingly longer than you ever wanted to.", "That\u2019s just my reaction though, maybe yours is different! Think about it!", "There\u2019s an important thing I think this experiment shows nicely.", "When a project is far off from its estimate, it is often blamed on the developer\u2019s estimation skill \u2014 if they were better at estimating, they would have been closer to predicting the real completion date.", "But in this experiment, we\u2019re taking estimation skill entirely out of the picture. We\u2019re taking all skills out of the picture! We\u2019re guaranteeing the actual project length in minutes is known and constant. 2000 minutes. And yet, we can see, the error can be quite large anyway! Because there is inherent randomness in software development.", "When you roll a six-sided die, and you give an estimate of 3.5, and you end up rolling a 6, that doesn\u2019t mean you estimated poorly. You estimated perfectly, 3.5 really is the average expected value. There is just inherent randomness in the act of rolling a six-sided die. You should be blaming that inherent randomness.", "You can claim after the fact \u201cwell you should have known the die would bounce that way, I see no randomness, just ignorance\u201d, but similarly, you can claim \u201cwell you should have known the the project would go that route, I see no randomness, just ignorance\u201d. Both statements are equally unwise.", "Even the god of software development cannot guarantee the actual project length will match the expected project length. There is inherent randomness in software development. For many of the random variables, it is hard to prove that the randomness is innate and unremovable, although nearly any software developer knows the intense randomness exists. But the \u201cunpredictable schedule\u201d random variable is a really useful one to study, since it\u2019s so plainly visible, and so easy to show how much it affects project length.", "Estimation skill probably does exist, but it is only one of many random variables, and there is no reason to blame estimation skill any more than the other random variables, when a project\u2019s actual length differs from the estimated.", "\u2026On the other hand, sometimes people say \u201cestimation skill\u201d and they\u2019re actually talking about estimating the variance of the project length \u2014 estimating that right-end of the 95% confidence interval. I think that is more reasonable to talk about. We should all be studying and trying to get really good at understanding how much randomness there is in software development. That\u2019s exactly what this experiment is trying to do, after all! Getting a decent feel for how much one particular random variable can add variance to project length.", "(By the way, I suspect in general, most disagreements about \u201cestimating\u201d are really caused by the confusion between estimating the \u201caverage expected length\u201d and the \u201cright end of the 95% confidence interval\u201d. Every time you have a discussion with someone about estimating, I recommend you figure out if you\u2019re even talking about the same thing!)", "OK, the rest of this article is just more fun with these simulations, and eventually, moving slowly away from the realm of science.", "OK ,we used my schedule data to simulate a 10-day expected length project. \u2026Let\u2019s also try it on some other project lengths!", "Once again, those are ignoring all random variables except for my collected unpredictable schedule data.", "I like that 20-Day Project result: 3\u20135 weeks is an easy to remember range for a 4-week-expected-length project.", "Just for fun, let\u2019s try constructing some fake data for a developer with less variance in their schedule than me.", "To do it, I removed 70 of the more extreme data points from my 222 data points. I used no mathematical strategy, I simply tried to greatly reduce the thick left tail on the histogram, and make it look more like a bell curve shape. Here is a histogram of the fake data.", "Hopefully that looks reasonable enough. It much more resembles a bell curve than my real data, which almost looked like a uniform distribution (die roll).", "And now, let\u2019s do 1 million simulations of a 10-day project again, using the fake data that is more consistent. Here is the result:", "Here are some observations this time:", "So, sure enough, there\u2019s less variance, but more than I would have expected before starting this experiment.", "Keep in mind when looking at the graphs, that it\u2019s nearly impossible to have fewer than 2 bars. That\u2019s because, a \u201c10-Day Project\u201d as I\u2019ve defined it, is expected to take 10 full days on average. That\u2019s precisely on the border of Day 10 and Day 11. So even if there is only a tiny bit of variance, then half the runs would finish on Day 10, and the other half would finish on Day 11, probably.", "So really, if you think about the graphs long enough, you start to prefer to think about the 95% confidence intervals, perhaps.", "Remember, project length is affected by many random variables that cause variance, but all the above simulations in this entire article only consider the \u201cunpredictable schedule\u201d random variable.", "But just for fun, we can take a guess at how much the other random variables affect project length, and then run the simulation again and include that randomness!", "Let\u2019s identify some other random variables and invent how much they add/subtract to project length:", "So now, for each run, we\u2019ll still start with 2000 minutes (10 full days), but then we will compute the above random variable additions & subtractions and modify that 2000 minutes. Then we will actually simulate the day 1/2/3\u2026 of the project by sampling my schedule data, just like before.", "Many software developers recommend that if you are asked to choose a date and commit to it, on a project, then: you should take your estimate of the expected average length, and double it, and that\u2019s your commitment date. Looking at the above graph, that seems like a reasonably good call. Although, I think most developers tend to underestimate the expected average\u2026so those developers should probably triple it.", "Here are some important rules I used for recording data and choosing to include it in this experiment:", "Strictly speaking, to do a statistical study like this, each data point should be independent of the others. My data is probably not actually entirely independent \u2014 surely there are interruptions that recurred over multiple subsequent days. But, I think it\u2019s close enough, you can take a look at a scatter plot, to give it an eyeball test for independence:", "Pretty darn random.
