The interest to grasp on statistics also required to become a successful data scientist. You need to demonstrate your keen on this field of discipline.", "It is the subject that includes all features of learning from data. As a methodology, we speak about the means and methods to allow us to work with data and to understand that data. Statisticians employ and develop data analysis methods and continue exploring to understand their properties.", "When will those tools provide insight?When are they possibly misleading?", "Researchers across all various academic fields, workers in many industries, are implementing and reaching the statistical methodology, and they are providing new approaches and techniques for conducting data analysis. A concise terminology is needed upfront, which is the difference between a statistic and the field of statistics.", "We encounter numerical or graphical reports from a collection of data every day. For instance, the average of total students score on the final exam, the proportion of employed and unemployed workers in some countries, or maybe stocks prices fluctuation in a day. These are statistics.", "However, the field of statistics is an academic discipline focusing on research methodology. The essential aspects as statisticians are developing new statistical tools, calculating statistics from data, and collaborating with the specialists to interpret those results in proper ways.", "Statistics is undoubtedly an evolving field and continuously growing. Furthermore, it provides challenges and opportunities.", "In data science, numerous statistical methods\u2019 are under continual study to understand how to use it properly. Lots of new application areas are available, and those areas are leading to the necessity to develop innovative analytical methods. For example, an idea of how to measure the data, and new types of methods available leads to new kinds of data that need analysis. Hence, we are often relying on those advances in computing, not only enabling us to do data analysis but also a more sophisticated analysis of the large volume of data collected.", "Statistics is a significant discipline, especially for data scientists and there are numerous schools thought about the field of statistics. It is including brand-new ideas from theory, practical, and relevant fields.", "Data can be terrifying because there is a condition to understand that data, which generally involves reducing and summarizing. The main goal of the data reduction is to make the dataset comprehensible to the human observer. Statisticians have different techniques for summarizing that data, which is required to achieve the goals for the data to be meaningful. Therefore, a statistician is well trained in using appropriate, precise, and effective methods for summarizing data.", "Data can be misleading. The primary purpose of developing the statistics fields is to get a structure and framework for evaluating data. Generally, insights from data are not 100% accurate, but it\u2019s absurd that we have a way to quantify how far away reported findings may be from the truth. Some evaluation reports return with a margin of error. This margin of error gives an idea of what that possible variance will be between the published and the actual cases of public opinion.", "Understanding data is critical, leads to the need to be able to work on what we\u2019ve discovered. There are some domains of statistics where that idea of decision-making is the ultimate goal of any statistical analysis. In the personal and professional journey, we are making decisions in the face of difficulty. We have to compare what are the costs and the benefits of the different approaches.", "For example, if a person finds that they might be at higher than average risk for a specific type of cancer, should they undergo a preventative procedure? Statistics can help in the decision-making process.", "When we summarize data, commonly, our primary focus is on typical or central value. This means we have to place a high emphasis on understanding variation in data from a statistics perspective. For instance, if you know that on average Americans have around $8,000 of credit card bills each month, you have a good idea of that central value for credit card debt distribution. If you are provided that about 10 per cent more, that percentile gives you a bit more information about the variability in credit card debt.", "The fundamental responsibilities in statistics are forecasting or prediction. You don\u2019t know the future with absolute certainty. Still, if you have effectively used the available data, it sometimes makes reasonably accurate predictions, such as weather predictions, stock market prices forecasting, and predicting the risk of a flood. Furthermore, trying to calculate future requests for the new product distribute to the market or predicting the outcome of an election.", "Let\u2019s say that you are collecting lots of data. Some of those variables are measured, and some of those can be measured with pretty high accuracy. A person\u2019s age or height, and some variables are a little bit more challenging to measure. For instance, blood pressure varies minute to minute, so that\u2019s a little bit more difficult to pin down. Also, there are those constructs such as mood, personality, and political ideology, which are much more difficult to define and quantify. Statistics play a significant role in constructing and evaluating useful approaches for measuring these difficulties in identifying concepts and assessing the quality of the various methods.", "Finally, statistics are the basis for principled data collection. Sometimes data can be costly and painful to collect. Resources restrict how much data can be obtained, which means if we have too little data, the findings will not be maximized. However, statistics provide an excellent way to manage this trade-off. You can get more data while knowing and allowing those resource limitations.", "Back in ancient times, civilizations have been gathering data on harvests and population sizes. Right now, randomness and variation can be more mathematically defined. Modern statistics developed in the 19th century, coming from addressing topics from genetics, econometrics, and statistical theory progress in the 20th century with many new application areas in science and industry. For example, the appearance of the ability to have computers to do the data analysis. Next, the rise of Big Data, massive data, data science, and machine learning.", "Statistics positively has a lot of intersections with it\u2019s allied fields.", "Computer science provides us with the algorithms, the structures for working with data, and the programming languages for manipulating that data. In mathematics, we get the language and the figures for showing some of these statistical concepts more concisely, and the tools to evaluate and interpret the properties of those analytical methods.", "One branch of mathematics is probability theory, a critical part of the foundation of statistics that allows us to reveal the ideas of randomness and uncertainty.", "Then data science, which gives us the database management and machine learning, which infrastructure able to carry out data analysis.", "Statistics have evolved from a small to be a significant allied in research and industry. Numerous different applications include computer vision, self-driving cars, facial recognition, recommender systems for online searching, and online purchasing.", "In the health domain, we have predictive and analytics, precision medicine, fraud detection, risk assessment in environment and infrastructure, social and government services in terms of job training, and behavioural therapy. Statistics and statistical thinking help us to understand that data and that information that surrounds us.", "Wie Kiang is a researcher who is responsible for collecting, organizing, and analyzing opinions and data to solve problems, explore issues, and predict trends.", "He is working in almost every sector of Machine Learning and Deep Learning. He is carrying out experiments and investigations in a range of areas, including Convolutional Neural Networks, Natural Language Processing, and Recurrent Neural Networks.", "Your home for data science.
