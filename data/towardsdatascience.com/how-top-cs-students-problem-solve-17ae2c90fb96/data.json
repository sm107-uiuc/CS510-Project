Underpinning the next two sections is a clear ability to build conceptual maps. I know I am a fairly idea-centric lecturer, and these students don\u2019t miss a beat. The raw compute power is impressive.", "I\u2019ll tell this story with a running multi-agent learning contest, where we wanted to optimally solve new Pac-man puzzles. This is designed to be a small amount of extra credit for above and beyond students, but it ended up giving great insight into what the top minds are doing. The scoring was as follows:", "I\u2019ve heard so many stories about how hard undergrads at UC Berkeley work, but it\u2019s hard to know what that means or how it translates into practical productivity without examples.", "A student who got second place in the Pac-man contest ultimately ran a brute force bash script overnight to create a feedback loop over the random seeds and upload new solutions to the test case we were trying (poorly) to keep hidden. The reason the student wasn\u2019t disqualified: he documented his approach and we had not created a rule against this. A new feature of the contests is averaging over multiple seeds (obvious to scientists, yes) so that the signal returned from the contest is not as direct.", "Below is a summary of the \u2018wow\u2019 contest submission, it seemed like the student may have used some shady practices to hard-code solutions (hard coding will remove the computation time penalty on score), but they set up a minor class competition as a serious engineering problem. Here\u2019s how in some of his own words:", "There are some serious insights in this process, combined with the force of will and motivation to get it done. So what it takes to be a top student at a top CS university is the ability and the will the walk oneself through this kind of rigorous implementation. I would not say I have that level of fine tuning \u2014 maybe that\u2019s why I am a graduate student and not a software engineer.", "The brute force solution is all about building a better toolkit, but ultimately the student lost to a clever solution that is from one stroke of genius.", "The top scorer in a class of 900 students was the one that made a change to the problem setting that made their score so much higher (10% margin). In a game penalizing extra actions, this student made 3 of the agents take no actions, and solved the game with one search agent.", "This is the other half of the equation to brute force engineering. It\u2019s the stroke of insight that seems simple post-hoc, but so few have.", "The best students find the ways to win, and often result in the rules of the future. As course staff, the detail is impressive. This is the kind of effort that gets products out the door, and I strongly stand by these students\u2019 scores. It\u2019s not a requirement to be successful to have these types of effort and insights, but they can take you very far.", "I choose to define my own success on how I perform, so I don\u2019t worry about trying to replicate any crazy win like this. You can have a great career through consistency and enjoyment, but it\u2019s fun to see how some of the best minds break problems down.", "I completed my undergrad almost 3 years ago at Cornell University, and it was almost 6 years before I was really trying to make a name for myself in my first competitive engineering classes. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s just a change of perspective, but I have been impressed by the students. I\u2019m sure they\u2019ll be rewarded for their hard work.", "More thoughts on lecturing can be found here.", "More?
