Visualization fundamentally serves 4 purposes in data science, in understanding:", "Various ways you can identify and communicate that hidden information and there are tools to do exactly that. Regardless of which programming language you choose, each language has libraries to handle data visualization efficiently.", "If you are in Python you have several options, but I\u2019ve found seaborn to be best in town. Not because seaborn can do something that other libraries cann\u2019t, but because of its simplicity and intuitive code structure.", "So the purpose of this article is to demonstrate some use cases of Seaborn with code snippets. My learning/teaching philosophy is to start with a problem and then find tools that can solve it. So I am not going to show everything under the sun, rather give an intuition on how Seaborn works and how to solve the 4 categories of problems I just mentioned.", "seaborn comes with 17 built-in datasets. That means you don\u2019t have to spend a whole lot of your time finding the right dataset and cleaning it up to make Seaborn-ready; rather you will focus on the core features of Seaborn visualization techniques to solve problems.", "First, let\u2019s take a look at the datasets.", "If you are in data science for some time you\u2019ll recognize many of them just by their names (titanic? iris?). Otherwise, just load the dataset and call the head() function to take a peek into the data.", "I\u2019m going to use a few of those datasets to show different kinds of visualization techniques, so I\u2019m loading them all in. If you know what each dataset is about that\u2019s great, otherwise don\u2019t bother. Just know that each dataset contains variables of different kinds; some of them are discrete variables (e.g. 10, 20 , 30 miles/gallon), some are continuous (e.g. 5.2, 3.6 petal length) and some are categorical (e.g. days of the week). Knowing just different variable types and when to use them should work for now.", "Our first kind of problem is to understand the distribution of data. By distribution I mean few things: frequency distribution, probability distribution or just spread of the data with respect to central values (mean, median etc).", "Let\u2019s say we have a dataset containing 1000 cars and their fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg). A histogram will tell us the frequency distribution of the number of cars in each mpg category.", "There is a more sophisticated version of this frequency distribution used in statistics called the probability distribution. You can plot that as well.", "There is another kind of distribution \u2014 better known as spread\u2014 which shows how a variable is dispersed/spread with respect to its central tendency.", "Boxplot is best known to demonstrate the dispersion of a variable with values such as the median, the minimum, the maximum and the outliers \u2014 all in the same plot.", "Kids grow taller with age \u2014 that\u2019s a relationship between two variables: height and age.", "The bigger the house, the higher the price \u2014 that\u2019s another kind of relationship between the variables: floor size and price.", "Relational plots display how variables are associated with each other.", "Visualization can examine and plot the association between variables. For continuous variables, you can pretty much visualize anything in a scatterplot and visually determine the relationship between them.", "You can see from the scatterplot below that in Iris flowers high petal length is positively associated with sepal length.", "If you are having trouble visually figuring out the relationship, there\u2019s another option \u2014 drawing a trend line.", "The trend line below is applied to the same data as the previous one in the scatter plot. Which one you want to use depends on your needs, but there are tradeoffs. In the scatterplot, you see the variability of every single data point in a two-dimensional space, but not easy to track the trend.", "In a trend plot \u2014 created based on a linear model \u2014 you can identify the overall trend in data along with confidence intervals, but you lose individual data points (but of course you can display points in trend plots as well).", "The comparative analysis is key to many business decisions. Which product is selling better \u2014 product A or product B? Is there a significant difference between the two drugs in their effectiveness? These kinds of questions are asked all the time all across the decision-making landscape.", "Bar charts are some of the simplest and old school yet effective visualization techniques to communicate comparative analysis. The figure below presents the total restaurant bills paid by customers on different days of the week. So this visual compares total bills between weekdays.", "Line charts are another way to compare data. It\u2019s commonly used in time series analysis where the temporal evolution of two sets of observations is compared.", "The final pillar of data visualization is composition. The purpose of composition charts is to show the composition of one or more variables in absolute and relative terms (e.g. percentage).", "Composition charts are a bit complicated to create in Seaborn, it\u2019s not a one-liner code like the others. So bear with me as I give two examples below.", "Stacked charts show the composition of a variable with different categories in a single bar. For example, a bar showing total car crashes in the state of Alabama, which is also disaggregated by crashes that involved alcohol (see the figure below).", "Stacked area charts display the changes in values of different groups of observation in the same plot area. In this case, the values are \u201cstacked\u201d on top of each other.", "Seaborn\u2019s built-in datasets and codes are not quite useful to display stacked area charts, so we are going to create a simple dataset and display a \u201cSeaborn-style\u201d graph using matplotlib library.", "The purpose of this article was to demonstrate some visualization techniques using the Python library seaborn. I wanted to cover two things \u2014 introduce different kinds of visualizations you will typically encounter in data science and second, some code snippets using Seaborn\u2019s built-in datasets.
