The shocking video published on the Internet showing how events happened brought people around the world to the streets to demand the end of racism and appropriate police conducts. With that in mind I decided to find more data on how Brazil is related to these topics and found this publication from BBC, showing a record in killings by police officers in the state of Rio de Janeiro in 2019.", "Rio de Janeiro is famous for being one of the most beautiful places of the world. Unfortunately it is also known as a really violent city, with high criminality rates and public safety issues.", "In BBC\u2019s article it is possible to read about a \u201cpolicy of confrontation\u201d that was implemented by the safety agencies in the past to help in the reduction of homicide rates.", "So I decided to look by myself to the whole violence numbers in the state of Rio de Janeiro and see if the increase in killings by police officers reflected in an actual reduction of violent crime rate.", "I will focus the study in more violent crimes that need a closer look from the authorities: rape, kidnapping and civilian deaths in any criminal situation. The study will consist of an analysis of the time series trends, a correlation verification and time series forecasting. The variables are described below.", "After the proper pre-processing the time series can be plotted in charts for an initial verification. Since data was not collected for all variables since 1991 some straight lines will be visible in some of the charts.", "It is possible to get some information from the time series of these variables:", "Interested on that I did a quick search on the Internet about public safety in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, and remembered an important fact: That was the year of the Olympic Games in the city. Many publications such as this one in Reuters discuss how badly the investments were done in safety measures, and that they were just enough to hide the violence during the games. Once the games ended, the resources were significantly reduced, and with that the violent crimes came back again. This is a possible theory for the numbers in this series.", "But the deaths were reducing since 2007, so the investment for the Olympics is only part of the story. What is interesting is that from 2007 until 2013 the death rates on violent crimes reduced with a reduction of killings by police officers. A more detailed investigation in the history of safety policies from 2007 until 2013 can help to develop new ideas and improve the fight against crime.", "Now letting the month to month variation aside the long term trends per year can be better understood. The graph below shows the total cases per year of each variable in the study.", "Among victims of rape, kidnapping and murders there are more than 10000 people impacted directly by the violence in Rio de Janeiro every year. Daily that represents more than 27 people going through events that will end their life or change it severely in a single state of Brazil. That doesn\u2019t include robberies, injuries and the psychological impacts that this situation also brings along.", "In the first chart we can also see the increase in people killed in police actions from 416 in 2013 to 1814 in 2019. It increased to 4.36 times in 6 years. However the trends of violent crimes are not descendent within this timeframe. The numbers in 2019 are pretty much the same ones achieved in 2013.", "So, I decided to look at correlation among the variables. If there is any sign that a change in one of them can reflect in the others I would see it in a correlation matrix.", "The strongest correlation in the table is among deaths and years, which is a sign that the total deaths in criminal events are reducing with time. But this correlation is an analysis involving the entire dataset, from 1991 until 2019, so this has no strict relationship with the last couple years. When we look at killings by police officers, there are no signs of strong correlation with any of the changes in crime rates.", "Then I decided to use the existing data to see the trend of these numbers for the next years. For the prediction I used only the rates registered after 2012, when the policy of confrontation started. I also tested the time series stationarity using an Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test to make sure that the model would be representative. After doing some transformations of the dataset I applied an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to the killings by police officers and plotted it in the graph.", "The model seems to predict well the results, and does not show signs of slope change for the next years. That means that, if no significant action is taken to change the way public safety is done in Rio de Janeiro, probably more and more people will be killed in police actions the next years.", "The objective of the study was to understand if the \u201cpolicy of confrontation\u201d being implemented in the state of Rio de Janeiro in the last years is helping in crime rate reduction. After a brief analysis the numbers of violent crimes in the state of Rio de Janeiro we can come up with a couple questions and conclusions:", "The public safety problem involves hundreds of variables and solutions involve huge efforts not only from public safety agencies but from the government as a whole. The purpose of this analysis is to extend the discussion from BBC\u2019s article with some additional data, and maybe raise new theories that can be further investigated in our path to a more equal and peaceful society. There are many other analysis that can be done using the datasets available, so I encourage people and organisations to do that and bring relevant information to people. In a generation where personal opinions of individuals can reach hundreds of thousands of people I really believe we must look beneath the surface and rely on data to solve problems of our society.", "If you want more details on the analysis you can check the full study in my GitHub. I'll be posting some really nice articles in the following weeks, if you liked this one please check my Medium or LinkedIn profiles! Thank you for reading!", "Your home for data science.
