This improves the ability for neural networks to learn from a textual dataset.", "Before word embeddings were de facto standard for natural language processing, a common approach to deal with words was to use a one-hot vectorisation. Each word represents a column in the vector space, and each sentence is a vector of ones and zeros. Ones denote the presence of the word in the sentence.", "As a result, this leads to a huge and sparse representation, because there are many more zeros than ones. When there are many words in a vocabulary, it creates a large word vector. This might become a problem for machine learning algorithms.", "One-hot vectorisation also fails to capture the meaning of words. For example, \u201cdrink\u201d and \u201cbeverage\u201d, even though these are two different words, they have a similar definition.", "With word embeddings, semantically similar words have similar vectors representation.

It is designed for higher accuracy, but the encoding requires more memory and computational time. This is useful for sentiment classification where words like \u2018not\u2019 can change the meaning and able to handle double negation like \u201cnot bad\u201d.", "Deep Averaging Network, the embedding of words are first averaged together and then passed through a feedforward deep neural network to produce sentence embeddings. Unfortunately, by averaging the vectors, we lose the context of the sentence and sequence of words in the sentence in the process.
