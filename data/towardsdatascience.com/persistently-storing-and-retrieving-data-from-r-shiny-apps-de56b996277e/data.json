However, due to some personal and professional reasons, I decided to undertake the project of \u201cCreating a centralized platform for my university exam resources\u201d in R Shiny and here in this article, I\u2019ll share the solution to the biggest hurdle you might face in file handling using R Shiny.", "Whenever you are dealing with persistent data storage in R Shiny apps, you are bound to come across articles by Dean Attali, especially this article. This article, covers a wide variety of possible scenarios for you. I, however, was left wanting for more, as it still did not align with my requirements.", "What I wanted was the functionality for users to upload any number of files and then for every other users to be able to download those files.", "When you work with R Shiny, you would across the functions fileInput() and the downloadHandler(). These functions can only help you to work with temporary files (files that will remain as long as the \u201csession\u201d is not changed). To persistently store the data, I tried exporting the \u201ctemporary\u201d uploaded file to a \u201cDropBox\u201d profile with the help of \u201crdrop2\u201d, but this process was painfully slow. Also since I was dealing with PDF files, connecting MongoDB servers or MySQL servers was not a viable option.", "This whole ordeal made one thing painfully clear for me. Remote storage could not be used for my project and local storage was the way to go.", "So, if you look into the available resources on the internet, the closest you\u2019d come to accomplishing this is by following Dean\u2019s example here. But, here again, he is simply using the function write.csv() and providing the local storage path name in the path parameter of the function. This still leaves us to figure out how do you \u201cwrite\u201d a PDF file to a specific location (www folder) in your local storage.", "I searched online for R packages that deal with PDFs and I came across the packages \u201cpdftools\u201d and \u201cqpdf\u201d . Since \u201cqpdf\u201d was a requirement of the \u201cpdftools\u201d package, I decided to only install the \u201cpdftools\u201d package. Unfortunately, this function too did not provide us the functionality to \u201cwrite a PDF\u201d onto a given file path. The functions \u201cpdftools\u201d provided are listed below.", "The functions provided by the \u201cqpdf\u201d package are as follows.", "Amongst these functions, what caught my eye was the function pdf_subset() , because it had a parameter called \u201coutput\u201d. So, it could potentially mean to store a subset of a particular PDF file in the specified file path by means of the output parameter. The \u201cpages\u201d parameter was specified using the above mentioned pdf_info() function (pdf_info$pages to be more specific).", "And, VOILA!!! This little experiment of mine worked and I attained the functionality that I wanted to. Here\u2019s a code snippet from my actual deployed app highlighting how I managed the upload part in my app.", "Now, after the files were being uploaded successfully, I needed a way to actually be able to download resources from my local storage using R Shiny. For this too, I searched far and wide, read the official docs, but to no avail. After tinkering around with all available options and a voracious reading for relevant materials over the internet, I got a little hint from this Stack Overflow answer. Therefore, I used the file.copy() function and converted the \u201cfilename\u201d and \u201ccontent\u201d parameters to function to accomplish my task.", "Here\u2019s a code snippet from my actual deployed app that showcases how I handled the download part of my app.", "So, we have actually been able to accomplish what we set out to do. It sure is euphoric when you solve a problem, isn\u2019t it!!", "I seriously felt like punching my screen many times when I was solving this problem, hence I wrote this article so that it may save a precious life or at least a precious monitor \ud83d\ude1c", "One thing to note here, is that, at the point of writing, https://www.shinyapps.io/ does not provide the facility of a local storage (at least, not in their free tier). So, you\u2019ll have to set up your own R server on the cloud service provider of your choice if you want to reap the benefits of local storage.", "You could also buy me a coffee to support my work.", "Your home for data science.
