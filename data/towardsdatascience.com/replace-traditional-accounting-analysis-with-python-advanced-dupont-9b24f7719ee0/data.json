But now what? When you do any sort of business valuation and financial analysis, most of the features from our Data Frames are important indicators. They are all publicly available and audited information which ultimately determines the stock price movement. Managements want them to look good, so they often times manipulate them and make sure the number is meeting the public expectation.", "Now, this is where data science and your domain knowledge come in. You need to understand what the features mean in order to interpret the accounting ratios. This often requires a few college accounting classes. You might have learned some ratios such as EPS, profit margin, quick ratio, etc. Today I am going to focus on Return on Equity, the profitability of a business in relation to equity.", "Return on Equity = Net Income / Equity", "Before doing any numerical manipulation, we need to clean up the data. Here are our objectives:", "I am not getting into too much details on cleaning the data since it is another topic, but feel free to check out this function I wrote. They make more sense when you are actually examing the DataFrame. You can ignore it for now.", "The simple Dupont model decomposes Return on Equity (ROE) into 3 parts", "Return On Equity = (Net Income / Sales) * (Sales / Total Assets) * (Total Assets / Shareholder\u2019s Equity)", "The first component focuses on operational performance: how much net income does each sale generate. The second measures the efficiency of a company\u2019s use of its assets in generating sales revenue. The third focuses on equity management: How many assets do you generate per share.", "However, if you look carefully at what is going on under the hood, you will notice that those components are very noisy. For example, net income is comprised of financial expenses, which means an operational KPI is combined with an investment KPI. Second, what kind of asset best reflects the overall operating picture? We want to look at assets placed on the operation side that can generate sales.", "Now you might ask, why do we focus on operation? Why don\u2019t we account for the investment side and the finance side? We do have cash inflow from investment and lending money. Well, it depends on the industry and business model. Generally, cash flow from operation is the blood of a business. Everything else are just the support.", "Return On Equity = Return on Net Operating Asset + Financial Leverage * Spread", "The idea of the above formula is that we want to separate the operation and finance components. 1. We want to know how much return of one share of equity generates. Okay, we now look at the return from the assets that are in operation, which is basically the net income added back to the financial expense like interest (Because it is from the investment side, which is an unstable and unreliable indicator) and minority interest(things that don\u2019t actually belong to your share of common equity).", "2. Okay, now for the financial leverage part. I bought a share of yours, but how much of that share do you use for paying the financial obligation? With that, how much of that financial obligation actually generates profit after deducting the cost.", "Don\u2019t be intimidated by the unfamiliar formula, I will do a breakdown below. Everything will become clear once you understand the logic flow.", "Return on Net Operating Asset = Net Operating Margin * Net Operating Asset Turnover", "Net Operating Margin = (Net Income + Net Financial Expense)/Net Sales", "Net Operating Asset Turnover = Net Sales/Average Asset", "Financial Leverage = Average Net Financial Obligation/ Average Common Equity", "Net Borrowing Cost = Net Financial Expense/ Average Net Financial Obligation", "Net Financial Obligation = Total Debt + Minority Interest + preferred stocks", "Net Financial Expense = Net Interest Expense * (1- Tax Rate) + preferred dividend + Minority Interest in Earning", "Spread = Return on Net Operating Asset - Net Borrowing Cost", "Here I created a new DataFrame to contain all ratio calculations to arrive at the final Return on Equity. To make it clearer, I highlighted the important ones in bold.", "Next, I found out what the effective tax rate is.", "Then I subtract the financial components from the operating components. Remember, we want to take back the portion from our taxes.", "Here I used average point in time between this year and last year to get a better representation of the underlying values of total liabilities and equity.", "Here is the final ROE ratio.", "Here are our new DataFrame and some simple data visualization.", "You notice that there is a lot of NaN values, this is just because I used the average in my calculation and we don\u2019t have the 2015 data. If you have more data and analyze it by quarters or months, you will see a more sophisticated datafame.", "Your home for data science.
