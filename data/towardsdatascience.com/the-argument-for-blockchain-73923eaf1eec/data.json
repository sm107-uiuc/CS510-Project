Since all transactions that ever happen are recorded, it\u2019s supposed to be easy enough to find all transactions related to some piece of information you want to know about.", "The second is immutability. We\u2019re not supposed to be able to change any data previously entered.", "The third is security. We love to present examples of big networks with so many peer nodes running that no hacker could ever take them down.", "These ideas sound great on paper right? You can certainly take them to your upper level management and convince them it\u2019s a great idea. Then they might start asking what an implementation would look like and ask for a high level development plan as well as some sound facts on how it would benefit the company.", "In order to truly make use of blockchain technology as we know it, it usually requires integration with other systems (particularly with other companies\u2019 systems) to make good use of data available.", "For example, I work in the insurance industry. If we created a chain for customer data, it wouldn\u2019t look too much different than the multiple systems currently integrated to handle the same thing. As in, it handles all the same data, we just can\u2019t get rid of any.", "If we made a combined system with our physician network and hospital network as well as our current in house system, this is where the transparency of blockchain makes itself useful. It fills in the gaps of what we know about our customers. It makes their health data more widely available rather than siloed.", "Trust me, it\u2019s a good thing, I\u2019ll give you a couple cases.", "As I\u2019m sure at least some amount of people know, it\u2019s not unknown for a drug addict to visit a hospital seeking to gain a prescription for medication they\u2019re addicted to by fraudulent means. They go in faking some pain, convince some doctor they need meds for pain management, and go on their way to feed their habit.", "Now, wouldn\u2019t it be much more helpful if hospitals and physicians had a shared system so they couldn\u2019t fool the system into letting them stay addicted? The answer is generally yes, yes it would.", "In today\u2019s world, it also isn\u2019t uncommon for people to arrive in emergency rooms, unable to speak and having no one to speak for them that they have chronic conditions or drug allergies. If they require surgery, or are going to be given some drug in order to help, most hospitals won\u2019t readily have this information that can mean life or death for a patient.", "If we had this fabled shared system, it could mean saving more lives.", "This is an example of where blockchain has shined. One example is outlined here. It\u2019s a case study of how Walmart uses blockchain to trace food back to its suppliers in the case of food-borne disease outbreaks. While it certainly doesn\u2019t cover all their suppliers, it\u2019s a small example of how data transparency is supposed to work.", "Proprietary data is always held sacred. It\u2019s like the bible before the printing press.", "Their idea is that without being the sole accessors to the data, the power of it is suddenly lost. That sharing the data means they\u2019re letting money walk out the door.", "In our capitalistic society, we focus heavily on the idea of scarcity. Meaning we need to hold onto the resources we have because we might not be able to get more of them. We don\u2019t want to share our data because if we don\u2019t gate keep it, we no longer have power or control over that resource. Which also means that resource is no longer ours.", "I\u2019m not going to argue that it\u2019s not true, because it partially is true. While we would still control who has access to the system, when they\u2019re in the system, we are no longer the sole accessors of such data.", "If we can form a more holistic data pool, not just in insurance, wouldn\u2019t it be easier to perform different analyses and not have to fill in holes? Would it further research faster? Probably.", "Your home for data science.
