The primary culprit: valid and real security concerns. Despite this, the business benefits of AI/ML are overwhelming, and the demand for AI/ML is seemingly insatiable.", "But AI/ML\u2019s unrelenting demand for data, much of it sensitive, has heightened the concern over data security. And, unfortunately, older security approaches appear to not work very well. The recent data breach from Capital One and data leak from Desjardins Group seem to have reinforced this point.", "And this has put enterprises in a bind. Euphemistically, an unstoppable force (business demand) has met an immovable object (enterprise security veto).", "Enterprises, however, are fighting back, introducing new techniques such as identity-based security which have been able to address a number of the security issues. But more needs to be done.", "In this article I will describe a \u201czero trust\u201d and \u201czero leakage\u201d security approach that build upon techniques such as identity-based security to provide additional \u2014 perhaps necessary \u2014 capabilities that protect the sensitive data that AI/ML thrives upon. And by adopting a \u201czero trust\u201d and \u201czero leakage\u201d security approach, enterprise\u2019s stand a good chance of once again accelerating the adoption of AI/ML on the cloud.", "Today, AI/ML is stretching the capabilities of internal data centers. Simply put, they don\u2019t have the computing resources (for example, GPU farms, on-demand capacity, etc.) required by AI/ML.", "Unsurprisingly, many enterprises have now concluded that a more scalable, on-demand, and cost-effective solution is available through the cloud. The journey towards cloud-native AI/ML was underway.", "Or so it seemed. The early adopters \u2014 those enterprises that now have some practical experience with AI/ML on the cloud \u2014 have raised valid and serious security concerns. Some have even had quite public and negative experiences (for example, Capital One and Desjardins Group).", "These concerns, unfortunately, have put a halt to previously grand ambitions to widescale enterprise use of cloud-native AI/ML.", "Enterprise security has until recently been focussed on ensuring that a secure network perimeter surrounded the enterprise data center. At the time this made sense since most of applications and assets worked almost exclusively within the data center. Plus, it made it much easier to manage from an application development, operations, and security management perspective. A so-called win-win scenario.", "Unfortunately, the default assumption \u2014 that these old techniques would apply in the future \u2014 has proven to be woefully incorrect. More specifically, the older network-perimeter based security approaches do not work for the cloud. Recent data breaches and leaks echo this fact. What went wrong?", "Three critical issues undermined this assumption.", "Firstly, enemies today are smarter and are acquiring better tools causing network perimeters to become even more become porous. Uber\u2019s recent data breach on the cloud certainly demonstrated this to be the case.", "Second, errors can be made in securing and enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy. And, unfortunately, all it takes is a single configuration error resulting in a compromised endpoint to open a wide swath of the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy. It seems that even the best and most experience cloud teams are hostage entropy \u2014 that security configurations do inevitably drift over time and will, inevitably, lead to breaches. Perhaps Capital One\u2019s recent experience on the cloud is the most poignant example of this occurrence.", "Lastly, the very nature of the cloud also creates a security issue: by default, many resources are designed to be \u201copen\u201d, or accessible via the internet upon their creation. This requires that enterprise security teams provide security to a much larger array of cloud components, and, unfortunately, all it takes is one error to cause a potentially catastrophic data breach.", "In this light, modern cloud security approaches should now, arguably, be designed under the explicit assumption that the network perimeter can be breached.", "There are several primary concepts that are the foundations of a secure enterprise cloud tenancy.", "First, a \u201czero trust\u201d security approach dictates that nothing is accessible within an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy unless explicit authentication and authorization is provided. This approach is tightly integrated with (and probably cannot be done without) an identity-based security approach.", "Second, \u201czero leakage\u201d policy where data cannot be transported in any unauthorized fashion, either accidentally or intentionally, outside of the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy. This addresses two situations: first, it stops unauthorized hackers that do get in from getting anything out; and, second, it stops employees that are authorized to access sensitive data from accidentally or maliciously allowing data to exfiltrate the enterprise cloud tenancy.", "Zero Trust is a security approach based upon two premises: \u201cnever trust\u201d and \u201calways verify\u201d. The first, \u201cnever trust\u201d, dictates that, by default, nothing is accessible within an enterprise\u2019s security perimeter (in our case, the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy). The second, \u201calways verify\u201d, dictates that only those with explicitly verified credentials are permitted to access resources.", "Zero Trust architectures applied to the cloud use identity and associated credentials combined with device claims/information (for example, IP address) to authenticate users and verify authorizations prior to providing access to data and applications in an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy.", "For AI/ML, Zero Trust ensures that sensitive data residing on the cloud can only be accessed by data scientists that are both authenticated and authorized to access and work with critical sensitive data. Recognizing that valid security concerns are major obstacles to AI/ML cloud adoption on the cloud, implementing this capability forms the basis for once again accelerating cloud AI/ML initiatives.", "As is typically the case, no security control stands in isolation: \u201czero trust\u201d is best implemented using a number of complementary techniques. Below are a number of considerations that are used to implement a holistic \u201czero trust\u201d solution:", "The cloud\u2019s relative scalability and computing capability clearly has its benefits. And AI/ML voracious data needs and commensurate need for computing capacity is an ideal match for the cloud.", "But the cloud has been also designed with \u201copenness\u201d in mind. Resources are by default accessible via the internet. And where safeguards have been put in place, hackers are now equipped with more tools to create cracks in any of those safeguards. Clearly, without appropriate diligence, this openness can also become a security exposure.", "And while AI/ML is the ideal candidate for cloud, its voracious appetite for data, much of which is typically very sensitive, cannot under any circumstances \u2014 accidental or intentional \u2014 leave the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy.", "So, how can and enterprise ensure that data does not escape the enterprise\u2019s boundary by virtue of a malicious employee, or perhaps an unintentional accident?", "Now, as highlighted earlier, identity-based security, and a \u201czero trust\u201d policy go a long way to securing resources.", "But as it relates to eliminating data leakage, the first and most obvious starting point is to address basic cloud data hygiene. The following recommendations serve as a starting point in this regard:", "But this alone, does not stop \u201cleakage\u201d, or more specifically, data exfiltration outside approved enterprise boundaries.", "Consider a practical and real scenario that must be addressed: What happens when an authorized employee, say a data scientist, who has access to very sensitive data is determined to illegally share that data? It does happen, and perhaps more often than we may be aware.", "The most obvious solution may be to lock down the employee\u2019s device (laptop or desktop, for example). Perhaps the device USB and external devices are locked down. And to stop any network-based transmission of data, perhaps the devices network access is curtailed. Suffice to say that this approach may work, but it is quite complicated to execute and even more difficult to manage across a large enterprise user base.", "A better and simpler opportunity is to use a \u201csecure portal\u201d. This \u201csecure portal\u201d is the equivalent of a browser window that has access to the cloud tenancy but has specific capabilities disabled (typically the ability to \u201ccut-paste\u201d and download) that permit data movement. In effect, the \u201csecure portal\u201d acts as a secure viewport to access the cloud tenancy.", "For data scientists and their organization, this offers the best of both worlds: Not only a relatively fully featured viewport to access cloud-native AI/ML capability (almost all of the cloud capabilities can be accessed this way) but also a mechanism to guaranteed to eliminate data leakage.", "These \u201csecure portal\u201d capabilities are quite commonplace and are offered by a number of vendors: Citrix has a number of products that support this, as do Microsoft (Remote Desktop), and VMWare (Horizon).", "The business benefits of AI/ML are overwhelming, and the demand for AI/ML is seemingly insatiable. But evidence is mounting that enterprise AI/ML on the cloud is stalling. And valid and real security concerns are the primary culprits.", "Unfortunately, older security approaches appear to not work very well.", "Hence, this is the catalyst for new security approaches. Identity-base security, for example, is promising to address some of these concerns are now gaining a foothold in enterprises. But enterprises are realizing that more needs to be done.", "Which is where \u201czero trust\u201d and \u201czero leakage\u201d come in. Evidence is mounting that Zero Trust and Zero Leakage strategies go a long way to addressing many of the remaining security concerns.", "In fact, \u201czero trust\u201d and \u201czero leakage\u201d strategies are now viewed as not just a prerequisite but perhaps also the catalyst for changing enterprises\u2019 traditionally cautious security posture allowing enterprise AI/ML adoption on the cloud to once again accelerate.", "Your home for data science.
