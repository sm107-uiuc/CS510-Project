You\u2019re overloaded with information, right? Speed \u200b\u200band noise are two characteristics that define our world today and that makes it increasingly difficult for me to get YOUR ATTENTION.", "Social networks, saturation of news, some fake ones, others not that much, emails, messages, \u2026 all of this continually consumes us. Don\u2019t you think it is magical that despite that, companies are able to communicate with us and capture a small part of our attention?", "Let\u2019s talk about AI in Marketing as the enabler to identify potential leads, hyperpersonalize offers and communication, as well as adapt the text and language used in each of the messages contained in company campaigns according to attributes such as age, personal situation or preference of customers.", "If you want to learn more, go visit oscargarciaramos.com", "Have you heard about clustering or customer segmentation? What about proactive identification of common consumption patterns? Typical, right?", "The right ad, with the right message and offer, placed at the right time in the right channel focused on the right audience.", "However, how much do companies spend on advertising?", "What do we want to know? How much should the advertiser spend on each of their campaigns.", "In other words, we want to determine the optimal cost, timing and means to carry out advertising campaigns.", "Nowadays, AI systems can help us identify the channel, the message and even adjust the advertising investment plans for each of our advertising campaigns, analyzing their performance and continuously monitoring the different communication channels. And not only that \u2026 Thanks to AI we can track not only the performance of an advertiser\u2019s campaigns, but also their competition.", "It is what we call \u201csituational awareness\u201d. As markets evolve and constantly change their patterns, AI-based systems can adjust ad spending by milliseconds by changing advertising content and communication channels.", "There are techniques called MMM (Marketing Mix Modeling) that allow us to quantify the impact of different marketing inputs on Sales or Market share. Thanks to MMM we are able to know the contribution of each of these variables or marketing inputs in sales and what is the estimated investment that we must dedicate to each of them.", "This technique is based, among others, on ML & AI algorithms such as Multi-Linear Regression. Our dependent variable may be Sales or Market Share, while our independent variables may be distribution, pricing, spending on paper advertising, TV spending, website visitors or promotional spending, among many others.", "Some of these variables do not necessarily have a linear relationship with sales, such as TVspending, that is, they are not directly proportional to the increase in sales (they are non-linear). Why? An advertisement will create awareness in the audience up to a certain point, from which a greater exposure of it would not create a greater awareness because audience will already know enough about the brand.", "We will also have to take into account Sales. At MMM, sales must be divided into two components: base sales, or what we will obtain without carrying out any type of advertising; and incremental salts, generated from marketing activities.", "Now, where do we place the ads?", "This can be difficult for a human to know. However, thanks to AI we can get to scan the content of thousands and thousands of pages to determine which ads are the most appropriate according to which channel and audience which consumes that page.", "Let\u2019s dive into the world of \u2026", "What is the perfect content for an advertisement? Can AI guide us in creating content to increase response rates?", "There are different techniques such as NLG (Natural Language Generation) used by companies such as the Associated Press, based on the creation of text from structured data. This type of techniques would allow us to create analytical reports, blogs and product descriptions with standardized formats.", "We can find one clear example with PR 20/20, the marketing agency behind the Marketing Artificial Intelligence Institute, which has reduced the time and production of reports by 80% thanks to NLG.", "Companies like Textio are helping companies like Twitter, P&G, Slack or Nestle in creating \u201caugmented writing\u201d by avoiding gender bias or jargon that may be inappropriate when creating content such as job posts.", "And not only that \u2026 AI has helped us to significantly reduce the number of fraudulent ads. In 2018 they doubled compared to the previous year.", "Get ready for the next November elections in the United States!", "Although we may not appreciate it or be unaware of it, AI is changing the world of advertising. Let\u2019s see it as a great competitive advantage:", "Let\u2019s lessen the frustration with more relevant and effective ads.", "If we do this, we will improve the media spending strategy, the decision-making capacity and it will mean an increase in the sales of our clients.", "Feel free to leave a comment or share this post.
