In severe cases, the virus can even induce shock and bleeding resulting in the death of weaker victims. Every day an average of 80 people in Singapore are infected with dengue with that number shooting up to over 600 during cases of a severe outbreak.", "This graph shows the trend of dengue cases in Singapore from 2012\u20132019.", "From the graph, we observed that dengue cases usually undergo sharp spikes of around 3\u20134 months in length and take around the same time to reduce back to its original value. This data is largely consistent with dengue being a contagious disease that can be prone to outbreaks. However, in order to fully understand the data we have to look at factors that affect the outbreak of dengue.", "Making use of various datasets, we are able to build a machine learning model to predict the trends of dengue in Singapore. Our approach takes into account the existing number of people infected with dengue in prior weeks and meteorological data as these are the factors that contribute to the spread of dengue.", "The aim of our machine learning model is to be able to predict dengue 8 weeks ahead as this would allow government health organizations and the public to take necessary pre-emptive measures, preventing the spread of dengue. With a good forecast model to predict the occurrence of dengue, this allows public health organizations as well as individuals to be able to prepare for, manage and control the spread of dengue in Singapore.", "3 different datasets were used to train the forecasting model", "Dengue infection \u2014 Dengue being an infectious disease is heavily dependent on the existing number of people who are infected with dengue. Mosquitos can become infected by people who are infected with dengue. Thus, the existing number of infected people has a factor in the number of existing dengue infected mosquitoes as well.", "Rainfall data- Aedes mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water and periods of heavy rain will likely a spike in the number of mosquitoes being present", "Temperature data \u2014 Female Aedes mosquitoes have an optimum feeding temperature of 28 degrees where they are most active. Temperatures outside this optimum zone can lead to lower feeding rates and therefore infection rates.", "The datasets were compiled from various geographical areas in Singapore. In certain regions, there were missing data found in them. Regarding these missing data, we dealt with them in the following way:", "The model we have chosen to use is a stacked XGBoost and LSTM Neural Network. First, we train the model using the XGBoost algorithm only on Dengue data to be able to predict the underlying trends of outbreak and recovery within the data. Our dataset is relatively small with only 413 rows and using a high variance algorithm like a neural network may overfit the data at the start. Thus, we only use the LSTM layer to adjust for any residual error in our forecast and finetune our results.", "XGBoost is an ensemble machine learning algorithm developed by Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin that uses decision trees and random forests to make predictions. Ensemble machine learning is a system of combining the predictive power of multiple models of the same or different kinds of algorithms. There are 2 main types of ensemble learning, bagging and boosting. Bagging refers to the aggregating different models trained on a random sampling of data and taking the mean of the predictions. For example, 10 decision trees are trained on a random sample of the total dataset. The aggregate would be the mean of the 10 predictions. Boosting, however, builds models sequentially, each subsequent model learning from the errors of its predecessor and creates a new model that corrects the error. For example, the second decision tree will predict the error of the first one, so that the final prediction will be the sum of both predictions.", "XGBoost uses boosted decision trees to come up with a final prediction. However, it uses a special algorithm called gradient descent to reduce the errors effectively. To further utilize the full computational power of a machine, the XGBoost algorithm optimizes hardware and software to ensure the maximum efficiency in training the model in the shortest amount of time.", "After applying XGBoost to our dataset, we train a Long Short-term Memory network to minimize the residual error of our model. LSTM networks are a variant of the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and are used applied to problems where the input/output sequences. Today LSTMs are used in state-of-the-art applications such as Google Translate and other Natural Language Processing tasks. Given that the time-series forecasting problem we are dealing with is a sequential one, LSTMs are a good learning algorithm for this problem.", "LSTM networks are useful for evaluating sequences because they are able to store information about a sequence which is known as the state of the cell. This information can be passed on to the next LSTM cell in the network or it can be overridden if the next element in the sequence contains more important information. The ability of the network to have an in-built memory allows it to learn more complicated behavior.", "We divided the entire dataset into two portions, from Jan 2012 to Jun 2018 which was the training set while the remaining data served as the test set to evaluate our model.", "A 5-fold K-fold cross-validation was used for learning the optimum hyperparameters for the learning algorithms.", "The training set is divided into 5 parts and the model trains on 80% of the data and is evaluated on the last 20%, using a loss metric of mean squared error. The model with the lowest error will then be used to evaluate the test set to see the final error of the model. This process is to prevent data-leakage, to ensure that the model is always evaluated on completely new data and can generalize well.", "The most important hyperparameter was the lookback period for the data fed into the algorithm. Through our testing, we determined a lookback period of 55 weeks to be optimum. This is likely due to an outbreak and recovery cycle lasting around 55 weeks which is important for the forecasting.", "Finally, the model was used to predict dengue data from June 2018 onwards. Using the same metric of mean squared error we achieved a modest error of around 5872. As can be seen from the graph shown, the model is able to predict major outbreaks with relatively high accuracy and no lag time. This is useful for policymakers to be able to preemptively stop outbreaks from occurring.", "Team Members: Neo Zheng Jie Reo, Jonathan Chua En Zhe, Joshua Seetoh Dewei", "This Medium article is written as part of Datathon 3.0 a machine learning competition organized by National University of Singapore (Faculty of Science) in conjunction with Terra.AI", "Your home for data science.
