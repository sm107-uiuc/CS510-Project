They were built to answer questions like, \u201cHow much money am I making and how many paying customers do I have?\u201d", "Marketing data sets were introduced to answer questions revolving around campaign performing, reach and impact.", "Most companies stopped building data structures beyond those two. Now, brands across the spectrum are struggling through an obsolete system attempting to answer key questions for both marketing and business development teams.", "How it is possible that we are lacking data sets in a day in an age where the amount of data is increasing exponentially by the second?", "The reality is that data needs a particular structure to answer specific questions. Typically the data is being captured in an unstructured way, and then needs to re-structured to answer critical product and consumer-centric questions.", "Building these data sets is a cross-functional team sport. It\u2019s a sport because it requires coaching, practice and can create a bit of rivalry across the teams to create a great dataset.", "\ud83d\udc49 Have a clear and concise consumer-centric strategy.", "Consumer-centric strategies need to have a consumer journey that is informed by consumer feedback and consumer need based states as the user moves through the consumer journey. Once this is done, make sure that everyone is aware and agrees with this strategy.", "The consumer-centric analytics will fail if people start to waver on how much they agree with the strategy, as analytics is meant to provide feedback on how well the strategy is performing.", "If people start to disagree with the strategy or follow a different strategy, then the consumer-centric analytics framework will not provide information on how well the strategy is performing.", "\ud83d\udc49 Build your KPI structure from the ground up, starting with consumer-centric KPIs first.", "Your consumer-centric KPIs should be descriptive of your consumer\u2019s need based states you identified as a strategic play in your consumer journey research. They also should be predictive of your business and marketing KPIs.", "\ud83d\udc49 Identify the differences between the business, marketing, product and consumer-centric questions.", "We recommend that an analytics team member categorize the questions that they get asked on a regular basis.
