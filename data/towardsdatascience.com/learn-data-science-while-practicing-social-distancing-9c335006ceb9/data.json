In Australia we have it a lot better than many other countries, at least at the moment. However, isolation can still get you down. Adhering to the \u2018stay the fuck home\u2019 movement, we all have a lot more free time on our hands. Lots of people are trying to use their alone time wisely by learning new skills.", "For the purposes of this article I have changed my friend\u2019s names to aliases to protect the innocent. Any parents reading along might recognise the names I have used from the popular kids TV show Bluey \ud83d\ude1c", "The Bluey aliases are from two episodes:", "1. Bluey\u2019s dad decided to rename Bluey and her sister Bingo as \u2018Dennis\u2019 and \u2018Sharalanda\u2019 in the episode called \u2018Teasing\u2019.", "2. Blue and Bingo pretend to be Grannies \u2018Janet\u2019 and \u2018Rita\u2019 in the episode \u2018Grannies\u2019.", "One of my friends, Sharalanda, who is an accountant by trade told me that she was thinking about doing some study during the pandemic. I asked her what she was thinking about learning? She was not really sure, but data science was one of the things on her list. I told her that if she was serious about wanting to learn that I would be happy to help her. At least I could teach her enough that she would know if it was something she would like to pursue further.", "Once I had made that offer, another friend, Janet chimed in. She is a chemist and data analyst. Over the years she had been interested in learning data science and had started learning to program in python a few times. However, life got in the way and she had not continued with it. So she asked if she could join in learning with Sharalanda. I said of course she could, the more the merrier.", "So I opened up the invitation to do some data science study to more of my friends and had a couple more takers.", "My friend Dennis is a lawyer and deals a lot with technology in her work. She wanted to find out more about what data science actually is. The idea for her was more to get a better understanding of data science so that she can do her job more easily when interacting with data scientists and technology contracts.", "The other person who said they would like to join our little study group is Rita. She is a fellow research scientist who has just completed her PhD in physiology. We have worked together on data science projects previously and taken part in a government run open data hackathon, GovHack.", "Rita had started learning some aspects of data science on her own, but has three children and many other commitments on her time. So it had been difficult for her to maintain momentum in her learning.", "There are plenty of self-directed data science courses available online. However I have never found that I feel accountable to an impersonal online course. You also can\u2019t always ask questions in online courses. When I started learning data science I wish that I had a group of friends to do it with.", "Learning data science with a group of friends seemed to be the perfect solution. We could keep each other accountable. I always find it easier to maintain enthusiasm for a project if others are relying on me. Learning with friends is also just so much more fun than doing it alone. So even though we cannot see each other face to face at the moment, we can share in this project to increase our skills.", "I have found in the past that when I do activities with my friends, like learning a new skill I see them much more than I ordinarily would. The activity provides an impetus to reach out and stay in touch. Hopefully learning together will keep us sane and connected during this difficult time where in person interaction is all but impossible.", "It will also be helpful to have different points of view while learning complicated concepts. Questions from different people may trigger understanding in others. So hopefully we will be able to help each other gain new skills in data science.", "I have worked as a data scientist for several years now. My background is in Neuroscience and I made the transition to data science by doing free online courses. You can read about how I got into data science in my previous story \u2018How I went from zero coding skills to data scientist in 6 months\u2019. My journey is proof that you can learn data science without doing a specific university degree if you really want to and put your mind to it.", "Data science is a little bit like art, there are many ways to approach achieving a desired outcome and there are different schools of thought about how to approach problems. By no means am I an expert in every aspect of data science. I don\u2019t think anyone really is. I look forward to learning some new data science skills on our journey.", "Developing the lessons as we go along will be in response to the aspects of data science my friends would like to learn. So anyone who reads these posts please do not treat them as gospel, this will just be us doing the best we can to learn new things together. I will be lending my expertise where I can, but drawing on other resources as needed.", "Whilst my friends are not necessarily looking for a career in data science I am still excited to help them learn and reach their goals.", "To keep us on track I thought that I would chronicle our progress on Medium. We have set up a private facebook chat where I post the draft links to my medium articles that contain the lessons. My friends are then writing up their answers to the questions and exercises in a shared google doc. That way I can see how they are going as they work through the problems. Then at the end of the week I will publish the story.", "The background of my friends learning data science is extremely varied. I don\u2019t want anyone to get left behind as we progress through the lessons, so we will start from the very beginning. The first lesson will assume no prior knowledge of programming or statistics.", "To start off with, we will be tackling learning SQL. That way we will know how to access data from databases. So stay tuned for the first lesson in creating a table and filling it with data in SQL.", "As a group we decided that we would aim to complete a lesson every week. It seemed like a time frame that would let us keep up our momentum but also not cause undue pressure on family lives. We may need to modify that time frame as we get to more complicated lessons. It is good to have a goal though.", "If you would like to join us and try to up-skill during this enforced time at home, please feel free to follow along with the exercises in my posts. Hopefully we will all have some fun and learn something new :)", "In addition to data, my other passion is painting.
