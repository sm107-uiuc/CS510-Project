This process starts with gathering data, moves to model building, and then model productionization. The Data Science Process Lifecycle [1], introduced by Microsoft in 2017, documents this process. The process is bookended by the business problem and acceptance of the data product by the customer. For reference, I\u2019ve included an overview of the Data Science Process Lifecyle below.", "If your team is like most, you may spend 90%+ of your time on the \u201ccenter flow\u201d of this lifecycle. It is arguably the most interesting and the most fun. In terms of the \u201cbusiness problem\u201d, product managers focus on translating the business problem into technical requirements. This leaves one key component remaining: customer acceptance. \u2018Customers\u2019 can include both external users as well as internal business users.", "Unfortunately, customer acceptance is often an afterthought in the development process.", "Science teams may confirm customer acceptance through a user acceptance test. Even worse, science teams may validate customer acceptance of data products through science metrics like RMSE, AUC, or F1 score. This article provides approaches to customer acceptance from an internal business user standpoint. We should recognize that acceptance isn\u2019t a one-time occurrence but rather something that is on-going through the life of the data product. I\u2019ve found that there are at least three options to support gaining customer acceptance, or maximizing adoption, of machine learning products. They are: 1) make it explainable, 2) provide some control, and 3) show the value. Let\u2019s explore these components through a set of use cases.", "While showing the financial impact of a machine learning-powered product is powerful evidence, sometimes business leaders want to understand what is \u201cgoing on under the hood\u201d. While not scalable, providing customer-based examples of why your science makes sense can go a long way in getting internal acceptance. When I was at Disney, we sometimes had challenges with gaining internal business customer acceptance of our team\u2019s data products. Below is an example of what we did.", "If you have ever tried to book a stay at a Walt Disney World resorts, or a hotel anywhere for that matter, you may sometimes find that the hotel is unavailable. This isn\u2019t a surprise as during some times of the year, like summer or the holidays, high demand may outstrip the supply of hotel rooms. To minimize this, we wanted to smooth out demand throughout the year. In particular, we wanted to do this by increasing prices for high-demand rooms and lowering prices for low-demand rooms. Our team built a machine learning-based data product that quantified the price elasticity of demand by room type, by resort, by time of year. The output from price elasticity calculations is a number that is typically less than zero. A price elasticity of -0.01 to -0.99 tells you that customers are less sensitive to price increases or inelastic to pricing. This means that you can feel confident in increasing price and only minimally reduce demand. Conversely, a price elasticity that is less than one implies that customers are price sensitive. The model we created could show us the difference in elasticity, or guest price sensitivity, between a lake view, parking lot view, or theme park view room at a certain resort on a particular date. Using the forecast of demand and a model for price elasticity, we were able to calculate the optimal price points for each room type and resort. With these insights, we could recommend price changes to business leadership.", "What our team developed was an offline pricing model: an internal tool that would provide recommendations to Disney leadership on tactical pricing changes for the upcoming year. When we were planning to review these results for the first time, we recognized that some of these changes were out of the ordinary. This is because many of our recommendations differed from historical changes. For the recommendations that seemed to be the most counter-intuitive, we tried to provide logic for what was driving the science. Instead of \u201cgoing into the black box\u201d to identify the most relevant features, we took a customer-centric approach. We reviewed online message boards where past guests shared vacation tips. We also drove to the resorts, viewed the rooms in person, and spoke to resort managers to get their insights. One resort at Walt Disney World, The Art of Animation, had a room type that our model identified as inelastic for most times of the year. This room type was the \u201cFinding Nemo\u201d suites. Other than the theming, there was no clear difference between this room type and the others at the Art of Animation. Since we knew that the ML models in our data product could be questioned, we decided to visit the resort. After walking the property\u2019s grounds, it was easy to see why the model made the recommendations. The Finding Nemo suites were all located in an area that was closest to the largest pool. It was also closest to the main building that housed the resort\u2019s dining as well as its retail store and video game arcade. In the map below, you can see the Find Nemo suites highlighted in yellow, the main building in gray, and the main pool in blue.", "We were also able to confirm our insights by reviewing Disney and travel blogs. We noted where past guests provided tips on choosing the Finding Nemo suites for the reasons we identified. Our science model was able to deduce this through the data. While this not a scalable approach, we were able to provide customer-based validation for our model.", "When creating data products whose primary user is an internal customer, you should build-in flexibility.", "This is especially important if the data product provides a recommendation derived from science-based forecasts. Data products for internal customers often replace existing processes. In the case of forecasts, the legacy process usually is a time-series forecast that isn\u2019t causal. An initial business case for moving from a time-series to a science-based approach is an improvement in accuracy and explainability. While the ML-based forecasts will include many features, realistically, the model can\u2019t account for strategy decisions, shift of the business, or other exogenous factors. A pertinent example of this would be the change in demand for a product as a result of Covid. No science model could have predicted the pandemic or the on-going impact.", "Going back to another example at Disney, our team built an internal data product to recommend promotions for Disney Parks & Resorts. The intent of our promotions was to increase demand during periods of the year that weren\u2019t performing as expected. So, our promotions were the response to the customer\u2019s initial reaction to the pricing that we discussed in the prior section. If we priced too high, promotions allowed us to \u2018course correct\u2019. The science model that we developed did two things. It recommended the level of discount by percent and the booking window for the promotion. The business user only had to provide the travel window, or time of year with lower demand than expected. The science model predicted demand at various discount levels as well as accounted for promotion dilution. Dilution means providing a discount to guests even though they likely would have paid full price.", "A challenge with science models that create hundreds of thousands of forecasts (or more) and optimize to generate an outcome, is that the end user may not believe that the forecasts. This has the follow-on consequence of not believing the optimized outcome or recommendation. To overcome these objections, we provided the demand forecasts. This allowed our internal customers to understand what the model \u201csaw\u201d and was optimizing against. We also provided a scenario analysis capability that let the user view the forecasts at different discount levels. Even with this, we still had customer acceptance problems. This is because there are other business areas within Disney Parks & Resorts that are also working to increase demand. In a given year at Walt Disney World, there are many events and festivals. Examples include Flower & Garden, Food & Wine, and Run Disney weekends. Adding more of these events or changing their duration can have a significant impact on resort demand. This is something that a science-model would have no insight into.", "While not perfect, the best approach is a hybrid one. This approach starts with a science model and then incorporates internal customers influences. Specifically, we allowed the customer to add their own insight to the science forecast and then re-optimize based on the combination of machine learning model and analyst inputs. To be successful, our data product included:", "\u00b7 User Interface that accepted inputs from the internal customer including constraints", "\u00b7 Initial output of science-based recommendations", "\u00b7 Scenario analysis including the raw data and visualizations embedded in the UI", "\u00b7 Feature in the UI that allowed the internal customer to provide demand \u2018influences\u2019", "\u00b7 Capability to re-optimize based on the internal customer demand influences", "\u00b7 Storage of the initial forecasts for later reference to reduce model run times when re-optimizing with the influences", "A third option to assist in customer acceptance of the data product is to show quantifiable benefits. This can be done through AB testing. Unfortunately, not all data products can be AB tested. For example, internal data products like those discussed before usually can\u2019t be validated in this way. The best candidates for the AB testing approach to internal customer acceptance are ML-based products that directly interact with the end customer. Examples of these types of products include chat bots, personalized UX, or recommendations.", "At Walt Disney World, prospective guests are provided recommendations if the resort they are attempting to book is unavailable. If Disney didn\u2019t do this, there is a chance that the prospective guest could look for non-Disney alternatives. These alternatives could include staying at a non-Disney resort or finding another city to vacation at. An example of this is shown in the screen shot below.", "Before implementing a science-based model, we created a business rule-based approach. This started with a static list of resorts and a corresponding list of \u2018next best options\u2019 across three dimensions. For example, each of the 31 Walt Disney World Resorts could have an associated stack-ranked list based on similar pricing, similarity of theming, and proximity to one of the theme parks. As seen in the screenshot above, a resort selected from each dimension could fill one of the three recommendation options. This business rule-based approach acted as the baseline or \u2018control\u2019 in the AB test.", "Once we built the ML-based recommendation product, prospective guests were randomly assigned into two groups. Half of the prospective guests visiting the website saw recommendations based on the ML model. The other half saw recommendations based on business rule approach. The goal of the AB test was to determine the difference in guest booking rates. Once we could quantify the incremental lift associated new data product, we could calculate the annual benefits. With annualized financial benefits, the value of science work is demonstrable to leadership making internal customer acceptance easier to come by. Unfortunately, there are two caveats. As mentioned before, only certain types of data products can be AB tested. Second, is that you can\u2019t assume the AB test results don\u2019t change. Even if new features aren\u2019t launched, a cadence of re-testing should be established to ensure that the value still exists.", "\u00b7 Just because a team builds a machine learning model, it doesn\u2019t mean that internal customers will believe and adopt it.", "\u00b7 Product and science team managers need to explicitly think about how to gain internal customer acceptance of data products as well as consider how end customers will be impacted by the product.", "\u00b7 Data products can possibly gain internal acceptance through coordinated efforts to 1) make the output explainable, 2) provide some flexibility and control of the model, and 3) experiments to show financial or business value.", "Your home for data science.
