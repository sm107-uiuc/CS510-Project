These are not new but have currently gained high importance and high attention due to advancements in tools, technology, and computing power of systems. But the main part is the data. Most of the time goes in data wrangling, feature extraction, data cleansing, etc. You may have heard,", "About 80 percent time goes in finding, cleaning, and reorganizing huge amounts of data and rest 20 percent for the actual data analysis or other purposes.", "Hence the time spent with data is important. As more time is given to build something, it yields better results. To know more about data and to reach insightful data analysis, we can divide the case study into the following parts,", "Gathering of data can be done from online resources such as Kaggle, UCI, google dataset search, etc. The above concept can be understood better with the real-world dataset (not really though! \ud83d\ude0b the real-world data is way more untidy \ud83d\ude25) for which I have chosen House Price Data provided by Kaggle,", "Features are the data points or the measurable property of the phenomenon being observed. We use the standard libraries for data analysis(pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, plotly and seaborn) and import them as,", "import pandas as pdimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport plotly.express as px import numpy as npimport seaborn as sns", "We define a function for extracting the variable types,", "The data types are broadly classified as follows,", "The above function yields following output to the training data,", "The numerical data is information that is measurable, and it is, data represented as numbers. Our data consists of about 38 numerical data types. Further Numerical is subdivided into:", "(a) Discrete are variables whose values are whole numbers (counts), example,", "(b) Continuous represents measurements and have certain values in a particular range, for example,", "Categorical variables represent types of data which may be divided into groups. Examples of categorical variables are race, sex, age group, and educational level. Our data contains about 43 categorical values. Categorical data is subdivided into :", "(a) Binary data is discrete data that can be in only one of two categories either yes or no, 1 or 0, off or on, etc.", "(b) Ordinal data are categorical variables in which categories can be meaningfully ordered, example,", "(c) Nominal data show no intrinsic order of the labels, for example,", "Date and time, or DateTime variables they take dates and/or timeas values. Example,", "Our data contains features such as,", "The data consists of errors such as,", "(a) Missing Data may happen due to forgotten to store, inappropriate data handling, inefficient data entry at the ground level, etc. Our training data has following missing value distribution,", "This is obtained from the following function,", "The missing data is handled using the Scikit learn Imputation method,", "(b) High Cardinality means that number of different labels in categorical data is very high, which causes problems to model to learn. We check our data with the following function,", "(c) Outliers are the extreme cases that may be due to error, but not in every case. We can find the outliers by viewing in the data as,", "Model requirements are the data behavior as desired by the machine learning algorithms. In our case, we have the following assumptions of linear models,", "These could be better understood here,", "Apart from assumptions, the modeling step also includes the data to follow the statistical concepts, for example, normal distribution. Our data must be normalized. The skewness of data is fixed using scipy statistical module in the following function,", "Skewness refers to distortion or asymmetry in a symmetrical bell curve, or normal distribution, in a set of data. If the curve is shifted to the left or to the right, it is said to be skewed. The skewness of a variable can be understood as,", "Next, we have regression task hence categorical data can be handled by converting them to numbers, by one-hot encoding, this is done using the sklearn module,", "The machine learning/deep learning task requires the breakage of data into training, validating, and testing tasks. Hence using modules such as sklearn we break data into train, validation, and test data. The following code breaks data into train and test dataset.", "At last we arrive the part of which everything is about, as you can observe out of 6 steps this is the last step which proves how much time is invested in the data processing. You simply can\u2019t apply machine learning algorithms without clean data and clean code.", "In our machine learning task we choose scikit-learn\u2019s linear regression model.", "The Linear Regression model is first imported then the data is fit to it. Finally, we predict the split test data set. And at last, we validate our model using metrics such as R-Square and MSE. These are the error calculation functions that show how our model performs.", "The complete code can be found here,", "Finally, you have learned how to preprocess data set and analyze data to predict house prices. We have done a case study of regression data and performed predictive analysis over it. You can further try finding out the relation between the variables using data visualization libraries such as plotly and seaborn.", "Thank you! And your valuable suggestions are welcome!
