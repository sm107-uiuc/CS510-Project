We might not fully understand all commands or fully memorize them, but we need to know how to use them to produce high-quality code. When programmers talk about Git, often, a set number of commands is used, clone, push, pull, and commit.", "Yes, these commands are most popular because they deal with the most common concerns needed when dealing with Git. However, some commands are quite powerful and provide awesome functionality that is not as popular as the standard basic commands.", "Git has different command categories \u2014 13 to be precise \u2014 each category deals with a specific aspect of version control. For example, init and clone are under the create a project category. Where pull and pull are updating the project category, and commit is used for basic snapshotting.", "This article will go through 5 Git commands that I feel don\u2019t get the hype they should\u2014commands for inspecting, debugging, and performing some administrative tasks.", "git-diff is the command for you if you need to check different commits or between commits and working tree. If you\u2019re not familiar with the concept, the working tree is the directory associated with your repository on your system.", "To analyze the status of a repo git diff command is often used in addition to git status and git log.", "In general, git diff is used to get the difference between two \u201cthings.\u201d These two things can be one of 6 options:", "This command is used to rewrite your repo\u2019s history. It does that by applying custom filters to each revision of the repo. The custom filters can change the working-tree or the commits' information, but it can\u2019t change the commit times or merge information.", "The general syntax for this command is git filter-branch <filters> branch_name . There are 7options of filters that you can use in this command to rewrite history for different aspects of the branch.", "This is probably one of the most important Git commands \u2014 in my opinion. Bugs can kill your application, and sometimes debugging a repo is not an easy task. git bisect can be used to find bugs in a repo.", "The entire idea behind git bisect is to perform a binary search in the commits history to find a particular regression bug \u2014 a regression bug is a problem resulting from an unrelated change in the code.", "git bisect walks you through all recent commits, asking you if they are good or bad \u2014 that is, if the regressing bug is present in the commit or not. Doing so narrows down the options to the broken commit.", "Trying to find something in your repo? Want to search all your branches for a specific file? git grep is here to help you achieve this smoothly and with ease. git grep is basically used to search for a pattern in a working-tree.", "You can use git grep to search for wither exact words or regex in the repo. There are various options you can use with this command. Assume we are looking for the doc in the repo; we can use one of these options:", "git grep can also be used to search for multiple words using and/or relations. Moreover, it can search in a specific commit, branch, or find all the occurrences between two commits or tags in the repo.", "The git blame command is used to display the information of the author of each commit. It can be used to track bugs and find the commits the produced an error. On a higher level, git blame is used to inspect specific points in repo history and obtain information on who last committed and what they really changed.", "git blame displays the last author that modified a line; you can even specify exact line numbers and get the commits that affected that line and who performed them.", "Some people are often confused between git blame and git log. Although they may sound similar, if you just need to display the commits performed, what they changed, and when they were done, it\u2019s troublesome to use get blame to achieve that. In this case, git log is the better option. However, if you only want to display the metadata of the person who performed the commit, then git blame should be your command of choice.", "Dealing with Git and version control is a never-ending learning experience. The more you use it, the more you learn about it, and the more you will understand it.", "When starting with Git, the basic and standard commands always take the lead, overshadowing some important commands that could ease up some of your tasks. Commands such as grep, blame, and biscet can help you debug your commits, while diff and filter-branch can help organize and inspect your repository.", "In this article, we went through 5 of these commands and how using them can take your skills to the next level:", "Mastering the use of these commands will help make your work process faster and more efficient.", "Your home for data science.
