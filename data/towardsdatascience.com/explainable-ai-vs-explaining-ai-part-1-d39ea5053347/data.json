For example the famous Move 78 of the professional Go player Lee Sedol which caused a delusional behavioral of Alpha Go, adversarial attacks and the erroneous behavior that DeepXplore found in Nvidia DAVE-2 self-driving car platform, in which the system has decided to make two different decisions for the same input image, where the only difference is the brightness level. Such examples push AI researcher to focus more on opening the black-box of deep learning and avoid relying only on the accuracy of the model.", "Some time ago, I was preparing a workshop about the state of AI for non-AI professions. Since AI is currently a buzzword and buzzwords usually come with a lot of definitions, I had to select one. The definition of artificial is clear but what about intelligence. I searched and found the most reasonable and related to AI definition by Marvin Minskey:", "Our model contains processes that enable us to solve problems we consider difficult.", "\u201cblack-box\u201d is our name of those processes we don\u2019t yet understand.", "Actually, this is a modified version of the definition, where I replaced \u201cintelligence\u201d with \u201cblack-box\u201d and \u201cmind\u201d with \u201cmodel.\u201d Although I have changed it, the definition still holds.", "These arguments tell us these things: a) black-box and intelligence are the same, b) complex problems require complex solutions, c) a simple, understandable process most probably is not suitable for complex problems, such us Autonomous Vehicles and Machine Translation and d) the darker the box is, the more intelligent it gets.", "So when we ask deep learning scientists to open the black-box, this could imply limiting the model capability.", "It is correct that most of the processes in the human mind are ambiguous and we don\u2019t understand them, but still, we can explain our decisions and thoughts. Our explanations usually consist of statements and reasons. Our explanations don\u2019t involve statistical inference analysis ( unless it is related to the topic).", "So the question is: how do we explain or decisions?", "The human mind consists of two different systems the brain uses to form thoughts. These two systems are:", "System 1: is a fast, intuitive, unconscious and emotional, stereotypical, automatic and uses similarity with past experience to get a decision", "System 2: is a slow, conscious, logical, effortful and uses high-level reasoning to get decisions", "System 1 makes automatic decisions that don\u2019t need a lot of concentration and common knowledge, like walking, holding objects, understanding simple sentence or driving a car on highways. System 2 does a high-level reasoning, that requires common knowledge, like understanding law clauses or driving a car inside crowded cities, where it doesn\u2019t only need knowledge about driving between the lanes, but it also requires knowledge about the traffic rules inside cities and the human factors.", "So the question is then: what does System 1 and System 2 represent in AI?", "In 1988, Marvin Minskey published his book The Society of Mind. One of the most interesting piece of this book is the Framework of Representing Knowledge in the human brain.", "The knowledge in the brain consists of seven layers (ignoring micronemes, the input layer). Considering the recent AI technologies, I would explain their functionality as follows:", "Considering the points above, We get the following conclusion:", "In the next parts of this series of articles, I will dive deeply into the state of the art technologies that aims to close the gaps in the above framework. Starting from explaining System 1 decisions using LIME or Shap, going through recent neural-symbolic research and inductive logic programming, addressing consciousnesses priors by Yoshua Bengio and finally how to build an explaining AI model instead of explaining an AI model.", "Your home for data science.
