I documented my journey here from Chemical Engineering to Data Science. Since then, as I spoke to students from my school about the move, many expressed the same interest and the same question\u2026", "\u2018How did you move from engineering to data science?\u2019", "That was the exact question I ask myself \u2014 how can I make the move? That same thought bugged for and pushed to start pursuing the skills of a data scientist a little over a year ago.", "It certainly wasn\u2019t the dearth of information that makes the research difficult. Quite the opposite, the deluge of resources to learn data science makes it hard to weed out the best resources from the average ones.", "Ah, this is a difficult question to answer that stumble hiring managers and interviewees alike. Fact is, different companies define data science differently, making the term ambiguous and somewhat elusive. Some say that it is programming, others contend that it\u2019s mathematics, while others say it is about understanding the data. Turns out, they\u2019re all somewhat correct. To me, the definition that I agree most is this \u2014", "Data science is the inter-disciplinary field that uses techniques and theories drawn from the fields of mathematics, computer science, domain knowledge. [1]", "To me, this is how data science looks like in an image. I illustrated the boundaries between each segment of knowledge as blurred to demonstrate my perception that knowledge from each of these fields blend together to form what is known as \u2018data science\u2019.", "In this series of blog posts, I would like to highlight some of the classes that I have taken along the journey, along with their pros and cons. Through that, I hope to help people who were in my shoes in planning their self-learning journey in data science. These posts are:", "In this post, I will highlight how I learnt about the Data Processing knowledge required of a data scientist. In order to process data, one generally needs to learn to", "SQL is the language to communicate with a database where the data lives. If the data is a treasure buried underground, then SQL is the shovel to dig up the raw form of the treasure. More concretely, it allows us extract information from one or a combination of several tables in the database.", "There are many different \u2018flavours\u2019 of SQL, like SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Oracle, MySQL and SQLite. Each of these differs slightly, but the syntax remains largely similar and you need not worry about which flavour of SQL you\u2019re learning.", "To learn a language, one first learns the words before combining them into sentences and then paragraphs. The same can be said for SQL.", "To learn the very basic concepts (the words or sentences of SQL), I used Datacamp (Introduction to SQL) and Dataquest (SQL Fundamentals). (I will go through the pros and cons of Datacamp and Dataquest later.) In general, these sites go through the essential SQL skills with illuminating exercises and examples. Some concepts covered are:", "(You might not know these know, but that\u2019s perfectly fine! This is just a list of things that you can expect to learn.)", "However, being able to complete these exercises did not sufficiently prepare me as an analyst. I was able to understand words and sentences, but I was nowhere near writing a full paragraph. In particular, some salient intermediate and advanced concepts like sub-queries and window functions are either absent or not extensively covered, though they had been tested in several technical interviews and is essential for my current role as an analyst. These skills include", "To learn these skills, I mainly focused on using SQLZoo.net, which is free and provide very challenging exercises for each concept. My favourite feature of SQLZoo is the fact that it has exercises that test the different concepts in one integrated question. For instance, one is provided with the following entity-relationship diagram and is asked to create complex queries based on it.", "This is close to what we encounter at work as an analyst \u2014 we use different techniques that we\u2019ve learnt to extract information from the same database. The following is the entity-relationship diagram of the SQLZoo question \u2018Help Desk\u2019. Given this, you\u2019re asked to show the manager and number of calls received for each hour of the day on 2017\u201308\u201312. (Try it yourself here!)", "Other resources that I used include Zachary Thomas\u2019 SQL Questions and Leetcode.", "To start learning about the programming and the tools needed for data science, one cannot run away from R and/or Python. They are very popular programming languages which are used for data manipulation, visualization and wrangling. The question or R vs Python is an age-old question that deserves another post on its own. My take?", "It doesn\u2019t matter whether you pick R or python\u2014 once you master one, you can easily pick up the other.", "My journey with coding in python and R started with the code-along-with-me sites like CodeAcademy, Datacamp, Dataquest, SoloLearn and Udemy. These sites provide you with the self-paced classes organized by languages or packages. Each breaks concepts down into digestible parts, and gives the user with starter code to fill in the blanks. These sites typically walk you through a simple demonstration, and you will get a chance to practice the concept immediately afterwards by exercises. Some offer project-based exercises afterwards.", "Today, I will focus on two of my favourites, Datacamp and Dataquest.", "Please keep in mind \u2014 down below you\u2019ll find an affiliate link to the courses. That doesn\u2019t mean anything to you, as the price is identical, but I\u2019ll get a small commission if you decide to make a purchase.", "DataCamp offers video lectures taught by professionals in the field and fill-in-the-blank exercises. The video lectures are mostly succinct and efficient.", "One part I love about DataCamp is the up-to-date courses that are organized into career paths in SQL, R and python. This takes away the pain of planning your curriculum \u2014 now you only need to follow your path of interest. Some of the paths include:", "Personally, I started my R education with Data Science in R, which provided a rather detailed introduction to the tidyverse in R, which is a collection of incredibly useful data packages to organize, manipulate and visualize data, which most notably includes ggplot2 (for data visualization), dplyr (for data manipulation) and stringr (for string manipulation).", "However, I do have my complaint about DataCamp \u2014 that is the poor retention of information after completing DataCamp. With the fill-in-the-blank format, it is easy to guess what is needed in the blank without really understanding the concept. When I was a student on the platform, I tried completing as many courses as I could in the shortest possible time. I skimmed through the code and filled in the blanks without understanding the bigger picture. If I could restart my learning on DataCamp again, I would take my time in digesting and understanding the code better as a whole, not just the parts that I was asked to fill.", "Dataquest is very similar to DataCamp. It focuses on using code-along exercises to illuminate programming concepts. Like Datacamp, it offers a wide variety of courses in R, Python and SQL, though it is somewhat less extensive than those in DataCamp. For instance, However, unlike Datacamp, Dataquest does not offer video lectures.", "Some of the tracks offered by Dataquest includes:", "DataQuest\u2019s content is generally more difficult than those in DataCamp. There were also fewer \u2018fill-in-the-blank\u2019 format exercises. Though it took longer, my knowledge retention on DataQuest was better.", "Another great feature about the DataQuest is the monthly call with a mentor who will review your resume and provide technical guidance. While I did not personally get in touch with a mentor, I would have in hindsight, since it would definitely have helped me progress much faster.", "Data visualization is the key to present the insights you drew from your data. After learning the technical skills of creating charts using python and R, I learnt the principles of data visualization from a book, Storytelling with Data by Cole Knaflic.", "This book is platform-agnotistic. In other words, it does not focus on any particular software but teaches the general principles of data visualization with enlightening examples. Some of the key pointers you can expect to learn from this book are:", "I thought I knew data visualization, until I read this book.", "After digesting the book, I was able to create a (somewhat) visually pleasing chart that address the police brutality against blacks. One of the main learning points from the book applied here was to draw attention where you want it. This was done by highlighting the African American line with a bright yellow \u2014 reminiscent of the BLM color \u2014 while ensuring that the rest of the chart remained in the background with duller shades like white and grey.", "In this post, I covered the steps I\u2019ve taken in learning programming from scratch. With these courses, you now have the necessary skills to manipulate data! However, there is still a pretty long way to go. In the next posts, I will cover", "If you have any questions, feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. All the best, and good luck!", "If you enjoyed this blog post, feel free to read my other articles on Machine Learning:", "Your home for data science.
