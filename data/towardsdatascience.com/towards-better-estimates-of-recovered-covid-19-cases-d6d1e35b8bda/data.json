One of the earliest examples was a widely circulated draft study from Stanford University. The authors of the study estimated the likely prevalence of antibodies amongst a population of 3,300 test subjects in Santa Clara county (California) to be 1.5%, though they also accepted an uncertainty that would purport to place the true prevalence within a range of 1.11 to 1.97% (with 95% confidence). This article explains how consideration of well-known statistical and machine learning concepts for handling uncertainty and observed data, specifically Bayes\u2019 Theorem, would have more realistically estimated the true prevalence to lay within a considerably larger range of 0.2% to 2.1% (95% credible). As has been critiqued by other scientists, a more careful consideration of uncertainty by the Stanford study\u2019s authors might have avoided the over-sensationalisation of the study\u2019s initial findings if such a wide error would have been originally identified.", "I would imagine that in our new COVID-centric world, everyone has found their own way of collecting, sifting, interpreting data, news, and information about what\u2019s happening and where. For me, I\u2019ve been enamoured at the data science and modelling that\u2019s been taking place around the world to understand the nature of this virus and its impact on public health and the economy. More than that, I\u2019ve been intensely fascinated (if not a bit concerned) by the emergence of a \u2018new normal\u2019 with respect to how critical scientific research generated by academics is affecting policy. We have rapidly arrived at a point where several, not just one, unreviewed pre-prints of epidemiological simulation studies and test results have driven major news headlines and policy decisions with significant impact on national economies and public health strategies. For sure, this has not been without good reason. This crisis has demanded urgent, immediate decisions informed by our best-available data, analysis, and experts. The time window to make critical decisions, such as choosing whether and when to trigger stay-at-home orders, was out of step with most typical academic journal review processes. Much debate will follow in the coming years as to whether we looked at the right data and listened to the right voices at the beginning of this crisis (to clarify, I\u2019m not one of them). This article is a bit more laser-focused on one particular set of data we are just starting to look at now: serological testing of COVID-19 antibodies.", "In the last two weeks, serological testing has emerged as the new frontier of the COVID-19 data gathering effort. Acquiring this data seems critical to answering important questions we face going forward: By how much have we missed diagnosing mild or asymptomatic COVID-19 cases over the last months? How close might we be to so-called \u2018herd immunity\u2019? Should we consider releasing \u2018immunity passports\u2019 to those with antibodies detected in their system?", "It\u2019s maybe in-part due to our interest (or impatience?) in answering these questions as soon as possible that a study by Bendavid et al. from Stanford University published earlier in April so quickly caught the attention of the media and public for its stunning result. If you\u2019re not familiar with it, you can read the original study, or maybe read some of the articles that immediately covered it. The authors of the study undertook serological testing of a sample of 3,300 adults in Santa Clara County, California. They found that 50 out of the 3,300 subjects tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. When this result was extrapolated to reflect the entire population of Santa Clara county, the authors estimated that the true number of citizens who have contracted COVID-19 in the past months may be \u201850-to-80-fold\u2019 higher than diagnosed so-far.", "Though the revelation of the Stanford study was shocking, not to mention headline-grabbing, it also didn\u2019t take long for a community of scientists to (justifiably) throw their hands in the air and call fowl at how the Stanford paper\u2019s authors interpreted their results and drew conclusions. One of the most note-worthy critiques of the study came from Professor Andrew Gelman of Columbia University, the statistician who very literally wrote the textbook on modern statistical data analysis methods [1]. (Forgive me, frequentists, for equating \u201cBayesian\u201d with \u201cmodern\u201d. Please don\u2019t let this ruin your day.).", "This article demonstrates how paying attention to the Bayesian way of handling uncertainty would have, if carried out transparently in the Stanford study, revealed a considerably wider, and ultimately less sensational conclusion about the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in Santa Clara county. To be clear, the target audience for this article is not the statistician or epidemiologist, who I suspect very much learns these methods in university. This article is instead written for the applied scientist, science journalist, or maths-savvy reader who\u2019s had a curiosity about uncertainty analysis and Bayes theorem, but has been in want of a pressing, real-world use case. The methods applied in this article are taken from academic references [2\u20134].", "When we carry out serological testing on a general population, we may intuitively think that the percentage of tests yielding a positive result may be equal (or close enough) to the prevalence of antibodies in a tested population. After all, why would we go ahead with the expense of testing our populations if our tests are not highly accurate?", "Well, this is at the crux of one of the concerns that has been raised with the Stanford study. As it turned out, the error of the tests applied in that study \u2014 whilst seemingly small \u2014 was nevertheless large enough to cast doubt on the credibility of the study\u2019s overarching suggestion that the number of actual COVID-19 infections in Santa Clara County was actually \u201850\u201380-fold\u2019 greater than officially detected.", "In order to get to the point that we can illustrate why, we start by introducing two key variables that inform, or are informed by, diagnostic testing of any condition: the prevalence of the condition across a sampled population, and the probability of testing positive for the condition in the first place.", "First, let\u2019s imagine we were to take a population of 100 individuals for who we know, with absolute certainty, that 36 possess antibodies for COVID-19. We would calculate prevalence in this scenario to be 36/100 = 0.36 = 36%. We can also re-write this variable in terms of a probability, p, as we can assume that out of this population of 100, any randomly-selected individual has a 36 in 100 chance of possessing COVID-19 antibodies. So, if we represent an individual possessing antibodies with V+, then we can refer to the prevalence as p(V+) = 36/100 = 0.36.", "The second variable we\u2019ll introduce is the probability of testing positive for antibodies, p(T+). If out of the above population of 100 individuals, 30 were found to actually test positive for antibodies using a specific test kit, then we could make an initial estimate that p(T+) = 30/100 = 0.30.", "In this particular scenario, we can already see there\u2019s an error at play. The probability of testing positive is lower than the probability of actually having antibodies for COVID-19. Specifically, it would seem like the test is liable to generate false negatives. However, we must consider this is possibly not the only error with the test (and therefore our approach to estimating p(T+) may not be quite correct, either). Let\u2019s look at the following example of an arbitrary sample of 11 individuals tested :", "Out of this total set of 11 samples, there are 8 actual positive cases and only 7 samples that test positive. Out of these 7 positive tests, 2 are the result of false negatives, so only 5 positives are matched with actual positive cases. The other two actual cases result in false negative tests. Thus, on a sample by sample basis, a diagnostic test may correctly identify a positive case, may correctly identify negative case, or it may erroneously yield a negative result to a known positive case, or it may erroneously yield a positive result to a known negative case. The extent of the latter two errors in any type of diagnostic test can be determined respectively by the test\u2019s sensitivity and specificity.", "Sensitivity establishes the accuracy of a diagnostic test in detecting cases that would be identified by a so-called \u201cGold Standard\u201d, 100% accurate reference diagnostic. In the table above, we see five out of eight true positive cases also test positive. If this is the only data we\u2019re given to determine the test\u2019s sensitivity, we would estimate to be 5/8 = 0.625 = 62.5%.", "Specificity establishes the accuracy of a diagnostic test in detecting known negative cases. For COVID-19 serological testing, this would mean successful identification of those individuals who must not (yet) have a relevant amount of antibodies in their system. In the table above, one sees only one out of every three actual negative cases test negative as well. The specificity would therefore be estimates as 1/3=0.333=33.3%. (This is a very awful test!)", "In our mathematical formulation, we represent sensitivity and specificity as two terms, p(\ud835\udc47+|\ud835\udc49+) and p(\ud835\udc47\u2212|\ud835\udc49\u2212) respectively. The sensitivity, p(\ud835\udc47+|\ud835\udc49+), is considered the probability that an arbitrary test of a known positive case, \ud835\udc49+, will yield a positive test result, \ud835\udc47+. Likewise, the specificity, p(\ud835\udc47\u2212|\ud835\udc49\u2212), is the probability that an arbitrary test of a known uninfected case, \ud835\udc49\u2212, will yield a negative result, \ud835\udc47\u2212. (For those readers who haven\u2019t seen this type of notation before, it helps to think of the word \u201cgiven\u201d when you see the \u201c|\u201d symbol).", "At this point, we know that, if an antibody test is not 100% accurate, the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies in a test population is likely not the same as the number of cases who test positive for antibodies. There\u2019s an error at play, and that error is attributable to (at least) the test\u2019s sensitivity and specificity. So how do we establish a clear mathematical link between these various parameters and the disease prevalence, \ud835\udc49+?", "Here lies the \u201cbeauty\u201d of the \u201cLaw of Total Probability\u201d. I may not be doing justice to this article (or the statistical sciences) by trying to explain this in only a few sentences, but here goes. If we were to sample a random population group in order to determine the probability of any sample testing positive for COVID-19, p(\ud835\udc47+), we know that each individual person who tests positive can have only one of two physical conditions: they either possess antibodies for the virus, \ud835\udc49+, or they do not, \ud835\udc49\u2212. The Law of Total Probability allows us to estimate p(\ud835\udc47+) in the form of a sum of the constituent probabilities of these two manifestations, such that:", "Using the \u2018Total Probability\u2019 rule is incredibly helpful, as we now start to see a mathematical relationship established between some of the variables we\u2019ve introduced, like sensitivity, p(\ud835\udc47+|\ud835\udc49+), and prevalence, p(\ud835\udc49+). To make this math a bit easier on the eyes, from now on we\u2019ll refer to the sensitivity term, p(\ud835\udc47+|\ud835\udc49+) with \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52, and refer to the prevalence term, p(\ud835\udc49+), with \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63. We now have:", "Finally, we\u2019re now able to refine the equation for \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc47+) into a function of only the test\u2019s sensitivity, specificity, and the prevalence:", "We can also rearrange the equation if our aim is to draw an estimate of the prevalence:", "At last, it seems we might be able to tease out a verification of the Stanford / Santa Clara study just from this equation alone. In the following Gist, I make a point estimate of the prevalence of antibodies Pv given the deterministic values of Sp and Se stated in the Stanford study, and assuming p(\ud835\udc47+) = 50/3330.", "I\u2019ve excluded the above example from the content of this article because it\u2019s tangential and, ultimately, not applicable to the real-world problem we\u2019re assessing. We can only accept point estimates of Pv using the above equation if, and only if, we know Se and Sp with absolute certainty. Unfortunately, we cannot, just as the authors of the Stanford study could not either. Even the reported errors of diagnostic tests, can have errors.", "There can be several reasons for why we cannot ascertain a diagnostic test\u2019s true values of specificity and sensitivity with 100% certainty. For instance, despite our best efforts, we may never be able to compare a test\u2019s diagnostic performance against a \u2018Gold Standard\u2019 test that is itself 100% accurate. In Andrew Gelman commentary on the Stanford study, he discussed the puzzling approach the study\u2019s authors took to estimating the error of their test\u2019s specificity and sensitivity.", "We can nevertheless demonstrate the core issue facing the Stanford study\u2019s conclusions even if we take the study\u2019s own estimates of sensitivity and specificity uncertainty at face value. Though the authors made a general estimate of Se to be 80.3%, they accepted the true value of Se may lay within a wider range of 72.1% to 87% (95% confidence). The authors likewise estimated the true Sp of their test to lie within a range of 98.3 to 99.9% (95% confidence).", "It\u2019s helpful to try to characterise these errors in the form of probability distributions, which give us a sense of how likely \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52=0.721 might be compared to \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52=0.803. Beta distributions are commonly used in literature [2,3] for representing estimated errors of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d, and so I\u2019m going to estimate the key parameters of Beta distributions for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d by numerically fitting distributions such that the 95 % confidence interval of each distribution is equal to the bounds of the 95 % confidence intervals of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d as provided in the Stanford study.", "With key parameters of our Beta distributions defined, we can plot these distributions and compare them to the source data.", "Success. The characteristics of our Beta distributions (mode and confidence intervals) match the study\u2019s data well. We should now also consider how to characterise a probability distribution of our initial estimates of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63. Although the purpose of this article is to make a revised estimate of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63, in the method to follow it\u2019s important we establish initial estimates for this parameter as well.", "I\u2019m thinking that a conservative, though generally uninformed estimate is that \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 might be anywhere within a range of 0% and 3%. However, because I have little initial sense of whether or not \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 is more likely to be 0% or 1.5% or 2% or 3%, I\u2019m going to assume that there\u2019s an equal chance \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 is any of these numbers, or anywhere in between. This calls for a uniform probability distribution:", "Now here is where it gets increasingly difficult to write an explanation of the remaining process in a way that will please both someone who may not yet be familiar with Bayesian statistics, and someone who is. Apologies in advance. Let\u2019s a take a look at our critical equation again:", "Using this equation, we can infer predictions of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 from predictions of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d, and \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc47+), but where in all of this is there room to calibrate, tune, or correct our predictions based on the actual observations of \ud835\udc47+ we obtain from real-world testing? At last, here enters Bayes\u2019 theorem, which provides us a manner of relating the estimated probability of a model\u2019s prediction to the probability of observing a true incident in the field. Bayes theorem has it that:", "If we let our predictions of the positive test rate, \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc47+) = \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61, and both \ud835\udc5b and \ud835\udc58 represent respectively the size of a sample population and the number of returned positive tests, we can then apply Bayes theorem to our problem as follows:", "We have so-far introduced all the terms necessary to solve the above equation except for the likelihood, \ud835\udc5d(observations of \ud835\udc47+|\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc61). A convention is to use a Binomial distribution for this type of case. A Binomial distribution represents the probability of observing \ud835\udc58 cases out of a sample of \ud835\udc5b given a model, which in our cases becomes:", "This theory has gotten exhausting, I know, and yet I know I\u2019m unable to do the explanation proper justice in a short article. The good news is that we\u2019re at the end of it. We now have the makings of a comprehensive, but solvable model that can be executed in the following steps:", "This entire process, steps 1 through 4, is otherwise known as Bayesian inference, but explaining how we implement these steps computationally requires more information and learning than I can possibly provide (or spend time on). I\u2019ll just go right to the point of saying that PyMC3 is a great Python library for solving probabilistic mathematical problems that utilize Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods, such as Bayesian inference.", "In the following code, we use PyMC3 to infer updated (posterior) estimates of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc63, and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 based on our knowledge of a single diagnostic test where 50 individuals out of 3300 tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. The outcome of the solver, what are called \u2018traces\u2019 in PyMC3, are a set of revised estimates of the possible true values for \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d, and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63.", "The outcome of the Bayesian inference process returns a comparison of our prior and posterior estimates of \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc52, \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc5d, and \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 in terms of probability distributions.", "The results bring out the big finding of this relatively simple process. Because we are assessing only one test and one diagnostic, there is too little information to suggest the test\u2019s sensitivity and specificity are any different than originally defined by the study\u2019s authors. We do however see the posterior distribution of \ud835\udc43\ud835\udc63 has coalesced itself around a range of new values. Our posterior estimates reveal a fairly significant correction of the prevalence in comparison to not only our initial esimate of Pv (e.g., 0 to 0.03%, 100% CI) but also that of the Stanford study (e.g., 1.11 to 1.97%, 95% CI). The final assessment is that, based on the result of a single, real-world test that returned 50 observed positives out of 3,300, the true prevalence must lay within a range of at least 0.2% and 2.1% (95% credible interval). To compare this to the original study, we can generate one more plot:", "So there it is. Using appropriate statistical inference, helped particularly by Bayes rule and machine learning techniques for solving problems of Bayesian inference, we\u2019ve made a new estimate of the prevalence of antibodies across the 3,300 test subjects sampled in the Stanford / Santa Clara study by appropriately taking into account the stated errors of the serological test kit used, and the errors of the errors. Though the most likely prevalence is 1.3%, we find there must be a 95% chance that the value lays anywhere between a range of 0.2% and 2.1%. This would seem to make any claim that the prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies amongst the population of Santa Clara County is \u201850\u201380-fold\u2019 higher than expectations a bit suspect\u2026 at least not without more data.", "Andrew Gelman has, amongst others, already put to bed this key issue with the Stanford study without so much as a need to go into the very detail of the modelling as I did in this article. To paraphrase this and other experts, if it is possible that a test\u2019s specificity might be so low that false positives could be identified at a rate equal or above the observed rate of positive test results, then there is the possibility that nearly every positive test might might be a false positive and not a true identification of an antibody-possessing individual. For regions where we expect prevalence of COVID-19 antibodies remains low (which apparently includes my hometown of Vancouver, BC), we ultimately need serological tests with very high specificity in order to distinguish between true positives and false ones.", "In the midst of writing this article, the authors of the Stanford study posted a revision of their work on April 30 very much addressing some of the concerns of their first submissio. They now included: 1) applying Bayesian inference to their estimates of Pv, and 2) sharpening their estimates of sensitivity and specificity based on additional reference test data. A day after their revised submission, Andrew Gelman contributed an Bayesian analysis of this revised work, using a more thorough methodology than what even I\u2019ve outlaid in this article. Though he found the Stanford team\u2019s new assessment of uncertainty to be improved, he demonstrated a fuller extent to which uncertainty analysis using Bayes theorem could (or should) be applied to their work. My last illustration is a summary of different analyses: 1) the results of the first version of the Stanford study (April 17, 2020 pre-print), 2) my estimate of prevalence as outlined in this article, 3) the results of the revised Stanford study (April 30, 2020 resubmission), 4) my estimate of prevalence based on these revised findings, and 5) Andrew Gelman\u2019s recent estimate of prevalence based on these revised figures as well.", "In closing, Should proper methods of uncertainty quantification, perhaps using Bayesian methods, be front-and-center when we are trying to measure the extent of the COVID-19 crisis (and the decisions we make to get out this)? I have to have faith that they are within the nebulous hallways of our health care and disease control authorities, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to shout it out as a reminder once in a while \u2014 particularly for our frontline science journalists trying to make sense of things.", "I\u2019ll end this article by answer several questions of an expected FAQ:", "Was it a bit overkill to work this all out in a Medium article?", "Was it hard to do this?", "No, and I don\u2019t mean that to tout my own knowledge of this material.", "Was I using state-of-the-art procedures for assessing diagnostic test uncertainty using Bayes theorem?", "I can\u2019t answer this in full. My methods were sound, but there are more thorough ways to consider uncertainty in diagnostic testing (hence, why Gelman\u2019s method \u2014 which is more thorough \u2014 shows a larger uncertainty for estimates based on the April 30, 2020 resubmission). The extent to which my results are robust depend on the extent to which we have available data and understand our diagnostic test errors. The works of Branscum et al. [2] and En\u00f8e et al.

In my direct area of work, this is normally about how we design and operate buildings that are healthy, comfortable, and ideally carbon-neutral.
