Researchers from the almighty Google published a paper about a fancy deep learning architecture called Deep and Cross. Their log loss was 0.4419 \u2014 a tiny improvement of 0.00273. Fast forward another three years to today, and the best score is 0.4395.

The goal was to predict if a person makes over $50,000 a year, given about 14 features about an individual (age, gender, country of origin, occupation, etc.). It has about 32,000 data points in it. This is actually useful in the real world \u2014 many companies have less than 30,000 customers, and many are interested in predicting their income or similar features. Can deep learning help you here? I\u2019ve looked around, and I haven\u2019t seen any papers on deep learning trying to beat a gradient boosted decision tree. The dataset is realistically large at 32,000 records, but not large enough for a neural network to outperform. The fact of the matter is, it\u2019s hard to do better than a simple gradient-boosted decision tree in this case.", "It might seem funny for me to list something here where deep learning has made steady progress, but I want to point out the sheer amount of capital that has been spent over the past five years to make neural networks 10% better.

I\u2019m thinking of DeepMind (now owned by Google) and OpenAI. OpenAI has made some cool stuff. It won Dota 2 against top-notch human players (although it did not solve the game in its full complexity). They also created GPT-3, which can create impressive writing that is hard to distinguish from human work. How much did this cost OpenAI? Since it is a non-profit, you can easily pull up their IRS 990 forms. Here is the breakdown of expenses by year:", "These are tens of millions of dollars and multiplying. In fact, OpenAI is switching away from the non-profit model because they realize it\u2019s simply not possible to sustain their output without a more reliable source of capital than the goodness of donors\u2019 hearts. And I can\u2019t blame the donors. Who would want to fund an operation whose expenses double every year with no end in sight?", "DeepMind\u2019s expenses are even more mind-boggling. DeepMind lost $572 million in 2018 and accrued over a billion dollars of debt by 2019. Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, DeepMind has made some impressive ML innovations in game playing, medicine, and energy saving. However, the bill for that hasn\u2019t broken even, and there is hardly any assurance that it ever will.", "Oh, I\u2019m just getting started here! What about IBM Watson? The info isn\u2019t public, but one of their consultants publicized an estimate. For three years of development, the bill came out to about a billion dollars in 2010 to build the Jeopardy winning system (that\u2019s a billion dollars in 2010, not 2020!). Whatever it has been since then is certainly not cheap! I can\u2019t declare IBM Watson a failure before history has been written, but so far, it certainly hasn\u2019t helped IBM dethrone one of the FANG companies as a dominant tech player \u2014 not an unreasonable ask for such a gargantuan investment.", "It\u2019s easy to look at these companies and wish that yours had something close to their level of innovation. But being jealous of other companies\u2019 ML breakthroughs without considering the financial costs is like being jealous of someone who has a Ferrari in their driveway and not realizing they are drowning in debt to keep the collector away.", "These organizations have the charter to unlock generalized AI, or at least create totally new solutions. The trouble is we have no idea how much work it takes to accomplish those goals, assuming we even can. Having an unconstrained charter leads to unconstrained expenses.

I\u2019m not disputing that. But even in that case, you don\u2019t need PhDs from MIT to utilize them. Huggingface is probably the most known implementation: https://github.com/huggingface/transformers. By the way, you\u2019ll need about six lines of code to experiment with it, which is more than in the last section.

ML, even the fancy stuff, is becoming simpler and simpler to use. But that happens to all evolving technologies, which leads me to the next section.", "It used to be the case that if you wanted to use SQL, you needed to hire a database administrator. If you wanted to host a website, you needed to hire a systems administrator, a network administrator, and a Rackspace engineer. Believe it or not, a compiler engineer was a standard part of a software company many moons ago because machine instructions were not as standardized as they are today. You also needed an operating system specialist for the same reason! If you wanted to stream video, you\u2019d better be ready to have someone who can invent their own video protocol and implement it in C++ because WebRTC, with its out-of-the-box Javascript APIs, didn\u2019t exist back then.", "Nowadays, if you want to stream video, you can call some Javascript APIs or pay a small fee to some SaaS company. If you want a database, you just click a few buttons on your favorite cloud provider. You don\u2019t even think about compilers and operating systems anymore because those were standardized even before some of my readers were born. If you told someone today that your company has a compiler department, most engineers would look at you funny.", "Of course, there are specialists who work in networks, databases, compilers, and so forth. Nonetheless, those roles are increasingly rare and relegated to companies where economies of scale and unique needs make the specialization economical. ML is not exempt from this trend that has repeated itself over and over.", "Can you imagine what happens when you have a silo around a commoditizing technology? On to the next section.", "The danger of silos is that outdated solutions stay around far too long in your company and cause inefficient waste.", "The next time you have a beer with a software engineer, ask about what ridiculous inefficiencies still exist in the engineering department. The number one thing I hear is using a proprietary solution where an open-source or cloud solution exists. Once specialists gain political power in a company, they are very hard to dislodge even when it makes economic sense to replace them with something cheaper. Admittedly, some specializations are unavoidable, but I argue that ML is probably not one of them for many situations. Be wary of narrow charters because they incentivize people to reinvent the wheel to keep their job.", "If you create the silo, make it clear that they must first look for external solutions before building something themselves. Stress that their charter is first and foremost to be an expert of existing solutions. Whatever you are trying to do, there is an excellent chance someone else had encountered that problem before and solved it. That is doubly true, now that billions of dollars have been poured into ML solutions.", "Also, silos are naturally rewarded for becoming a solution looking for a problem. They have a bad incentive to add unnecessary features to products simply because that feature uses the technology they develop.", "Even if they are well-meaning, it\u2019s too easy to pigeonhole ML specialists into spending their time improving the accuracy of some system by a few percentage points. But does your business benefit from a 1% gain break even with the salaries you are paying those ML specialists? This applies whether the silo is one person, an entire department, or something in between.", "A more economical solution is to roll out an ML model, monitor it, then revisit it in a year when some other researchers advance the state-of-the-art. This solution doesn\u2019t work well if you have a machine learning silo because silos have low utilization with spiky work.", "The stereotype works something like this. A full-stack team consists of a couple of ML scientists, some backend engineers, and maybe some front-end engineers, if applicable. The ML scientist develops the model and hands it to the backend engineer, who puts the model into an API. The new feature is launched, and the team pops the bottle of champagne. As time passes, the ML scientist monitors the model\u2019s performance and updates it from time to time as more data is collected from instrumentation.", "Because of how seductively simple this is, it looks compelling when presented to executives, and people outside the field think this is how things really operate.", "Except that this is a very inefficient way to run things in reality, as I alluded to previously. Under this setup, the ML specialist and the backend engineers take turns twiddling their thumbs waiting for each other. Of course, they don\u2019t actually twiddle their thumbs. They fill their time with low-value work simply to stay busy and not lose their job.", "Building the initial ML model is a full-time job, yes, but it is a limited engagement. Maintaining it is barely a part-time job. In fact, right after the model launches, what will the ML specialist do in the following days while new data is being collected?", "In reality, there are many open source and proprietary products for creating and hosting models that the spikes can be offloaded to. Here is a nice list if my refrain to Sagemaker is getting tiresome: https://neptune.ai/blog/best-mlops-tools (I\u2019m not recommending neptune.ai, having never used it before, but I like the list they assembled on that page).", "To really picture this in your mind\u2019s eye, imagine you had a database specialist who only did work every time you needed to add the column, backup the database, or add a new query. Maybe every so often, that employee pops in to see if the database should be re-sharded.", "This person would not be very busy, right? Hopefully, you aren\u2019t changing your database that often as the product matures, and I would hope for the same with your ML model, which at best gets 1% better every year. Wouldn\u2019t it be more economical to train your engineers to be decent at database management? The same applies to ML in a lot of cases.", "New algorithms make the news and give the impression that success in ML development is about coming up with new algorithms. That is not the case, of course. We use existing algorithms 99.9% of the time.", "Two things drive success with known algorithms: understanding your data (cleaning and exploring) and manipulating it in a way to make it more understandable to existing algorithms (feature engineering).", "Both of these are a bit of an art form. If you look at most data science contests, you\u2019ll see that people are usually using the same algorithms. But the winner is determined by who had the most brilliant insight into the data and could leverage that insight to make the off-the-shelf algorithm sensitive to it. The more people who look at your problem, the more likely a brilliant insight is to surface.", "(I should make an aside here about contests: like state-of-the-art in research, it is not a good idea to be obsessed with the very best solution. Oftentimes, the difference between the first-place score and 100th place score is 1% \u2014 something that again usually doesn\u2019t matter in the real world)", "This doesn\u2019t mean you should hire a hundred ML engineers to maximize your chance of success. It means either hire a consultant to find those insights for you (and then write five lines of code) or train your workforce on how to look for these insights and have everyone temporarily drop what they are doing to work on the ML problem temporarily. This is compatible with the spiky nature of ML.", "This is a very realistic solution. ML is fun! I would have quit my job by now if that wasn\u2019t the case. Your engineers will enjoy it, and you will save a lot of money. They also get to brag to their friends that they work on AI.", "Machine learning development is a little different from software engineering. Software engineering doesn\u2019t benefit from having too many people work on the same section of the code. It creates opportunities for miscommunication, and it\u2019s hard to measure who did what.", "On the other hand, machine learning development works extremely well in parallel because you can easily combine models or modeling techniques at the end (we call that ensembling).", "Furthermore, worker output is literally measurable with the accuracy score of the models they produce. You actually know who contributed what with a cold hard number, despite having many people working on it. You get metrics-based management with an uncontrived metric that actually matters. It doesn\u2019t get any better than that!", "I\u2019m not prophesying that ML services will make engineers \u2014 ML ones or in general \u2014 obsolete someday. Such a prediction is not supported by current trends and is little better than science fiction and idle speculation. I am pointing out that, although the ML engineer will not die completely, it will be less and less necessary as time goes by.", "However, it\u2019s still absolutely worth knowing the subject for practical edification because having the skills to execute machine learning and data science makes you a better technologist and decision-maker in general, even if you don\u2019t use this skill exclusively on a day to day basis.", "For example, even though there are plenty of software engineers who don\u2019t know anything about the physics of silicon and transistors, but they do know key information about hardware, namely that RAM is faster than disk, the CPU has a fixed number of cores, sequential reads on hard disks are faster than random seeks, and network packets drop from time to time. They may not understand the exact mechanics of why these phenomena exist, but they can intelligently make decisions around these matters.", "You don\u2019t need to be a network specialist to write a good API, but you can\u2019t be completely ignorant about networks.", "You don\u2019t need to know how the ext4 format works to write and read data from a disk, but you should understand that writing is slower than reading.", "You don\u2019t need to be a database specialist to use SQL as part of your app, but you should know about the CAP theorem and the difference between eventually consistent and strongly consistent.", "There are analogs for machine learning. You don\u2019t need to know exactly when XGBoost decides to split or what the parameters beta1 and beta2 in the Adam optimizer do. Still, you should know about the gotchas of ML and statistics like underfitting/overfitting, reversion to the mean, non-stationary distributions, seasonality, heteroskedasticity, correlation/causation, ergodicity, outliers, dirty data, data leakage, class imbalance, not outperforming a baseline, and discounting common sense and domain knowledge. (Anything else I should add to the list? Please comment below)", "Some of those terms may seem scary to the uninitiated, but wouldn\u2019t something like left-join, SELECT *, indexing, sharding, secondary key, and foreign key also sound mysterious at first? The fact of the matter is, they really are quite learnable. Just because database terms aren\u2019t enshrouded in sociological herd hype doesn\u2019t make them less technically interesting or complicated.", "Ignorance can definitely hurt you. Blindly trusting an ML algorithm that you got from thoughtlessly plugging your data into is obviously bad. However, you don\u2019t need a Ph.D. or even a master\u2019s to avoid these silly outcomes, just as you don\u2019t need to know how the Google Chrome Javascript engine works inside-out to write a web app. It\u2019s all about balance and not investing past the point of diminishing returns. And in my experience, the point of diminishing returns comes quickly.", "ML is evolving at quite a fast pace, but outdated truths about it aren\u2019t dying at the same rate. Training ImageNet from scratch was crazy six years ago, but nowadays, it can be done cheaply in less than 20 minutes. Yet, many people still think training from scratch is too computationally expensive. You used to need specialized knowledge to build a simple neural network because Caffe and Tensorflow version zero were truly nightmarish to use. But nowadays, you can copy six lines of code from a Medium or Stackoverflow post. Similarly, if this essay were written four years ago, it would have been laughably wrong.", "Having successfully led non-ML software engineers to create high impact ML models and having guided startups to accomplish their ML goals without hiring ML engineers or expensive consulting firms, I can assure you that the need for ML specialists is far smaller than the current hype is making it out to be.", "So yes, your engineers can\u2019t be ignorant about data science, ML, statistics, AI, or whatever you want to call it. But most teams can still drive a lot of business value without a set of specific team members dedicating their career exclusively to it. Even if they try and fail, you will be in a position to evaluate ML talent or solutions more effectively afterward.", "Find startups who solve the problem you have on hand and offload your specific ML problem to them while paying them a lot less than an ML scientist\u2019s salary. As more and more competitors come in, renegotiate the prices in your favor. Don\u2019t hire someone that you will only need for a few quarters. Technology inevitably becomes cheaper as time goes by. You want to be a customer in this market, not a seller. Commoditization is ruthless.", "Use off-the-shelf solutions. You\u2019ll get something within striking distance of state of the art, but your expenditures will be massively cheaper. Keep yourself up to date with what AWS and its competitors are offering. Set up multiple sales calls to see what potential partners can do for you. You will soon get a sense of which ML services are standard.", "Have your engineers take online courses for ML and get educational feedback by participating in data science competitions relevant to your business needs. You may have a slight dip in productivity in the short term but a massive gain in retention, engagement, and worker efficiency in the medium and long term. Don\u2019t expect them to become experts in 3 months. However, making consistent incremental progress yields tremendous results.", "Please note that I\u2019m not saying this is an \u201ceither-or\u201d concerning having an ML specialist or not. Some hybrid models where someone is ultimately responsible for ML outcomes but also expected to coordinate ML from nonspecialists can work well.", "Deep learning only pays off when you have a tremendous amount of data at your disposal. When you only have a small or medium amount of data, simple models work well. As you grow, collect data in a clean way, but don\u2019t be obsessed with state-of-the-art predictive analytics just yet. When you achieve ultra-scale, then it can make economic sense to hire expensive ML experts and squeeze out the last couple percent where it matters.", "This essay is a plea to decision-makers to allocate resources wisely. It is also a stern warning to students and potential converts against overspecialization in a field evolving against the need for specialization, as happens with most technology stacks.", "There are so many boot camps and masters programs ready to push their newly minted ML specialists on you (or issue a siren call to pay them big tuition fees). There are enough ML consultants ready to charge you a lot of money for what you could get cheaply on the cloud (pro tip: Ask a quote for an ML model you know AWS provides cheaply and see if they try to bill you to build a system without mentioning AWS). Please, take a step back and look at your business. Is having ML that is 1% better really what is holding your company, department, or team back from greatness? Oftentimes, the answer is no.", "Again, I\u2019ll need to say this repeatedly \u2014 my claim here is not universally true. However, the commentary on machine learning nowadays is so lopsidedly bullish that a valid counterpoint is needed.", "I should explicitly state what I believe is implied in the essay above:", "Again, it is not universally true that companies or company departments don\u2019t need ML specialists. My point is, don\u2019t create an ML department just because it\u2019s ML. There should be an obvious economic reason to allocate resources this way. And if you do have a genuine ML need, look at the alternatives before committing to pay massive salaries. And if you must invest, think carefully about the scope of the charter. But isn\u2019t that true of any business investment? Hype doesn\u2019t make timeless business truths go away.", "Yeah, I can\u2019t argue with this one, but I do want to acknowledge that it exists. If you have a legitimate need and you can\u2019t get your current workforce to expand their skills, then yes, it\u2019s probably worth bringing her in even if she only has to do real work for 15 hours a week.", "I\u2019m assuming you weren\u2019t turned off by the high costs I documented earlier. Large companies have departments whose sole job is to create something impressively innovative using ML, like a machine that can play games above human capabilities, create a convincing fake video, write coherent essays from scratch, etc. Here\u2019s the thing though: companies that do this can afford to burn billions of dollars on incredibly low probability investments. Nearly all of these efforts go nowhere, but as a courtesy of survivorship bias, you only hear about the few successes. People pay lip service to \u201ccelebrating failure,\u201d but when was the last time you saw a press release from Facebook about giving up on some AI project that turned out to be infeasible?", "Furthermore, big tech companies get an intangible benefit from creating spectacular ML outcomes even if they lead to no direct business value, because it creates the brand image of being an innovative company. This is true even if the rest of the company is stodgy and un-innovative. Things haven\u2019t really changed due to Lee Sedol being defeated by AlphaGo, but it definitely made Google look cool and maybe tipped the decision for some talent to join Google instead of someone else.", "This perception keeps the investors interested and attracts talent to the company, often to the boring jobs that actually drive value. However, investing in ML because maybe, just maybe, that ML department will develop an innovation that makes the company dominate the industry is almost like buying lottery tickets. Chances are, your company doesn\u2019t have enough cash to gamble like that.", "Don\u2019t extrapolate regular advances in a benchmark to the hope that totally new use-cases can be unlocked.", "Also, why do some believe that ML has a monopoly on innovation? Apple is widely considered an innovative company, but they have famously been behind on technology adoption. They innovated on UI/UX and became a trillion-dollar company because of it. Innovation is important, of course, but it doesn\u2019t have to be in ML!", "Don\u2019t try to forge innovation out of thin air. Necessity is the mother of invention (innovation), not the other way around. Start with a problem worth solving and work backward. If you end up with a \u201cboring\u201d solution, so be it. You\u2019ve still made the world a better place. But you should never start with a solution and work forward.", "I couldn\u2019t fit this video into the flow of point two, but it needs to be included in this article, so I\u2019ve added it here. It brilliantly illustrates a consultant\u2019s experience using simple models in production \u2014 something that is simply not talked about enough.", "This aged well! Three months after this piece was originally published (November 17, 2020), the Wall Street Journal reported that IBM is seeking to sell of Watson Health (https://www.wsj.com/articles/ibm-explores-sale-of-ibm-watson-health-11613696770) due to a lack of profitability.", "I\u2019ve also found a couple of interesting pieces on Forbes that echo the same points I made in this article.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Ex-Senior Software Dev Manager at Yahoo. Currently building web3.
