The dataset is taken from Keith McNulty\u2019s post where he had shared this use case along with the dataset. This is Part 1 of a 2 Part series on assessing the performance of managers in an organisation. In this article , I will cover the data preparation and exploratory data analysis of the dataset.", "The CEO of a company is interested in the performance of its managers. Using an experimental dataset , the key objectives of this work is to explore the following :", "I start off with loading the dataset and taking a quick view of the data. The dataset contains performance data for each manager. I have used the dataexplorer package in R to conduct a series of data exploratory analysis.", "The dataset contains a mix of character and numerical variables. Performance group is the column we want to study in relation to all the other variables in the dataset. Here is a brief description of the fields in the dataset :", "Step 2 : Exploratory Data Analysis", "Exploratory data analysis is the process to get to know the data so that we can generate and test our hypothesis. Using the data-explorer package in R , it is quite easy to visualise the content of the dataset , especially if there are missing values in the dataset.", "Here is an introduction of the dataset where we explore the dataset structure , and identify any missing values.", "We are dealing with a clean dataset which has no missing data in any of the rows. In the real world , we often encounter messy data.", "Since we are interested in the understanding of what factors drive performance group , the following table shows the distribution of data across each performance group.", "We can see that 65.8% of managers belong to the middle performance group. This is an important observation which we will refer in Part 2.", "Through bar charts , histograms , QQ plots we examine the data more closely to derive some high level insights.", "Upon a closer view of the frequency distribution of the non-numeric discrete variables we can identify that :", "Now lets visualize distributions of all the numeric / continuous variables.", "We can see that the sub plots for the variables customers , group_size , and yrs_employed are skewed either left or right.", "Next plot I have generated is the Quantile-Quantile plot which helps to visualize the deviation from a specific normal probabity distribution.", "Before doing any modeling work , it is a good practice to normalise the distributions by treating the data , such that the distributions follow closer to normal pattern (the diagonal line in the plot). We achieve this by transforming the variables to their log values. Based on the qq plot , we can see that the data for customers , group_size and yrs_employed seems to be skewed on both tails. I have applied a simple log transformation on the variables and generated the qq-plot again", "The distribution looks better now. We can also visualize the qq plot by another feature such as performance_group which is objective of our study.", "From the above plot , we can see that :", "Correlation analysis is meant to uncover any dependency / correlations of feature variables with our target variable. In other words we are trying to understand if performance is influences with factors such as years of employment , working hours , group size , number of customers etc.", "Some of the correlations are pretty much known for eg high_hours_flag_N having a negative correlation on customers. This means a manager who has not flagged high work hours is likely to have less customers.", "In Part 2 of this article , I will be sharing a machine learning based approach to explore what features affect manager performance , how strong is the effect and what is the reasoning behind that.", "Github account along with the refactored code in R : https://github.com/Sambit78/ebp_exercise", "Link to the original dataset and problem : https://github.com/keithmcnulty/ebp_exercise", "Your home for data science.
