It is a very reputed resource among data scientists and programmers.", "It also has different sections where the administrators display links for online courses, webinars, events, and jobs relevant to the community.", "Developing artificial intelligent programs is a very complex and time-consuming task. As a programmer, we often stuck in difficult coding challenges that slow down our progress.", "That\u2019s why IBM took the initiative to create a platform called Code Patterns to solve commonly faced problems by developers. They write about the best practices of working with machine learning models, data visualization, speech recognition, and everything related to the programming world.", "Jason Brownlee is the man behind this awesome blog about machine learning. At the time of writing this article, he has published 967 blog posts. It informs us about his consistency and familiarity with this field.", "I personally learned a lot of new machine learning concepts through his step by step guides.", "Jason also published 19 e-books related to machine learning and deep learning. Some of his e-books are designed for beginners while some others are for more advanced learners.", "Datanami publishes news about AI, data science, and advanced analytics.
