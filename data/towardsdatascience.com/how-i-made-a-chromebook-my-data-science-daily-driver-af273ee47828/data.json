Recently, Chromebooks have been granted the ability to install and use Android apps from the Google Play Store. For apps with sufficient optimization, this can be fantastic; getting a full-screen, perfectly normal experience of an android app, as if you were working on an Apple IPad with a dedicated keyboard. The apps run quite well, as you might imagine. Chromebook processors, for the most part, are huge contenders against a standard Android phone processor, and have the same base architecture, ARM64.", "But with a laptop, there are a lot of things that need to be done that apps can\u2019t do. Fortunately, Google\u2019s problem of straying too far from Linux has been remedied to some extent by now allowing the installation of Linux applications from a Debian-based repository. So now in ChromeOS, we have the compatibility with ARM64 applications inside of Debian repositories, as well as android applications.", "So when looking for my Chromebook, those two were my big requirements. The laptop needed to have the aptitude package manager (the package manager I use every day,) and likely would also need to be able to run Android Applications. These two major features are only in addition to the features that ChromeOS comes with in the first place. The ChromeOS UI isn\u2019t my favorite but is definitely clean, pretty, and usable.", "In my closet sits around 20 Lenovos of various eras, Thinkpads, Yogas, so obviously when I came across a Lenovo C330 Chromebook on the web listed for $30, I jumped at the opportunity. Not only would I be able to tinker with a Chromebook, but I\u2019d also add to my Lenovo collection!", "The Lenovo C330 is a great budget Chromebook, although it is ABS plastic, it feels rather solid. The keyboard is okay, a little squishy, and the trackpad is perfect for the system. It\u2019s a convertible, like my Yoga 910, but likely due to the bezels, size, and Android app compatibility, I actually do end up using the laptop in tablet mode, something that can\u2019t be said for my Yoga 910. Also, I hate to say it, but USB-C/Thunderbolt-3 charging is an absolutely enormous plus for me, as I love using", "Firstly, it should be noted that I\u2019m a computer collector and computer fanatic. Adding to my collection is always a great thing. In addition to this, I\u2019m a huge Unix fan, and distro fan. So in short, I wanted a new toy to play around with, but there are also some key benefits to using a Chromebook that are staples in the Chromebook name.", "Battery life is a key focus of many Chromebooks, and is frequently targeted by Google specifically in their Chromebook advertisements is battery life. The Chromebook I decided on charges fast, and gets around ten hours of battery life on average. Of course this varies a bit, but compared to my current daily driver, it usually doubles run time.", "Additionally, I use a lot of Google Play Services, as I\u2019m an Android user as well. Google Play Music, Google Play Movies, the convenience is certainly there, as on my daily driver I can\u2019t download anything from Google Play.", "Out of the box, Google is already bragging about their low-level APIs and compatibility layers, asking for Android apps you\u2019ve installed on your Google account to install onto your Chromebook. From these apps I chose Slack and Zoom, two apps I frequent on a daily basis. Both apps are perfectly usable on the Chromebook, so, fortunately, it\u2019s not looking like we\u2019ll need to replace either of them. In addition to these suggested apps, the first setup will place a little folder called \u201c Linux Applications\u201d into your app drawer, with a terminal application inside. Of course, this is the first thing I did on my Chromebook, prior to even opening Google Chrome.", "A quick setup will get you into a Linux terminal, where you can execute bash commands. In classical nature, the first thing I typed was", "which yielded no result. Okay, so next I decided to see how limited we would be, and CD up. When I ran cd .., I was able to access the entire / directory, though all of the files are hidden by Google, so you\u2019ll have to do ls -a instead of ls. Additionally, we have access to apt, so I went ahead and did the classic", "Next, as you might expect I decided to start installing some software. My first test was gedit, with", "Fortunately, gedit worked fine, even showing up in the application menu on ChromeOS. Admittedly also, ChromeOS\u2019s GTK theme made it blend in pretty well with the operating system.", "After I had ensured apt was working fine, I decided to go ahead and pursue Jupyter Notebooks. Which worked incredibly smoothly, with a simple", "Running the notebook server is as easy as running jupyter-notebook in your terminal. Obviously I love Python, but to be my daily driver, this computer is going to need Julia. To get Julia, it\u2019s the same thing:", "And now we have Julia, but there is a big problem\u2026 The latest version of Julia is 1.2, and the latest version in apt available for ARM64 is 0.4. And with that, there\u2019s a pretty serious Pkg bug, no Pkg REPL, and a lot of packages including Lathe for machine-learning will not be compatible with this version of Julia.", "Fortunately, we are on a virtual Debian machine, which means the galaxy of the hardworking contributors to GNU free software will cater directly to us. Debian Stretch comes pre-loaded with MultiArch, and it is rather easy to configure. Unfortunately, we will have to grab nano from aptitude real quick to edit some text files (or you can use gedit or vi if that\u2019s more your speed.)", "Luckily we can nano into our sources list for aptitude pretty easily on ChromeOS, because step one is going to be precisely that.", "You could likely get away with adding Ubuntu sources here for Apt, but I decided to continue using Debian Stretch, adding this line into the bottom of the sources file:", "Now we can add our new architecture, I decided i386 (32-bit) would be a lot easier than trying to get AMD64 (64-bit) working. We can add it quite easily buy doing", "And then we\u2019ll need to update and full-upgrade:", "But when trying to install julia for i386, we run into a new issue:", "Though a lot of applications will install fine with the ones we have, and a lot of them we can fix dependency errors with", "This isn\u2019t going to work here, as the dependencies compatibility files aren\u2019t there for arm64 compatibility. Regardless, I still decided to build the dependencies that we already have available. After a ridiculous amount of time, we\u2019ll be met with a dependency issue that is still not resolved. The only other consideration you can take in this situation is updating our package sources to the latest, that being Debian 10/buster. Of course, for stability, this is not recommended, and there is no guarantee that this will work in the first place, but this could be your last shot at installing your application. So once again, we will edit our sources file, but this time we will change all mentions of \u201c stretch\u201d to \u201c buster\u201d. Write it out, close nano, and update your sources.", "Now it might behoove us to not get an HTTP error through apt, so we\u2019ll upgrade our distribution. The environment seems to be virtual, so, fortunately, we can upgrade our distribution entirely separately from ChromeOS without the need for a kernel or grub update:", "This is going to be our last dying attempt at running our application with MultiArch, so in a perfect world, this will be the thing that gets your applications working. For Julia, I was able to get amd64 Julia running with MultiArch using the Debian 10 Buster repositories. So now I can officially dub my Chromebook as my", "ChromeOS really has come a long way from its netbook-like history. This is a great thing, because it makes Chromebooks a viable alternative, whereas previously it was not. Now you have the potential to use applications like Kdenlive, Gimp, and Open-Broadcaster Software for multimedia use, nearly every programming language, libre-office, and even system managers like Gparted. I had seen a lot of talk about installing .deb files from the internet to install, and the short-hand given with arm64, but never anybody who tried to use MultiArch! So I hope that Chromebook owners will appreciate being able to get a bit more out of their Chromebook!", "Your home for data science.
