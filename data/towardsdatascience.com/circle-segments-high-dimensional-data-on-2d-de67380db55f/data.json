Frequencies, correlations, proportions of data can be interpreted easily. These statistics also play an important role in deciding machine learning methods. Especially understanding relations between variables. Therefore, scatter-plot is one of the most used techniques to understand the distributions or relations of one or more variables on certain locations. The challenge of scatter-plot is visualizing high dimensional data. Understandable dimension by humans can only be maximum 3 as x, y and z. It means that we can only visualize three variables in the same plot as points. Besides, interpreting 3D plots is harder than 2D plots. Therefore, we might try to add colors, shapes and sizes as other dimensions to 2D plots. However, another solution for this problem is scatter-plot matrix. Scatter-plot matrix is a method that creates 2D scatter-plots with each pair of variables and displays them on matrix structure. Thanks to that we can see all scatter-plots in the same visual.", "There is also one more option for visualizing high dimensional data on 2D called \u201ccircle segments\u201d which is suggested by Ankerst, M. et al. in 2001 [1]. In this article I am going to explain; what is Circle Segments Visualization and how to apply it on \u201cmatplotlib\u201d. We will see following sections;", "As it\u2019s known, color is one of the major components of visualization. It can be used for visualizing another dimension of data without adding any axis to plotting. Circle Segments visualization technique mostly depends on colors. It basically slices the circle to amounts of variables (dimensions). Every slice represents variable values as pixels from first observation to last observation. Algorithms assign colors to every pixel according to the observed value. For instance; we set the highest value of the variable as blue and lowest value as red. Let\u2019s suppose, values of X variable increase from first observation to last observation and values of Y variable decrease from first observation to last observation. Therefore, colors of pixels in slice X will start from blue and will turn to red at the end of the slice and colors in slice Y will start from red and will turn to blue at the end. Plus, we can add more slices (variable) and compare them on 2D plotting.", "Circle Segments visualization technique processes the pixels stay under the slices. Therefore, if there is more observation the visual will have much more pixels. The pixels under the slice of the variable are processed according to the values of that variable. However, it is also important to define the direction that shows pixels are colored throughout to which line. While comparing different slices, direction plays an important role.", "The figure above shows how pixels are colored with circle segment technique. First observations start from the center of the circle and last observations end on the circle border. This approach has been suggested in the research [1]. But, when there are too many data points it might be difficult to track every pixel for understanding correlations between variables . Therefore, in another research [2], lines between slice\u2019s borders have been colored instead of pixels. This approach draws lines between slice borders and color them according to values. In this article we will create circle segment visualization by following the second approach.", "There is not any method in \u201cmatplotlib\u201d that creates circle segments visualization automatically. Therefore, we will create an algorithm on \u201cmatplotlib\u201d from scratch in this section. Before you start please make sure that you have \u201cmatplotlib\u201d installed in your system. We will use the Wine Quality data set, you can also download it from Kaggle.", "As it\u2019s mentioned before, we will draw lines between slice borders instead of pixel. This method is easier and more understandable. Therefore, we need to define how many variables will be used in visualization in order to decide how many slices there will be in the circle. In order to do that, we need to complete following steps;", "After completing this step, we know how many slices will be in use (\u201cvar\u201d at #26) and how many parallel lines will be drawn in slices (\u201cr\u201d at #23). Now, we can create a method that finds the lines will be drawn between every slice and coordinates that will be drawn as parallel to each other within slices in order to represent every value in variables. We can also find the coordinates for variable names in order to display which slice belongs to which variable.", "\u201cslices\u201d method takes two argument as \u201cnum\u201d and \u201cradius\u201d. \u201cnum\u201d represents how many slices will be in a circle and \u201cradius\u201d represents how many lines will be drawn. So, \u201cradius\u201d will be equal to the number of observations and \u201cnum\u201d will be equal to the number of variables. This method returns 3 arrays as \u201cpoints\u201d, \u201clines\u201d and \u201clabelPoints\u201d. \u201cpoints\u201d is the coordinates for lines that will be drawn between slices, \u201clines\u201d is the coordinates for lines in every slice that represent each value and \u201clabelPoints\u201d is the coordinates for locating variable names.", "We also need to create two more methods. One of them is for calculating which color should be used for a single value of a variable and the other one for creating RGB data from variables by using the first method. This process is also known as linear color interpolation. \u201cmatplotlib\u201d has its own color interpolation methods but it does not match the requirements for our visualization algorithm. That\u2019s why, we will create it from scratch.", "The method \u201ccolorFader\u201d takes three colors as HEX format. First color represents the lowest, second represents middle and third represents the highest value in the variable. What it does is take a single value between 0 and 1 and convert it to RGB code. For example, if one of the values of a variable is 1 then, RGB will be equal to the color of highest value. If it is 0.75, RGB color will be the color of mixing middle and highest color.`", "The method \u201ccolorGenarator\u201d, takes four arguments as, \u201cdf\u201d, \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmiddle\u201d and \u201chigh\u201d. \u201cdf\u201d is the Pandas data frame which includes all variables and other argument colors codes (string type HEX) for lowest, middle and highest values. Most important part is that we need to normalize every variable between 0 and 1 by using the Min-Max Normalization method. Because \u201ccolorFader\u201d assigns colors to values which are between 0 and 1. After normalization, it converts every value in the data frame in order to get their RGB codes.", "Okay! Now our all methods are ready to create circle segments visualization. All we need to do is apply these methods to our data and draw/color lines on the polar coordinate system by using \u201cmatplotlib\u201d. You can execute the following codes to create the plotting.", "After running codes above you should get the following visual. According to data size it might take some time to render the visual. Blue color represents highest values, green color represents middle values and red color represents the lowest values. For example, while the values of volatile acidity start from highest and go to middle value, the values of total sulfur dioxide start from middle and go to highest. It means when volatile acidity increases, total sulfur dioxide decreases. So, we can say that there is a negative correlation between volatile acidity and total sulfur dioxide. We can also inspect other variables by considering color patterns in detail. You can also add more variables and change the colors.", "In this article we learned how to visualize high dimensional data on 2D space by using circle segments visualization technique. We discussed what is circle segment visualization technique, how its algorithm works and how to apply this algorithm with \u201cmatplotlib\u201d. As you can see from output of technique, by using color interpolations we can easily compare different variables. Although, the technique allows to us increase number variable. Thanks to that we can inspect more variables in same plotting.", "If you any question please feel free to ask. Hope it helps\u2026", "[1] Ankerst, Mihael & Keim, Daniel & Kriegel, Hans-peter. (1996).
