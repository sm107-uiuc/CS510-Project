Where can new leads come from?", "Thankfully, some of these questions can already be answered by existing customer and leads, in your communications.", "Finding out what channel they came through to find out about your brand, which influencer converted their trust for your products, and where they have heard about your services before helps you find others like them.", "This is not a recommendation to mass-interview all your leads and customers, but to dig through all your past interactions, where most of this information likely already exist.", "Mining past and ongoing interactions helps marketing teams monitor the customer chatter, and stay ahead of emerging topics. This lead in customer insight allows marketing to focus on creating customer-supported and data-driven marketing decisions, without being overloaded by information and analysis.", "Good marketing teams can identify a few instances where leads convert to customers. Great marketing teams find leads in those stages to optimise conversions. World-class marketing teams? They find the patterns and behaviours that signal a lead-to-customer conversion so they can nurture along the way.", "How do you get from good, to world-class?", "One of the most tangible methods (obviously data-backed \ud83d\ude09) is text analysis. That is, analysing customer text data, like conversations, social media interactions and support tickets, to identify patterns of communication that people in the consideration stage share.", "This can be a pattern of communication channels they use, the types of questions they ask and even the sequence of word choice in their interactions.", "Text analytics helps find these unique nuances and patterns in communication style in your customers, to better identify future leads that are at the sweet conversion point.", "Text analytics takes away the human bias, error and inevitable mind-blowing boredom from digesting all these conversations to extract identifiers of lead value. What\u2019s left is actionable insights the marketing team can execute on, making the most of lead-to-customer opportunities.", "Marketing reports for customer experience are typically centered around quantitative numbers, for example: open rate, engagement ratio, churn and retention. It\u2019s no secret these metrics are often unable to capture the full picture of the customer experience and their satisfaction or dissatisfaction.", "This gap created results from a lack of reporting on qualitative insights. These are insights that come from the contents of unstructured data sources like customer conversations, feedback and phone transcripts. Most companies only capture the numbers around these data sources: number of tickets, problem resolution time, email open rate, engagement ratio etc.", "What\u2019s more important, especially when gauging customer opinion and satisfaction with the brand, is the contents of these interactions. When customers express their happiness with a brand, what\u2019s really meaningful is that they are expressing their opinions through words, not simply a \u201clike\u201d on a post.", "The problem with trying to capture these qualitative sources, is the perceived inability to measure them. Marketing reports are dominated by numbers, and if expressed otherwise, dwindles the trust in the work of the marketing team.", "So, how do you capture the entirety of the marketing team\u2019s good work on customer experience, while ensuring you convey its significance in numbers?", "With text analytics, some of these points previously only in the realm of qualitative insights can be captured:", "Text analysis captures both quantitative and qualitative insights from unstructured customer data. When capturing qualitative data, it takes a quantitative approach to find patterns and sequences that sheds light on the contents of the data.", "To illustrate the point, let\u2019s say we want to report on new customer-inspired targeting strategies to try this quarter. Having used text analysis on social media comments, it was found that many customers use the sequence: \u201cperson\u201d + we need this for/ we need to get this to + \u201cpurpose\u201d. In a comment, this could look like: @monica we need to get on this to meet some new vendors.", "Detecting this sequence across thousands of social media comments and multiple channels, text analysis tools like Intent Manager group together the top motivations as key insights as to why leads are interested in your product. This can then be used to create new targeting campaigns, or present customer data-backed proposals for new strategies.", "Without needing human intervention or excessive resources, text analytics, once trained, allows marketing teams to more holistically capture the fruits of their labour for reporting, and make better data-driven, customer-backed marketing decisions", "Chatbot teams face a multitude of unique challenges.", "While pursuing innovation in Conversational AI against the backdrop of outdated processes and protocols in many businesses systems, they have to maximise business value, encourage adoption and fix the tangle of customer data all while still navigating the complexity of the technology.", "Without a doubt, it\u2019s one of the toughest jobs contributing to a technology that\u2019s fast becoming a modern day business necessity.", "Thankfully, text analytics help with each of these challenges. Its ability to scale pattern and insight extraction helps chatbot teams enforce the value of their work across the organisation and resolve chatbot-specific issues like intent clashes. These techniques are particularly useful for teams working with enterprise chatbots, where data is in the 100,000\u2019s or millions.", "Let\u2019s go through some use cases for how text analysis helps chatbot teams.", "Use Case Directory: Text Analysis for Customer Service Teams", "Chatbots often start out being built for a specialised use, and when the need arises to repurpose for other teams or use cases, teams find it hard to demonstrate the same value or garner the same adoption. As a result, many teams struggle to contribute to key business values across the organisation beyond a set use or small set of goals.", "Text analysis, through micro-categorisation or \u201ctagging\u201d methods, help other teams across the organisation understand the chatbot\u2019s value by being able to personalise data interpretation for their particular business-unit needs.", "To illustrate this example, let\u2019s say a customer responds in a chatbot interaction, \u201cI can never find the files I need in Slack messages\u201d. Depending on which team you sit in, you will assign different next-best-actions \u201ctags\u201d.", "By giving teams the ability to customise the value (and thus the \u2018next best action\u2019) to their specific needs and goals, the perceived value and adoption rates of the chatbot will naturally increase. Better yet, text analysis doesn\u2019t need extensive coordination from the chatbot team, and instead empower other teams to create value from a channel which democratises Voice of Customer data.", "Additionally, more complex cross-analysis and patterns can be drawn as teams add their interpretations to the data. Combined, they provide more opportunities to find further automation opportunities, revenue-generation ideas and customer-satisfying strategies.", "As the chatbot team, you\u2019re always on the lookout for ways to optimise business processes with intelligent automation technologies. The problem is, are they worth the investment, time and resources?", "Why not get some customer input? They\u2019re telling you how they will spend more, be satisfied and refer others. All you have to do is listen.", "With text analytics, your team can actively listen to a plethora of customer opinions \u2014 from support tickets, feedback, social media comments and emails \u2014 without the hassle of monitoring.", "Analysing customer interactions can help identify automation opportunities that are:", "Whether you\u2019re looking to understand what automation opportunities will have the most impact, or understand the concerns with particular product features, text analysis helps to sort through customer input to leave your team with data-driven, customer-backed insights to action on.", "The results can also be customised to your team\u2019s goals. With human-in-the-loop training of the NLP, your team can customise topic clustering to suit changes in focus or purpose.", "Intent clashes (also known as double intent or intent conflicts) are pesky chatbot problems that stem from incorrect NLP training at the beginning of the chatbot journey. Usually, this stems from not effectively managing the huge number of questions chatbots receive.", "They are hard to detect, and even harder to identify how and where to fix, making it a costly and resource-intensive problem to correct.", "With text analysis tools like Intent Manager, chatbot teams can:", "Without needing to dedicate immense resources to backtrack on training, then manually re-categorising phrases, text analysis techniques helps chatbot teams quickly surface intent conflicts, and provide solutions to quickly resolve the conflict.", "Before we dive into the tools, here\u2019s 3 questions you should ask yourself when choosing a text mining tool for your business.", "1. What business values do I want to see?", "It goes without saying that the most important criteria for a text analysis software should be its ability to draw business-focused value. Insights shouldn\u2019t just be on what\u2019s most \u201ccommon\u201d or \u201ctrending\u201d, but should be analysed with an underlying business goal as a filter. A good tool needs to let its users customise that filter.", "2. What characteristics of my text data will I need to consider?", "Finding the best software or tools for your particular use case is highly dependent on:", "The types of text analysis techniques best employed for your use case will vary depending on these factors, and a slight change in each can greatly impact the techniques you should use.", "3. How well will it fit into my technology landscape?While it\u2019s always recommended to find the best tool for the job, it\u2019s sometimes inevitable when you have a very specific tech stack. In this case, you need to consider how well the text analytics tool will integrate. Ideally, find a tool that is technology agnostic and plays well with your stack.", "These are the first questions you should ask yourself. Here\u2019s a link to a more comprehensive list of considerations for selecting an NLP tool.", "Related: 3 Stages of Conversation Analysis, Simplified.", "With that out of the way, let\u2019s look at some text analysis tools, split by Beginner, Intermediate and Advanced levels of text analysis.", "You\u2019d be surprised how many large companies are still using a mixture of their current tools and Microsoft Excel for analysis of communications. No doubt, this is a quick way to start analysing, but it is not scalable in the long, or middle run.", "If you\u2019re at this stage, it\u2019s advised to quickly understand what it is that you want out of text analysis, and what you need in an analysis tool. Then, upgrade to that tool as soon as you can. The benefits are boundless. Hundreds of hours saved from all stages of the text analysis process, as well as faster business response for cost reduction or revenue generation.", "A lot of large organisations use these tools with their conversational analysis, and rightly so. They are easy, powered by generic NLP that works across all sectors, industries and teams.", "Though, the big down-side to many of them is that they mostly play well with their suite of products, and require expensive customisation, resources and training to mingle with other technologies you have in your enterprise landscape.
