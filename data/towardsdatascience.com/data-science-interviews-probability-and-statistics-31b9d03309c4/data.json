At the base of all data analysis lies probability and statistics, which form the foundation for thinking critically about developing and evaluating hypotheses.", "By no means should you expect to learn all the topics quickly \u2014 many of the topics involve many sub-topics which are in themselves a lifelong journey to study fully, but in general having a strong statistical background is important for the majority of data science interviews. This post will provide some very high level topics and 10 example questions within both topics. The problems discussed are featured from https://datascienceprep.com/ which covers interview questions from top tech companies.", "The beginnings of probability start with thinking about sample spaces, and basic counting and combinatorial principles. Although it is not necessary to know all of the ins and outs of combinatorics, it is helpful to understand the basics and certain methods for simplifying problems. One classic example here is the \u201cstars and bars\u201d counting method.", "The other core topic to study is random variables. It is important to know about expectation, variance, covariance, etc. along with the basic probability distributions. Whether by doing simple examples or focusing on the application side, being comfortable in the basic computations will generally be very helpful for interviews.", "For modeling random variables, knowing the basics of various probability distributions is essential. Understanding both discrete and continuous examples, combined with expectations and variances, is crucial. The most common distributions discussed in interviews are the Uniform and Normal but there are plenty of other well-known distributions for particular use cases (Poisson, Binomial, Geometric).", "Most of the times knowing the basics and applications should suffice \u2014 which one would flipping a coin be under? What about waiting for an event? And so on. However, it never hurts being able to do the derivations for expectation, variance, or other higher moments. This is likely to come up especially if the interviews are very statistics focused.", "This is the backbone behind statistical inference and can be broken down into a couple of topics. The first is the Central Limit Theorem, which plays an important role in studying large samples of data. Next includes the core elements of hypothesis testing: sampling distributions, p-values, confidence intervals, type I and II errors, etc. and understanding the mathematical details here is important in order to grasp the underlying mechanics. Each of this has important mathematical details to understand, along with applications outside of just computational problems. Lastly, it is worth looking at various tests involving proportions, and other hypothesis tests.", "Most of these concepts play a crucial role in A/B testing, which is a commonly asked topic during interviews and is what all of experimentation is based upon. Therefore, it is useful to note only understand the technical details but also conceptually how A/B testing operates, what the assumptions are, possible pitfalls, applications to real-life products, etc.", "Armed with a strong understanding of probability distributions and hypothesis testing, modeling uses both heavily and adds onto them with specific theoretical concepts and techniques. Since it is a rather broad term, we will refer to modeling as the areas will often have strong statistical intersection with ML, and include topics such as: linear regression, maximum likelihood estimation, bayesian statistics, etc. each of which will often involve many mathematical details and other theoretical details.", "Each area plays important roles in the theoretical foundations for statistical methods used in many real-life applications. For interviews focused on modeling and machine learning, knowing these topics is essential.", "If you\u2019re interested in further exploring probability and statistics in data science interviews, check out this newsletter that sends you practice problems three times a week.", "Your home for data science.
