Go is often played with 181 black and 180 white stones on a square wooden board checkered by 19 vertical lines and 19 horizontal lines to form 361 intersections. Each player in turn (black moves first) places a stone on the point of intersection of any two lines after which that stone cannot be moved, making the game a sequential game of perfect information. The objective is to conquer territory by completely enclosing empty points with boundaries made of their own stones in which the opponents stones that are enclosed are captured and taken off of the board. The player with the most points (conquered territory) wins the game (Britannica Encyclopedia).", "DeepMind is a team of scientists, engineers, machine learning experts and more, working together to advance the state of the art in artificial intelligence. They leverage their technologies for widespread public benefit and scientific discovery, and to collaborate with others on critical challenges, ensuring safety and ethic. One of their many breakthroughs was AlphaGo, the first computer program to defeat a professional human Go player, the first to defeat a Go world champion, and is arguably the strongest Go player in history (DeepMind, 2017). While the majority of AlphaGo\u2019s success can be attributed to various innovative artificial intelligence methods such as deep learning and convolutional neural networks, a lot of the concepts to allow these models to work comes from the realm of game theory. Throughout this paper, I will bring to fruition some of the various game theory concepts the scientists, engineers, and machine learning experts at DeepMind used to construct AlphaGo \u2014 one of the greatest accomplishments in recent AI history", "Go is a sequential-move game of perfect information; the players move in sequences and each player has the same information that would be available at the end of the game. When displaying and analyzing a sequential move game, we display it and analyze it in the form of a game tree, which is often referred to as an extensive form game. An extensive form game has a number of key aspects such as the sequencing of players\u2019 possible moves, their decisions at every decision point, the information each player has about the other, and the payoff at the end of each node (Games of Strategy, 2010). The following is novel game tree for the game of Go:", "A common strategy used to analyze extensive form games is rollback/backwards induction, which is the process of reasoning backwards in time, from the end of a problem (game tree), to determine any subgame perfect equilibria. In these more novel extensive form games, you can use the rollback strategy to identify any equilibria, but the catch with the game of Go is that it has 250^150 possible moves. If humans could hypothetically analyze the game tree of all possible moves using backwards induction, even all of the time since the beginning of the universe isn\u2019t nearly enough to do a full tree search in Go (DeepMind, 2020). DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo program utilized a deep reinforcement learning convolutional neural network that incorporated a Monte Carlo tree search. The Monte Carlo tree search looks ahead at only a miniscule fraction of the possible sequences that could arise from each move, counts how many wins and losses those hypothetical sequences lead to, and uses those counts to give a score to each of its possible moves (Melanie Mitchell, 2019). The following is an illustration of a hypothetical game tree for Go:", "When AlphaGo is giving itself a score in regard to each of its possible moves, in principle, we are really talking about maximizing expected utility. Leveraging the deep reinforcement neural network and Monte Carlo tree search to learn by self-play, AlphaGo would play millions of games by itself. In these games, the program would look ahead at the possible moves it could take and its payoffs to predict the winning probability if that action were to be chosen. The payoff is the agent\u2019s utility and we know we want to maximize our utility while the opponent wants to minimize our utility. So, by looking ahead (only briefly) in the tree search of possible moves, what decision will maximize the agent\u2019s utility and in parallel increase winning probability?", "Minimax is a decision rule used in game theory to find the optimal move for a player assuming your opponent plays optimally/rationally. The two players take turns being the maximizer and minimizer and with each sequence, a particular move may put the opponent in the minimizer state. When the opponent (maximizer) is minimizing your utility, the minimax algorithm is a decision rule used to minimize the worst-case potential loss. But since the game of Go has more possible moves than atoms in the universe, the minimax algorithm is unable to successfully complete its objective on the full game tree (Google AI, 2016). This is where pruning comes in. Pruning is where you \u201ccut off\u201d the branch within a game tree that is \u201cNot\u201d emerging from a second node. More simply put, it is a method to decrease the number of nodes that are evaluated by the minimax algorithm in its search tree. Remember how the game tree of Go is so extensive that even all of the time since the beginning of the universe isn\u2019t nearly enough to do a full tree search, and thus the minimax algorithm isn\u2019t able to successfully complete its objective? The alpha-beta pruning method complemented with the Monte Carlo tree search is here to save the day. Recall that the Monte Carlo tree search method looked ahead at only a miniscule fraction of the possible sequences that could arise from each move. With the alpha-beta pruning algorithm running in parallel, you get a highly effective decision-making program that seeks to maximize utility and in turn increases the winning probability (or at least we hope).", "DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo is one of the greatest accomplishments in recent AI history thanks to developments in various deep learning methods, computer processing, and computer hardware. With all of the buzzwords surrounding AlphaGo such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and reinforcement learning, some of the concepts in game theory that contributed to AlphaGo\u2019s accomplishment(s) are often overlooked. Game theory concepts and methodologies such as extensive form games, backwards induction, utility maximization, minimax, and pruning has been around for decades and it is motivating to see their applications within artificial intelligence.", "Mitchell, Melanie.
