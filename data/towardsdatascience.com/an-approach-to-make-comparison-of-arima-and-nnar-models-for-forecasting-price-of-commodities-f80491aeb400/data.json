S. A. Aashiqur Reza and Tanmoy Debnath Mathematics Discipline, Khula University", "A reliable forecasting model to predict future scenario of the price of two most commonly used commodity in our day to day life: wheat (retail) and rice (coarse). In this study, Seasonal Auto-Regressive Moving Average (ARIMA) and Neural Network Auto-Regressive (NNAR) were used were applied on the time series characteristic of rise and fall of prices of the commodities. Ljung-Box tests confirmed that both of the models had very good fitting and forecasting performances and NNAR model shows better fitting than ARIMA as the p-value of NNAR model were well above ARIMA model. RMSE, MAPE, MAE and MASE values were low enough to suggest with both of the models are capable of giving good predictions but comparatively NNAR model shown lower values than ARIMA model. Again NNAR model showed a better predictive performance than ARIMA model. The value of R-squared were 0.98 in NNAR model whereas it was 0.95 in ARIMA model in both cases. A pretty large training set was taken to calculate this value manually. Therefore, based on all these tests, NNAR model holds good for forecasting task of aforementioned series.", "In Bangladesh, wheat and rice are two of the mostly used commodities. In recent years, the behaviors of change of price of these commodities are very mysterious and hard to predict what is going to happen in next few years as the change of weather and global pandemic strikes may cause a huge leverage in this price changes. In this study, the future behavior of price changes is forecasted based on the previous behaviors. Some useful forecasting methods used to forecast the future state by doing time series analysis. These methods analyze the patterns from the available observations and make a good prediction of future outcomes.", "Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARIMA) is an adaptation of time filtering methods developed in 1930\u2019s \u2014 1940\u2019s by electrical engineers. Later in the 1970\u2019s, two statisticians George Box and Gwilym Jenkins developed a systematic method for applying them in business and economical data. This model assumes that the time series is generated from a linear process. But in real world phenomenon, systems are non-linear pretty often. The Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is such a technique that is capable of analyzing such kind of non-linear relationships among input regressor and responses. Neural Network Auto Regressive (NNAR) is one kind of ANN\u2019s in which lagged values of the time series can be used as inputs to a neural network.", "In this study, ARIMA and NNAR were used to forecast the future behavior of changes in price. A long term forecast (next 36 months from available data) was made in this studyusing both of these models. In this study, Wheat (retail) and Rice \u2014 coarse (retail) were taken under the test.", "Data was collected from internet (data.humdata.org) and analyzed and rearranged before fitting model. Prices of the commodities vary from station to station. Just like price of 1kg wheat (retail) in the Dhaka City of a particular day will not be same as it is in Khulna City. The study does not aim to forecast the prices of each station but to make a forecast of the whole country. To solve this problem, the median price of the commodities in each month was taken under consideration.", "The ACF and PACF graphs for wheat and rice shown in the figure respectively. In both cases, we see geometric impact on ACF and PACF which suggests choosing ARIMA model.", "b) Stationarity:  Firstly the test was imposed on both rice and wheat data to check if the time series data is stationary or not. In order to do so, we decomposed the time series data of rice and wheat. As we can see from both of the graphs, the bar at the right so small that implies that the price component varies with a small mean. So, that is not globally important.", "The seasonal component of the graph shows that the time series contains seasonal behavior and assures about random components which are significant on seasonal behavior. Hence the stationarity of the time series is graphically rejected. For more confirmation, we imposed Augmented Dickey Fuller (ADF) test on both datasets. The results are shown in Fig-4. As from the results we can see that p-value is higher than 0.05 which means we cannot reject the null hypothesis of ADF-test. This test confirms that both of our time series data are not stationary.", "After the confirmation of the stationariy test, we had to select ARIMA model with SEASONAL component, which is SARIMA model. SARIMA model of different order and seasons were taken under study and finally SARIMA(1,1,3)(1,1,1)[12] and SARIMA(3,1,3)(1,1,1)[12] were chosen for wheat and rice data respectively based on lowest AIC, AICc and BIC value.", "The Ljung-Box test has been performed on all the trained data set to validate their performances. Each of the model gives a p-value more than 0.05 that ensures there is a normal distribution on the residues and it does not affect the fitted. So the possibility of over fitting the data is declined by Ljung-Box test. Both models tested TSCV.", "a) ARIMA:   In ARIMA model, a non-stationary time series is made stationary by applying finite differencing of the data points. A standard notation is used of ARIMA(p, d, q) where the parameters are substituted with integer values to indicate a specific ARIMA model to use. Here, p = lagged order, d = order of differencing, q = order of moving average. The process of this model says that any time series can be described by the following equation,", "A seasonal ARIMA model is formed by introducing an additional term to the ARIMA model. It is described by ARIMA(p, d, q) (P, D, Q)[m] where the portion (P, D, Q)[m] describes the seasonal part. An ARIMA(1,1,1)(1,1,1)[4] is defined as", "Neural networks are used for complex non-linear forecasting. NNAR is generally describes by NNAR (p, k) where p = lagged inputs and k = number of hidden layers. And NNAR(p, P, k) is the general denotation of seasonal NNAR.", "The NNAR model is a feedforward neural network which involves a linear combination function and an activation function. The formations of these function are defined as,", "And the distribution of residues graph shows that residues are distributed normally which confirms that the model is free from overfitting problems.", "And the distribution of residues graph shows that residues are distributed normally which confirms that the model is free from overfitting problems.", "The most common methods to evaluate accuracy RMSE, MAE, MAPE and MASE are been considered to evaluate accuracy. General formulations of these methods are:", "The predictive capabilities of the two methods can be compared by the measures ME, RMSE, MAE, MPE, MAPE, and MASE. For two different time series, the results are shown in the tables:", "As the tables show, in both cases, NNAR method shows very good measures comparing with ARIMA, as all the value are much lower.", "Conclusion: Based on the study conducted above, the price of commodities (wheat and rice(coarse)) are moving upwards in recent future that can be a alarming sign for the economical condition of Bangladesh as both of these commodities are mostly used.", "In this study, two models NNAR and ARIMA were tested and compared to each other where NNAR showed better performance both in predictive ability with R squared \u2014 statistics and also in forecasting capabilities. The errors in the forecasting procedure were quite lower in NNAR model rather than ARIMA.", "Other Stories:1) Hands on Churn Prediction with R and comparison of Different Models for Churn Prediction", "2) Time Series Forecasting in R", "3) Market share prediction in R", "Your home for data science.
