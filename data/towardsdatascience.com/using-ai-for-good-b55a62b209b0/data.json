Automation of factories can potentially lead to higher unemployment rates in poorer nations, thereby disrupting local economies and causing other social issues. Is AI nothing but a huge threat to the developing world?", "One simply cannot deny the potential of AI to transform lives and reshape the way humans live. In well-developed countries such as the United States, AI has rapidly taken over most people\u2019s lives within the past decade. From search engines to self-driving vehicles, AI has influenced and disrupted many traditional industries by providing semi- to fully automated, cost-effective solutions. Consider the advertisement industry as an example, ads have become increasingly personalized through the adoption of computational advertising. Real-Time Bidding (RTB) based Display Advertising allows companies to target and purchase users directly, instead of buying ad keywords or ad views. All these complicated ad systems eventually boil down to simple ML techniques such as gradient boosting decision trees and factorization machines.", "If AI is so powerful, then how is it possible that it is doing nothing but harm to the developing world? The truth is, AI can also be harnessed and used properly to help the less fortunate.", "California-based startup Zipline is making a positive impact with AI by inventing a national drone delivery system to ship blood and medicine to remote medical centers in Rwanda, a landlocked East African country devastated by poverty and disease. Zipline\u2019s new, improved aerial robot is capable of making more than 500 deliveries a day from a single delivery center. Equipped with automated logistics system and cutting-edge computer vision technologies, a single Zipline drone can be launched in under just 10 minutes upon receiving an order. Currently, the company is expanding its project to Tanzania, where anti venom, rabies vaccines and other important medicines are delivered via its drones. Besides Zipline, Matternet is also another California-based drone startup that partnered with the Swiss Post in 2017. Their drone delivery system has successfully delivered healthcare supplies between labs and hospitals in Switzerland.", "Besides medical products, many of these developing countries are in desperate need of secure food source. Microsoft\u2019s Digital Agriculture project in small Indian villages such as Telengana, Maharashtra, Karnataka and Madhya Pradesh has proven to be successful. Microsoft has designed a Cortana Intelligence Suite based sowing app which incorporates Machine Learning and Business Intelligence to inform farmers the best days to sow. No significant investment is required from the farmers as all they need is a phone capable of receiving text messages from Microsoft\u2019s app. The app has aided farmers tremendously by predicting the ideal sow dates, which leads to increased crop yields. It also allows farmers to plan ahead by accurately predicting pest attacks and other potential risks such as monsoons.", "Perhaps the most important aspect in which AI can be helpful to developing countries is to improve the quality of education. Many kids in developing countries, such as the poor 8-year-old Chinese boy who walks almost 5 kilometers in freezing temperature to school do not have easy access to education. Companies such as Thirdspace Learning, Duolingo, and Carnegie Learning are working on 1-on-1 AI tutoring softwares that provide personalized and immediate access to education. With more and more million-dollar investments made in ed-tech companies such as Quizlet, Newton and Thinkster Math, there is hope that in the near future AI will be used to provide educational resources to rural areas in Third World countries.", "Since famous computer scientist John McCarthy coined the term \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d in 1956, AI has been evolving and transforming our lives every second. While many have used AI to invent state-of-the-art and highly profitable technologies, few have considered making an impact in developing countries. What are some ways that AI can change the world for the better?", "Andrew Ng what do you think?", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "ML Lead.
