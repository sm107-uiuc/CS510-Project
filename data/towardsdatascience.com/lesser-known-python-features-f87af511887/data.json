The divmod() function performs a modulus division % on two numbers, then returns both the quotient and remainder. For example:", "This is simply finding the number of times we can fit 2 into 5 , without splitting the number, which gives us 2, the quotient. After this, we still have 1 leftover, which is our remainder.", "This is particularly useful for returning the time taken for a process to run \u2014 in hours, minutes, and seconds. Like so:", "Occasionally, you may notice that a function definition contains these two arguments, like def func(x, y, *args, **kwargs).", "They\u2019re both actually incredibly simple features. Both allow us to pass multiple values to a function, which will then be packed into a generator.", "It has a similar outcome as to if we passed a list/generator to a standard argument, like so:", "Now, lets use *args \u2014 this will allow us to instead pass each value as a new argument, rather than containing them all within a list.", "Note that we didn\u2019t need to type *args , instead, we typed *values . The variable name we use is irrelevant. It is defined as an *args thanks to the single asterisk *.", "*args simply creates a tuple from the arguments we pass into a function.", "**kwargs on the other hand, creates a dictionary. Hence the name, key-word arguments. We use it like so:", "Again, we can call the variable whatever we want, in this case we used **values. It is defined as a **kwargs by the use of a double asterisk **.", "Definitely one of the most useful features of Python. Comprehension expressions are unmissable. The most common is the list comprehension, I\u2019m sure the vast majority of you will have seen these:", "But we are not limited to those square brackets. We can define a generator expression with almost the exact same syntax:", "Of-course, each element in the generator will only be output when called, which we can do with list():", "With another small change of syntax, we can even build dictionaries using dictionary comprehensions:", "A particularly interesting string method. It functions in a similar way to lower. However, casefold attempts to standardize, more aggressively, a wider range of characters.", "In most cases, lower and casefold behave the same, but occasionally, they do not:", "Here, both sigmas are already lower-case. Which, depending on the use-case, may function as expected.", "However, if we intended to compare two equivalent Greek words, one using \u03c3 and the other \u03c2. Despite being the same, only casefold would allow us to compare them accurately:", "I hope you have gained something from this article. In particular, divmod and casefold are both very interesting features that I personally had never used until very recently.", "If you have any unique, interesting, or relatively unknown Python features that you\u2019d like to share please let me know, I\u2019d love to see them!
