It is implicitly related with a product\u2019s brand and represents a competitive advantage and differentiator from competitors. With the goal of satisfying customers\u2019 needs while making profit out of it, companies and organizations have developed methodologies, frameworks and tools for addressing issues that attempt their products and services\u2019 quality. However, there are some commonly used tools that can be applied across any industry\u2013from the product development phase until its delivery\u2013for solving critical quality related issues.", "Also referred as the 7 QC tools, the seven basic tools for quality were first conceptualized by Kaoru Ishikawa, an engineering professor at the University of Tokyo, influenced by a series of lectures given by W. Edwards Deming in the 1950\u2019s. Ishikawa\u2019s seven basic tools for quality correspond to a fixed set of graphical and statistical techniques helpful in solving critical quality related issues. They are widely used to fine-tune processes as part of an overall quality assurance effort. In the same way, they are considered as basic since they can be easily implemented by any person with very basic training in statistics.", "\u201cFrom my past experience as much as ninety-five percent of all problems within a company can be solved by means of these tools and because they can be used to solve the vast majority of quality-related issues\u201d (Ishikawa, 1985, from his book What is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way).", "Also known as the Pareto distribution diagram, the Pareto chart is a vertical bar graph in which values are plotted in decreasing order of relative frequency from left to right. It represents an extremely useful tool during the first stages of analyzing a problem since it helps visualize what problems need attention first by looking at the tallest bars of the chart, which represent the variables with the greatest cumulative effect on a given system.", "Developed by the Italian engineer Vilfredo Pareto, the chart provides a graphic representation of the Pareto principle, a theory maintaining that 80% of the output in a given system is produced by 20% of the input (i.e. defects, mistakes, errors). The chart aims to identify the vital few (~20%) inputs from the insignificant many (~80%). It is a dual-axis chart where the left axis corresponds to the inputs frequencies while the right axis corresponds to their cumulative percentage. Let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a Pareto Chart.", "Also known as a run-sequence plot, the run chart is a graph that displays observed data in a time sequence. Run charts are useful for finding patterns and anomalies in data that suggest shifts in a process over time or special factors that might be influencing its variability. On a run chart, the x-axis usually represents time or run while the y-axis represents the property under observation. Let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a run chart.", "Histograms are graphical representation of data. The data is represented by columns on a graph which vary in height depending on the frequency the specific range of data occur. Histograms display data in an easy-to-interpret graphical manner; they reveal the centering, variation and shape of the data; they illustrate the underlying distribution of the data; they enable future prediction of process performance; and they allow understanding if the process is capable of meeting the customer requirements. Let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a histogram.", "Also known as the Ishikawa or fishbone diagram, the cause-and-effect diagram represents a tool that helps identify potential root causes for an effect, problem or undesirable outcome while sorting them into six major categories commonly referred as the six Ms: measurement, material, machine, method, man power and mother nature. The analyzed effect is placed on the fish head while the causes are placed on the fish spines based on their corresponding category. During the brainstorming session, the team members must continuously ask \u201cwhy does this happen?\u201d to generate potential causes; having multiple layers of causes is a common practice, where the layers indicate causal relationships. Let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a cause-and-effect diagram.", "Scatter plots are a mathematical diagram that plots pairs of data on an X-Y graph in order to reveal the relationship between the data sets. They require two sets of data: the first one commonly referred as the independent variable (x) and the second one commonly referred as the dependent variable (y). Scatter plots help determine if correlation between data sets exists. In other words, if there is an existing relationship between variables which tend to occur together in a way not expected on the basis of chance alone. However, even though scatter plots might suggest correlation between data sets, one should always take into consideration that correlation does not necessarily imply causation. Let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a scatter plot.", "Control charts are graphic representations that depicts whether samples of products or processes are meeting their intended specifications and, if not, the degree by which they vary from those specifications. They allow monitoring if a process is under statistical control; help visualize variation; find and correct problems when they occur; predict expected ranges if outcomes; and analyze patterns of process variation from special causes.", "Control charts are divided into two main groups: one for monitoring discrete data \u2014 which is further divided by the sample size (e.g. X-MR chart, I-MR chart, x-bar chart, R-chart and s-chart)\u2014 and the other for monitoring continuous data \u2014 which is further divided by the numbers of defects per unit and then by the sample size (e.g. c-chart, u-chart, np-chart and p-chart). For the following example, let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a c-chart.", "If interested in learning more about when to use each type of control chart, how to interpret their results and the R codes to build them, please refer to my previous articles here.", "Also known as defect concentration diagram, a check sheet is a structured, prepared form for collecting and analyzing data in real time and at the location where the data is generated. It is typically a blank form that is designed for the quick, easy and efficient recording of the desired information, which can be either quantitative or qualitative. One of its main characteristics is that data is recorded by making marks (i.e. checks) on it. Some of the advantages if using check sheets include: effective way of displaying data; easy to use; can identify the root cause of a problem; can be used to substantiate or refute allegations; and represent the first step in the construction of other graphical tools. Let\u2019s take a look at the following R code to generate a basic check sheet.", "As seen on the code above, coding in R might not be the most efficient and effective way for developing check sheets. However, I did not want to conclude this article without addressing and coding them. It is up to the engineer to decide the best tool/program/software to be used for their development, but for simplicity, I would not recommend you using R.", "The seven basic quality tools examined in this article represent highly useful tools for developing root-cause analyses, conducting lean six sigma projects and for managing quality improvement initiatives.", "Engineers must become familiar and comfortable with these tools to pull the appropriate one out of their engineering toolbox to approach problems within a given system and to help maintain the consistency of the products and services being produced.", "One of the main advantages of having their R codes is their reproducibility by just having to modify their initial inputs. This article does not intend to convince the readers to strictly use R for when developing these tools, but instead to introduce how to develop them in a free and open-source software with just a few lines of code.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
