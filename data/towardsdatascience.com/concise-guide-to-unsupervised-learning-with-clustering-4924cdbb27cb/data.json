From these datasets, our machine learning model built can predict the results for similar data. This process is what happens in supervised learning.", "An example of supervised learning is for determining if the patient appears to have a tumor. We have a large dataset with a set of parameters of their patients matched with their respective results. We can assume that this is a simple classification task with \u20181\u2019 for tumor and \u20180\u2019 for None.", "However, let\u2019s say we have a dataset of dogs and cats. There are no pre-trained results for us to determine which one of them is a cat or a dog. Such kind of problems that have unlabeled datasets can be solved with the help of unsupervised learning. In technical terms, we can define unsupervised learning as a type of machine learning that looks for previously undetected patterns in a data set with no pre-existing labels and with a minimum of human supervision. Clustering and association are two of the most important types of unsupervised learning algorithms. Today, we will be focusing only on Clustering.", "Using certain data patterns, the machine learning algorithm is able to find similarities and group these data into groups. In other words, Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that objects in the same group (called a cluster) are more similar (in some sense) to each other than to those in other groups (clusters).", "In clustering, we don\u2019t have any predictions or labeled data. We are given a set of input data points, and using these we need to find the most similar matches and group them into clusters. The clustering algorithms have a wide range of applications that we will discuss in future sections.", "Let us analyze the various clustering algorithms that are available. We will discuss the three most prevalent and popular algorithm techniques among the many existing approaches available to us. We will also understand the performance metrics used for unsupervised learning and finally discuss their applications in the real world.", "There are lots of clustering algorithms but today we will be focusing mainly of the three most popular and important types of clustering algorithms. These clustering algorithms are \u2014", "We will analyze each of these algorithms in detail and understand how they exactly work. We will also look at the advantages and limitations of these algorithms. So, without further ado, let us get started!", "The K-means clustering algorithm is one of the most popular methods for performing clustering analysis. In K-means clustering, the hyperparameter used for evaluation is \u2018K.\u2019", "The number of clusters will determine the type of clustering classification that will be performed. In the above figure, we can assume that the value of K chosen is 3. The value of K will determine the number of centers that will be considered for the process of segregation and grouping.", "The \u201ccorrect\u201d value of the hyperparameter K can be determined with methods like grid search or random search. Hence, we can say that the main objective of K-means is to find the best centroids and group the clusters accordingly in a suitable manner for the particular dataset.", "Steps to follow for K-means clustering \u2014", "The above image is a representation for the convergence procedure of K-means.", "Connectivity-based clustering, also known as hierarchical clustering, is based on the core idea of objects being more related to nearby objects than to objects farther away.", "The concept of hierarchical clustering is basically grouping of similar things from either bigger chunks to smaller chunks or vice versa. This point can be understood better when we look at the two types of hierarchical clustering methods which are as follows:", "The agglomerative clustering is usually preferred over the divisive clustering. So, we will look further into the analysis of agglomerative cluster rather than divisive.", "The above dendrogram is a representation of how hierarchical clustering and specifically how agglomerative clustering works.", "Let us understand the steps involved in the process of agglomerative clustering \u2014", "DBSCAN stands for Density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise and is gaining a rising popularity. In DBSCAN, we create clusters that for the areas of higher density than the remainder of the data set. Objects in sparse areas that are required to separate clusters are usually considered to be noise and border points.", "DBSCAN utilizes two important hyperparameters in minimum points (or MinPts) and epsilon \u03b5. Before we look at the steps on how to solve these problems, let us analyze how these hyperparameters exactly work.", "For the implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm, the stepwise procedure we need to follow is as described below:", "The performance metrics used in supervised learning like AUC (Area under ROC curve) or ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) curve does not work for unsupervised learning. Hence to evaluate the performance metric of unsupervised learning, we need to compute some parameters like intra-cluster and inter-cluster. Take a look at the below reference diagram.", "Intra-cluster: The distance between two similar data points belonging to the same cluster.", "Inter-cluster: The distance between two dissimilar data points belonging to different clusters.", "The main objective of any good clustering algorithm is to reduce the intra-cluster distance and maximize the inter-cluster distance. One of the main performance metrics that is used for clustering is the Dunn Index parameter.", "Dunn index: The Dunn index aims to identify dense and well-separated clusters. It is defined as the ratio between the minimal inter-cluster distance to maximal intra-cluster distance. For each cluster partition, the Dunn index can be calculated by the following formula:", "The first line in the ratio is trying to minimize the inter-cluster distance, and the second part is trying to increase the intra-cluster distance. Since the internal criterion seeks clusters with high intra-cluster similarity and low inter-cluster similarity, algorithms that produce clusters with high Dunn index are more desirable.", "If anyone is confused by this statement, please consider the Dunn index \u2018D\u2019 as a parameter that measures the worst cases of both parameters, and hence when \u2018D\u2019 is high, it is considered as desirable clustering. Other performance metrics choices are available such as Davies\u2013Bouldin index, but the Dunn index is usually more preferred in most cases.", "There are a ton more applications to clustering, and I would highly recommend all of you to check out the various applications that you can utilize in the field of clustering.", "Clustering is an extremely important concept of machine learning that can be used for a variety of tasks. It can also be very useful in the data mining process and the initial stages of exploratory data analysis. The above diagram is an image of a graph constructed using TSNE after the application of clustering on the data.", "With the help of the three aforementioned algorithms, you should be able to solve most of the clustering tasks quite easily. The techniques and applications mentioned give us a brief insight into why clustering algorithms are helpful in categorizing the unlabeled datasets. I hope this article was helpful in explaining these concepts.", "Check out these other recent articles that you might be interested in reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope you enjoyed reading the article. Wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Love to explore and learn new concepts.
