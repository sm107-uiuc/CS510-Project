Linearity by the book | by \u0141ukasz Gebel | Medium | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Is a straight line linear?", "description": "The term linearity is used in Data Science, Machine Learning and Math, but when something is linear by the definition? Straight line is not the answer."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["This simple question \u201cis a straight line linear?\u201d came to my mind and couldn\u2019t get out of it. It seems to be obvious, so it should have an obvious answer. However, when I dig into the research and try to find proof for this simple answer, I realized it\u2019s more complex than I thought and more interesting!", "Linearity and non-linearity are terms commonly used in Data Science and Math. We try to figure out if a problem can be solved using linear or non-linear models, or if our data is linearly separable. If we widely use these terms, it\u2019s important to understand them well, isn\u2019t it? So what does it mean that something is linear by the book?", "Let\u2019s think and try to visualize linearity. What comes to your mind? For me, it\u2019s a simple straight line. Such a line is described by the following formula:", "And indeed it is called a linear function [1]. In this formula, we have a variable x, and two parameters a and b. Let\u2019s assume that a = 1, b = -2, and plot it:", "We also tend to think about linearity in terms of proportionality [2]. It means that the input is proportional to the output. Such intuitive thinking is natural for us, however, we need to remember that formally proportionality is a separate, wider term.", "By definition proportionality of two variables or quantities is a relation that occurs when ratio or product of these quantities is a constant. Having variables x and y, they are proportional if:", "Where k is a constant. In this situation, if x is increasing, y also is increasing. The same applies when we decrease our variables, it\u2019s proportional.", "Variables are inversely proportional if their product is a constant:", "To check if it fits our intuition, we can transform this formula like this:", "Assuming that k is greater than 0, and y is not equal to 0, while increasing y, x is decreasing. So everything is ok, it\u2019s inversely proportional.", "Having in mind our intuitive thoughts on linearity, let\u2019s confront it with the formal definition.", "To call given relation, or a function, linear it should satisfy two properties (also known as superposition) [3]:", "Additivity is described by the following formula:", "It means that the result of a function for the sum of inputs should be equal to the sum of the function\u2019s results for each input separately.", "So let\u2019s check if the function we drew before satisfies additivity. Just to quickly remind you, our function has parameters a = 1, b = -2, and its formula looks like this:", "To check additivity we\u2019ll assume that x = 2, y = 3. Now we need to calculate values of the function for the left and right side of additivity formula and check if they are equal. Let\u2019s start with the left side:", "Now let\u2019s calculate the right side of the formula:", "Oops, 3 is not equal 1, it means that our linear function does not satisfy additivity, which is a required property of linearity. So it\u2019s not really linear\u2026", "Maybe at least it\u2019s homogeneous [3]? But first, what does it mean that function is homogeneous? Let\u2019s say we multiply input x by a factor d and calculate the output of the function f(dx). Then let\u2019s calculate the value of such expression df(x). According to homogeneity property, both results should be equal. It\u2019s elegantly expressed by the simple formula:", "Now, we\u2019ll do the same experiment as for additivity and check if our sample function satisfies homogeneity property. Let\u2019s assume that d = 4, x = 2 and calculate the left side of the formula:", "And then let\u2019s calculate the right side:", "Hmm, 6 is definitely not equal 0, again our function doesn\u2019t meet linearity requirements, this time in terms of homogeneity.", "If our simple linear function doesn\u2019t meet either of linearity requirements, which function does? Actually, it\u2019s even simpler linear function with parameter b = 0:", "What is characteristic, functions described with such formulas go through the origin of the coordinates system (in the 2D system it\u2019s (0,0)) [4].", "Let\u2019s check if it really satisfies the requirements of linearity. We\u2019ll assume that a=2, so our function is described by f(x) = 2x.", "We go for additivity first. Calculating the left side of additivity formula for x = 2, y = 3, we get:", "And for the right side of the formula we have:", "So far so good! 10 is equal to 10, so our function is additive, great. Let\u2019s check homogeneity then.", "Assuming that d = 2, x = 4, we can calculate the left side of the homogeneity formula:", "Ok, it\u2019s 16, let\u2019s check the right side of the formula:", "Yes! Our function is homogeneous. It satisfies both requirements of linearity, so we can tell it\u2019s \u201ctruly\u201d linear.", "The answer is: it depends. As you can see not all of the linear functions comply with strict requirements of linearity. Of course, it doesn\u2019t mean that all of us make a huge mistake by using the term linear function. We just need to be careful in which context we use it.", "Math is a really complex domain, containing a lot of different branches. The term linear function we use on a daily basis is perfectly correct in terms of calculus. In this context, every straight line is a linear function.", "However, in terms of linear algebra only a subset of linear functions is truly linear (these with b = 0). It\u2019s a wider context where we think in terms of linear mappings and linear systems (models that use linear operators). In this context, with strict requirements, a straight line may not be linear.", "Answering the original question we learned not only about linearity but also about the value of asking really obvious questions. They help us to obtain clarity and understanding of concepts we think we fully understand.", "Your home for data science.
