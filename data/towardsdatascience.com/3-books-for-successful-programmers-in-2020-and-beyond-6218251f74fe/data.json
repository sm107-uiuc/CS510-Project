However, this article is not about preaching to you about the necessity of reading for a successful life.", "After all, by opening this page, you voluntarily decided to spend the next 10 minutes of your life learning about good books to read, so I will go ahead and assume that you are a firm believer in the Leaders are Readers dogma and jump straight to the point.", "In today\u2019s information abundant age, given any topic of consideration, you will find a massive cornucopia of available resources to study. Once you decide you want to learn about something, you quickly find yourself facing the Tyranny of Choice regarding: \u201cSince there is so much out there, where should I start?\u201d", "This is where I can help. Assuming you are interested in the art of software development and how to push yourself to the next level, let me present to you my 3 personal favourites on the subject. Not a daunting 25 to scare you off, but just 3, as this is more than enough to to get you started.", "For each book, let me give you a brief summary of the content, explain how the book\u2019s lessons are directly applicable in the current state of affairs of our techno-maniac economy and how knowledge of this translates into an edge over your competitors.", "In addition to making me a more effective programmer (and an overall better person), these books helped me make sense of education, technology and business and how these are all tied together in humanity\u2019s relentless quest for innovation. I sincerely believe that they can do the same for you. Hence, without any further ado, let\u2019s get started with Book 1).", "Have you ever wondered where Facebook gets its ridiculously large revenues? Or how does Apple get away with charging such a hefty premium for a phone of almost identical quality as the one of Samsung? Well, read this book and you will wonder no more.", "The Four is an eye-opening excursion deep into the inner workings of the 4 technological giants, Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google. After reading it, you will understand and truly appreciate the immense power that gets unlocked when one combines abundance of data with smart algorithms that are able to extract valuable information from it.", "Once recognised, you will no longer be puzzled with Facebook\u2019s market valuation being hundreds of billions of dollars despite it being \u201cjust a social network\u201d that seems not to do much. Spoilers, it does A LOT under the hood.", "I find particularly useful the later chapters in the book where the author offers advice for young people entering the industry on how to take advantage of the economy created by the Four and set themselves up for success.", "Said another way, if you want to flourish in today\u2019s job market dominated by Facebook, Amazon, Google and Apple, you can think of this book as a practical guide for navigating this complex landscape placed in the intersection of business, marketing, education and technology.", "Great, after finishing book 1) you will be familiar with the rules of the \u201cbig technology\u201d game and ready to conquer the world. That being said, getting admitted to play in the big leagues at one of the Four is not exactly a walk in the park, especially for new joiners.", "Luckily, book 2) is all about getting you past those dreaded gate keepers in the form of technical interviews and helping you kickstart your technological career by landing your first dream job.", "This book has become a sort of bible for university students in computer science looking to land their internships and first full time gigs at one of the fancy tech companies, again Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google but this time the list gets extended by Microsoft and Palantir. For the purpose of the next few paragraphs, let us call the collection of these 6 companies \u201cThe Six\u201d.", "The underlying assumptions (which hold true by the late 2020) on top of which the Book 1) and Book 2) build their content are 3-fold:", "Assumption 1 is covered thoroughly in Book 1). Now, Book 2) is concerned with points 2 and 3. More precisely, its purpose is to get young, ambitious, aspiring tech superstars ready to excel at a technical interview with one of The Six and, consequently, land the job of their dreams.", "The interviews at these companies are notoriously technical and extreme focus is paid to candidates ability to solve problems and write code. The structure of the book respects this current state of affairs and is organised into 2 parts.", "The first part (the soft skill part) is about the non technical aspects of the job, like what you should wear, what questions is ok to ask, how to do an effective elevator pitch and how to talk about your past experience to get the interviewer interested.", "It also contains a list of the strict DON\u2019Ts that will instantly close the doors for you no matter how talented you are. Be sure to note these down somewhere and avoid them at all costs.", "The rest of the book (i.e. over 80% of it) is the so called technical part and is a collection of sample problems candidates were presented with in real world interviews at one of The Six with descriptive solutions attached to them.", "You probably won\u2019t have time to go through all of the hundreds of technical examples the author presents in the technical part. Do not worry, neither did I. What I do recommend though, is to study the first part of the book in detail and then solve a couple of problems from each technical section.", "Believe it or not, a lot of savvy engineers that are ready to recite hash map implementations from on top of their head often get caught completely off guard by simple queries like: \u201cSo Tomas, tell me a little bit about yourself\u201d. Been there myself and it is not fun! The first part of Book 2) is designed specifically so that you do not end up like me, so do not skip it.", "Finally, even if you do not intend to work for one of The Six, going through the book and learning the art of nailing job interviews (both the technical and non technical aspects of it) might very well prove to be one of the most valuable investments you do in your life.", "That is, because the interview has become the de facto standard for getting a job in our day and age. If you prepare yourself for interviews at The Six, (i.e. one of the hardest interview processes out there), you should be more than ready to pass with flying colours interviews for pretty much any other job in the world.", "Great, after reading books 1) and 2), you know what the ballpark of the technology game looks like and you also know how to get to play with the other cool kids at Googles and Facebooks of the world.", "Now you might be asking yourself: Once Im in the big leagues, how do I make myself stand out? What separates the Cristiano Ronaldos from the local ballers in the technology world?", "The short answer is hard work and experience. There is now way around it. However, you can accelerate your rise by dedicated study and mentorship from top performers that are senior to you.", "Imagine the senior engineers, all the pitfalls they had to face throughout their careers and the countless lessons they have learnt from them. It is this hard earned wisdom which makes them so great at what they do. Wouldn\u2019t it be nice if it was written down somewhere for the younger generation to study and apply it to their practice, without paying for it with their own blood, sweat and tears?", "Good news! Book 3) (The Pragmatic Programmer) is exactly that, a compilation of tips, tricks and habits that effective programmers use to write clean, well designed code, meet business deadlines and deliver cutting edge software while earning credit for their work and trust of fellow engineers as well as key business stakeholders.", "The truth is that software engineering is not a sprint, but a marathon. To climb the ladder of success as a programmer, you need to produce high quality work, and you need to produce it often, on a steady and consistent basis.", "As an example of how Book 3) can help you become a software engineering top performer, see bellow my 3 favourite tips from the book that I use on a regular basis and I can readily attest that their adoption has made me better at what I do (there are, of course, many other cute tricks in the book)", "Fun fact: Tip 3 is a favourite piece of wisdom my current skip level manager at Amazon likes to give to recent joiners in the team. I wonder if he got it from this book as well\u2026", "Using myself as an example, I read Book 3) while I was going through the cognitive dissonance triggered by being thrusted into an America Corporation right out of university. Back then, I thought that as a programmer I will spend most of my time writing code. I was dead wrong\u2026", "As I was about to learn the hard way, software engineering is a very complex discipline which presents its practitioners with vaguely defined problems, tight deadlines and ever demanding customers.", "To be successful, you will need to master more skills in addition to coding. This is because writing code is only one part of the end-to-end solutions that you will be delivering, and, actually, a relatively small one.", "Luckily, Book 3) can equip you with a pragmatic philosophy which seeks to find the right balance between making the code pure and keeping the business running.", "With the pragmatic mental operating system in place, you are not only avoiding insanity stemming from the ambiguity and pressure that comes with building important software, but you are also setting yourself up for success in this ever demanding and exciting domain.", "Thank you for reading my article", "Looking for a mentor to help you thrive in the tech world?Subscribe to my Email List!", "Tomas YeGymnast, Mathematician and Software EngineerFeel free to connect with me on LinkedIn:", "Your home for data science.
