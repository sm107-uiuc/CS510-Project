I opened the door and I saw a big figure wearing a red coat, red pants, and a funny red hat. I\u2019ve never been so surprised in my life: the man staring at me was Santa in person!!!", "TL;DR; what he wanted from me was a piece of software to optimize his delivery for December 24th. His request was to find the shortest route given 342 cities. He needed a cyclic path starting and ending in Lapland.", "Here\u2019s a video for convenience! The link to the live JavaScript visual is at the end of the article!", "What follows is the conversation I had with Santa!", "Andrea: Hi Santa, let me prepare a cup of tea, in the meanwhile, why don\u2019t you explain to me your problem?", "Santa: Ho Ho Ho! Well, as you know every year during the night between the 24th and 25th of December, I need to deliver billions of toys all over the world. It\u2019s a very challenging task, Andrea. I\u2019m wondering if Computer Science can simplify my life. How can visit every city travelling for the shortest distance possible?", "Andrea: Ok, this sounds familiar, can you expand a bit on your problem?", "Santa: Of course. I have a list of 307 cities, those with the largest population. I would like to know which is the shortest path that visits all of these cities only once. As you might know, I need to depart from my house in Lapland, and Lapland is also the last stop of my trip! Obviously, I need to touch more than 307 cities, but I want a strategic plan, not operational. Once I\u2019ve reached the major places, I\u2019ll figure out with the reindeers how to move to the nearby towns!", "Andrea: Ok Santa. I think your request is clear. Actually what you are describing is a very classical problem in Computer Science: it is called the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP), and its qualitative formulation is pretty much what you just told me. I have bad news though: it\u2019s very difficult to solve! Let me draw a small sketch to see if we agree on what\u2019s the task!", "Let\u2019s say that we want to focus only on the major US cities, then the route that you are looking for is something like the following:", "Santa: Oh Andrea that\u2019s exactly what I am asking for! Just remember that I can fly! By the way, can you explain to me why it is so difficult?", "Andrea: Well, the TSP belongs to a class of problems known as NP-Complete problems. Not sure you want to know the mathematical definition, but from a practical standpoint, in over a hundred years of research, nobody has found a fast method to solve any of those and these solutions are unlikely to exist.", "Santa: How hard can it be?", "Andrea: If you run a brute force algorithm for what you are asking (which means testing all the possible solutions and picking the best one), it can take LITERALLY hundreds or thousands of years to get the results! Even with modern technologies. Luckily for you, there are some smarter ways to deal with many TSP instances!", "Santa: Ho Ho Ho! This is great news! I am happier than that day I fell in the marshmallows pool! Can you tell me what are the alternatives?", "Andrea: Of course. There are a few strategies:", "Before recommending you something, may I know what is your budget and what is your deadline?", "Santa: Oh well, unfortunately, my deadline is quite strict, I need the solution by Sunday night, so you would have a day and a half to implement everything. On the other hand, I have an infinite budget! The National Bank of Christmas can print as many Magic Dollars as I want! Note also that I want nothing else than the optimal route among the 307 cities!", "Andrea: Ehm\u2026 ok. Indeed the deadline is quite close; since you need the optimal route we are going to go with Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP). There are many tools that we can use, some of them are commercial, like CPLEX or Gurobi. Some of them are free to use only for academics, like SCIP. Some of them are open-source, such as GLPK and CBC.", "Now, you told me that you have an infinite budget, but unfortunately, Gurobi and CPLEX won\u2019t accept Magic Dollars as currency, so we\u2019ll need to use GLPK or CBC; the latter is usually faster and can be used with Python, so I suppose we have our base tools!", "Santa: Wooow! Amazing Andrea! Let\u2019s start then. Many are unaware that a long time ago I graduated in Mathematics. I would be really happy if you\u2019d explain the model.", "Andrea: Oh great, it\u2019s always fun to write down some formulas, it makes me feel smarter! First, let\u2019s see the solution that we are looking for in a sample situation:", "This can be roughly described as follows:", "To express this solution using Linear Programming we need to define some variables: given that we have n cities, we could create one variable for each pair of cities i and j, y\u1d62\u2c7c.", "Now, y\u1d62\u2c7c will be equal to 1 if in our best route we need to go from city i to city j straight forward (directly, without first passing through another city), y\u1d62\u2c7c will be equal to zero in case that connection is not chosen. c\u1d62\u2c7c is the cost of the connection between city i and city j. Let me write the model:", "Santa, the issue with this object is about the \u201cNo Sub-tours\u201d constraints (e.d. see the image above). A sub-tour is a cycle that does not visit all the cities, but only a subset. We want to have a single cycle, so those inequalities aim to remove the possibility of having more than one cycle.", "This is why we need to find a better strategy.", "What we can do is apply the following algorithm:", "Maybe later we should make a sketch to clarify these steps.", "Santa: Oh, that\u2019s fantastic Andrea! Thanks for the explanation! So the idea is to remove that huge number of constraints and add only those that are necessary to obtain a solution with a single cycle. Ahhh sweet memories! And is this the best method to solve this problem?", "Andrea: Of course not Santa. There are many other types of constraint that we could add to the model to reduce the number of iterations needed to get to the optimal solution (they are called \u201ccuts\u201d, from cutting). But you told me that we only have two days so we\u2019re going for the simplest way.", "Santa: Ho Ho Andrea, I would also like to see some code. You know, the whole IT System that we have at Santa\u2019s House is written in Pascal, we\u2019d really need some renovation. Could we do some old-but-gold pair programming so that I can start to delve into Python?", "Andrea: Oh wow, absolutely Santa. Let\u2019s implement this together.", "As I told you, we need to relax the model removing \u201cNo sub-tour\u201d inequalities (these are technically called SECs, Sub-tour Elimination Constraints). Our model becomes the following:", "As I explained earlier, if we solve the above we may have those very famous sub-tours. For example, the following image is the solution to the relaxed model using 18 cities:", "As you can see the solution is satisfying all the constraints: it is optimal and each city has only one incoming edge and one outgoing edge. But we do not want sub-cycles! As I said, we need to:", "Now that we have added all the new cuts, let me show you what happens if we solve the problem:", "We begin to see the shape of the solution! Finally, if we iterate the process\u2026 Boom!", "Andrea: It\u2019s time to write some code. First of all, we are going to need some libraries. The most important one is PuLP. From their website: PuLP is an LP modeler written in Python. PuLP can generate MPS or LP files and call GLPK, COIN CLP/CBC, CPLEX, and GUROBI to solve linear problems. PuLP comes bundled with CBC. We also need networkx, a Python package for the creation, manipulation, and study of the structure of networks (we need it to identify the sub-tours during the optimization process).", "Let\u2019s create a Python class that will solve the problem. First, we need to read the cities (here we can have the list of the world\u2019s cities with the population and the geographical coordinates). Since your house location is not in the list, Santa, we\u2019ll add it to the data; moreover, we will add some more cities to improve the world\u2019s coverage:", "Now, we need a function to calculate the distance between two locations (using latitude and longitude coordinates). Your vehicle is a sleigh pulled by magical reindeers, so the distance as the crow flies will be a good approximation:", "Nice! We can write the function to build the model:", "Good. It\u2019s time for the complicated part.", "We have to get the current solution and build the corresponding graph. We\u2019ll use networkx. After that, we need a function to:", "We are ready to write the function that solves the model!", "Done, dear Santa, we just have to call the methods!", "Santa: I can\u2019t wait to execute the code!", "Andrea: Me too! Let\u2019s see how long it takes and how many SEC constraints we need to add to get to the solution! We\u2019ll use JavaScript to visualize the results; more specifically we\u2019ll implement the visuals on a map using Leaflet along with Leaflet.motion plugin!", "I\u2019ll run the code on my laptop:", "First of all, we will try to use your 308 cities (307 plus your house in Lapland):", "As you can see, we are not covering some countries, let include some more cities. Consider that we now have 342 cities (341 plus your house in Lapland):", "In this case, the time needed to find the solution DECREASED when we added more cities to visit. This is not an uncommon outcome when TSP is solved using Linear Programming. Of course, the number of nodes (and by consequence number of variables and constraints) can have an impact on the execution time, but quite often what makes the problem hard is the actual layout of the cities on the map. Even adding a single city (or removing one!) can worsen the performance dramatically!", "Santa: Ho Ho Ho! Andrea! That\u2019s really Amazing! I owe you a lot! Everybody will get their gifts on time! You helped me making people happier!", "Andrea: Well Santa, actually there\u2019s already Amazon that does something similar, but, you know, they do not accept Magic Dollars too, so I think we did a good job for the given conditions!", "Santa: Thank you. I don\u2019t understand why nobody is accepting my magic money, but I\u2019m glad you do!", "This is my story. It\u2019s been a pleasure to help Santa Claus with these few concepts.", "Thanks for reading until here and contact me if you need some spare Magic Dollars!", "Your home for data science.
