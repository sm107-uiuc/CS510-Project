The prediction is State-Of-The-Art! Bravo!", "Share it with the world of course! It has such great potential and no one has done this before, you want everyone to try it out! How? You ask.", "In this tutorial, I\u2019ll introduce you to an affordable and flexible way of deploying your trained Machine Learning model. I\u2019ll walk you through every step in the way and hopefully, after reading this article, you\u2019ll have no issue deploying your \u2018next big thing(model)\u2019 to the world.", "First of all, you need to train your model and export it. In this article, we\u2019ll use Fast.ai\u2019s library to showcase how it\u2019s done. You may want to refer to my two-part articles about how to collect data and train a Chinese Calligraphy Classifier model or you can also use your own model. For the purpose of this article, I\u2019ll assume that you already trained the model and achieved your desired accuracy rate.", "Fast.ai uses a learn object to train the model, to export your model, use methodlearn.export() to export and save your trained model to a export.pkl file(my model export file from the link above is around 100MB). Save this file, we\u2019ll use that later.", "With the model ready, the next step is web app development. I assume you are a full-stack web developer, so let\u2019s jump right into coding. No, I\u2019m just kidding here. We\u2019ll use a boilerplate web app template on GitHub to quickly get your web app ready. You only need to do some minor tweaks and you\u2019ll be ready to go. If you don\u2019t know what GitHub is, it is a place to hold the source code of a lot of open-source applications. I already put a ready-made web app\u2019s code there so you can easily download and reuse.", "Go to this GitHub repository, click the big green button \u2018Clone or download\u2019 on the right side, like below:", "On the pop-down window, copy the link, then go to your terminal and type:", "These commands will clone all the required code onto your local machine, under a folder named fastai-vision-uvicorn-gunicorn-starlette-docker and enter that folder. This is the main folder we\u2019ll be working on, there are a couple of things in it that worth explaining:", "app: The structure of this appfolder is as below:", "This is where your Starlette web app source code resides. It has a very simple Python file main.py. The Starlette is a lightweight ASGI framework/toolkit, which is ideal for building high-performance asyncio services.", "It also has the saved model fileexport.pkl. The template folder holds an HTML template file app.html which will serve as your web app UI.", "Remember the exported export.pkl file you saved? Pull that out and replace the one in this app folder. So the app will use your model. You are also welcomed to update the app.html file for better-looking UI, but it\u2019s not necessary as far as deployment is concerned. Now the source code of your web app is ready, we need to wrap it into a Docker container and do some testing. We use the Dockerfile as the config file. We\u2019ll explore more in the next section.", "We will use Docker to create a container where our web app runs. If you don\u2019t know what Docker is, just know that it is kind of a mini virtual machine, with all the necessary libraries and dependencies installed so the app can run smoothly. It is smaller and more flexible than real Virtual Machine and can be created and deployed very easily.", "First, you need to install Docker. Here is a very thorough guide for your reference. After installation, if you are running Ubuntu, then it\u2019s beneficial to run the following commands:", "This will eliminate the need to use sudoevery time you enter a docker command. Reboot, now docker should be properly installed.", "In the same directory where app folder and Dockerfile resides, we need to create a docker image that contains all source code within this folder so we can test things out. Enter the following command(don\u2019t forget the \u2018.\u2019 at the end):", "This will start a docker image building process according to the Dockerfile. It will take a while, so let\u2019s take a brief look at what\u2019s inside the Dockerfile:", "Line 1: Specify from which starter image we\u2019ll build our docker image. We use tiangolo/uvicorn-gunicorn-starlette:python3.7 . You can find its GitHub link here and Docker Hub link here.", "Line 2,3,4: Install fast.ai library, jinja template framework, Starlette framework, and other utilities.", "Line 5: Copy your app folder into docker image so our app can run within the docker container.", "Line 6, 7: Assign work directory to the app folder and expose port 80 to outside so we can visit the web app through port 80(HTTP).", "Once the docker image is created, run docker images to check. You\u2019ll find something like:", "Now we can fire up a docker container from the created image and test your app locally:", "On the above docker command, we specified the port to be 80. We transferred two environment variables into the container, TITLE and SUBTITLE, they will be used to display our web app UI titles. At the end we specified our docker image name: test_app. Please note that for export.pkl file, you need to use the absolute path, otherwise Docker will not be able to find it.", "If you don\u2019t see any error, your docker container should now be up and running. Head over to your browser and type 127.0.0.1 and hit enter, voil\u00e0! You should see the web app. Give it a \u2018Kaishu\u2019, \u2018Lishu\u2019 or \u2018Xiaozhuan\u2019 calligraphy image and hit \u2018Classify\u2019, you should see something like this:", "You can see the app classified this as \u2018KaiShu\u2019, which is correct. Now that your app is up and running on the local machine, we are 80% done. What\u2019s left is to deploy it on the cloud. Let\u2019s head to the cloud next!", "For the cloud hosting service, we\u2019ll use DigitalOcean. Comparing to the more incumbent players like Amazon AWS, GCP, or Azure, it\u2019s more friendly to developers and cheaper. You can follow this well written and concise tutorial to create an account and a \u2018Droplet\u2019 of your own. (\u2018Droplet\u2019 is a virtual machine running by Digital Ocean where you can install your app in, much like an AWS instance.) If you want, you can use this link to create your account and get $50 credit for free, which will be enough to get you started. Use the following configuration as a reference:", "It is recommended that you create your Droplets with at least 4G memory since installing PyTorch will require a lot of memory. You can resize it down to 2G later.", "You can choose the default \u2018Data Center\u2019 and set up your authentication method. Use SSH key or password, whichever way you feel more comfortable. I personally prefer SSH key, fewer keypresses and more secure. Once the Droplet is created, SSH into it and we are ready for the final deployment!", "Now you should be able to SSH into your server as root. It\u2019s recommended to create a normal user with sudo privilege, you can follow this tutorial. Once a normal user is created, log out of your root user and SSH back into the server with your normal user account. The final deployment is very similar to what we\u2019ve already done on our local machine, only this time we do it on the remote droplet server. First, let\u2019s git clone our repo so we have the source code:", "Don\u2019t forget to copy your export.pkl file to replace what\u2019s in the app folder. (follow this link if you don\u2019t know how)", "If docker is not installed, install docker. Then build the docker image using below command. Again, if the image building failed due to low memory, resize your memory up, you can resize it down later without much cost increase.", "Once the image is built, fire up the docker container:", "Once the docker container is up and running, head over to your browser and enter your Droplet\u2019s IP address, hit Enter. Congratulations! You\u2019ve successfully deployed your Deep Learning model to the Internet!", "Not that hard, huh? Deployment using standard DigitalOcean Droplet offers a lot of flexibilities. You can do whatever you want to your Droplets since you have root access. You can run multiple apps on it, and pay very little($5 - $10 tier should be enough). If your app gets some traction and needs more resources, you can easily scale up.", "I hope this tutorial somewhat help you deploy your AI app. If you have any question or want to share your deployment experience, please write a response below. Happy Deploying!", "Update: I\u2019ve deployed the web app here. I used the web app on DigitaOcean as the API backend server and put another ReactJS-based web app hosted on GitHub Pages as the front-end. Since the React app needs to visit \u2018http\u2019 URL, some browser will indicate a \u2018Mixed Content Error\u2019, just enable it and you should be able to try it out yourself. You are also welcomed to check the React app source code in the repo.", "Any feedback or constructive criticism are welcomed.
