Which programming language should you learn?", "Learning a new programming language is a big investment in time, energy, and brainpower. But learning a new Programming language can improve your Software development skillset and give you career boost as I have written in a separate Blog post:", "Usually, choose a programming language that gives you a boost in your career. Also, learn a language whose popularity is ascending. This means that you should learn established and hugely popular programming languages. Here I have listed top 10 mainstream programming languages to learn in 2020:", "I have huge respect in mainstream programming languages. But here I will give you a list of modern programming languages that can improve your productivity, boost your career, and make you a better developer. Also, I will cover a wide variety of domains: system programming, app development, web development, scientific computing.", "The term \u201cModern programming language\u201d is ambiguous. Many consider languages like Python, JavaScript as modern programming languages. At the same time, they consider Java as an Old programming language. In reality, all of them appeared around the same time: 1995.", "Most of the mainstream programming languages were developed in the last century, mainly in the 1970s (e.g. C), 1980s (e.g. C++), 1990s (e.g. Java, Python, JavaScript). These languages were not designed to take advantage of modern-day software development ecosystems: Multi-Core CPU, GPU, fast networking, mobile devices, Container, and Cloud. Although many of them have retrofit features like Concurrency in their language and adapted themselves, they also offer Backward compatibility and could not throw away the old, obsolete features.", "Python did a Good job (or Bad depending on the context) by making a clear cut between Python 2 and Python 3. Those languages often offer 10 ways to do the same things and do not care about developer ergonomics. According to the StackOverflow developer survey, most of the mainstream old programming languages share top spots in the \u201cmost dreaded language\u201d category:", "I would put a clear boundary between the old and new programming languages is on June 29, 2007, when the first iPhone was released. After that, the landscape has transformed. In this list, I will consider post-2007 programming languages.", "First, modern programming languages are developed to take the full advantages of modern computer hardware (Multi-Core CPU, GPU, TPU), mobile devices, large-set of data, fast networking, Container, and Cloud. Also, most of the modern programming languages offer much higher developer Ergonomics as given below:", "Second, many programming languages of the list are disruptive and will change the software industry forever. Some of them are already mainstream programming languages, while others are poised to make the breakthrough. It is wise to learn those languages at least as a second programming language.", "In a previous blog post: \u201c20 predictions about software development trends in 2020\u201d, I have predicted breakthrough of many modern languages in 2020:", "The System programming language landscape is dominated by near-Metal languages like C, C++. Although they give full control over programs and hardware, they lack memory safety. Even if they support concurrency, it is challenging to write Concurrent programs using C/C++ as there is no Concurrency safety. The other popular programming languages are interpreted languages like Java, Python, PHP. They offer safety but need a bulky runtime or Virtual Machine. Because of their large runtime, languages like Java are not suitable for System programming.", "There were many attempts to combine the power of C/C++ and the safety of Haskell, Java. It looks like Rust is the first production-grade programming language that did the trick.", "Graydon Hoare first developed Rust as a side project. He was inspired by the research programming language Cyclone. Rust is open source and Mozilla is leading the language development along with many other companies and communities. Rust is first released in 2015 and has soon caught the eye of the community. In a previous post, I have taken a deeper look into Rust and argued why it is a better choice to use Rust over C++, Java in Big Data domain:", "Since its debut in 2015, Rust is well accepted by the Developers and voted as the Most beloved language for four consecutive years (2016, 2017, 2018, 2019) in StackOverflow developers survey:", "According to GitHub Octoverse, Rust is the second-fastest-growing language just behind Dart:", "Also, programming language Popularity website PyPl has ranked Rust in 18th position with an upward trend:", "Comparing the feature set it offers, it is no wonder that giant Tech companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google finally announced their investment on Rust as a long term System programming language.", "In the last 5 years, Rust has been getting increasing traction every year, as shown by Google trends:", "Google is one of the biggest Web Scale companies. At the beginning of this century, Google has faced two scaling problems: Development Scaling and Application Scaling. Development scaling means that they could not add more features by throwing more developers. Application scaling means that they could not easily develop an application that can scale to the \u201cGoogle\u201d scale machine cluster. Around 2007, Google started to create a new \u201cpragmatic\u201d programming language that can solve these two scaling problems. In Rob Pike (UTF-8) and Ken Thompson (UNIX OS), they had two most talented Software Engineer in the world to create a new language.", "In 2012, Google has released the first official version of the Go programming language. Go is a system programming language but different from Rust. It also has a Runtime and Garbage collector (a few Megabytes). But unlike Java or Python, this runtime is packed with the generated code. In the end, Go generates a single native binary code that can run in a machine without additional dependency or Runtime.", "Since Go first appears, the Software Development community has accepted it with arms. In 2009 (right after its debut) and 2018, Go has entered the Programming Language Hall of Fame list by the TIOBE index. It is no wonder that the success of Go has paved the way for a new generation of programming languages like Rust.", "Go is already a mainstream programming language. Recently, Go team has announced the work on \u201cGo 2\u201d to only make the language more solid:", "In almost all popular programming languages comparing websites, Go ranks high and has surpassed many existing languages. Here is the TIOBE index rating from December 2019 where Go ranks 15th:", "According to the Stackoverflow survey, Go is one of the top 10 most loved programming languages:", "Go is also one of the top 10 fastest growing languages according to GitHub Octoverse:", "Google trends also show increasing traction for Go over the last five years:", "Java is the undisputed king of Enterprise Software Development. In recent times, Java has become the target of much criticism: It is verbose, needs lots of boilerplate coding, prone to accidental complexity. However, there is little argument about the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). JVM is a masterpiece of Software Engineering and offers a battle-hardened runtime that has passed the test of time. In a previous post, I have discussed in detail the advantages of JVM:", "Over the years, JVM languages like Scala tried to answer the shortcomings of Java and wanted to be better Java but failed. Finally, in Kotlin, it looks like a search for better Java is over. Jet Brains (the company behind the popular IDE IntelliJ) has developed Kotlin, which runs on JVM and answers the shortcomings of Java and offered many modern features. The best part is that unlike Scala, Kotlin is much simpler than Java and offers Go or Python-like developer productivity in JVM.", "Google has declared Kotlin as a first-class language to develop Android and boosted Kotlin\u2019s acceptance in the community. Also popular Java Enterprise framework Spring has started to support Kotlin in the Spring eco-system since 2017. I have used Kotlin with Reactive Spring and the experience was amazing.", "Since its first release in 2015, the popularity of Kotlin is soaring. As per Stack Overflow, Kotlin is the fourth most loved Programming language in 2019:", "Kotlin is also one of the fastest-growing programming languages and ranked 4th:", "Popular programming language ranking website PyPl has ranked Kotlin as the 12th most popular programming language with a high upward trend:", "Since Google has declared Kotlin as the first-class language to develop Android Apps, Kotlin has experienced a huge positive boost in trending as shown below:", "JavaScript is an excellent language but pre-2015 JavaScript had many shortcomings. Even noted Software Engineer Douglas Crockford has written a book \u201cJavaScript: The Good Parts\u201d and implied that JavaScript has bad parts and ugly parts. With no modularization and with \u201cCallback Hell\u201d, developers did not like to maintain especially large JavaScript projects.", "Google even developed a platform to transcompile Java code to JavaScript code (GWT). Many companies or people tried to develop better JavaScript e.g. CoffeeScript, Flow, ClojureScript. But TypeScript from Microsoft arguably hit the Jackpot. A group of engineers in Microsoft, led by famous Anders Hejlsberg (creator of Delphi, Turbo Pascal, C#), created TypeScript as a Statically Typed, Modular superset of JavaScript.", "TypeScript is transcompiled to JavaScript during compilation. First released in 2014, it quickly attracted the attention of the community. Google was also planning to develop a Statically Typed superset of JavaScript back then. Google was so impressed by TypeScript that instead of developing a new language, they co-operated with Microsoft to improve TypeScript.", "Google has used TypeScript as the main programming language for its SPA framework Angular2+. Also, the popular SPA framework React offers support for TypeScript. The other popular JavaScript framework Vue.js has declared that they will use TypeScript to develop the new Vue.js 3:", "Also, node.js creator Ryan Dahl has decided to use TypeScript to develop a secure Node.js alternative, Deno.", "Developers love TypeScript for its elegant language design. In the Stackoverflow Developer survey, it has ranked joint second with Python in the most beloved language category:", "TypeScript is one of the fastest-growing Web programming languages and ranked fifth according to GitHub Octoverse:", "TypeScript also entered the Top 10 List (ranked 7th) according to the GitHub Contributions:", "TypeScript is having more and more eyeballs in each passing year, which is reflected by Google Trends:", "Steve Jobs has refused to support Java (and JVM) in iOS as he has famously quoted that Java is no more a major programming language. We now know that Steve Jobs was wrong with his assessment with Java, but iOS is still not supporting Java. Instead, Apple has chosen Objective-C as the first-class programming language in iOS. Objective-C is a hard language to master. Also, it does not support the high developer productivity required by modern programming languages.", "In Apple, Chris Lattner and others have developed Swift as a multi-paradigm, general-purpose, compiled programming language that gives an alternative to Objective-C. The first stable version of Swift was released in 2014. Swift also supports LLVM compiler Toolchain (also developed by Chris Lattner). Swift has excellent interoperability with Objective-C codebase and has already established itself as the main programming language in iOS App development.", "Developers love Swift programming language like many other modern languages. According to the StackOverflow survey, Swift ranked 6th as the most beloved programming language:", "In the programming language ranking of TIOBE, Swift has moved to the number 10 ranking in 2019. Considering how young the language is (5 years), this is quite a feat:", "Google trends also show a sharp rise in the Popularity of Swift followed by a slight decrease in trending in the last couple of saturation:", "Dart is the second programming language in this list made by Google. Google is a key player in the Web and Android domain, and it is no surprise that Google has developed its own programming language in the Web and App Development domain. Led by the famous Danish Software Engineer Lars Bak (who lead the Development of Chrome\u2019s V8 JavaScript Engine), Google has released Dart in 2013.", "Dart is a general-purpose programming language which supports Strong typing and Objected-Oriented programming. Dart can also be transcompiled to JavaScript and can run where JavaScript runs means virtually everywhere (e.g. Web, Mobile, Server).", "According to Github Octoverse, Dart is the fastest-growing Programming language in 2019 and its popularity has five-folded in last year:", "According to the TIOBE index, Dart stands 23rd position and has already surpassed many other existing and modern programming languages in only 4 years:", "It is also one of the most beloved programming languages as ranked 12th in StackOverflow developer Survey:", "Along with Flutter, Dart has also experienced huge traction in the last two years as clear by Google Trends:", "Most of the programming languages in this list are developed by large corporations except Julia. In technical computing, usually dynamic languages like Python, Matlab are used. These languages offer easy-to-use syntax but are not fit for large-scale Technical computation. They use C/C++ libraries for the CPU intensive tasks which gives the famous Two-Language problem as they need Glue Code to bind both languages. As Code is translated between two languages, there is always some performance loss.", "To tackle the issue, a group of researchers at MIT planned to create a new language from the ground-up which takes the advantages of modern hardware and combines the best parts of other languages. They work in the MIT innovation lab with the following Manifesto:", "Julia is a dynamic, high-level programming language that offers first-class support for Concurrent, Parallel and Distributed Computing. The first stable version of Julia is released in 2018 and soon got the attraction of the community and industry. Julia can be used in Scientific Computing, Artificial Intelligence, and many other fields and can finally solve the \u201cTwo-Language\u201d problem.", "Julia mainly competes with Python in many areas. As Python is one of the most popular programming languages, it will take a few years until Julia will be mainstream.", "Julia is relatively new (only one-year-old) but still ranks 43rd in the TIOBE index:", "Google Trends also shows a stable interest in Julia over the years.", "But considering the feature set and the number of companies is working behind Julia such as NSF, DARPA, NASA, Intel, it is just a matter of when instead of if for Julia to make a breakthrough:", "If you found this helpful, please share it on your favorite forums (Twitter, LinkedIn, Facebook).", "If you are interested in Programming languages, you can also read my following articles:", "Your home for data science.
