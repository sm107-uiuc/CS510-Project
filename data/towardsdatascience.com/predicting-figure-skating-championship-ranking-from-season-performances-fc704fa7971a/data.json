Similar to many sports, figure skating competition events are organized into two main categories:", "Every year, before the world championship, the Internet is abuzz with predictions of who is going to land on the championship podium. The obvious sources to make predictions from are the scores of skaters from earlier events in the season, and the obvious method to rank skaters from these scores is to compare the average score of each skater over all of his or her previous events.", "However, one potential problem with this method is that scores are averaged across different events, and no two events are the same. For one, the judging panels for each event are largely different. For another, there might be some other factors that can systematically raise or lower the skater scores of a given event, such as ice condition, what time the event takes place, or even altitude (skaters might not be conditioned for events in higher altitudes). As seen in the below box plot for the male skaters in the 2017 season, the center and spread of scores for each event can be remarkably different from one another:", "Therefore, a ranking model that can tease out the skater effect, the intrinsic ability of each skater, from the event effect, the influence of an event on a skater\u2019s performance, might make better predictions on who will fare better or worse in the world championship.", "In this project, several such models will be explored to accomplish this goal. The first part that you are reading involves simple linear models, while later parts of the project will cover more complicated models.", "The good news: scores from all events dating back from 2005 (the year the current scoring system was implemented) are available through the official website of the sport\u2019s federation, the International Skating Union. The scores are contained in tables within plain HTML pages, so scraping them using Beautiful Soup is more than adequate.", "The bad news: each event has its own score webpage. And as expected from webpages that were built by different event organizers across more than a decade, they have slightly \u2014 yet very frustratingly \u2014 different link templates and HTML formatting, as can be seen from a page in 2005 versus one in 2018.", "Therefore, a lot of care was taken to make sure that all scores are scraped accurately. For example, below are several link templates used to capture all webpages of event scores:", "The placeholders in the link templates help identify a specific event, with:", "Once scores from all events are scraped, they are cleaned via the following steps:", "Out of the 14 years of scraped scores, scores of 10 random years will be used to train and validate different ranking models, while scores of 4 remaining years will be used to benchmark the models at the end. The later parts of this project will focus on more complicated skater ranking models, and I will be using the 4 years in the test set to benchmark all models at the final part of the project.", "Before we compare how well different models rank the skaters for the world championship, let\u2019s first define how we can evaluate one ranking as better or worse than another.", "We know that a good predicted ranking is a ranking that closely matches that from the eventual world championship result. A simple metric that can measure the similarity between two rankings is the Kendall ranking correlation coefficient (also called the Kendall\u2019s tau coefficient). Let\u2019s go through a simple example to see how this metric works:", "The above table shows some predicted ranking (left) and the actual ranking after the world championship (right), each from best to worst, for 3 fictional skaters. Comparing between these two rankings, we can see that the predicted ranking mistakenly placed Aaron higher than Bruce. However, it got the ranking for Craig right: he is placed below the other two skaters in both rankings.", "The Kendall\u2019s tau coefficient (\ud835\udf0f) can quantify the above description with the following formula:", "As a result, the more ordered pairs there are that hold in both rankings, the higher the Kendall\u2019s tau coefficient between these two rankings is. Two identical rankings will have \ud835\udf0f =1, while two completely opposite rankings (think: one ranked from highest to lowest, while the other from lowest to highest) will have \ud835\udf0f = -1. Therefore, when compared with the world championship ranking of the same season, a predicted ranking with a higher Kendall\u2019s tau coefficient (closer to 1) will be better than one with a lower coefficient.", "In Python, the scipy library has the built-in scipy.stats.kendalltau function to calculate the coefficient. However, implementing this calculation \u201cfrom scratch\u201d is incredibly easy: the combinations function from the itertools module will generate the ordered pairs from each ranking, and the concordant pairs between two rankings is nothing more than the intersection (via the & operator) of the two sets of ordered pairs:", "As mentioned at the beginning, this is the simplest and most obvious way to predict the skater rankings at the world championship, and can be done by:", "Using the scores of male skaters from the 2017 as an example, we can see that the predicted ranking using season averages has relatively strong correlation with the eventual ranking from the world championship (see the leaderboard comparison below). As with any sport, there are big surprises: Denis, TEN dropped 10 places in rank \u2014 from 6 to 16 \u2014 while Brendan, KERRY leaped up 7 places \u2014 from 22 to 15. However, from a quick glance, the top-tier skaters during the season tend to perform more consistently than the lower-tier skaters, as can be seen from the relatively fewer shufflings in ranks within the top of the leaderboard compared to the bottom.", "With 24 skaters, there are 24\u00d723/2 = 276 possible ordered pairs in the actual ranking of the 2017 world championship. Out of these 276 pairs, the season average model predicts correctly 234 pairs (such as Yuzuru, HANYU > Javier, FERNANDEZ ), leaving 42 pairs wrongly predicted (such as Boyang, JIN > Nathan, CHEN) . This translates to a Kendall\u2019s tau score of (234 - 42)/276 = 0.695. Not too shabby for a baseline model!", "Let\u2019s move from the baseline model of season averages to other models that can hopefully separate the event effects from the skater effects. A simple such model is to assume that the score of a given skater in a given event is the addition of:", "This additive model can be expressed mathematically as:", "At first glance, it seems there is no straightforward way to learn these latent scores, since each event-skater pair has a different combination of latent scores. In other words, there is no fixed set of features across all data points as expected from a machine learning problem.", "However, the model formula can be rewritten in the following form:", "The new terms in this form of the model formula are:", "Written this way, it can easily be seen that for a given event-skater pair, only the latent scores of that skater and that event will factor in the actual score of that pair, which is exactly as the previous formula. This is because those latent scores will have coefficients I(e = event) and I(s = skater) of 1 in the above formula, while latent scores of other skaters and events will have coefficients of 0.", "Also, written this way, each event-skater score can be simply thought of as a linear combination of binary variables I(s = skater) and I(e = event) on top of a baseline score and a zero-mean Gaussian noise. In other words, the problem becomes nothing but a simple linear regression with binary features, whose regression coefficients are indeed the latent scores of all events and skaters \u2014 \u03b8_e and \u03b8_s respectively \u2014 and the regression intercept is nothing but the baseline score \u03b8_baseline .", "Let\u2019s go through a small example (using the male scores of the 2017 season) to see how this linear regression model can be coded:", "Notice that we must use the drop_first=True argument of the function, since including binary variables for all skaters and events will cause the binary features to be perfectly collinear, which is a no-no for linear regression; this is sometimes referred to as the dummy variable trap. This argument will, in effect, drop the binary feature of one skater and one event. Since there are 62 skaters and 9 events, our dummies data frame will have 61 binary columns for skaters and 8 binary columns for events, for a total of 69 binary features. The identity of the dropped skater and event can be found by the method below:", "After dropping the two columns, the resulting dummies data table is shown below in the left, with 120 rows corresponding to the 120 unique scores in the season and 69 columns of binary dummy variables. A column of all 1\u2019s is appended to the left of the data table to correspond to the baseline score, which is present in all season scores. As a result, the baseline score will just become one of the regression coefficients, which now has a count of 70.", "The reason for creating this 120\u00d770 data table is so it can represent a binary feature matrix X that, when multiplied by the vector \u03b8 representing all 70 regression coefficients (including the baseline/intercept), can approximate all scores of the season \u2014 the vector y with length of 120. In other words, the linear regression problem can be expressed in matrix form as:", "with \u03b5 representing the Gaussian noises that contribute to each season score. As a result, the least-square estimates of the regression coefficients can be calculated easily by solving the normal equation of linear regression:", "Since the data for each season is small, as evidenced by the tiny 120\u00d770 feature matrix, solving the normal equation can easily be done in Python to return exact values of the regression coefficients (as opposed to something like gradient descent). The code for this is below, with .T as matrix transpose, @ as matrix multiplication, and np.linalg.inv as matrix inversion.", "From the regression coefficients found by solving the normal equation, the baseline score, skater scores, and event scores can be extracted. Note that we need to add back the scores of the skater and the event that were dropped before regression; they will have scores of zeros, since by dropping them, their scores are already absorbed into the baseline score.", "Once the latent skater scores are sorted, the predicted ranking based on the additive model is as simple as ranking the skater with the highest latent score as 1st, the one with second highest latent score as 2nd, and so on.", "Furthermore, these latent scores can be interpreted as how much better or worse a skater is compared to the dropped skater, which is Adam, RIPPON with a reference score of zero, once the event effect has been removed (according the additive model).", "Also, note that out of the 62 skaters whose latent scores have been calculated, only 24 qualified for the world championship in 2017. Therefore, we only evaluate the model based on the predicted ranks of those skaters.", "First, let\u2019s see how the additive model does when approximating the actual scores during the season, since that was the primary goal of the regression. Below is a chart showing the predicted scores for every event-skater pair in the season, each broken down by its latent components (baseline score + event score + skater score) against the true score of that very pair.", "The chart above shows that the predicted scores match quite closely with the true scores during the season, with the largest deviation from the true score (also called residual) of just under 30 points. We can plot these residuals against the predicted score, along with the same residuals if the season average model were used. Furthermore, we can plot the histogram and QQ plot of those residuals to confirm whether the Gaussian noise assumption of the linear regression model is justified.", "From the above plots, it can be seen that:", "Second, and more importantly, let\u2019s see how the additive model does in predicting the eventual ranking in the world championship (compared to the baseline model of skaters\u2019 season averages). Attentive readers will notice that the ranking from the additive model shown earlier are very similar to that from the season averages, which is confirmed when comparing these two rankings against each other, and also against the world championship ranking:", "There are some interesting cases (highlighted in red) when comparing the predicted rankings from these two models:", "In total, there are 239 out of 276 ordered pairs in the world championship that the additive model got correctly, which translates to a Kendall\u2019s tau score of 0.732. Compared to the season average model with 234 correct pairs (Kendall\u2019s tau = 0.695), the additive model seems to provide little predictive improvement compared to the baseline model. Therefore, let\u2019s move on to the next model that hopefully will perform better.", "Instead of thinking of a event-skater score during the season as composed of some latent scores added together (baseline + event + skater), we can think of these latent scores multiplied together, as well as multiplying with an exponential of a zero-mean Gaussian noise to create that season score. This multiplicative relationship can be expressed mathematically as:", "One potential advantage of the multiplicative model over the additive model is that the latent scores can interact with one another in this model. For example, in the additive model, the latent effect of a given skater stays the same regardless of the event he or she participates in. In contrast, the skater score in the multiplicative model acts as a \u201cmultiplier\u201d on top of the baseline and event score: think of this as how good a skater is in \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of every event if you will.", "The reason we multiply by an exponential of a Gaussian noise at the end of the formula is because a logarithm can be taken across the entire formula, which results in:", "In other words, like the additive model, the multiplicative model is nothing but a linear regression problem with binary features. However, the difference is that the response is now the logarithm of the season scores, and the regression coefficients are now the logarithms of the latent scores.", "Since the linear regression at the core of the model stays the same, the coding of the multiplicative model is largely the same as that of the additive model, except when solving the normal equation at the end: instead of X.T @ y, we have X.T @ np.log(y).", "Another small modification occurs after the regression coefficients are obtained, we need to take their exponentials to get back the latent baseline, event, and skater scores. Please refer back to the additive model for how baseline_score, event_scores, and skater_scores are extracted from regression coefficients.", "Below are the skater latent scores recovered by the multiplicative model:", "The best skater, Yuzuru, HANYU, has a \u201cmultiplier\u201d of 1.15; that means for any event, after the baseline score and event score are multiplied together, his predicted score will be 1.15 times that number. At the bottom, the worse-ranked skater is Julian Zhi Jie, YEE, who has a multiplier of 0.77.", "Despite their different forms, the multiplicative model provides remarkably similar predictions to that of the additive model for every event-skater pair during the season. This can be seen below when the deviations between true and predicted scores are plotted for both models, along with the baseline model of season averages. As a result, the RMSE of both models are virtually indistinguishable: 8.84 for additive and 8.88 for multiplicative (against a 10.3 of the season average model).", "In terms of predicting the eventual ranking of the world championship, the two models are again almost identical to one another (see their rankings compared to the eventual world ranking below):", "There are only two differences between the two rankings in the 2017 season, highlighted in red in the above chart:", "As a result, the multiplicative ranking has the exact same number of concordant pairs to the world ranking (239 out of 276 pairs) and the same Kendall\u2019s tau (0.732) as the additive ranking, which is still higher than that of the baseline model of season averages (0.695). In other words, there seems to be virtually no performance difference between two models in predicting the eventual ranking of the world championship, at least in the 2017 season.", "Given that the model choice (additive or multiplicative) does not seem to drastically affect predictive performance, let\u2019s see how we can improve either model in another way.", "A common method to improve these models is, ironically, to penalize them (also called regularization). For this problem, penalization can be understood as artificially shrinking the latent event and skater scores toward zero. On one hand, this shrinking will undoubtedly make the models less accurate in terms of predicting season scores. On the other hand, it could prevent the model from overfitting to the season scores, which can be noisy and might not reflect the true ability of the skater (perhaps they had food poisoning earlier that day). As a result, this might better capture the true ability of skaters and rank them more accurately.", "For this problem, I will choose ridge regression to penalize both models for two reasons:", "Let\u2019s see how ridge regression can be incorporated into the normal equation used for linear regression. Recall the solution of the regular normal equation for the additive model:", "We can modify this solution for ridge regression so that the regression coefficients are shrinked toward zero (see the resources section at the end for the derivation of the below formula):", "The extra terms in this equation are:", "The higher the penalty parameter \u03bb is, the more penalized the model will become i.e. the latent event and skater scores are further shrinked toward zero. In contrast, when \u03bb = 0, the model becomes the original, un-penalized version.", "Given the formula above, coding the normal equation\u2019s solution for ridge regression of the additive model can\u2019t be any simpler, since we have already built the code for the regular version of the same equation.", "Take the additive model for the 2017 season as an example, when \u03bb increases by factors of 10, the latent event and skater scores generally shrink toward zero. In contrast, the baseline score is relatively unaffected by the penalty parameter (which it wasn\u2019t meant to be in the first place):", "When the latent event and skater scores are shrinked toward zero, the model will naturally gets worse in approximating season scores. As a result, the model RMSE will increase (see graph below): at the extreme end when \u03bb = 10000, the RMSE is 35.6, which is much worse than just taking the season average for each skater (RMSE = 10.3), let alone the original, un-penalized model (RMSE = 8.8).", "However, does this extreme shrinking leads to better predicted ranking for the world championship? Alas, no. From the above graph, the extremely-penalized model only got 231 pairs correctly out of all 276 ordered pairs, lower than the 239 of the un-penalized model, or even the 234 of the season average model! By charting how the predicted ranking changes when \u03bb increases (see above), we can see that up until \u03bb = 0.1, the predicted ranking of the penalized model does not change much compared to the original model, and the number of concordant pair stays flat at 239. However, after that, the rankings of the penalized model start to shuffle quite a bit, which coincides with a dip in number of concordant pairs (from 239 at \u03bb = 0.1 to 235 at \u03bb = 1).", "In short, penalizing the additive model creates a double whammy: not only does it make the model worse in approximating the season scores, but also worse in predicting the world championship ranking.", "However, this is only the result for a single season (2017). Let\u2019s apply the same models (additive and multiplicative) on all 10 years in the training sample. For each model, we calculate their differences in RMSE and Kendall\u2019s tau from the baseline model of season averages. We then plot the average of these differences, along with their 95% confidence intervals using a t-distribution with 9 degrees of freedom (since n=10 years). This is the same as performing a paired t-test for the average differences in RMSE and Kendall\u2019s tau of each model compared to the baseline.", "From the above graphs, we can see that:", "Yet, even with the un-penalized additive and multiplicative models (\u03bb = 0), the above graph reveals that on average, these models actually lower the Kendall\u2019s tau compared to the baseline model of season averages \ud83d\ude31 Granted, the 95% confidence intervals of differences in Kendall\u2019s tau show that such differences from the baseline are not statistically significant, since they encompass the horizontal line at zero. However, let\u2019s graph the performances of all three models separately for each year so we can compare between these three models in finer details:", "Below is the final report on the RMSE and Kendall\u2019s tau performance of both models (additive and multiplicative), including the mean, the mean difference from the baseline model of season average, and the 95% confidence interval of these differences in the 10-year training sample:", "For female skaters, we can see that the 95% confidence intervals of difference in Kendall\u2019s tau (compared to the baseline model of season averages) encompass zero for both additive and multiplicative model. In other words, neither model provides any statistically significant improvement in predicting the world championship ranking from the baseline.", "Despite the initial optimistic result from the 2017 season, it turns out that in order to predict the eventual world championship ranking, the two models proposed during this project (additive and multiplicative) are no better than simply ranking skaters by their season averages. Therefore, by Occam\u2019s razor, there\u2019s no compelling reason to choose these more complicated models over the simpler season average model.", "A question remains: given the plausible interplay between the latent event effects and the skater effects factored in the these models, why do they not show significant improvements in predicting the world championship ranking?", "One answer is that sports are simply too unpredictable. Sure, these models can predict quite well scores of past events, as evidenced by their small RMSE\u2019s, but there\u2019s no telling that in a future event, no one will be injured, or have a jet lag, or just plain hit a freak rut on the ice. This unpredictability can be reflected by the highly variable Kendall\u2019s tau from year to year for all three models: for male skaters, this can be in the 0.5 range all the way to above 0.8 (or 0.4 to 0.7 for female). In other words, just because a world championship happens to be in favor of a model in one year doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be anything funky going on next season.", "Despite obtaining no significant improvement compared to the baseline model, this project has taught me that even the simplest of models such as linear regression can be used in inventive ways, such as finding latent factors to solve a ranking problem in this case.
