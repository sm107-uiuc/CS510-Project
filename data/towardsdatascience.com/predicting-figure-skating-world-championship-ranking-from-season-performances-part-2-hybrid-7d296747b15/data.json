The main strategy is to separate the skater effect, the intrinsic ability of each skater, from the event effect, the influence of an event on a skater\u2019s performance, so that a more accurate ranking could be built.", "Two models were proposed for this ranking problem, in which the season score of an event-skater pair can be approximated by:", "These latent scores can either be added together (additive model), or multiplied together (multiplicative model) to approximate the season score:", "In either case, the latent scores can be easily be found by rewriting the above formulas so that they become simple linear models whose regression coefficients are the latent scores themselves. As a result, these scores can be found simply by solving the normal equation of linear regression. From there, the predicted ranking of each model is just a ranking of the latent skater scores, from highest to lowest.", "The predicted rankings from these two models were compared with the baseline model of simply ranking skaters based on their season averages. The metric used to evaluate these models is the Kendall ranking correlation coefficient (also called Kendall\u2019s tau) with respect to the actual world championship ranking: a model is better if its predicted ranking have a Kendall\u2019s tau closer to 1, which means the predicted ranking is more correlated with the actual ranking in the world championship of that year.", "From the above report on these two models over the 10 years (out of 14) chosen in the training set, both models approximate the season\u2019s scores better than the baseline model of season averages, since the 95%-confidence intervals of difference in root-mean-squared error (RMSE) between them and the baseline model lie below zero.", "Yet, in the much more important metric of Kendall\u2019s tau, these models sadly do not provide any significant increase in this metric compared to the baseline model, since the 95%-confidence intervals of difference in Kendall\u2019s tau between them and the baseline encompass zero for both male and female skaters.", "Given the lackluster performance in ranking prediction of these two models, I propose a new model that is a curious hybrid of these two models:", "From the model formula, a score that a given skater earned at a given event during the season can be approximated by the latent score of that skater multiplied with the latent score of that event, similar to the multiplicative model. However, this product is then added to the baseline score, similar to the additive model.", "Since there are some years where the additive model has a higher Kendall\u2019s tau than the multiplicative model, and some years where the reverse happens, a hybrid model just might provide a better predicted ranking than either model separately. You can find the analysis on the hybrid model in this Jupyter notebook in the Github repo of the project.", "Due to the strange combination of addition and multiplication in the hybrid model, we can neither reformulate it as a linear model, nor can we take the logarithm of the formula to transform it to a linear model (similar to what we did with the multiplicative model).", "Nevertheless, the strategy to find the best parameters of this model remains the same as the previous two models: to minimize the sum of squared differences between the predicted scores and true scores over all event-skater pairs in the season:", "With the objective function above, we can use good ol\u2019 gradient descent to find the optimal baseline, event, and skater scores for the model. Let\u2019s see what the gradient for each parameter looks like, first for the baseline score (\u03b8_baseline):", "From the above formula, the gradient of the objective function with respect to the baseline score is simply the sum of differences between true and predicted scores (which will be called residuals from here on) for all scores in the season.", "Therefore, given some current values of baseline, event, and skater scores, we can always calculate the gradient of the baseline score, and update the baseline score against this gradient (since we are looking to minimize the objective function):", "The extra term \u03b1 multiplied with the gradient is called the learning rate, and controls how fast the gradient descent algorithm runs. A low \u03b1 might make the algorithm converge too slowly, while a high \u03b1 might make the updates too large and the parameters keep swinging from one extreme to another, which has happened to me several times during this project.", "The latent score of a given event can be updated similarly, using the event in Russia (latent score \u03b8_RU) as an example:", "When differentiating the objective function with the latent score of this event, all squared differences that do not involve this event will vanish, which leaves only the terms involving the skaters who participated from this event, including Javier, FERNANDEZ (\u03b8_FERNANDEZ) and Alexander, MAJOROV (\u03b8_MAJOROV). Using chain rule, we can see that the gradient is nothing but the residuals for each skater who participated in this event multiplied by the respective latent score of that skater, after which these products are added together.", "Using this gradient, the latent score of this Russian event can be updated using gradient descent:", "Lastly, for the latent score of a skater, such as that of Takahito, MURA (\u03b8_MURA), the gradient score of the objective function with respect to this latent score is:", "For the 2017 season, he competed in 2 events, one in Canada and one in France, which have the latent scores \u03b8_CA and \u03b8_FR respectively. As a result, the gradient is nothing but the residuals for each of these events multiplied by the latent score of that event, after which these products are added together. As a result, the latent score of this skater can be updated using gradient descent:", "In short, the gradient descent algorithm to find the baseline, event, and skater scores can be summarized by the following steps:", "In the second step, convergence can be monitored by checking whether the RMSE of the model, which is just the square root of the average residual\u2019s square, have stabilized to a minimum value. The skater scores obtained after convergence of gradient descent would then be used to rank skaters for the world championship.", "Given the gradient descent algorithm above, let\u2019s go through a small example of how it can be coded in Python. Below, we have a data frame (season_scores) containing 7 season scores across 4 skaters (MAJOROV, FERNANDEZ, GE, MURA) and 3 events (CA, FR, RU):", "First, we convert this long table format into a pivot table format using pandas\u2019 pivot_table function, with the skater names as row index, and the event names as columns. The reason for converting season scores into this pivot table format will be apparent very soon after.", "Below is the 4\u00d73 pivot table of season scores we will end up with. Note that not all skaters participate in all events, so there are missing values in the pivot table, which are represented as NaN (Not a Number).", "Lastly, before we start with gradient descent, let\u2019s convert the pandas data frame season_pivot into a 4\u00d73 numpy matrix true_scores so we can manipulate it more easily. This will in effect remove all row and column names, so let\u2019s store the skater names (rows) and event names (columns) so we can still identify them after running gradient descent.", "First, let\u2019s initialize the baseline score for gradient descent using numpy\u2019s RandomState object with a specific seed (so that results are consistent every time we run the code) and call the random_sample method of this object to return a random number between 0 and 1. There\u2019s no reason for the initial value to be in this range; I just thought it would look nicer.", "Now, let\u2019s initialize the latent event and skater scores. Instead of initializing each of them one by one, I will initialize all the skater scores as a column vector of size 4\u00d71 (skater_scores), and all the event scores as a row vector of size 1\u00d73 (event_scores), whose entries are also random numbers between 0 and 1, again using the random_sample method.", "The reason for initializing these latent scores in vector forms is that the predicted score for every event-skater pair can be calculated all at once by multiplying these vectors together (using the matrix multiplication operator @) and add the baseline on top of that:", "To illustrate it more clearly, the diagram below shows the two latent vectors (of sizes 4\u00d71 and 1\u00d73 respectively) multiplied together with the baseline added on top to form a 4\u00d73 matrix of predicted scores for every event-skater pair. Highlighted in red is an event-skater pair (CA-MAJOROV) that was computed by multiplying the corresponding entries in the latent vectors, with the added baseline on top.", "Next, since the true scores (true_scores) and predicted scores (predicted_scores) for every event-skater pair have been computed, we can easily calculate the residual for every score in the season.", "Recall that our true_scores numpy matrix contain NaN values for event-skater pairs that do not exist during the season. Therefore, when residuals are calculated, the corresponding residual for those pairs are also NaN.", "The presence of NaN in the residuals matrix makes it very convenient in calculating gradients, since we don\u2019t have to keep track of which event-skater does and does not exist during the season. For example, the gradient for the baseline, as derived earlier, is the sum of residuals for all existing event-skater pairs {e, s} in the season:", "Therefore, the baseline gradient can be implemented simply as:", "The np.nansum function effectively skips over the non-existant NaN value (by treating them as zeros), which fits our purpose of summing only residuals of existing event-skater pairs in the season.", "To calculate gradients for all latent event scores, the np.nansum function is again of great help due to its axis argument:", "Let\u2019s breakdown this line of code to see how it works:", "However, since the two arrays are not of the same size: the residuals matrix is of size 4\u00d73 (4 skaters by 3 events), while skater_scores is a column vector of size 4\u00d71 (latent scores of the 4 skaters), numpy\u2019s broadcasting kicks into gear. In effect, numpy will duplicate the skater_scores vector horizontally 3 times so that it becomes the same dimension as the residuals matrix (4\u00d73), as illustrated below:", "Notice that after the broadcasting, the element-wise multiplication between the two matrices (which are now of similar size) will leave NaN values at the same positions as those in the residuals matrix. This allows for np.nansum to come in to calculate the relevant event gradients, but this time there are two new arguments for the function:", "Calculating gradients for all latent skater scores is identical to calculating event gradients, except that we are multiplying the residuals (residuals of size 4\u00d73) by the event scores (event_scores of size 1\u00d73, which will be broadcasted 4 times vertically).", "The result of that multiplication will be summed across columns (the events that each skater participate in) using np.nansum with argument axis=1 to get the skater gradients:", "Once the gradients have been calculated, using them to update the baseline, event, and skater latent scores involves nothing but simple subtractions (using a learning rate alpha=0.0005):", "Using a simple for loop, we can repeat step 2 many times to alternate between calculating the gradients and using them to update the latent scores:", "Convergence of the gradient descent algorithm can be monitored by calculating RMSE after each loop \u2014 np.sqrt(np.nanmean(residuals**2))\u2014 and checking how different it is to that of the previous loop. After 1000 iterations, the RMSE of the model is 4.30, with an iteration-to-iteration difference in the magnitude of 10e-9. This indicates that the algorithm has well and truly converged.", "Finally, the latent skater scores after gradient descent has converged are converted into a pandas Series, which allows the skater names stored earlier to be added back. Note that ravel is needed to collapse the technically 2-D skater_scores array (4, 1) into a 1-D array (4, ) before converting it into Series. Moreover, sort_values(ascending=False) is called to sort the latent scores of skaters from highest to lowest, since the initial goal is to rank skaters by these latent scores.", "When applying the gradient descent algorithm to male skaters during the 2017 season, we can monitor the progress of the algorithm by the residuals and the RMSE at each iteration. Furthermore, the latent skater scores at each iteration can be used to build a temporary ranking whose correlation with the world championship ranking is measured by Kendall\u2019s tau. All metrics monitored during the algorithm (with learning rate \u03b1 = 0.0005) are shown in the animated dashboard below:", "From the dashboard above, we can see that:", "Here are the latent skater scores after gradient descent has converged; only the 24 skaters who qualified for the 2017 world championship will be shown, ranked from highest to lowest skater scores:", "After running gradient descent for the hybrid model with learning rate alpha=0.0005 and 10,000 iterations, the final RMSE of the model is 8.86, with an iteration-to-iteration difference of 1.7e-8\u2014 small enough for convergence.", "When comparing this RMSE to that of the linear models in the first part of the project \u2014 8.84 for additive model and 8.88 for multiplicative model \u2014 we can see that the hybrid model nestles right in between the previous models in how well it approximates the season scores. This is also better than the baseline model of season averages, whose RMSE is 10.3.", "The deviations from true score for every event-skater pairs are shown below for all models. The closeness in predicted scores between all 3 models in this graph confirms the similar RMSEs between them.", "In terms of predicted ranking, the hybrid ranking is again almost the same as those of earlier rankings (see below graph). In fact, compared to the multiplicative ranking, the hybrid ranking only reverses the order of only one pair of skater: Kevin, REYNOLDS and Maxim, KOVTUN, which is highlighted in red.", "Unfortunately, this reversal does not match up with the eventual world championship result: Kevin, REYNOLDS ended up placing higher than Maxim, KOVTUN. As a result, the hybrid model got 238 pairs right out of all 276 ordered pairs, one fewer than that of the multiplicative model. This translates to a slightly lower Kendall\u2019s tau of 0.724 of the hybrid model, compared to 0.732 for the multiplicative \u2014 and for that matter, the additive model. However, this is still slightly higher than the Kendall\u2019s tau of 0.695 (or 234 out of 276 pairs) for the baseline model of season averages for male skaters in the 2017 season.", "Before evaluating the hybrid model on all 10 years in the training set, let\u2019s first see how we can make it overfit less to the season scores as promised earlier.", "Recall the objective function of the hybrid model that gradient descent is trying to minimize:", "To penalize the hybrid model, we need to find a way to artificially make the latent event and skater scores smaller (while leaving the baseline score alone so that season scores are still decently approximated). One way to do so is to modify the objective function as such:", "The additional squared terms at the end of the objective function above signals that: aside from minimizing the squared residuals for season scores, we also want to minimize the squares of the latent event and latent skater scores (\u03b8_e and \u03b8_s respectively) so that these latent scores are kept small. The degree to which the latent scores are penalized is controlled by the penalty parameter \u03bb: the higher \u03bb is, the more the squares of latent scores are minimized, and the smaller these latent scores will be.", "We can differentiate the modified objective function with respect to these latent scores to get the gradient formulas during gradient descent (step 2a):", "From the above gradient formulas, we can see that the only modifications to the original gradient descent formulas are the terms with \u03bb at the end of the event and skater gradient formulas respectively.", "As a result of these simple modifications, incorporating these terms into our Python implementation of gradient descent is incredibly easy. Below are the code for step 2 of gradient descent for the penalized model (using a penalty parameter lambda_param=10), with changes from the original model highlighted in bold. Notice that for our toy example, the latent skater scores that we obtain after convergence for the penalized model is smaller than those from the original model, which means the penalization did indeed work.", "Below are the graphs of how the RMSE, Kendall\u2019s tau, and predicted ranking of the hybrid model change when the penalty parameter \u03bb increases (by factors of 10):", "From the above graph, it can be seen that:", "When examining the effect of this penalization on all 10 years in the training set by plotting the average difference in RMSE and Kendall\u2019s tau over the baseline model (of season averages) across different values of \u03bb, the same picture emerges:", "With these lackluster results for model penalization, let\u2019s see if we can reduce model overfit in another way that hopefully will produce better predicted ranking for the hybrid model.", "As mentioned earlier, the idea of early stopping in this context is remarkably simple: we just stop gradient descent prematurely, when the Kendall\u2019s tau of the predicted ranking is the highest. This will, in effect, prevent the latent scores to get as large as if we were to let gradient descent converges all the way in the original hybrid model.", "As a result, early stopping will make the model less accurate in predicting season score (higher RMSE) than the converged hybrid model. However, similar to model penalization, this might make the model less overfit to the training data, and rank skaters more accurately (higher Kendall\u2019s tau). This was seen earlier in the animated dashboard that monitors these metrics across iterations of gradient descent, which I have reproduced in the still version below.", "Nevertheless, compared to model penalization, early stopping offers some additional advantages:", "In our Python implementation of gradient descent, early stopping simply means limiting the the number of loops for step 2 to a small number \u2014 for i in range(10) for example. Afterwards, the Kendall\u2019s tau of the predicted ranking after 10 iterations can be calculated, and we continue trying other small numbers of iterations and choose one with the highest Kendall\u2019s tau.", "However, a more practical way to perform early stopping is to run gradient descent for a large number of iterations (say 1000), monitor Kendall\u2019s tau for each iteration (similar to what we did before with the dashboard animation), and retroactively pinpoint the iteration where the Kendall\u2019s tau was the highest. If there are several maxima in Kendall\u2019s tau, we pick the earliest iteration, since we want to err on the side of less model overfit.", "When monitoring RMSE and Kendall\u2019s tau across iterations of gradient descent for each year (see accompanying graphs), we can see that:", "Therefore, we have to smooth out the Kendall\u2019s tau across all 10 years by taking their averages at every iteration and find out which iteration has the highest across-year average. More accurately, for each iteration, we\u2019re averaging (over 10 years) the difference in Kendall\u2019s tau of the hybrid model over the baseline model of each year. This allows us to compare the effect of early stopping against the baseline model directly, and is highlighted in the graph below (in brown):", "From the above graph, we can see that:", "In short, even early stopping doesn\u2019t seem to help improve the predicted ranking of the hybrid model. However, before we give up on the hybrid model altogether, let\u2019s see if we can somehow combine both strategies to reducing model overfit \u2014 model penalization and early stopping \u2014 as one last ditch effort to improve on this model.", "Combining model penalization and early stopping is nothing but including the penalty parameter \u03bb while calculating the gradients (model penalization) while limiting the number of iterations of gradient descent to a small number (early stopping). Therefore, nothing will change from the Python code for model penalization except for limiting the number of iterations for step 2 of the gradient descent algorithm \u2014only for i in range(10), for example.", "For each combination of model parameters \u2014 the number of iterations for gradient descent as well as penalty parameter \u03bb \u2014 we can measure the average difference (over 10 years) of Kendall\u2019s tau of the hybrid model over the baseline model and plot them in the heat map below:", "It can be seen from the above heat map that:", "Such comparisons are plotted for both male and female skaters above, which show very interesting patterns:", "From the above analysis, it is clear that early stopping is not only easier to implement than model penalization (as mentioned earlier), but it also has a clear performance advantage compared to the latter for this problem. Therefore, for both genders, only early stopping is chosen to improve on the hybrid model. Below is its final result when applied to the 10 years in the training set:", "The hybrid model developed during this part of the project was originally inspired by the various matrix factorization techniques used in recommendation system. In general, these techniques will \u201cfactorize\u201d a matrix of ratings that many users leave on many items (on Amazon, for example), into a user-specific matrix and an item-specific matrix. When these two matrices are multiplied together, they can approximate the original rating matrix.", "The same principle holds in our hybrid model: the rating matrix is nothing but the pivot table of season scores for all event-skater pairs, and the user-specific and item-specific matrices are nothing but the skater and event latent score vectors. Therefore, when multiplying skater_scores @ season_scores (with a baseline score added on top) we can approximate true_scores of the season. You can check out this very readable article on matrix factorization for recommendation system, which also includes the derivation of the gradient descent algorithm that is very similar to the one used in this project, and is often referred to as FunkSVD.", "With that said, our current hybrid model involves only a single factor: each skater and each event is represented by only one latent score. In contrast, matrix factorization in recommendation systems often involves multiple factors. In the next part of the project, I will describe how multi-factor matrix factorization can be applied to our ranking problem."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
