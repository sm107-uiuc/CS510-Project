Over the years, both R and Python have garnered a lot of positive feedback from developers and users for a variety of modern tasks. It might seem hard at first to decide which one is better among the two but let me tell you something, even though they are similar in certain areas, such as being free and open-source, they both can offer some unique and game-changing features.", "Some examples of sub-communities using Python/R:", "With the help of this article, we would like to shed some light on the features separating Python from R.", "Python is an experiment in how much freedom programmers need. Too much freedom and nobody can read another\u2019s code; too little and expressiveness is endangered.", "Python has been around since 1989 as a high-level general-purpose programming language, which was built to emphasize code readability. Python encourages developers to write clear and logical code for projects of all scales. Built to be extremely extensible, Python comes with hundreds of libraries that extend its core functionality while its open-source nature allows developers to freely build and share custom libraries.", "Python also serves as an exceptional tool for Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning due to the availability of several packages and libraries, such as TensorFlow, Pandas, Keras, NumPy, PyTorch, and more.", "\u25cf Hugely popular among developers due to its easy to use nature.", "\u25cf Supports multiple programming paradigms, such as object-oriented and procedural.", "\u25cf Takes comparatively less execution time than others.", "\u25cf Has a vast collection of third-party libraries.", "\u25cf Python may lack alternatives to some of the popular libraries in R.", "\u25cf Dynamic typing can sometimes make it difficult to track faults properly.", "First launched in 1993 by Ross Ihaka and Robert Gentleman, R was built to put unmatched statistical computing and graphical capabilities in the hands of the developers, statisticians, analysts, and data miners. It comes with a command-line interface.", "When it comes to Data Science, many researchers still prefer R over Python due to its powerful statistics-oriented nature and interactive visualization capabilities. Also, using R\u2019s frameworks, you can create dashboards and interactive visualizations for actionable insights.", "R being a procedural language allows the developers to break complex portions of the problem into smaller chunks to make problem-solving easier.", "\u25cf Comes equipped with a robust set of analysis tools.", "\u25cf Has a wide range of packages for enhancing its core behavior and capabilities.", "\u25cf GUIs like RStudio IDE and Jupyter can add a graphical interface to an already powerful tool while adding more features such as integrated help, code debugger, code completion.", "\u25cf Allows for powerful data import options, including files, such as Microsoft Excel.", "\u25cf Supports various third-party packages for extensibility.", "\u25cf R is difficult to learn and can make things go down if not used carefully.", "\u25cf Lack of proper documentation for some libraries can waste the developer\u2019s efforts.", "\u25cf Relatively slower performer than Python.", "Choosing one language over another for your next Data Science project can be challenging, especially when both the languages can carry out the same tasks. Now that the introduction is out of the way, we will cover the comparison between both the languages in the upcoming section, keeping in mind a set of notable features that most developers will find extremely helpful.", "To facilitate data collection, Python can support a variety of commonly used data formats, such as CSVs, JSON files, and even SQL files. Another widely used source of data in Python among Data Scientists is the datasets. Python can also allow you to extract data directly from the internet with the help of suitable libraries.", "Although not as versatile as Python, R allows you to import data via Excel, CSV, and text files. Files built using packages such as Minitab or SPSS can also be turned into data frames for use in R. Packages such as Rvest and magrittr can help you scrape and clean the data from the web.", "Python\u2019s various libraries can help you analyze structured and unstructured data very easily. Libraries such as pandas, NumPy, PyPI are undoubtedly among the best for data exploration. Pandas, for example, allows you to organize the data into data frames and makes cleaning simpler. Moreover, pandas can even hold a huge amount of data while offering additional benefits.", "Built specifically for Data Exploration, R delivers exceptional results, as it was built specifically for statisticians and data miners. With R, you can apply a range of tests, and techniques, such as probability distributions, data mining on your data. R can perform data optimization, random number generation, signal processing, and even offers support for third-party libraries.", "With Python, you can create effective and customizable visualizations in the form of graphs and charts. Libraries like IPython and matplotlib exist to help developers and researchers create powerful and interactive visualizations. While the Python ecosystem does consist of more libraries, the most commonly used is matplotlib.", "On the other hand, R can offer advanced visualizations as it is among the core functions provided by the programming language. R comes with built-in support for many standard graphs, for even more complex visualizations, you can use libraries, such as ggplot2, Plotly, and Lattice.", "For data modeling, Python provides several libraries that will cater to the desired modeling type. Say, for numerical modeling, Python provides its NumPy library, similarly, for scientific computing, we have SciPy. Various other libraries and techniques allow for more data modeling options in Python.", "In R, you can do statistical modeling efficiently due to the robust statistical capabilities offered by the programming language. It comes with plenty of support packages to help you in statistical modeling, even for specific analyses, such as Poisson Distribution, Linear & Logistic Regression.", "Performance is a critical aspect of any programming language, and it often becomes the prime reason for picking one language over the other. One of the key reasons why most programmers and even data scientists are beginning to prefer Python over R is due to its ability to rapidly perform most data science tasks with relative ease. Another area where Python outshines R is that it can perform comparatively faster. Other factors against R can include a lack of features, such as unit testing and insufficient code readability.", "When it comes to the packages and libraries provided by these programming languages, they both offer thousands of useful packages for almost every situation.", "PyPI hosts and manages Python\u2019s packages, whereas R\u2019s side of things are handled by CRAN. If you\u2019re more interested in the numbers, Python has over 257 thousand packages, while CRAN has a little over 16 thousand. That\u2019s a lot!", "Although Python does offer more than 10 times the packages available for R, not all of them are useful for Data Science. One shouldn\u2019t forget while reading those numbers that Python is a general-purpose programming language, whereas R isn\u2019t.", "Both of the programming languages are fairly popular among developers and data scientists and are good options to add under their command. Python seems to be taking the lead here due to its general-purpose nature and the availability of several libraries focused around Data Science, but R is not far behind.", "According to StackOverflow, Python is the fastest-growing major programming language.", "Several statisticians and data miners still prefer R for its powerful number-crunching and visualization capabilities. Moreover, R provides better control over data analysis due to its inclination towards statistical and numerical computing and its collection of libraries, providing more advanced and in-depth results to substantiate the claim.", "The programming language R continues to rise and is on schedule to become TIOBE\u2019s programming language of the year 2020.", "Job opportunities in Data Science are on the rise, and statistics show that more jobs demand Python than R. Both the programming languages are much more needed now than ever due to the pace at which Data Science is growing.", "Python, being an all-rounder programming language, can be a solid overall choice since it can allow you to do software engineering, and provide a reputable entry point into Data Science. Whereas R will be a much better option if you are to focus on extracting valuable statistics within a short period, make beautiful visualizations that speak for the numbers, and create graphical interfaces for web applications.", "A community offers support and guidance to the developers and one can say that it is the second most visited place by a developer, after the project code. It holds a significant value in quickly finding the root cause and solution to the problems at hand while offering dozens of useful tips.", "When we talk about a programming language\u2019s community, the first thing that comes to mind is its target users. Usually, it will include developers, but our case includes statisticians and data miners as well. Python is used by a diverse audience that includes applications of all sorts. R, on the other hand, is primarily used by enterprises and researchers chasing primarily statistics.", "Needless to say, both the programming languages provide an active community of developers and contributors, regularly providing invaluable insight to others and the language.", "The competing nature of the two languages might help us produce the simplest and the most efficient code for our purposes.", "Throughout this article, we discussed a handful of deciding factors among Python and R playing a leading role in picking one programming language over the other. We can conclude that even though both the languages are a respectable choice for Data Science, they still have their pros and cons. Learning Python gives you the versatility to work with a majority of Data Science-centric projects while learning R gives you a stronger hold on the statistics in Data Science. Learning both will undoubtedly give you an upper hand in your upcoming Data Science projects, but we\u2019d like to leave the final decision-making up to you.", "Note: To eliminate problems of different kinds, I want to alert you to the fact this article represent just my personal opinion I want to share, and you possess every right to disagree with it.", "I hope you\u2019ve found this article useful!
