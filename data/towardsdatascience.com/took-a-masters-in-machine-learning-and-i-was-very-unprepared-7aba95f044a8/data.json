Geniuses out there might be thinking, \u201cmeh sounds like a walk in the park\u201d, but I assure you it wasn\u2019t.", "I wrote an article in December highlighting my rejection from a Data-Science role I applied for. I\u2019ll place a link at the end of this article for those who are interested.", "My article on my rejection got around (on Medium), and a couple of individuals contacted me via LinkedIn questioning how my experience doing a master\u2019s in Machine Learning went, and more importantly, if it was worth it?", "I\u2019ll save you some time and trouble and inform you that having an advanced qualification or degree in promising and developing fields such as Machine Learning is absolutely worth it.", "From my experience thus far, I have noticed that not only do employers demand expertise in a domain; they also require proof of qualification(s) as well.", "Having a practical and theoretical knowledge of neural networks or understanding in detail the workings of backpropagation sets you above the competition.", "But I digress from the main point in this article and will get back to how I was unprepared for a Master\u2019s degree in Machine Learning.", "For those who are familiar with having too much confidence, we know it comes in various forms.", "For me, it came in two forms.", "Firstly, I had over-confidence from performing strongly in my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering (BSc). At that time, everything about the software development lifecycle seemed to click. Designing, implementing, and testing software applications became second nature as I went through the process over and over again.", "This ease of software development subsequently projected itself into my four-year career as a Web Developer. I knew how to develop the user interface of a website, supported by a well fleshed out backend system with APIs, and a connected database system, which was hosted on a hosting platform such as Amazon. Easy right?", "I wrongly assumed Machine learning would come to me as easily as Web Development did.", "Boy, was I wrong. It didn\u2019t come easy to me at all.", "My second form of overconfidence came through the underestimating how complex the Machine Learning domain was as a whole.", "My naivety to how difficult machine learning could be was, in part fuelled by the flashy news articles that mentioned how a \u201910 year practicing lawyer became a Data Scientist in 3 months\u2019.", "You couldn\u2019t escape how much hype there was around Artificial Intelligence.", "My immediate goal was to learn Machine learning in three months. So, I purchased this book.", "For those who are unfamiliar with this book, let\u2019s say that it\u2019s like you giving a book on Calculus to a kid in primary education; or like learning how to fix a bicycle by reading a book on rocket ships \u2014 I\u2019m exaggerating here, but you get the point.", "The terminologies and equations in this book looked like a whole different language to me. And some of it still does, to this day.", "Honestly speaking, the content of this book scared me, and as a result, I associated studying Machine Learning to one of the most challenging things on the planet.", "Fast foward to now, I have to admit that this book is essential for anyone that desires to take Machine Learning very seriously. This book is for those looking to go beyond the frameworks, APIs, and libraries.", "Tip: Start small if you are embarking on studying Machine Learning. Here is a resource for self-starters:", "My surplus overconfidence led to a lack of preparation embarking on the degree.", "First, there was Maths, then came essays and finally intense studying \u2014 the waking up and sleeping in the library kind of studying.", "Unfortunately, Mathematics and I have never been the best of friends in my academic career. And it was no different taking a master\u2019s degree either. Although if you were strong in Maths or Statistics in high school or undergrad, then the Maths associated with Machine learning might not seem daunting at all.", "For me, it was the opposite; I enjoyed learning about backpropagation, but then finding the partial derivatives of functions was not fun. But it had to be.", "After three years of employment, I had become accustomed to only sitting down for hours on end to meet a release date.", "But the master\u2019s degree demanded more.", "I had to increase my concentration, focus, and attention levels by four-fold. It was challenging, and I struggled for the first half of the degree.", "Concentration for me became more comfortable once I immersed myself in study groups, quiet room in libraries and utilized productivity apps", "Tip: If you find it hard to put down your phone and stay away from social media platforms, then use Forest:", "Studying from textbooks is very different from searching for solutions on StackOverflow.", "Only after underperforming in a few courses within the masters did I realize that in University, you have a pool of resources around you.", "So I took one on one sessions with some of the smartest individuals I have ever met. And went online and discovered a YouTube channel that a lot of Machine Learning Engineers and Data Scientist will be familiar with, 3Blue1Brown.", "Lastly, writing essays. Essay writing is a skill in itself, and I severely lacked in it. Sure, I could spend hours typing on my laptop, but that\u2019s when debugging or implementing code. Writing essays is different.", "Essay writing was something I had to learn by actually practicing regularly. There were no resources I found online that could help you gain essay writing skills in Machine learning, specifically.", "Tip: Practice writing and publishing articles on Medium explaining Machine learning topics and concepts. It\u2019s quite similar to writing essays in the sense that you have to conduct research and write eloquently (sometimes). Here is an example of such article below:", "Simply kept, Machine learning is no joke. Individuals have dedicated their lives to developing topics and corners within Machine learning, so believe me when I tell you that you can\u2019t master or learn Machine Learning in three months. At best, you could be aware of some of the common concepts that are easily digestible within a small time frame.", "Throughout this article, I\u2019ve mentioned my shortcomings. However, I have to give some credit to myself, as I did, against all the odds, manage to complete and pass my masters. And you should also give some credit to yourself if you have previously overcome something you deemed impossible at some point.", "Now that we have both patted ourselves on the back, it\u2019s time to humble ourselves. I wouldn\u2019t have gone through all the turmoil I did during my masters if I simply prepared adequately. My abilities in software development blinded me, and I wrongly compared learning machine learning to learning a new web development framework or library.", "Your success in a field does not guarantee success in a different field, even though they might be related. It seems obvious, I know, but it has to be said.", "The ability to maintain full concentration and focus for an extended period should honestly be considered a superpower. In the current digital age, time and attention are the new gold, and mobile apps on your devices are optimized to gain your attention, every time.", "You need to regain self-control and be able to disconnect from the internet. Disconnecting for an hour or so and using that time to focus on one specific task can be fruitful in the long run.", "To be able to focus and concentrate is a skill that requires cultivation, so be patient and start small.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far, it\u2019s only fair I tell you the outcome of the degree. I passed my masters and gained useful knowledge across various topics related to Artificial Intelligence.", "What I did find specific to my master\u2019s course (so this might not be the norm) is that you are not taught practical skills such as deploying your ML models, setting up databases. I wasn\u2019t taught about standard Data Science libraries like Sci-Kit Learn, Numpy, and Pandas. But you can learn all this yourself, independently.", "Pursuing a master\u2019s might not be necessary to obtain a Job in Machine learning or its related fields, but it does help get you through the door.", "And if you have a master\u2019s in ML and some cool projects/portfolios, you will have a competitive advantage that others might not.", "Here is the link to my rejection article, as promised below, and if you enjoyed this article and would like more, give me a follow.", "Here is an interesting article from David Chong in which he explores the reality of what Machine Learning/Data Science looks like after studies.", "Your home for data science.
