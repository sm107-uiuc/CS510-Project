Fortunately, there are many productive things that you can do from your home on the computer that can occupy your time until it is safe to go to a movie theater or play basketball at the park again. One great example of something productive to do online is learning new skills by taking courses online, and a great example of a site that provides such a service is Udemy.", "Let\u2019s face it, learning Assembly is probably one of the hardest things that an aspiring computer scientist might have the desire to do at some point during their life time. Most programmers are never going to go this low-level in programming, and don\u2019t really have a practical use for Assembly. While this is partially true, as most modern applications are web-based and fit into the context of scripting languages, learning Assembly also means", "And I believe this is an important and rather valuable ability. Firstly, you can learn about control flow, pointers, and flags. While those are all great, they tremble in comparison to the knowledge gained when working with registry cores, processor commands, and memory. That is precisely how a computer works, and as a result learning how all of those fit together and are used together will make you a better programmer and scientist all around.", "This course takes you through an extensive hardware lesson on the Atari 2600. If you\u2019re like me, even though you weren\u2019t alive during the Atari 2600\u2019s time, you might have played some games from the Atari 2600 that make you a little nostalgic for the 8-bit era (before E.T.) After getting familiar with the Atari, you\u2019ll take a deep dive into 6502 Assembly. The advantage to learning 6502 Assembly before regular x64 Assembly for your processor is that 6502 Assembly is both consistent and simple compared to modern processor Assembly.", "By the end of this 14 hour course, you will be able to create an Atari game in Assembly, assemble it in a 6502 assembler, and run your Atari game on a custom cartridge or emulator like Stella. I took this course about a year ago, and I remember very well that I still had an old Atari that was my dad\u2019s when he was young. As a prank, I created a custom cartridge with a little two player game, but more importantly \u2014 my name signed at the end. Needless to say, anybody who played the game with me was shocked and confused about how my name was signed into this game. To this day it sits up there in my grandparents attic.", "This is another course that will teach you a lot of information about the inner workings of your computer. The difference between learning how operating systems work from scratch and learning how to program the Assembly language is that learning operating systems will give you a greater connection to your software. Not only is this important for modern-day Assembly, as an example, with syscalls and various other kernel interactions, but learning how software interacts with hardware from a low-level can certainly come in handy for programming computers.", "Whether you are writing a scripting language, compiled language, or even an assembled language, being able to understand how your code interacts with your operating system and your peripherals is very important. A great thing about this course is that you can start with absolutely no knowledge besides basic computing and come out understanding how operating systems work from the ground up.", "Though this course is certainly a little shorter than the Assembly course, coming in at a cool 8 hours, the lessons are often both in-depth and concise. Not a lot of time is wasted, and that\u2019s a great thing for someone who is trying to learn without dozing off.", "The course includes an in-depth look at scheduling algorithms and memory allocation while also providing a look into what makes an operating system work.", "Shell-script/Bash automation is a concept that I am very familiar with and fond of, and you should be too. The advantage of using Bash to automate code is that you can use it as a system to tie everything together. This is along with environmental variables that can be loaded into the Bash session, as well as being able to read and write text very easily and quickly using Bash. Using Bash, you can access a whole range of applications to complete a range of tasks and utilize them however you like to automate that particular task.", "Needless to say, being comfortable with the Unix command-line and bash is definitely going to benefit your career as a programmer and scientist. In my opinion, comfort with bash is probably one of the most important skills a programmer can have. This is because it opens the door for server-administration, execution, systems scripting, and dev-ops on top of just making programming a lot easier.", "There are lots of cool courses on Udemy that could help you with just about anything computer related. Of these three, I bought the first two, and a great friend of mine recommended the third for anyone looking to learn Bash. I think that all of these are important skills that will even more importantly teach you so much that you might not have ever known about computers.", "The combination of knowing Assembly, Bash, and the inner-workings of an operating system is certainly a great chunk of knowledge to have. However, there are millions of Udemy courses that you can browse through and view, and some of them are on sale or even free. So with this pandemic, you could certainly make great use of your time by checking out the great things available on Udemy!", "Your home for data science.
