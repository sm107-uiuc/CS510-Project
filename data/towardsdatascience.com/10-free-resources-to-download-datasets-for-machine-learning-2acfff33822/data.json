You might worked on your problem, defining it as a ML problem but now have no data to train your model. Maybe you do have some data, but it\u2019s not enough to feed those data-hungry neural networks. Or maybe you do have lots of data, but it\u2019s not correctly labeled. Who said ML was easy?", "I have been there many times, and along the road I have found many online resources that have helped me to find these precious data. In an attempt to make your work easier, I have made this list of free online resources you can use to get data for your ML projects, on any topic you like. I hope you find it useful!", "In case you are searching for Reinforcement Learning environments, I recommend you to check my article with a list of them.", "You probably know it already. It was firstly published as a Beta in 2018 and it finally went out of Beta to it\u2019s official release in January this year. How did we live so long without it? I\u2019m not sure but I know that nowadays, it\u2019s the first place to go when you\u2019re looking for a dataset.", "This search engine actually searches on many of the other resources I list below, and directs you to the download page of the dataset. Once you\u2019ve entered your keywords, you can also filter your search using a number of options: last updated, download format, usage rights, topic and free (or not free). It is extremely useful and a must for anyone in ML, AI or Data Science.", "Kaggle is an online community of Data Science and ML practitioners (fun fact: it\u2019s a subsidiary of Google.) Kaggle is great for learning and improving your ML skills, in fact, my first steps into ML were on Kaggle. You can find several competitions in which you can compare and share your ML algorithms, and you can even win money if you achieve the best results.", "But apart from this, Kaggle also has its own Datasets page, which you can use to search into the more than 40.000 datasets currently hosted on Kaggle. You can also filter your searches per License, Dataset Size and File Types. Even though many datasets are very high quality, beware that most of these datasets are provided by people like you and me, and many times the quality of the data might not be the best.", "A great collection of freely available datasets out there, maintained by Github contributors. The list is currently quite large and on many different topics. As you might expect, search is not as easy as in other options in this website since it\u2019s simply an .md file with a list of datasets and their links, but it does include information about the overall status of each dataset.", "This is a great contribution and it has the warmth of the online community so at least for me, that adds something especial to it. You can also join their Slack channel if you\u2019d like to contribute to the ever growing list.", "Several countries around the world have published freely available data with varied topics such as demographics, territory, budget, laws, environment and more. These are very valuable resources and we have to thank to the open data initiative for it.", "In the Global Open Data Index, you can find a list of the countries and their open data index, which ranks them according to how many data sources they have published and how well updated and curated they are. You can also find the link to the official websites where you can find the data resources to download.", "You can also find several datasets released by the European Union in its recently launched Open Data Portal.", "Well, that\u2019s a third for Google in this list, and I promise it\u2019s the last one. Another way to find datasets is to search for papers publishing these datasets on Google scholar. This is not so direct and in fact, this is a bit old school but it can achieve great results. Just type the data you like followed by the word \u201cdataset\u201d, with a little luck some researcher might have published a dataset you can use.", "You can also find several datasets released by the European Union in its recently launched Open Data Portal.", "Well, that\u2019s a third for Google in this list, and I promise it\u2019s the last one.

Just type the data you like followed by the word \u201cdataset\u201d, with a little luck some researcher might have published a dataset you can use.", "Even though not as easy as the previos two options, the quality of datasets you can find is usually very good, since papers are generally reviewed by peers and have to achieve a certain quality standard to be published. In addition, datasets published like this are almost always freely available and re-usable in any way as long as you cite the proper publication.", "Amazon has launched its own repository of publicly available datasets, which you can search from here. Amazon is storing these datasets for free in Amazon Web Services to make them available to all the public, which makes me think the list of datasets here will continue growing over time. At the time of writing, there are 157 datasets in this repository so there are not so many options to choose from. However, the quality of the datasets published is very high because Amazon reviews it before publishing it.", "The University of California, Irvine, also hosts a repository of around 500 datasets for ML practitioners. You can find a variety of datasets: from the most basic and popular such as Iris, to more complex and new such as for Shoulder Implant X-Ray Manufacturer Classification.", "The quality of the data seems quite good in general even though datasets are donated by users of their website. I guess there is some \u201ccuration\u201d provided by the people from UCI on the datasets so quality should be generally good. You can see the full list of datasets here, and search them by name, default task and other attributes.", "Microsoft has also joined the Open Data wagon and is now sharing several interesting datasets for researchers and ML practitioners. They are currently hosting around 100 datasets from different topics such as Biology, Computer Science, Information Science, Education and more.", "The quality of the data is excellent because all of the datasets have been curated by Microsoft before being published here. They will probably continue to publish more datasets so this repository has great potential.", "Academic Torrents is a very nice website that I didn\u2019t know until a few weeks ago. It hosts a very large catalogue of datasets, intended for research purposes but you can also use them for learning and trying out things.", "You can search datasets per name or description and sorting them by size. Each dataset has a long description page in which you can also find comments, license terms and the citation you should use in your publications when using the dataset. As the name gives it away, you will need a BitTorrent client in order to download the datasets, so that\u2019s a little extra complication you will have to go through.", "FiveThirtyEight is a website that focuses on opinion poll analysis, politics, economics, and sports blogging. I have come to know it from checking their opinion polls, mostly on politics, which are also summarized in nice simple plots. But FiveThirtyEight has a less known feature: you can download the data from its polls.", "The quality of the data is not always the best and many polls only have summaries that are usually not enough for ML. However, you can find some very interesting polls that you can combine with other sources and I think it is worth mentioning.", "Ok, so this isn\u2019t a real dataset resource but it gives you the possibility of downloading historical data from stock markets and also real-time data for free. How cool is that?", "Alpaca is a company with the mission to give the possibility of using algorithms for trading for everyone. This means that you can not only access data from stocks market in real time, but also trade with real money or in a simulated environment. If you want to download historical data for any trading or investment ML project you have, you can follow the steps in my previous article:", "As usual, thank you for reading! I will try to keep this list updated with new resources I find. If you have any other recommendations, please let me know in responses so I can add it to this list.", "Your home for data science.
