If we pick two handwriting samples at random written by two people we might notice that the way the pen strokes are constructed, the spacing between letters and other details are different. In this post, we will train a model that tries to classify if two sample handwritings are written by the same person or not.", "We will use the IAM On-Line Handwriting Database which gives multiple handwriting samples per writer along with the sequence of pen strokes that were recorded in the construction of the handwriting sample.", "This dataset gives us the opportunity to tackle the problem of writer identification using two separate approaches :", "In the off-line setting we have a static image of the final result of the handwriting. This gives a global representation of what the handwriting looks like. This type of representation is probably best suited to be used as an input to a vision model.", "In this setting, we will make two images like the one above to a siamese Vision model (Resnet50 in our case) and try to predict if the two samples were written by the same person.", "The images are pre-processed to remove the extra white space on the edges and to normalize their size to (128, 1024), while being careful to keep the same aspect ratio before and after as to not deform the handwriting.", "The same encoder is used for each image to produce a fixed-length representation for each of them, then the two representations are combined and fed to a fully connected layer, to finally make the prediction.", "Since we have a set of handwritings made by each writer, we will use this information to create positive samples by selecting two examples from the same writer and negative examples by selecting samples from two different writers. We also make sure that the same writers cannot be in the training set and the evaluation set at the same time.", "Since we also have the handwriting represented as a sequence of hand strokes, with the (x, y) coordinates for each stroke path, we can use this information as input to the classifier. This sequence of coordinates gives the steps that were necessary to produce the final handwriting result, one tiny line at a time. It gives more details about the distinctive characteristics of the writer.", "The most natural way to input this format is a sequence of images for each sub-stroke, however, each handwriting has a few dozen strokes, with each stroke having multiple sub-stroke lines. This makes it unpractical to use due to memory issues and is probably not very efficient. This is why we will have to feed the raw line coordinates as a sequence of (x, y) numbers to a sequential model like a GRU.", "This has a much lighter memory usage and we will show that it can work well with a much smaller model than the image encoder.", "This means that the GRU model can tell with 92% accuracy if two sets of handwriting are made by the same writer or not when applied to unseen writers. Those are encouraging results given the small size of the dataset.", "There are multiple ways this project can be improved ->", "This was a pretty fun application of machine learning since it demonstrates that each person\u2019s handwriting may be identified. It also shows that there can be multiple ways to model the same problem that can be considered before finding the best approach.", "Your home for data science.
