If you are curious, have a look.", "Original Article:I went grocery shopping the other day and saw empty shelves. People seemed to be on edge and more distant than usual. This made me feel slightly uneasy, so when I got home, I decided to dig a little deeper into this hysteria around Corona.", "For me, the first step is always to get data. Unfortunately, for COVID-19, the data for Germany is sparse on a district (so-called \u201cLandkreis\u201d) level. Generally speaking, I feel like there is not a whole lot of data available when it comes to the number of tests administered, the number of cases reported (on granular geo-location level), and the exact time of the administered test, as well as further attributes of the cases (e.g., gender, age, and potentially preconditions).", "The intended use of this visualization is to get an impression of the development on a district level over time and to be able to quickly identify which counties are over or under proportionally affected. I found it very insightful to see which areas are severely affected and how that compares to the district that I live in (Munich) and the one I work in (Cologne).", "To get information on a district level in Germany, I took the data from the daily Robert Koch Institute (RKI) reports:", "I synthesized the data initially by hand. I briefly thought about training an optical character recognition model to extract the labels out of the maps in the reports. However, I decided against it, as this would take a couple of days.", "Update (18.03.2020):The RKI has since published a dashboard, which I scrape every morning to update the evolution of cases throughout German Landkreise.", "After scraping the data from the RKI reports, I started to build a Dash-app using Plotly. You can learn more about Plotly here:", "I then deployed the app via Serverless (utilizing AWS-Lambda and AWS API Gateway). This will minimize costs when nobody is using it and allow scaling up flexibly should the incoming traffic spike unexpectedly.", "However, this also comes with the so-called cold-start problem. This means when the app has been dormant for some time, it could take up to 20 seconds to boot up.", "Find below the code for the actual app.", "Going forward, I want to provide more information on an aggregated level as the data becomes available, especially around administered tests, their results, and the population in that area to get a truer view of the number of infected people.", "I will also try to update the daily data on a district level daily. Unfortunately, it takes about 45 minutes for each day.", "The RKI is a German federal government agency and research institute responsible for disease control and prevention. The RKI gets its information from the regional ministries for health and country ministries as constituted in \u00a711 IfSG.", "Gisanddata is a very good dashboard. It has even sparked a \u201cUX Case Study\u201d Check it out if you are interested in that kind of stuff.", "Worldometers is another global dashboard with some additional charts that allow a breakdown on a country level. I feel like the data is a little bit more up to date than Gisanddata.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "EX-Consultant turned tech geek!
