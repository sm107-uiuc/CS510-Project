The understanding of EDA that practitioners may not aware of, is the EDA uses a visually-examined dataset to understand and summarize the main characteristics of the dataset without having a prior hypothesis or relying upon statistical models.", "EDA is a crucial step prior to a formulation of new hypotheses that then could be tested on new data sets using follow-up analysis. The maximum benefit of doing EDA can only be realized when it detects the expected and discovers the unexpected from the dataset.", "The most interesting question to ask is on the interpretation of interesting patterns in the visualization that could be in the form of charts, graphs, or maps and describe what might have caused the pattern you observed.", "Consider the interactive graphic piece called \u201cBattling Infectious Diseases in the 20th Century: The Impact of Vaccines below:", "First, what we notice straight away is the color scheme. By just looking at the color and the line where it says vaccine introduced, it already delivers the evidence that vaccines work.", "This is what we should expect from the visualization we produce at the stage of EDA, which is a representation, exploration, and presentation of data to facilitate understanding. What makes one EDA differs from the other is the visualization it produces can make understanding accessible.", "Like I have said, visualization is just the product of EDA. And the better form visualizations are the interactive ones. A single visualization can only represent one aspect at a time. In the dashboard that contains multiple visualizations that are interactive, users can work and direct, select, philter with multiple representations. Just follow the link to play around with the simple dashboard that allows you to interactively philter records for various temporal aspects.", "Why is it so hard to come up with effective EDA? You could just say well, let\u2019s import some libraries and draw something.", "Because there are countless possible visual representations of data. Your goal should be about creating effective visualizations that users really understand without a lot of further explanations.", "The way to strategize your EDA is many, depending on your creativity level. However, the good start is to go over your data and understand different data types out of which the datasets are composed.", "So, what exactly data types? It could be explained as the way data is interpreted in a structured manner. Data types here does not refer to the definition of data types that we know from programming.", "Second is task abstraction. Let me give you an example to explain what does \u2018tasks\u2019 mean in visualization and the reasons to be abstract about it. The first thing that \u2018tasks\u2019 do is it justifies the use of visualization when we perform our EDA. Some may think that a perfect visualization is created when it ticks all the checklist that appears in the guidelines, but if it does not provide the insights and answer the questions initially asked by the user, no matter how pretty it is, it serves little to no purpose to the user.", "This is how the \u2018tasks\u2019 by the user matter. When users want to analyze data, consideration of the domain from which the users come from, determine how the users think", "I hope you learn something new from this post.", "Thank you for reading.
