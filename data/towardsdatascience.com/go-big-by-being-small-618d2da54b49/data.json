I was just casually scrolling through the internet and voila! It didn\u2019t take me long to gather all of the datasets I needed. But when I thought everything went smooth sailing with my boat, a Kraken appeared \u2014 of course not the sea monster but it required tons of brainstorming sessions. The dataset that I\u2019ve been collecting is too small to work with, I\u2019m talking 20 to 30 periodic observations, yikes. You may ask, why didn\u2019t you realize that it\u2019s insufficient just by looking at the number of observations? Well, to be frank, I did feel a little bit worried when I saw the \u201chandful\u201d amount of observations. But it hit me when I realized it\u2019s not enough to be implemented in the model I was researching.", "After quite a few hours, a book, and a glass of coffee, I\u2019ve finally found inspiration on how to work with these small datasets, extrapolate it, appropriately. At first, I genuinely thought my idea is going to cause quite an error in the model, but thankfully, it went well and I finished my paper. So in this article, I wanted to share the methods that I used working with a univariate dataset and a new method that I\u2019ve developed for a multivariate dataset.", "A dataset with provided MOE is so useful in this extrapolation method because the MOE is one of the key factors on how accurate the extrapolated values will be. In this case, I\u2019ll be using the US Annual Mean Income, gathered from the United States Census Bureau, Table S1901. With the MOE on board, we can easily get the minimum and maximum values of mean income for each year. By knowing these values, we extrapolate it according to its annual values by generating random variates from the Uniform(0,1) Distribution, to represent the standardized values of the mean income. Then, we convert the standardized values back to the actual values using the minimum and the maximum values like so", "Say that I wanted to extrapolate the dataset because I want to recreate monthly mean income, I\u2019ll be needing 12 random uniform variates to be converted each year. Here\u2019s a side by side plot comparison of the real and the extrapolated datasets.", "As we can see, the increasing trend is still there, it\u2019s just noisier since now it has monthly instead of annual values. And if we check the difference between the statistical properties", "Now, this condition was the problem I mentioned before. I was confused about how I\u2019m supposed to get info on the periodical variance of the data that I was working on. Luckily, the solution only requires two main features: A time-series model that fits the distribution of the dataset and some randomizing standardized values.", "In this example, I\u2019m going to use the monthly sunspots dataset which you can acquire here. And yes, it\u2019s already a huge dataset so no need for extrapolation, am I right? But let\u2019s say you\u2019re only given the last 3 years of observations and was told to generate daily values for the last 3 years based on that.", "Now let\u2019s pick the model. From the beginning, we know that this is a monthly dataset. So why don\u2019t we pick something simple? We\u2019re going to use a linear seasonal regression model to be fitted to the dataset. Here\u2019s the result:", "That\u2019s quite a great fit. Now we\u2019re going to use the estimate and the standard error from this result to extrapolate the data. In other words, if we look back to the previous example, we can use the estimates and standard errors as the \u201cmean income\u201d and MOE respectively. Since we\u2019re going to generate daily values, the values will be generated according to the number of days in the month along with the estimate and standard error \u2014 I\u2019m using a confidence level of 95% from this point on. Here are the extrapolated daily values:", "One thing that immediately feels off is the lack of a decreasing trend in the original dataset. I\u2019m doing it on purpose to show how important it is to pick an appropriate model according to the dataset we\u2019re working on. By this result, we can conclude that the linear seasonal regression model is not the perfect fit for this dataset. Moreover, by using a regression we immediately assume a stationary condition in the dataset, which causing the extrapolated values to look like a stationary time series.", "Down to the last example, it took me quite a while to think of a way to extrapolate a multivariate dataset. Nevertheless, here\u2019s one of the methods of doing it. In this last example, I\u2019m using New Delhi Climate Training Dataset from Kaggle.", "Likewise, let\u2019s investigate the dataset first. Since I was expecting a correlation between the variables, I\u2019ll start with the scatterplots between the variables.", "Now my eyes immediately make its way to the pressure section albeit the apparent negative correlation between the temperature and humidity. Something feels off with the plot, and I immediately realize it must be some outliers knowing some values differ much from the rest. I understand that I\u2019m no expert in this climate section of knowledge, so I\u2019m calling our best friend and jack-of-all-trades, Google, to help me to find out the normal values for air pressure, and it sent me here. Turns out, the values should be around 1013.25 millibars. Hence, according to the dataset and the website, pressure values that lie between 990 and 1024 will be considered as normal. Then, the outliers will be replaced according to the distribution of the dataset.", "You might be wondering, there must be a twist to this example since there are already a lot of observations. YOU GUESSED IT RIGHT! (really sorry for my corny jokes trying to get your attention back lol)", "The twist here is that you\u2019re actually given the monthly average from each variable and you need to convert it back to daily values. Now, based on the last two examples I gave out before, please answer this question", "Is it going to work? Is it possible to do so?", "Save your answer until the end of this article, and let\u2019s see.", "First, as we did earlier, let\u2019s take a look at the scatterplots between the variables.", "Well, seems like our dataset is correlated to each other. Here\u2019s what I can see from this plot:", "With these in mind, I decided to create a linear and quadratic regression model for every possible pair of variables, then compare their R-Squared and Adjusted R-Squared values. Also, I\u2019m going to create a linear seasonal regression model for each variable since it definitely has a seasonal pattern based on the plots below.", "Before doing the regressions, it\u2019s best for the values to be standardized since the variation of values isn\u2019t similar. Here\u2019s the result of the model fitting:", "Let\u2019s focus on the relation between the variables. Excluding the seasonal regression results (row 1\u20134), the highest R-Squared value is the quadratic model where pressure as the independent variable and temperature as the dependent one. Whereas the other model doesn\u2019t seem to have a great fit albeit the scatterplot showed an indication of correlation. Fortunately, the seasonal model is a great fit for all variables. With these in mind, here\u2019s my plan:", "And now, the moment you\u2019ve been waiting for, the comparison of the real versus the extrapolated values (the blue line is the extrapolated one).", "Each extrapolated values fit well with the actual values, and not so bad with the temperature. But, our million-dollar question hasn\u2019t been answered yet. To convert the values back to daily values, we\u2019re going to need a little bit of math here.", "in which n is the number of samples. Then, we can acquire the variance of the monthly averages, which is", "in which Yj^s is the standardized version of the monthly averages. Finally, we derive the standard error of the daily values with this set of equations:", "Aaaandd without further ado, let\u2019s see how the daily extrapolated values turned out.", "My first reaction was \u201cWhat kind of noisy time-series is this? This is nuts!\u201d. I don\u2019t think we need to explain anything to answer the question, it\u2019s a definite no, at least using this method. The extrapolated values become too noisy and only effective for the short-term since we use extrapolated data to extrapolate \u2014 #extrapo-ception. Moreover, the monthly average values don\u2019t carry the \u201cjumps\u201d as the daily values do, causing the extrapolated daily values unable to capture it.", "I might be not the expert in this, but I did learn to work creatively with a time-series dataset. Even so, I would like to hear your suggestions that may improve this method even more. So, below is my GitHub repo of this time-series extrapolation method. I will definitely post more data science or actuarial science projects in the near future, so stay tuned!", "Your home for data science.
