Those deals information is valuable user behavioral data, and interesting questions and answers could be retrieved from it. Slickdeals.com is one of the popular sites for deals and coupons. The Frontpage Slickdeals are recommended deals in the last 24 hours by either community members or editors from Slickdeals. The scope of the deals covers a variety of categories, and prices range from free stuff to thousands of dollars.", "In this article, we are going to exploring a dataset from Slickdeals and perform data analysis with Pandas and Plotly Express. I hope this article can provide some interesting examples from collecting raw data, as well as some insights on how to use Pandas and Plotly Express to perform data analysis and visualization.", "As a data guru, we\u2019d need data to work with. One of the challenging tasks of performing any type of web analysis is time. Since the available data for any website is only current, It is difficult to trace back what had happened before or perform any type of time travel analysis. For example, on the Slickdeals home page, if we saw a popular deal with 46 thumbs up, we don\u2019t have any ideas on how fast it gets here. In this case, a web scraping tooling is very helpful in collecting data for this purpose. The detail is covered in one of article How To Detect The Best Deals With Web Scraping", "To collect enough data, I have run the web scraping program for two weeks with 15 minutes interval, which should be able to capture changes across date and time. You can find two weeks of data here.", "After collecting data from the web for some time, we are at the parsing and cleaning stage. Here we added the raw data with columns name and change the format of the date-time column from string to date format. A convenient thing pandas makes it easier is read_csv function, we can get data directly from the web and convert it to a CSV file.", "Some interesting questions can be asked on this Slickdeals dataset. One of the items would be \u201cWhat is the most popular deal among the frontpage deals?\u201d. To find the answer to that, from the Slickdeal dataset, we can compare how many times a deal appears on the Slickdeals homepage. Since the web scraping happened every 15 minutes, the more time it shows, the higher chance that item would be the most popular one.", "Then we could use the following code to group by all the title and perform a count, then sort count in descending order, the sorting here will ensure Plotly Express to show the lines in order.", "To visualize it, we can use Plotly Express to create a beautiful bar chart for the top 20 deals.", "From the result above, \u201cApple AirPods Pro\u201d is clear to be recognized as the top deal among the last two weeks on the Frontpage section. But did we count duplicates? We will find out on that next.", "What is the trend looks like for the top deal?", "Since the \u201cApple AirPods Pro\u201d is the one deal, we pick this one for further analysis, and let\u2019s dig in and explore what the trend looks like in this case. To get a better idea of the popularity of this deal, one of the measurements is how many people click the \u201clike\u201d button. Slickdeals could potentially use the \u201clike\u201d button as one of its features for its recommendation. Exploring the number of \u201clikes\u201d increased by date and hour could be exciting.", "However, after plotting the data on the chart, the chart looks odd, we\u2019d expected a perfect curve indicating the increase, but the chart above looks like the number jump back and force. It seems at the starting point of popularity, and we tracked two data points. So the question is, \u201cIs there any duplicate data?\u201d", "The answer is \u201cYes\u201d, the reason is Slickdeals have two deals from different stores but with the same title. We can see that Verizon Wireless first had this deal on the front page on 4/17. A few days later, Google Shopping caught up and also listed on the front page for a specified period. Then the Google Shopping went way. It\u2019s unclear if the algorithm that Slickdeal performed deduplication process cases like this to prioritize the first deal, or one of the deals just lost the competition. But we can see from the chart below that Verizon\u2019s deal lasts longer and popular. To verify our assumption, we can show both stores in the line chart, color is a parameter that we can set to split the data to show in different groups.", "Is there a correlation between likes and comments for the top deals?", "In the frequency_frontdeal we can get the first ten rows and plot them in the chart. We can then observe the relationship between the number of likes and comments.", "From the picture above, we can see both cases that comments and likes perform a similar trend. And some products can even have more comments than likes, this could be multiple threads of discussion about the deals and could be another reason that this deal landed on the front page.", "We can perform more analysis and collect more fields from the web scraping program. Collecting data from the web for analysis is easy and cheap to set up. However, it would take some time to collect data for detailed analysis. We can set a web scraping tool running on Raspberry Pi and collect data. This solution is more flexible than purchasing data from 3rd party. This article shows how easy to analyze the data we pulled from the web and perform analysis using Pandas and Plotly Express, I hope it shows a different approach towards data collection and analysis.", "I hope this story is helpful to you.
