Some of you might not be, but have heard a lot about it, and some of you might not be, but have a professional interest in how it can be applied in your sector.", "Many organisations have already embraced data science and can support large teams working on everything from extracting insight from data to make better decisions, to developing and implementing machine-learning models at scale. Many organisations just don\u2019t have the resources to do that; there just may not be the economy of scale to make that first data scientist hire work, or there might always be that project that just has to get priority.", "However, there is an answer. One that benefits data scientists and those that are developing their skills and portfolios, and one that benefits many of those organisations. In this post, we will take a brief look at how we define data science and how it can be used by charitable and third sector organisations \u2014 for the non-data scientists \u2014 and how data science itself can be donated as an asset to drive change and advancement.", "New technologies are leading to an exponential increase in the volume and types of data available, creating unprecedented possibilities for informing and transforming society and protecting the environment. Governments, companies, researchers and citizen groups are in a ferment of experimentation, innovation and adaptation to the new world of data, a world in which data are bigger, faster and more detailed than ever before. This is the data revolution.", "Some are already living in this new world. But too many people, organisations and governments are excluded because of lack of resources, knowledge, capacity or opportunity. There are huge and growing inequalities in access to data and information and in the ability to use it.", "For further adventures where business meets data science, follow Chris on Twitter.", "Our world is generating data at an incredible rate. As more and more devices take advantage of an internet connection to offer more functionality and convenience \u2014 the \u2018Internet of Things\u2019 \u2014 the rate at which we produce that data will continue to increase. Beyond some of the most visible applications, such as improved product recommendations in your online shopping cart and a more relevant set of \u2018up next\u2019 cat videos, data science can lead to knowledge that was there in the data, just waiting to be found. And some of that knowledge could just be the thing that changes the world, or even just be the first step in fixing that one small problem.", "If you were to ask ten people, you may well end up with ten different definitions as to what data science is, and what a data scientist does. Fundamentally, data science is about using statistical and computational techniques to turn the data that is available from myriad sources into findings and conclusions that generate insight, facilitate informed decision making, reveal patterns and trends and allow us to make predictions.", "\u201cNew technologies are leading to an exponential increase in the volume and types of data available, creating unprecedented possibilities for informing and transforming society and protecting the environment.

There are huge and growing inequalities in access to data and information and in the ability to use it.\u201d", "-The UN Secretary General\u2019s Independent Expert Advisory Group on a Data Revolution for Sustainable Development", "It is easy to see how data science can be put to use in certain fields. Banks, for example, can build analytical pipelines to look for features in credit applications that are associated with loan defaults; streaming video sites can recommend films on the basis of your viewing history, and mobile phone companies can build models to predict whether a customer won\u2019t renew their contract and target them with appropriate offers.", "It might not be immediately obvious to see how data science can be put to use in organisations focussed on charitable and advancement activities, but data science can be as effective and useful in these sectors as it is in blue-chip business or tech startups.", "Starting with basic effectiveness and efficiency, data science can inform all aspects of organisational management, from employee recruitment and retention, to marketing, to estates and operations. In a recent example of applying machine learning to facilities management, Google was able to use its algorithms to reduce the amount of energy it uses for cooling its data centres by 40%.", "As machine learning approaches begin to be applied across more of an organisation\u2019s activities, the potential savings through increased efficiency could make a significant difference to costs, decreasing the percentage of each donation that goes toward organisational overhead.", "Even though reduced operational costs can maximise the amount of each donation that gets put to work, there will always be a desire to ensure that donations are put to work where they will deliver the most impact, and to ensure that the effectiveness of that donation is monitored.", "Data science can help here as well, with AI-based models put to work looking for features in prospective projects that are associated with strong performance and successful outcomes, and algorithms that can assess the performance of projects in real-time, from following social media opinion using sentiment analysis, using statistical analysis to look for an uplift in economic growth in a particular sector, or using data science techniques to combine and complement data from different sources to drive healthcare initiatives, such as malaria control in Namibia.", "In my experience of having conversations about the application of data science in a number of areas, such as procurement and inventory management, sustainable fashion and tourism, often the only limit is your imagination. If you can get a data scientist and a domain expert together for a casual conversation over a coffee or a pint after work, you may well be amazed by how many ideas can get scribbled on a napkin in one evening.", "While it is clear that data science can empower not only the selection and management of philanthropic projects, ensuring donations are put to the best use, there is an increasing movement in data science being the donation.", "With organisations making large investments in not only their own data infrastructure, acquisition, storage and analysis, but also in their data scientists, the data science function of a company is a valuable asset, and one that has the potential to deliver value both within and outwith the organisation. This value has made \u2018philanthropic data science\u2019 a growing area for corporate outreach and social responsibility programs.", "The MasterCard Foundation\u2019s Center for Inclusive Growth is one example of global corporations leveraging their resources and expertise to give back. The centre\u2019s central philosophy is to use \u201cthe company\u2019s core assets to catalyse action on inclusive growth through: research, data philanthropy, programs and engagement.\u201d", "And it\u2019s not just multi-national companies that are giving back through data science. Organisations such as DataKind give data scientists the chance to give back by donating their own time and expertise to projects that may have accumulated data, but don\u2019t have the in-house skills to utilise it.", "\u201cData science competitions to save the world\u201d", "with competitions covering everything from conservation to improving public services. If you want to improve your data science techniques while knowing that what you code and build might change someone\u2019s life, there are ways to do it, wherever you are.", "With more organisations continuing to develop novel data science tools as products and apply data science-driven process to other aspects of their business processes, it is likely that data-driven approaches will become increasingly commonplace across all sectors. As this expansion drives an increase in data science resources, and individuals across all areas of an organisation find ways to take advantage of them, the application of data science will undoubtedly be felt in philanthropy, fundraising and advancement.", "The way I see it, it takes two to tango. There needs to be a data scientist willing to give back, and there needs to be an organisation who\u2019s willing to let them.", "For the data scientists \u2014 particularly if you\u2019re at an early stage of your career and looking to gain more experience working on more projects \u2014 find some charitable organisations whose cause appeals to you and get in touch. You might not want to promise the world, but just see if they\u2019re willing to have that first conversation; that one that gets both sides thinking and excited about putting a collaboration together.", "For the organisations, make it easy for them. Yes, you might have reservations about letting people loose on your data, but fields can often be removed from databases or personally identifiable information anonymised or aggregated. If you want to become a data-driven organisation, or at least dip your toe in the water, the first step is having a culture in place that allows you to think about becoming data driven; if nobody sees the potential value in it, then it\u2019s unlikely that the email from that data scientist will get a positive reply.", "There are a lot of good data scientists out there who want to give back, and there are a lot of people doing good work in making the world a better place. Let\u2019s see if we can bring more of them together and speed that process up.", "Your home for data science.
