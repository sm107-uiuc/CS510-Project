Their model has even been called the preferred model of the White House Coronavirus Task Force. But these models have also garnered a lot of skepticism and concern about their validity and how they are being used. In this article, we\u2019ll take a quick look at some of the data from these models and attempt to give proper context around how they were created and their limitations.", "Firstly, it is important to note that the IHME model is not an epidemiological model. It is neither a SIR model nor is it one of the more computationally intensive agent-based models. The IHME forecast is an empirical model that takes the shape of the death curves from other countries and attempts to fit current data to those curves. The IHME model starts with data from regions where there were early outbreaks of COVID-19, such as Wuhan and a number of cities in Spain and Italy. They then use their own open-source Python-based curve fitting tool (appropriately called CurveFit) to fit the US death data to the death rate curves from Wuhan and other selected regions.", "The IHME forecast is an empirical model that takes the shape of the death curves from other countries and attempts to fit current data to those curves", "The biggest assumption here should be somewhat obvious; this model assumes that the progression of the disease through US populations will be similar to its progression through these other regions.", "This is the point that has raised the most alarms since \u2014 as critics argue \u2014 US States all have different levels of restrictions and none of them are following the 100% lockdown that was seen in Wuhan.", "The forecasts can largely be broken into two categories: the death forecasts and hospital resource forecasts.", "With all of these charts, the x-axis shows the date and the y-axis shows the count (e.g. on the Daily New Deaths Projections chart the y-axis shows the number of deaths). The red and blue line displays the actual value up until the current date. After that point, we are looking at the projected value. For the forecast value, the portion pink shows the upper and lower bounds and the line shows the expected value.", "The first category is death forecasts. The goal here was simply to predict the number of projected daily new deaths assuming full shelter-in-place quarantine across the country.", "The Daily New Deaths Projections chart shows deaths per day (not to be confused with the next chart, which shows the cumulative number of deaths). This daily new deaths projection shows the growth curve for death rates in the US and is the most important visual for determining how well we are flattening the curve. If you inspect the chart, you\u2019ll see that this visualization shows deaths in the US spiking in late April/early May and then steeply dropping off until late May. But as with all of the IHME visualizations, the uncertainty is huge. At the peak, the upper and lower bounds range from 8,000 deaths (in one day) to under 1,000.", "The second death chart, the Total Deaths \u2014 Projections chart, shows total cumulative deaths. As you would guess from the first chart, as the number of daily new deaths plummets, the cumulative number of deaths levels off. But again, the uncertainty here is huge. The upper and lower bounds of total deaths goes from around 40,000 to 140,000, greatly limiting the utility of this model for predicting COVID-19 deaths in the US.", "The second category is Hospital Resource Forecasts. As the IHME mention on their website, the original goal of this article was to forecast resource demand for hospitals. They wanted to create forecasts to help hospital administrators anticipate resource demand as a result of COVID-19.", "Thus the models attempt to anticipate the need for ICU beds, non-ICU beds, and invasive ventilators \u2014 all for COVID-19 cases.", "The New ICU Daily chart shows the anticipated need for ICU admissions across the US. The shape of the curve closely mirrors that of the daily deaths curve \u2014 which seems logical since most COVID-19 mortalities would likely spend some time in the ICU.", "The Ventilators Projections chart shows the anticipated need for invasive ventilators for COVID-19 cases.", "The Admissions Projections chart shows the projected need for hospital beds for non-ICU COVID-19 cases.", "\u201cAll models are wrong, but some are useful\u201c\u2014 A statistics aphorism attributed to George E.P. Box", "As mentioned above, the fact that the IHME model uses Wuhan data for their projections has caused a backlash of criticism.", "While the epidemiological standard is to use SIR models or agent-based models, the IHME model is purely statistical. It is created by fitting new numbers to existing distributions (like from Wuhan or Italy). This means that the model does now allow for the adjustment of parameters (like mortality rate) based on domain expertise.", "This is not to say that the IHME model is not valuable. Purely empirical models like the IHME can be powerful forecasting tools \u2014 especially when factors like transmission rate and population-specific mortality rate are not well understood. But anyone consulting the IHME models must be careful to consider the assumptions involved and only to use them within the proper context.", "The most crucial takeaway is that journalists (and the US government) need to be cautious when using and reporting these IHME models. They need to be sensitive to the assumptions that went into the models and the limitations that arise from those assumptions. Different models are useful in different domains. During a pandemic, misunderstanding a model can literally be a matter of life and death.", "If you would like to take a look at the IHME forecast data for yourself, you can find live visualizations in the Knowi Coronavirus Data Hub.", "The IHME published a scientific paper describing the forecasts on the Medrxiv preprint server. This means that it is not yet peer-reviewed but is being inspected by the scientific community at large.", "Read the full IHME paper here on Medrxiv", "Check out the IHME FAQ where they discuss some of this.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
