Such a dataset is easy to get lost in and can lead to challenges like overfitting. Luckily, variables (or features) are often correlated, as high-dimensional data are often dominated by a small number of simple variables. We can find a subset of the variables to represent the same level of information in the data or transform the variables to a new set of variables without losing much information. This is when dimensionality reduction algorithms become useful.", "The dataset we will use examines customers\u2019 credit card default payments in Taiwan. It comes courtesy of the UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository.", "The dataset employed a binary variable, default payment (Yes = 1, No = 0), as the response variable. It contains the following 23 variables as explanatory variables:", "X1: Amount of the given credit", "X6 \u2014 X11: History of past payment (from April to September, 2005). The measurement scale for the repayment status is: -1 = pay duly; 1 = payment delay for one month; 2 = payment delay for two months; . . .; 9 = payment delay for nine months and so on.", "Playing around with distributions of default (or another target variable) is can be an interesting exercise.", "The dataset features 3000 something rows and 24 columns, of which 23 are explanatory. There are no null values (score!) and the dataset seems to be skewed heavily (~78%) towards no default instances.", "Feature scaling standardizes data columns and is an important step of data pre-processing. Normalizing the data within a particular range also helps speed up calculations.", "Splitting data into test and train sets", "In machine learning, algorithms are constructed that can learn from and make predictions on data. Models are initially fit on a training dataset, which is a set of examples used to fit the parameters. The model is trained on the training dataset using a specific machine learning method. However, you cannot do a simple train-test split that does a random split that disregards the distribution or proportions of the classes.", "In this scenario, you would end up with a training and a test set with totally different data distributions. A model trained on a vastly different data distribution than the test set will perform inferiorly at validation.", "To have a balanced dataset and to avoid overfitting, it is important to remove data points. In this data set, around 70\u201375% of entries or non-default instances.", "We want to avoid the model not being able to tell the default and non-default instances and instead \u201chone-in\u201d on the latter.", "Thus, we remove entries until there is a 50/50 ratio between default and non-default instances. One of the issues with this is significant information loss.", "Correlation matrices allow us to determine which features influence most in whether a specific case will be an instance of default. It is important that we use the correct subsample in order for us to see which features have a high correlation to instances of default.", "Negative correlations occur when the lower these values are, the more likely the end result will be a default transaction. Positive correlations occur when the higher these values are, the more likely the end result will be a default transaction. In this case, it seems the balance transaction variables X12 \u2014 X17 correlate most heavily so that is what we will focus on.", "Removing outliers from features that are highly correlated with our classes will result in a more accurate model.", "One method of doing this is the Interquartile Range Method (IQR), which eliminates instances that fall outside the range between the 25th and 75th percentiles.", "The idea of principal component analysis (PCA) is to reduce the dimensionality of a dataset consisting of a large number of related variables, while retaining as much variance in the data as possible.", "PCA helps us to extract a new set of variables from an existing large set of variables. These newly extracted variables are called Principal Components.", "A principal component is a linear combination of the original variables. Other intricacies include:", "Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) can be used to decompose our original dataset into its constituents, which results in dimensionality reduction.", "It is used to remove redundant features from the dataset.", "SVD decomposes the original variables into three constituent matrices. The concepts of Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors are used to determine those three matrices.", "t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a nonlinear dimensionality reduction technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets in a low-dimensional space of two or three dimensions", "Basically, t-SNE allows you to easily visualize how the data is arranged in a high-dimensional space.", "The t-SNE algorithm calculates a similarity measure between pairs of instances in the high dimensional space and in the low dimensional space. It then tries to optimize these two similarity measures using a cost function.", "t-SNE differs from PCA by preserving only small pairwise distances or local similarities whereas PCA is concerned with preserving large pairwise distances to maximize variance.", "While that\u2019s the end of sampling dimensional reduction methods with this dataset, many more things could be done with it! For starters, classifiers could be used on the data once the dataset has its features separated from its labels. This particular dataset might warrant using GridSearchCV or a Logistic Regression.", "The model should also be evaluated for both underfitting and overfitting, which you could determine via a high bias and variance respectively. Whether you undersample or oversample might influence how accurately the model detects default cases. As you can see, there is a lot to consider when handling a high-dimensional imbalanced dataset!", "Your home for data science.
