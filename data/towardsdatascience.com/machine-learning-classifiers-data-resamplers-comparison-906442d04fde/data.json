Some of the most widely used algorithms are logistic regression, Na\u00efve Bayes, stochastic gradient descent, k-nearest neighbors, decision trees, random forests and support vector machines.", "Classification models must be evaluated to determine their degree of effectiveness for performing a specific task. While good classification models are useful for prediction purposes, poor classification models lead to unreliable outcomes, and thus, are not useful for the user.", "Performance evaluation metrics are based on the total number of the following variables:", "which are visually represented in a matrix (i.e. confusion matrix) where one of its axis is the label that the machine learning model predicted, and the other the actual label:", "There are four main performance metrics used to evaluate the effectiveness of classification models:", "Unbalanced data sets are sets in which the total number of samples in different classes vary significantly, leading machine learning classifiers to be biased towards the class with the larger of samples (i.e. majority class). The image below illustrates the training of a Linear SVC (Support Vector Classifier) with different level of class balancing.", "To deal with this issue, there are two groups of resampling techniques used to balance data sets:", "Undersampling consists in reducing the number of samples from the majority class to match it with the number of samples from the minority class. Some undersampling techniques include: random undersampling, Tomek\u2019s Links and condensed nearest neighbors.", "Oversampling consists in increasing the number of samples from the minority class to match it with the number of samples from the majority class. Some oversampling techniques include: random oversampling, SMOTE, SMOTE-NC, Borderline SMOTE and Adaptive Synthetic.", "For the following example, let\u2019s evaluate the performance of a logistic regression model on the Framingham Heart Study data set (a study conducted to identify the common factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases) after applying eleven different resampling techniques (Random Under Sampling, Near Miss I, Near Miss II, Near Miss III, Tomek Links, Condensed Nearest Neighbors, SMOTE, Borderline SMOTE, SMOTE-NC, Adaptive Synthetic and Random Over Sampling) to determine the one that leads to the most reliable outcomes.", "The following Python code will be divided into five major steps. Lines of comments are included to provide a brief explanation and guide you through the coding process.", "According to the plot above, the Framingham Heart Study contains more data points corresponding to women than to men.", "The plot above reveals that the Framingham Heart Study is a heavily unbalanced data set. Most of the data points correspond to a negative class (i.e. low risk of developing a cardiovascular disease in ten years). Further data balancing will be necessary to address this issue.", "Interesting. Even though the total number of data points corresponding to men was lower, the plot above suggests that the risk of developing a cardiovascular disease on men is higher than on women.", "According to the results from the table above, the logistic regression model developed for the data set balanced with the condensed nearest neighbors under sampling technique obtained the best precision, recall and F1-score, and the third best accuracy score, making it the most reliable model for this data set.", "In contrast with the performance measures scores obtained from the logistic regression model developed for the original unbalanced data set, the performance measures scores for the model developed for the balanced data set improved. The precision score increased from 0.6135 to 0.6596, the recall score from 0.0777 to 0.7929 and the F1-score from 0.1362 to 0.7188. However, the accuracy score decreased from 0.8512 to 0.6260. According to the results from the table above, there is no resampling technique that improves the model\u2019s accuracy score, since the highest one was the one obtained by Random Under Sampling technique with a value of 0.6516.", "After the condensed nearest neighbor has been identified as the best resampling technique that leads to the most reliable machine learning model, the next step would consist in tuning its parameters to determine if its performance can further be improved.", "It is worth specifying that during the instantiation of machine learning classifier and the resampling techniques in the code above, their parameters were set to the default ones, except for the max_iter parameter in the logistic regression model to achieve model convergence and the random_state parameter in some resampling functions for replicability.", "In the previous example, just one machine learning classifier (i.e. logistic regression) was developed and evaluated with multiple resampling techniques. However, the development of other machine learning classifiers (e.g. decision trees, random forests, support vector classifier, Gaussian Na\u00efve Bayes classifier) might lead to better outcomes. Try replicating this experiment with other machine learning classifiers to determine if there is a better combination of classifiers and resampling techniques for this data set.", "In the same way, the machine learning model was built using the entire data set (i.e. data points corresponding to men and women), which assumes that the factors that contribute to cardiovascular diseases have the same weight on both genders. As a way of practicing your coding skills, try splitting the data set by gender and build classification models for each one. Compare their performances using the evaluation metrics discussed in this article and evaluate if it results more convenient to have independent classification models for each gender or a common one for both of them.", "Machine learning and artificial intelligence algorithms have many useful and diverse applications to solve problems and complex tasks. In addition to data science, they have become highly popular research trends within academics and professionals with new emerging research lines in a wide range of fields. Researches continue updating and developing new programming libraries and packages for multiple programming languages and software to facilitate the implementation and execution of such algorithms.", "Dealing with unbalanced data sets and choosing the most appropriate resampling technique represents a significant step in data science projects. An adequate resampling technique selection could lead to more reliable machine learning models, while an inadequate selection could lead to biases machine learning models incapable of predicting accurate outcomes. This article showed one approach for deciding the best resampling technique for the given data set.", "Python represents a great free and open-source programming language capable of performing a wide range of machine learning, artificial intelligence, data science and data analytical tasks. Some of its most popular machine learning and deep learning libraries include scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, Pandas and NLTK. Data scientist and analysts must take the best out of these tools to solve real-life complex problems and tasks to bring added value to an organization, client or research field.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
