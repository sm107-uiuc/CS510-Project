That's what a Fourier transform does. It takes up a signal and decomposes it to the frequencies that made it up.", "In our example, a Fourier transform would decompose the signal S3 into its constituent frequencies like signals S1 and S2", "But, How can we recover the original signals? What will the Fourier transform do for us ?", "Let the three signals in the above picture are S1, S2, and S3 and when we merge these three signals together we get the signal in Red which is actually the sum of the three signals S1+S2+S3.", "What Fourier transform does is It kind of moves us from the time domain to frequency domain.", "In case, If anyone is wondering, What if we want to go back from the frequency domain to the time domain ?", "We can do so by using Inverse Fourier transform(IFT). But we won't be discussing this in this article.", "If we want to describe a signal, we need three things :", "The very first example that we took was very simple, every signal had the same frequency and phase difference and only different amplitudes.", "We will now look at a slightly complex example and we will look at the individual signal from the above example because in order to understand Fourier transform better we need to look at the individual signals closely.", "Below is the original signals that we were looking above.", "Frequency: If we look closely at the three signals, we will notice that the frequency of all the three signals is different.", "If for the same period of time, in signal 1 there is n number of waves then there are 2n number of waves in signal 2 and vice versa.", "Phase: Also, when we look closely as to where actually the signal starts. We will find that While signal 1 starts at (0,0), signal 2 starts at (-0.5,0) if we trace the wave to meet the y-axis at 0. So, at 0 we already have the maximum amplitude of the signal. This is what we call Phase shift.", "Amplitude: All the three signals have different amplitudes, Signal 1 has an amplitude of 1 while signal 2 and signal 3 has an amplitude of 2 and 3 respectively.", "This is all captured in an elegant and super simple mathematical formula. So, In the above examples if the x-axis is termed as x and y-axis is termed as y. We can generate y as a function of t such that :", "Using this formula, we can generate any type of signal that we want and then we can merge them together and play with them. For example, If we merge signals 1, 2 and 3. we will get a signal like this :", "The main idea behind Fourier transform is that :", "Any continuous signal in the time domain can be represented uniquely and unambiguously by an infinite series of sinusoids.", "It means that, If we have a signal and this signal is generated by some function x(t) then we can come up with another function f(t) such that :", "So, It doesn't matter how strong the signal is, we can find a function like f(t) which is a sum of an infinite series of sinusoids that will actually represent the signal perfectly.", "Now, the question that arises now is, How do we find the coefficients here in the above equation because these are the values that would determine the shape of the output and thus the signal.", "So, to get these coefficients we use Fourier transforms and the result from Fourier transform is a group of coefficients. So, we use X(F) to denote the Fourier coefficients and it is a function of frequency which we get by solving the integral such that :", "The tricky part in this integral is actually the i which denotes a complex number. So, we probably remember that i\u00b2 = -1 or i = \u221a-1. It also might help to remember that the form of a complex number is a + ib . So, It has a real and imaginary part.", "Also, when we actually solve the above integral, we get these complex numbers where a and b correspond to the coefficients that we are after.", "We do have however three problems that we need to deal with :", "So, let\u2019s start with the second one.", "To understand Discrete Fourier Transform, we first need to understand how to sample a continuous signal?", "According to Wikipedia, In signal processing, sampling is the reduction of a continuous-time signal to a discrete-time signal. Here is an example of how the form of the signal changes with the change in sampling rate :", "Let the original signal be a signal with an amplitude of two and frequency of five over a period of one second :", "Now, as we decrease the sampling rate, let's look at how the shape of the signal changes :", "As we decrease the sampling the sampling rate further, we get :", "So, the bottom line is : The higher the sampling rate, the better the quality of the signal and also we can distinguish between more frequencies.", "Now, that we know how to sample the signals, we will look at the modification of the algorithms known as Discrete Fourier Transform.", "Any sampled signal of length N in the time domain can be represented uniquely and unambiguously by a finite series of sinusoids.", "So, We don\u2019t have to deal with infinity anymore in our new definition.", "In standard Fourier Transform, we used a function of time x(t) to generate a continuous signal. Now In the discrete case, we don't have a function, we have a dataset, a set of points which we get by sampling the continuous signal. So, I will use {x} to donate a dataset such that it contains the reading from the sampling such that :", "and what Discrete Fourier Transform will do for us is that it will transform the dataset of {x} into another dataset {X} which will contain the Fourier coefficients such that :", "If we look at the definition of Fourier Transform, each X in {X} is a complex number and it contains the a and b components for the frequencies.", "But, How come the two datasets {x} and {X} have the same length?", "If we think about, what drives the length of {x} dataset is the sampling rate because, over a period of time, the number of data points I read is exactly the sampling rate right? If we think about the other dataset {X} , we said that frequency is the number of occurrences per unit of time. So If I am sampling with a certain frequency, I cannot recognize signals that have larger frequency then the sampling frequency just because we don't get enough data points.", "So, If we have signals with very high frequencies on a very low sampling rate, we won\u2019t be able to recognize these signals at all. So, the number of frequencies that we can recognize by applying the Fourier Transform is actually driven by sampling rate as well.", "So, now that we have our dataset {x} we will get {Xk} such that it is an element in {X} which are my Fourier coefficients such that :", "So, this is essentially the Discrete Fourier Transform. We can do this computation and it will produce a complex number in the form of a + ib where we have two coefficients for the Fourier series.", "Now, we know how to sample signals and how to apply a Discrete Fourier Transform. The last thing we would like to do is, we would like to get rid of the complex number i because it's not supported in mllib or systemML by using something known as Euler's formula which states :", "So, If we plug Euler's formula in Fourier Transform equation, we get", "we also know that cos(-\u03b8) = cos(\u03b8) and sin(-\u03b8) = -sin(\u03b8) and if we use this in the above equation, the equation could be simplified as :", "and we can actually break the above equation in two sums, such that :", "Now, If we compare the above equation with the equation of a complex number which is a + ib then we get the corresponding value as :", "So, now we can put these values in the equation of f(t) and get the result.", "In practice we use a slight modification of the Discrete Fourier Transform known as Fast Fourier Transform because Discrete Fourier Transform is very simple, basic and also slow. Its not fit for purpose If we really want to do something in production environment. Computation complexity of Discrete Fourier Transform is quadratic time O(n\u00b2) and Fast Fourier Transform for comparison is quasi-linear time O(nlogn).
