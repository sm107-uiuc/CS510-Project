Somehow our brains are trained unconsciously with different or similar types of images that have helped us distinguish between features (images) without putting much effort into the task. For instance, after seeing a few cats, we can recognize almost every different type of cat we encounter in our life. \ud83d\udc31 However, machines need a lot of training for feature extraction which becomes a challenge due to high computation cost, memory requirement, and processing power.", "In this article, we will discuss the pre-processing of one such use case.
