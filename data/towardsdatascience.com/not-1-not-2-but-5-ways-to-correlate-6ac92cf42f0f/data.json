In almost any business or for personal reasons, it is useful to express something in terms of its relationship with others. For example, sales might increase when the marketing spends more on TV advertisement or ice-cream sales increases when temperature increases. Often, correlation is the first step to understanding these relationships and subsequently building better business and statistical models.", "So, why is correlation a useful metric?", "\u00b7 Correlation can (but often does not, as we will see in some examples below) indicate the presence of a causal relationship", "\u00b7 Correlation can help in predicting one quantity from another", "\u00b7 Correlation is used as a basic quantity and foundation for many other modeling techniques", "There are various algorithms to find correlation. However, understanding the reason why correlation is required is key to selecting the right algorithm. In this article, we will see different algorithms and techniques to find correlation as well as tips and tricks on how to select an appropriate algorithm to determine the correlation", "Scatter plots are one of the easiest ways to understand if there is any association or relation between two things. In order to illustrate, lets us look at a dataset which has information on body weight vs brain weight of some small animals. A sample from this dataset is shown below", "Looking at this data, we can ask the question: Is there any association or relation between body weight and brain weight? One of the easiest ways to see is any association or relation exists is to make a scatter plot of body weight vs brain weight. As we can see from the scatter plot below that body weight increases, the brain weight tends to increase", "The scatter plot visualisation technique can give you a \u201cfeel\u201d if there is any relationship or not. However, it does not allow to concretely measure the strength of this relationship. This is where algorithms come into the picture. In algorithmic terms, the strength of relationship is called the correlation coefficient. One of the most widely used algorithm to measure the correlation coefficient is Pearson correlation. Pearson correlation measures the linear association between continuous variables. In other words, this coefficient quantifies the degree to which a relationship between two variables can be described by a line. Remarkably, while correlation can have many interpretations, the same formula developed by Karl Pearson over 120 years ago is still the most widely used today", "Let\u2019s use the Pearson correlation to find out the strength of relationship between the body weight vs brain weight. The Pearson correlation will try to fit a line between the body weight and brain weight. The slope of this line gives the strength of relationship", "The plot below shows scatter plot between body weight vs brain weight as well as a line which would fit between the points. The slope of the line is 0.955 which is the Pearson correlation coefficient. The Pearson coefficient values are between -1 and 1. A value of -1 indicates a strong negative correlation, a value of 0 indicates that there is no correlation and value of 1 indicates a strong positive correlation. So in this example, we have a correlation value of 0.955 which indicates a strong positive correlation between body weight and brain weight. We can conclude factually that in the given data, the brain weight increases with increase in body weight", "Now let us take another example of product sales. The dataset, as shown below, contains sales of products such as Bread, Wraps, Muffins as well as Temperature of the day", "Also shown below is an example of negative correlation. The data used in plot below is Coffee sale vs Temperature (in F).", "The Pearson coefficient calculated is -0.741, which indicates a negative correlation. This means that as temperature increases the sales of coffee goes down.", "An example of no correlation is given below. This example corresponds to sales of Bread with Temperature. As you can see that the line fitting is almost straight. The Pearson correlation is -0.09, which is almost zero. In such case, there is no correlation between the two variables", "Here you saw the basics of correlation and how we can use scatter plot and Pearson coefficient to calculate correlation. However, the Person correlation has some drawbacks, especially when the data is non-linear. As an example, let's take a dataset which has average temperature for a month of a Melbourne. The data indicates that temperatures are high from January to March. Then they go down from April to October; Then again they rise in November and December", "This dataset is an example of non-linear data where the temperatures does not follow a linear path but goes up, down and up along with the months. If you calculate the Pearson coefficient, it will be -0.38, which means that the months and temperature are somewhat negatively correlated. This means that the temperature goes down from Jan through December. However, this is not the case. So the drawback of Pearson coefficient is that it would not work when data is non-linear", "The techniques above such as scatter plot and Pearson correlation show correlation between two variables. If your dataset has many variables, you might be interested to find out correlation between each combination of variables. Making scatter plot or Pearson correlation for each combination could be cumbersome, especially if your dataset has many variables. In such a situation, the correlation matrix comes very handy.", "Let us illustrate the correlation matrix with help of dataset on product sales. As you have seen in the table above, there are many numbers of columns. It will be super useful to calculate correlation between all column combinations such as Coffee sales vs Temperature, Muffin sales vs Temperature, Coffee vs Muffin etc\u2026 However, making scatter plot or Pearson correlation between all combinations will make you tired and sleepy. So let us use correlation matrix in order to remain active and awake.", "Shown below is correlation matrix between each combination of variables. The correlation matrix is shown in form of a heatmap. More red is the cell means higher positive correlation. More blue is the cell means higher the negative correlation. For example, we see that Temperature and Sodas have a strong positive correlation. Also, as already observed, Temperature and Coffee have negative correlation. Similarly, Muffins and Cookies have a strong positive correlation.", "So correlation matrix is a great view to understand correlations for many columns without having to calculate correlation for each combination separately.", "Correlations algorithms are not the only algorithms which calculate correlations. There are some other interesting ways also. One such algorithm is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). This is generally used for dimension reduction when the dataset has a very high number of dimensions. It is used to reduce dataset with many numbers of columns to a fewer number of columns without losing the essence of the data. As a side-result, it also gives correlation between variables", "We will use PCA on product sales dataset. This dataset almost 30 columns. It is impossible to make a data visualisation on 30 columns. So we will use PCA to reduce the data to two dimensions, without losing the essence of the data using PCA.", "In our example of product sales, you can reduce 30 columns to fewer columns (such as 2 or 3). In doing so, PCA also gives variables which have played an important role in achieving the dimension reduction in terms of feature influence score. The feature influence of our product sales columns is shown below. The columns which are on negative side correlate to each other and columns which are positive side correlate to each other. So as you can see that Temperature and Sodas are positively correlated as well as Muffins and Coffee are positively correlated. Also, this means that Temperature and Coffee are negatively correlated.", "These are the same results which we have obtained using Pearson correlation technique.", "In continuing our quest to find out different ways which can give correlation \u2014 the next stop is Lasso Regression. This algorithm is a variant of ordinary least square (OLS). The OLS algorithm tries to fit a straight line between two variables, thus essentially trying to find correlation between two variables. The Lasso, which is a variant of OLS, removes the variables which are not correlated, thus giving us the variables which are correlated.", "The Lasso algorithm takes a target variable (Y) and multiple independent variables (X1, X2, etc\u2026). The algorithm will try to find out correlation between all independent variables with the target variables. The Lasso will try to calculate a co-efficient for each of the independent variables which gives an indication of correlation with target variable", "If we take our example of product sales, the target variable (Y) could be Temperature and all independent variables could be (Coffee sales, Juice Sales etc\u2026). The result of Lasso , which is coefficient of independent variables is given below", "As you can see that coefficient of Coffee is negative, which means that Coffee and Temperature are negatively correlated. Similarly the coefficient of Sodas is high, which means that Sodas and Temperature are positively correlated", "So in this story, you got an overview of correlation and five different methods which can be used to determine it. There are other methods also such as Spearman Correlation as well as SVM or Neural networks to find non-linear correlations", "The choice of algorithm which you will eventually use depends on what problem you are trying to solve, but its always good to see and match results from different method. If results are coherent with each other, then you are on right track.", "You can visit my website to make analytics with zero coding. https://experiencedatascience.com", "Please subscribe to stay informed whenever I release a new story.", "You can also join Medium with my referral link.", "Your home for data science.
