When I saw it, I had to agree that it\u2019s a great tool \u2014 not only for exploratory data analysis, but also for violating all the best practices of software craftsmanship.", "The modern software industry knows a lot about keeping the code basis clean. For structuring, it will first be separated into domains, then into services or libraries, then into packages, and finally into classes or functions. For every level, there are multiple patterns for splitting, API design and communication. There are processes for integrating new code and tools which support them. There are diverse testing methodologies (once again, with tools). There are code reviewing practices and tools for discovering poor design. An experienced software craftsman applies all these best practices before putting the code in production, since the risk of ignoring them is real. You can end up spending weeks in order to add even minor features to your system, and fixing bugs becomes a nightmare.", "The only thing is, not every code deserves to run in production. A piece which doesn\u2019t add value to your business in a direct or indirect way should ideally not make it to production at all. A useless feature in production is bad in two ways. First, it took the expensive path of following all the best practices mentioned above, so you could not implement something different instead. Second, it increases the complexity of your system, requires maintenance and causes operational costs, while making further changes even harder to implement.", "Sometimes, the only way to check if the idea will fit the needs of your customers is to implement at least an MVP for it. But often, there is an easier way. This is exactly where Jupyter notebooks offer a great opportunity \u2014 by working with hypotheses.", "When the primary goal of data scientists is to improve a particular product, the hypothesis becomes the main unit of work. It is a possible way of fulfilling a particular need (usually a need of your customers). The hypothesis may be split into smaller pieces of work like research, data delivery, analysis, and model building. And, most importantly, a hypothesis may work, but it may also fail: if there is no need at all, or it doesn\u2019t really cover the need, or there is not enough data to build a model, or the customer won\u2019t pay the required price, or one of many other reasons. This is why you need an approach that allows you to test a hypothesis cheaply, get feedback soon and iterate through multiple hypotheses unless you find a working solution or declare the problem to be unsolvable with available means.", "Imagine you\u2019re selling insurance policies and want to sell more travel insurances to your customers. How do you want to find the right audience to approach? Based on demographics (age/gender/family situation/employment status)? Or on other products your customers have? Or on their financial transactions? Or on GPS data (assuming customers have your app and share that data)? Do you offer a discount or sell at the regular price? These are all hypotheses to test. Using a Jupyter notebook you should be able to do the following for every single hypothesis:", "Don\u2019t build a service around your model, don\u2019t integrate it into the CI/CD pipeline, don\u2019t implement new processes in your CRM, don\u2019t add a widget for travel insurance to your mobile app at this point of time! All the effort around implementing a single hypothesis should be limited to around 1 week of work, and the feedback cycle should be short. Be prepared, the feedback may not be great. Document it and move to the next hypothesis \u2014 it is much easier throwing away just one notebook and not a fully-built and integrated solution.", "When you find a hypothesis which really adds value to your product, you can open a good IDE (I prefer PyCharm) and finally start writing production-ready code. Now, time for following industry best practices will be well spent.", "Your home for data science.
