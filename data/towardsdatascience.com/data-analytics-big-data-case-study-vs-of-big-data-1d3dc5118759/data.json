Big data is not regular data. Big data is not business as usual data. Big data is not something that a regularly experienced data analyst may be ready to work on. Big data doesn\u2019t fit well into a familiar analytic paradigm. Big data won\u2019t fit into an Excel spreadsheet. Big data probably won\u2019t fit on your normal computer\u2019s hard drive.", "Doug Laney in 2001 writes in his article on Big data that one of the ways to describe big data is by looking at the three V\u2019s of volume, velocity, and variety.", "Big data is data that\u2019s just too big to work on your computer.", "The general point of Moore\u2019s Law, a well-known observation in computer science that physical capacity and performance of computers double about every two years. This implies what\u2019s big for one system at one time is commonplace for another system at another time.", "So for example, in Excel the maximum number of rows that you could have in a single spreadsheet has grown over time. Previously it was 65,000. Now it\u2019s over a million, which seems like a lot, but if you\u2019re logging internet activity where something can occur thousands of times per second, million rows can be reached very quickly.", "On the other hand, if we consider photos or videos where we need to have all of the information in memory at once, it will be an entirely different issue. Generally, the phone takes photos at two or three megabytes per photo and video at about 18 megabytes per minute or one gigabyte per hour. And for a high-quality video camera, it could go up to 18 gigabytes per minute. And instantly it is very big data.", "Now, some people call this lots of data, meaning it\u2019s the same idea of the data that we\u2019re generally used to, there\u2019s just a lot more of it. And that gets into the issues of velocity and variety.", "So for velocity, Big data is when data is coming in very fast.", "In conventional scientific research, it could take months to gather data from 200 cases, weeks to analyze the data, and years to get that research published. Not only is this kind of data is time-consuming to gather, but it\u2019s also generally static once it\u2019s entered, it doesn\u2019t change.", "As an example, perhaps the most familiar data set for teaching the statistical procedure, cluster analysis, is the Iris data collected by Edgar Anderson and analyzed by Ronald Fisher, both of whom published their papers in 1936. This data set contains four measurements: The widths and lengths of the petals and sepals for three species of Iris. It\u2019s got about 150 cases, and this data set is used every day. It\u2019s one of the built-in data sets in the statistical programming language, R, and it hasn\u2019t changed in nearly 80 years.", "At the other end of the scale, if you\u2019re interested in using data from a social media platform, like Twitter, in fact, right now they\u2019re processing more than 6,000 tweets globally per second. That works out to around 500,000,000 tweets per day and about 200,000,000,000 tweets per year. In fact, a neat way to see this is with a live counter on the web. At Internet Live Stats, it\u2019s showing us that there are about 355,000,000 tweets that have been sent so far today, and they\u2019re updating extremely quickly. Even a simple temperature sensor hooked up to an Arduino microprocessor through a serial connection and is sending just one bit of data at a time, that can eventually overwhelm a computer if left running long enough.", "Now, this kind of constant influx of data, better known as streaming data, presents special challenges for analysis, because the data set, itself, is a moving target. The demands and complexities of streaming data can be very daunting, to say the least for static data us.", "A recent study by Forester Research shows that variety is the biggest factor that\u2019s leading companies to big data solutions.", "And now we get to the third aspect of big data, variety. What variety means here is that it\u2019s not just the rows and columns of a nicely formatted data set in a spreadsheet, for instance. Instead, we can have many data sheets in many different formats. We can have unstructured text, like books and blog posts and comments on news articles and tweets. One researcher has estimated that 80 percent of enterprise data may be unstructured, so it\u2019s the majority as the common case. This can also include photos and videos and audio. Similarly, data sets that include things like networked graph data, that\u2019s social connections data. Or if dealing with data sets in what is called NoSQL databases, so you may have graphs of social connections. It also may have hierarchical structures and documents.", "Any number of data formats that don\u2019t fit well into the rows and columns of a conventional relational database or a spreadsheet, then it will have some very serious analytical challenges.", "Do we have to have all three V\u2019s \u2014 volume, velocity, and variety \u2014 at once, or just one, to have Big Data?", "It may be true that if you have all three V\u2019s at once, then you have Big Data, but anyone of them can be too much for the standard approach to data. And, what Big Data means is that we can\u2019t use the standard approach with it. As a result, Big Data can present a number of special challenges.", "Your home for data science.
