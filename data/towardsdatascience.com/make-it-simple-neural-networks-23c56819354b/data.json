It will help people with or without mathematical background to apply their specific knowledge in one of the most promising research areas.", "I originally started as a political scientist, and I quickly became interested in qualitative methodology. So after my bachelor\u2019s degree, I decided to study statistics. During my master\u2019s in statistics, I developed a profound interest in mathematical knowledge.", "At about the same time I started working in the software management field of a large German research institute. This was my first contact with machine learning. During lunch breaks, I heard colleagues talk about loss functions such as the mean squared error, which I as a statistician rather knew as a measure of variation. Repeatedly discussions triggered approximation methods, which are apparently used in machine learning for functions in neural networks, but which I knew for approximating complex distributions.", "Little by little I took courage and to my surprise, I was able to contribute some points to discussions that were not considered by the software developers back then. Therefore, I decided to spend some time to understand neural networks. I found many articles and books with specific mathematical derivations, which helped me for better bottom-up understanding. However, I was not able to capture the general concept for a large time span.", "For this reason, I will provide a mostly narrative overview of neural networks in order to have a top-down perspective on the whole concept for an effective starting point for individual adaption.", "A major problem that I needed to overcome is to understand the actual difference between the terms Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Neural Networks (Fig. 1). These buzzwords are often used inconsistently across the literature, similar as I did use them in my previous section. However, I believe that it is mandatory for effective learning to have a consistent understanding of the specific terms. I will not argue that my definitions are exhaustive and unite all the available literature, but if I am asked what the difference of these terms is, I am able to give a consistent answer.", "I like to think about the definitions as a Russian doll (Fig. 2). The biggest doll represents the term Machine Learning [1], which summarizes the ability of algorithms to learn over time. The term Deep Learning [2] is represented by the doll in the middle. Deep learning stands for computationally extensive machine learning procedures. And the smallest doll can be considered as the term Neural Network [3]. Neural networks are architectures of deep learning models.", "Generally, machine learning algorithms, which include neural networks, have three things in common: a function to map input and output, a function to measure the information loss, and a function that minimizes the information loss [4]. The first one is also known as chain function, the second one is called loss function and the last one is named optimization algorithm.", "Now that we know that neural networks are architectures in the field of deep learning and deep learning is a sub-field of machine learning, we need to identify how the initially presented components look in the case of neural networks.", "Similar to statistics, where the model selection depends on the use case, in machine learning exists also a major amount of different neural network architectures. I will focus on an extremely simplified fully-connected architecture in this tutorial.", "A quick verbose description of Figure 3: a neural network consists typically of three types of layers [5]. The input layer hands matrices, vectors, or even scalars with input data in the neural network. The output layer gives back output values with a predefined shape. The hidden layers connect both of them. They are called hidden layers, since in general they have no predefined output. However, once we understand each layer mathematically, we understand the output dimension in each layer. The dots indicate that there can be indefinite shapes of hidden layers. Generally, the number of hidden layers is known as the depth of the network, whereas the number of circles in one layer stands for the width of the network. If someone talks about deep neural networks, one means neural networks with many hidden layers. The blue arrows are called weights and they are the parameters of the network.", "The input values and the output values are connected by hidden layers. Each hidden layer can be represented as one function. According to this, the chain function is a connection of all the functions from the hidden layers.", "There are again many different functions available. What they have in common is that they are matrix or vector multiplications. So, each of these hidden layers can be understood by basic knowledge in linear algebra.", "Assume now we walk once through the neural network. We will get an output with a predefined shape. But how good will this output be? The answer to this question is exactly the purpose of loss functions [6].", "Neural networks at least in a so-called supervised learning procedure try to minimize the distance between their output (Figure 4, first column) and the ground truth (Figure 4, second column).", "Before we are able to think about the minimization objective, we need a strategy to measure the deviation. Again there is a variety of different methods. A simple one is the mean squared error, which sums up the squared difference of the true value and the output of the network for each row and divides this result by the number of rows. In the example of Figure 4, the sum of the squared differences is 8. Since we have 2 rows, the mean squared error would result in 4.", "We are now at a point where we know that our neural networks is nothing else but a combined and usually rather complex aggregation of matrix or vector multiplications. Furthermore, we are aware that we require loss functions to estimate the distance between output and desired values. Now we are looking for procedures to minimize the estimated distance [7]. In my opinion, this is the most complex point in neural networks, since the used optimization algorithms are usually very sophisticated. At the risk of repeating myself: there are a large amount of different optimization algorithms available. To name just two frequently used algorithms: Stochastic Gradient Descent and Adam optimizer.", "All of these optimization algorithms seek for adapting the weights such that the loss function is minimized. Almost all optimization algorithms estimate the gradient of each weight in the chain function. In this step, we go backwards through the neural networks as Figure 5 indicates.", "The inverted lines of Figure 5 in comparison to the lines in Figure 3 mean that we estimate the gradient of each parameter of the chain function. Each optimization algorithm provides then instructions on how to use this gradient information to update the weights.", "That\u2019s it! These are the narrative explanations for the basic components of neural networks. The whole procedure of going first forward and then backward through the neural network and update the weights afterward is repeated until the loss function is minimized.", "Please let me know how you liked the idea of breaking complex mathematical topics down to simple narrative explanations. And let me know if you have any other buzzwords that I should use for a Make it Simple article.", "Your home for data science.
