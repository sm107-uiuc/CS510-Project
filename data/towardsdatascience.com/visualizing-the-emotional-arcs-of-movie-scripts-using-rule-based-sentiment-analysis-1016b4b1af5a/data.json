These include \u201cRags to Riches\u201d (rise), \u201cRiches to Rags\u201d (fall), \u201cMan in a Hole\u201d (fall then rise), \u201cIcarus\u201d (rise then fall), \u201cCinderella\u201d (rise then fall then rise) and \u201cOedipus\u201d (fall then rise then fall).", "Their work deviated from Vonnegut\u2019s in that they plotted the emotional trajectory of stories, not just their plot lines. To do so, they slid 10,000-word windows through each text to score the relative happiness of hundreds of points in the story, using a lexicon of 10,000 unique words scored on a nine-point scale of happiness, resulting in the hedonometer tool for sentiment analysis.", "Using a similar lexicon-based approach, I plotted the emotional arcs of more than a thousand movie scripts and used hierarchical clustering to group the most similar scripts.", "However, since previous research focuses mostly on positive and negative sentiment, rather than rising and falling action, the following method differs from UVM\u2019s approach in that it uses the NRC Valence, Arousal and Dominance Lexicon, which has scores for 20,000 English words, as a proxy measure for action or conflict in a story. Specifically, I used the arousal dimension to score words on a spectrum from \u201ccalm\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d to \u201cexcited\u201d or \u201cactive.\u201d", "The result is an interactive visualization that can be used to search for any script already published on the Internet Movie Database to visualize its emotional story arc (for arousal) and find five of the most similar movie scripts in terms of the story\u2019s emotional trajectory, not content.", "In a search for the blockbuster \u201cAvatar,\u201d for example, you can see that arousal peaks towards the end of the movie, at around 90% of the length of the script, which corresponds to the point in the movie with the most tension and conflict (the final confrontation between the Na\u2019vi and the humans to determine the fate of the planet).", "Other movies with similar structures, with a clear climactic end, include \u201cBeauty and the Beast,\u201d \u201cThe Avengers\u201d (2012) and \u201cAli.\u201d", "Here is the process I followed to arrive at these results:", "Using Beautiful Soup and a revised version of Jeremy Kunn\u2019s script, I scraped all of the movies from the Internet Movie Database, which took about 20 minutes using the following script:", "Then I created a new dictionary using the NRC VAD lexicon:", "And I adjusted the simple labMT usage script to calculate the arousal scores of a corpus, rather than happiness, by replacing the labMT dictionary and labMT vectors with my own:", "Considering that movie scripts are shorter on average than books, I set the fixed window size at 1,000 words and slid it through each script to generate n arousal scores, or the number of points in the resulting time series.", "After implementing the revised version of simple labMT, which uses singular value decomposition under the hood to find a decomposition of stories onto an orthogonal basis of emotional arcs, I used linear interpolation to create word vectors of equal dimensions and used scipy\u2019s hierarchical clustering to find and group the most similar movie scripts based on the trajectory of their emotional arcs.", "Using Ward\u2019s method and Euclidean distance as the distance metric, I was able to minimize the variance between clusters of movie scripts to arrive at the most accurate segmentation of observations.", "Finally, I created a Flask API to output arousal scores for any movie found in the Internet Movie Database and return the five most similar scripts.", "Using a function to call the API and filter the data, I visualized the resulting output using D3\u2019s built-in d3.json() method for loading and parsing json data objects.", "You can play around with the final interactive visualization here and view all the notebooks and code here.
