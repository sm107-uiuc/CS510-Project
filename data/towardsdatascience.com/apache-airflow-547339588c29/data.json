To speed up the end-to-end process, Airflow was created to quickly author, iterate on, and monitor batch data pipelines. Airflow later joined Apache.", "Apache Airflow is a platform for programmatically authoring, scheduling, and monitoring workflows. It is completely open-source with wide community support.", "It is written in Python so we are able to interact with any third party Python API to build the workflow. It is based on an ETL flow-extract, transform, load but at the same time believing that ETL steps are best expressed as code. As a result, Airflow provides much more customisable features compared to other ETL tools, which are mostly user-interface heavy.", "Apache Airflow is suited to tasks ranging from pinging specific API endpoints to data transformation to monitoring.", "The workflow is designed as a directed acyclic graph. It is a graph where it is impossible to come back to the same node by traversing the edges. And the edges of this graph move only in one direction. Each workflow is in the form of a DAG.", "Each node in a DAG is a task.", "A task is executed using operators. An operator defines the actual work to be done. They define a single task, or one node of a DAG. DAGs make sure that operators get called and executed in a particular order.", "There are different types of operators available (given on the Airflow Website):", "Create a dags directory inside airflow. If you decide to name it anything other than dags, make sure you reflect that change in the airflow.cfg file by changing the dags_folder path.", "Make sure to open up your airflow.cfg to set a default configuration. You can configure your webserver details:", "Set your time zone, type of executor, whether to load examples or not (definitely set to TRUE to explore).", "Another important variable to update is dag_dir_list_interval. This specifies the refresh time to scan for new DAGs in the dags folder. The default is set to 5 minutes.", "Next is to start the scheduler. \u201cThe Airflow scheduler monitors all tasks and DAGs. Behind the scenes, it spins up a subprocess, which monitors and stays in sync with a folder for all DAG objects it may contain, and periodically (every minute or so) collects DAG parsing results and inspects active tasks to see whether they can be triggered.\u201d [Airflow Scheduler]", "The scheduler starts an instance of the executor specified in the airflow.cfg. The default Airflow executor is SequentialExecutor.", "Next up, open a new terminal tab and cd to the airflow directory. From here we\u2019ll start the server.", "This is the home page that greets you. It lists all the DAGs in the your dags folder and the pre-written examples if you\u2019d set the load_examples option to TRUE. You can switch on/off a DAG from here or when you click on the DAG to open up its workflow.", "Although the default configuration settings are stored in ~/airflow/airflow.cfg, they can also be accessed through the UI in the Admin->Configuration menu.", "Let\u2019s look into a super simple \u2018Hello World\u2019 DAG. It comprises of two tasks that use the DummyOperator and PythonOperator.", "The first step is to create a python script in the dags folder. This script defines the various tasks and operators.", "This script imports certain date functions, the operators that we\u2019ll be using and the DAG object.", "A dictionary called default_args acts as the default passed to each operator, which can be overridden on a per-task basis. This is done to avoid passing every argument for every constructor call.", "Once you\u2019ve created this python script, save it in dags. If you don\u2019t have the webserver and scheduler running already, start the webserver and scheduler. Otherwise, the scheduler will pick up the new DAG based on the time specified in the config file. Refresh your home page to see it there.", "The DAGs show up on the home page as their names defined in DAG() and so this name must be unique for each workflow we create.", "We can switch between the Graph View and Tree View.", "To switch on the DAG, toggle the off/on button next to the name of the DAG. To run the DAG, click on the Trigger DAG button.", "Keep refreshing from time to time to see the progress of the tasks. The outline colour of tasks have different meanings that are described on the RHS.", "You\u2019ll see there\u2019s no output. To access that, click on the hello_task and go to View Log.", "We\u2019ve run our very first workflow!", "Your home for data science.
