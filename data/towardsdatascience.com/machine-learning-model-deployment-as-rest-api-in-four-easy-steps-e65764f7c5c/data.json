Now it\u2019s time to deploy it.", "In real-life projects, machine learning models are used by other applications. These applications can be anything, it can be a customer-facing operational application like company website or back-office application like ERP or it can be a data analytics application. These applications should be able to send feature variable values to the model and get a prediction.", "While there are various ways to achieve it, in this blog I am going to take you through steps of deploying machine learning models through REST API. Once the model can interact through the REST API, any application can seek prediction from the model by passing feature values through API call.", "The below figure shows steps we are going to follow. Step 1 is already done.", "Run below lines of Python code to complete step 2.", "Now you should find below two files created on your system. If you are using the Windows operating system and have not set up Python path to something else, you will find these files in C:\\Users\\<your userid> folder.", "Make sure to combine python code in Step 1 and Step2 in one file and store it in the same directory as above. Let\u2019s name this file randomfs.py", "In summary, below is the content of file randomfs.py", "In case you are wondering what is web service, here\u2019s a short and simple explanation from Wikipedia", "a Web service is a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents (HTML, JSON, XML, Images), and creating web applications services, which serve in solving specific domain problems over the web (www, internet, HTTP).", "In case you are more confused now, I will say, don\u2019t worry too much about it for now. Just consider it as a server on which website runs. Web sites can talk to other applications through these services called web service.", "Okay, now that we got this part out of our way, let\u2019s understand what we need to do in step 3.", "Python has a very useful library Flask, which is a web service development framework. If you are using Anaconda distribution, Flask is already installed for you.", "Now comes the real action. Write below the line of code in a notepad of your choice and save it as a .py file. Do not use the Jupyter notebook for this. You might get errors if you use a Jupyter notebook for this.", "I saved it as rndfsapi.py in the same directory where the other three files are stored.", "Now open Anaconda prompt and run command python rndsfapi.py. This will compile the file and start Web service at mentioned port 12345.", "We have completed activities in this step. Let\u2019s move on to the next step.", "You will need a REST API testing tool like Postman for this step. You can download Postman from the below link.", "Once downloaded, start postman.
