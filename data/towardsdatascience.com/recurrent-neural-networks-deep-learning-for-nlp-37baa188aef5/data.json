This has become possible only in the last few years. Until now, understanding and extracting information from unstructured text data was possible only through manual effort let alone automating acknowledging user requests.", "The underlying concept behind the revolutionizing idea of exposing textual data to various mathematical and statistical techniques is Natural Language Processing (NLP). As the name suggests, the objective is to understand natural language spoken by humans and respond and/or take actions on the basis of it, just like humans do. Before long, life-changing decisions will be made merely by talking to a bot.", "Here in this article, I will try to provide some basic understanding of neural networks, particularly useful for the purpose of NLP. We will not delve into the mathematics of each algorithm, however, will try to understand the intuition behind it which will place us in a comfortable position to start applying each algorithm on real world data.", "RNN is widely used neural network architecture for NLP. It has proven to be comparatively accurate and efficient for building language models and in tasks of speech recognition.", "RNNs are particularly useful if the prediction has to be at word-level, for instance, Named-entity recognition (NER) or Part of Speech (POS) tagging. As it stores the information for current feature as well neighboring features for prediction. A RNN maintains a memory based on history information, which enables the model to predict the current output conditioned on long distance features. Below is an example of NER using RNN.", "Although a RNN can learn dependencies however, it can only learn about recent information. LSTM can help solve this problem as it can understand context along with recent dependency. Hence, LSTM are a special kind of RNN where understanding context can help to be useful.", "LSTM networks are similar to RNNs with one major difference that hidden layer updates are replaced by memory cells. This makes them better at finding and exposing long range dependencies in data which is imperative for sentence structures. Image below shows a representation of LSTM sequence tagging model which has LSTM memory cells in place of hidden layers.", "As the name suggests, these networks are bidirectional, that is, it has access to both past and future input features for a given time. This is particularly important in sequence tagging.", "Conditional Random Fields (CRF) takes context into account while making predictions. The difference between BiLSTM and CRF is that the former uses input features in both directions whereas the latter uses tag generated. Here, the input and outputs are directly connected as opposed to LSTMs networks. Also, as shown below the output tag information is connected rather than the input features.", "This network is a combination of LSTM and CRF network to utilize the best of both worlds. This network can efficiently use past input features via a LSTM layer and sentence level tag information via a CRF layer.", "This network is similar to the previous one with only difference being the LSTM network is replaced by Bi-LSTM network, thereby, achieving superior performance. As we already know a Bi-LSTM uses past as well future input features which can help to improve the tagging accuracy.", "This provides a basic idea about the deep learning networks that can applied to textual data. The next rational step would be to pick up some text data and start implementing these algorithms to see the real results and compare which is what I will cover in my next article.
