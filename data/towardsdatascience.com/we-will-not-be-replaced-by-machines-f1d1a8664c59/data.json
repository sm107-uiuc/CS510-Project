Real world problems don\u2019t tend to fall neatly into the scope of one particular area of research \u2014 we need to learn to face problems together by not only sharing what we know, but also by being willing to listen \u2014 carefully \u2014 to the ideas of others. We need to remain open enough to admit that we don\u2019t have all the answers and that someone else may have knowledge and perspectives that we don\u2019t.", "I think we can all agree that collaboration is a good thing and that our combined thinking is greater than the sum of its parts. Why, then, do we feel the need to take a different view when it comes to working with artificial intelligence?", "Scientific papers constantly compare the performance of their AI algorithms at solving some particular problem to that of an expert. It is seen as a trophy to outperform the human, even if just in some narrow sense of the term. While this may be a useful benchmark to put the achievement and significance of the research into context, I think it also insidiously sets up a kind of antagonistic relationship. It\u2019s suddenly a competition. Us versus the machines.", "Competition and eventual conflict between humans and their AI creations have successfully captured our society\u2019s collective imagination. We\u2019ve dramatised the idea to great effect in literature and film. It\u2019s certainly thought-provoking material and poses a number of very good (and very difficult) ethical questions that we should most definitely be thinking about sooner rather than later.", "But the other side of the coin is that this fascination has also contributed to a widespread view that AI is somehow against us. Careless scientists blindly pursuing the progression of their research at the expense of the rest of our livelihoods. We are terrified of the day that we are replaced by a robot at the very thing we have spent the best part of our lives learning how to do.", "It\u2019s easy to see why this horrifies us so. While we may complain when we feel overworked and under-compensated, there is some fundamental part of us that likes to work. We like having jobs and we like contributing. We want to feel valued by others. We derive self-worth from work. We derive identity from our work. In many ways, we are our work. If we feel that our work \u2014 and hence our selves \u2014 are being threatened, we dig in. We get defensive. It\u2019s an assault on something we hold dear.", "The prospect of being made redundant by an algorithm seems to come with the implication that what we do is no longer of worth, and this rightly disturbs us. We should not, however, let our imaginations get the better of us yet. Let\u2019s check in with reality before we decide that the relentless march of AI research must be stopped at all costs.", "Humans will always retain a flexibility that a machine does not have. Admittedly, we are vastly outperformed when it comes to simple and repetitive decision-making \u2014 but the human ability to learn, adapt, and more generally, react properly to novelty cannot be replicated with lines of code. Our successful exploratory behaviour in the presence of the unknown has, over the course of history, rendered us humans more powerful and more successful than any other creatures on earth.", "In the presence of anomalous information, we can (provided we\u2019re willing to face it) derive what it means and integrate what we need to know into our existing decision-making processes. While algorithms do \u201clearn\u201d in a sense, we\u2019re nowhere close to developing anything like a general intelligence that can emulate what humans are able to do.", "Essentially: for a long time to come, we\u2019re going to be working alongside AI rather than in competition with it.", "Our work will be enhanced by AI. By handling the boring, repetitive parts of our jobs, we\u2019ll be able to focus our attention on the more interesting \u2014 and more importantly, the more impactful \u2014 aspects of our work. Everyone has those things they know they should be working on, those important-but-not-urgent tasks that we know would be good for us and for our organisations if we did them, that we just can\u2019t seem to get around to. We get bogged down in all the less important \u2014 but ultimately more pressing \u2014 things.", "Imagine if everyone in your organisation only worked on the important stuff. For, like, a year straight. How would things change in that time? How much more efficient would processes be? By how much would the quality of the work improve? And how much happier would your clients be? So much more would get done.", "Or maybe AI does outperform you at a certain key aspect of your job. The next question is: what could you achieve if you worked in tandem with the machine? How could you compensate for each other\u2019s weaknesses? Could the AI help you with particularly ambiguous situations? Could you cover off the machine\u2019s failure modes?", "The point is this. Replace the fearful question:", "\u201cWhat could we achieve if we worked together?\u201d", "It\u2019s not robots versus humans. It\u2019s robots and humans versus problems. Big, important, head-scratching problems.", "And the sooner we start thinking that way \u2014 from the perspective of collaboration with AI rather than that of confrontation \u2014 the more we are going to be able to achieve, and sooner.", "Andrew Hetherington is an actuary-in-training and data enthusiast based in London, UK.", "Photo by Erhan Astam on Unsplash.", "Your home for data science.
