Even so, I sensed a visible dissatisfaction with the answer.", "I wasn\u2019t sure of the reason. Either I upset my child breaking down its favorite LEGO set or my interpretation wasn\u2019t educative enough. Anyway, I had to come up with another plan.", "My child has no doubt grasped one thing or two about Big Data, but Big Data is more than that. I recalled my journey on becoming a big data engineer. I thought of how I perceived each of its core concepts in the first place. The word MapReduce popped into my head.", "At the dawn of my career path, Hadoop MapReduce was the first key idea I\u2019ve encountered. It helped me to pick up the notion of how to leverage the common operations to perform massive calculations on Big Data.", "I figured it would be another appropriate concept for my six-year-old. In contrast, I became more frustrating.", "I didn\u2019t know how to explain MapReduce to my child.", "It doesn\u2019t have any clue about how computers work. How can the innocent mind even comprehend the principle of Hadoop MapReduce?", "Everything has changed when we had this kind of conversation", "At that moment, something sparked inside me. My child\u2019s passion for this beloved kind of food could be the key to my MapReduce demystification.", "It was a hot summer day. My baby and I were standing in front of an ice cream truck. The ice cream man kindly asked for what kind of ice cream we want. I didn\u2019t fancy for any, so I let my child decides.", "The ice cream man formed three scoops of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry flavors. He then put those on top of a brownish waffle cone.", "Being happy with its fresh ice cream, my baby began to enjoy without hesitation. All a sudden, an image of MapReduce flashed through my mind. I\u2019ve figured it all out. I stopped my baby to take its first bite. I said: \u201cMy baby, I will explain Hadoop MapReduce to you using your three-colored ice cream\u201d.", "Do you see the ice cream man with his giant freezers? That\u2019s tons of ice cream. Every day he handles ice cream requests from his customers. Imagine that everybody loves three-colored ice cream as much as you do. The ice cream man must serve that unique kind of ice cream.", "But it takes time to produce proper three-colored ice cream. The ice cream man must first take scoops from the ice cream containers. From there he has to put them in the waffle cone in a correct position, and deliver those to the customers. Daddy bets that he can do that all day.", "Imagine those ice cream containers become enormous piles of ice-cream. The piles are huge that the ice cream man can stand under their shade. The ice cream truck now attracts thousands of customers every hour. No matter how skillful the ice cream man is, he will never keep up with the pace.", "As a big data engineer, Daddy reaches out to give the ice cream man a hand. Daddy doesn\u2019t know how to shape a beautiful ice cream scoop, but he knows how to do it with speed. As usual, Daddy has some friends to help him out. This time he separates them into two groups: Mappers and Reducers.", "What does a Mapper do? Well, he transforms. A Mapper sacrifices his life to manufacture impeccable ice cream scoops. The ice cream man\u2019s trivial task becomes Mappers\u2019 life purpose. Each one finishes with three scopes of chocolate, vanilla, and strawberry. The amazing Mappers must not compete within the groups. Each Mapper completes his task at a different time. They all contribute to a common pool thereafter used by Reducers.", "Reducers, waffle cones on their hand, are waiting for Mappers to conclude their assignment. The ice cream scoops are already prepared by Mappers. The Reducers only have to take them out of the common pool. Each Reducer is capable of delivering thousands of three-colored ice cream per minute. That efficiency enables the ice cream man to please his customers.", "The ice cream man is content because he can serve as many customers as he desires. Those Mappers and Reducers at all times focus on their sole possibilities. They never let him down. \u201cMy child, you can now continue to enjoy your favorite three-colored ice cream. Remember that a simple job can become impossible with a tremendous amount of input. With the help of Mappers and Reducers, we can overcome the obstacle \u201d.", "The Hadoop MapReduce\u2019s power lies in its components\u2019 well-defined responsibilities. It enables us to split the massive amount of work into tiny pieces a single worker can achieve.", "Comprehending Hadoop MapReduce is each big data engineer\u2019s duty. It lays the first bricks on the foundation of other big data computation algorithms. It\u2019s all about taking advantage of mediocre computers to gain computation. It sparks the idea of working with big data.", "My name\u2019s Nam Nguyen, and I write about Big Data. Enjoy your reading?
