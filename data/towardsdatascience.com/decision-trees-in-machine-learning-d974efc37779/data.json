The endless possibilities to be comprehended before going down any road, all the mental calculations it performs regarding the rewards and the penalties that must be considered for achieving the best possible route to a decision. Yes, our brain, truly is a masterpiece and we\u2019ll discuss how we can teach our computer the art of decision making.", "Decision Trees are a predictive tool in supervised learning for both classification and regression tasks. They are nowadays called as CART which stands for \u2018Classification And Regression Trees\u2019. The decision tree approach splits the dataset based on certain conditions at every step following an algorithm which is to traverse a tree-like graph from root to leaf. At every stage, the nodes of the tree represent the possible test cases for the problem and following along any edge of a node represents a possible solution.", "Let\u2019s see what a decision tree looks like.", "The diagram illustrates a simple scenario of decision making wherein a person has to decide if he/she is eligible to cast a vote. So, the decision tree starts at the root trying to see the possibilities of making a decision based on the user\u2019s input. Here, it\u2019s a classification problem where a person becomes eligible to vote only if he/she is a citizen of the nation and is above 18 years of age.", "You might be thinking right now that this can be implemented using a simple if-else statement in any programming language. But, I assure you it is much more complicated than that.", "When it comes to huge and complex datasets there are a variety of parameters to be considered while making decisions throughout the tree. Hence, decision trees come to our rescue to aid us in making these decisions for us.", "Let\u2019s see a practical example where we will predict if a person can be hired or not based on their attributes.", "Let\u2019s start by importing the dataset.", "Let\u2019s have a look at what we have here.", "To be able to work with machine learning, every alphabetical entry in the dataset has to be converted into numbers.", "Convert the \u2018Y\u2019 entries in \u2018Employed?\u2019, \u2018Top-tier school\u2019, \u2018Interned\u2019 and \u2018Hired\u2019 column to 1 and all \u2018N\u2019 entries to 0.", "Let\u2019s also map their qualifications into number. 0 for \u2018BS\u2019, 1 for \u2018MS\u2019 and 2 for \u2018PhD\u2019.", "The dataset will now look like,", "The target column here in the \u2018Hired\u2019 column which is the column that we need to predict and the rest of the columns are the features that we consider while making our decision.", "So, separate the features column from the target.", "Lets call our features in x and target in y before we build our tree.", "It\u2019s time to build our tree. We will use the DecisionTreeClassifier() method in the tree package to make our tree.", "The decision tree is now ready. To visualize the tree we\u2019ll have to install the pydotplus and graphviz package.", "\ud83d\ude32Yes! we just obtained an amazing decision tree which may look like this.", "Let\u2019s analyze the decision tree we just obtained which is crucial in understanding how this algorithm works. At any point going down the right side of the tree depicts that a person is hired and going down on the left, depicts that the person is not. An observation can be made that a person who has \u2018Employed?\u2019 column with a value >0.5 is instantly hired. A person whose \u2018Employed?\u2019 column has a value of less than 0.5 but has a value greater than 0.5 in the \u2018Interned\u2019 column is hired. Similarly, other nodes in the tree can be evaluated. The tree has certain metrics which it has set for itself to make decisions gradually while traversing down the tree.", "Random Forest is nothing but a multitude of decision trees. It takes the number of trees as input and generates that many combinations of decision trees. Finally, the prediction is based on the mode in case of classification or the mean in case of regression.", "We\u2019ll use the RandomForestClassifier() method from sci-kit learn library. Let\u2019s generate 10 such decision trees.", "We\u2019ll use this random forest to predict if a person with certain attributes is going to be hired or not. Prediction for a person with the following features:", "Now, let\u2019s predict for another person with features:", "We see that in the first case, the person who was highly qualified with his/her features for the job didn\u2019t even have to go all the way down the decision tree and was immediately classified as hired. In the second case, The person didn\u2019t meet the features that were required for the company to be hired.", "On running predictions for multiple test cases, we can observe that sometimes the value that is predicted changes. This is because the random forest classifier method considers randomly generated trees each time it runs. This is completely normal as we are just using 14 entries in our made-up dataset. With an increase in the size of the dataset, there are increasingly different combinations to be considered which can enhance the purity of the decision tree.", "Yay! \ud83d\ude4c We just built a decision tree that can predict if a person can be hired based on their attributes.", "Hope you all understood what and how significant decision trees are in the field of machine learning.
