Some of the main ones that I use frequently are:", "Applies a given function to an RDD.", "Note that the syntax is a little bit different from Python, but it necessarily does the same thing.

When working with textfile, the RDD that gets formed has got a lot of strings. We use map to convert it into a format that we want.", "So now our category_price_rdd contains the product category and the price at which the product sold.", "Now we want to reduce on the key category and sum the prices. We can do this by:", "Similar to reduceByKey but does not reduces just puts all the elements in an iterator. For example, if we wanted to keep as key the category and as the value all the products we would use this function.", "Let us again use map to get data in the required form.", "Here the groupByKey function worked and it returned the category and the list of products in that category.", "You have filtered your data, mapped some functions on it. Done your computation.", "Now you want to get the data on your local machine or save it to a file or show the results in the form of some graphs in excel or any visualization tool.", "You will need actions for that.
