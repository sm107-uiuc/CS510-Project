Do not be overwhelmed with the ridiculous list of programming languages mentioned in data scientist job ads. While it is important to learn as many data science science tools as possible, it\u2019s recommended to start from just one or two programming languages for a start. Then once you\u2019ve built a solid background in data science, you can then challenge yourself to learn about different programming languages or different platforms and productivity tools that can enhance your skills set.", "According to this article (The Most In Demand Tech Skills for Data Scientists), Python and R are still the unequivocal champions of data science when it comes to programming languages.", "As a beginner, it is OK to start with one programming language, say Python, then maybe learn R later on, or you can learn the two languages concurrently.", "The good thing is that you can pick up skills in Python and R as you go from data science training courses. Most data science training programs often start with fundamentals of programming. So if a data science specialization is going to be taught using R, they often start with a course such as R Basics or Python Basics, if the specialization is being taught with Python.", "So if you have some basic programming background, you can actually teach yourself data science via self-study from online courses. You don\u2019t need advance knowledge in Python or R programming to begin your journey to data science. You will learn and master these languages throughout your training as you complete homework assignments, read books, as well as utilize the numerous online resources available for providing help with R and Python programming.", "If you are interested in data science specializations that can get you started with basic programming courses in R or Python, here are two of my favorite data science specializations that will teach you data science in Python and R as you go (for those with some prior exposure to basic programming):", "Includes the following courses, all taught using R (you can audit courses for free or purchase a verified certificate):", "(ii) Applied Data Science with Python Specialization (the University of Michigan, through Coursera): https://www.coursera.org/special...", "Includes the following courses, all taught using Python (you can audit most courses for free, some require the purchase of a verified certificate):", "In summary, Python and R remain the two top programming languages in data science. In my personal experience, I use Python for machine learning applications, while I find R to be very useful for statistical analysis. Basically, everything that can be done with Python can be implemented in R as well.
