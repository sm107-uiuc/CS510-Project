Pyle. Between these comics and his weekend stories personifying pigeons, his is one of my favorite instagrams to follow. In the comics, Pyle posts about ordinary human interactions conveying the humans as alien-esque creatures", "I spent time analyzing all comics that have been posted to instagram in order to build a model that could predict the description of the post of any given comic.", "Nearly every post includes a one word description from the comic in the following format:", "Over time, followers have begun guessing this word before they read it (and announcing when they guess correctly). This has led to discussions like:", "It\u2019s hard to explain why it\u2019s fun or exciting to play this guessing game if you don\u2019t follow the comic, but for me and many others, it just is.", "This has all inspired me to see if I can create an algorithm that can guess for me.", "To more easily train my predictive model, I analyzed only comics that fit the following criteria:", "Almost every comic meets these criteria, giving me 138 comics to work with.", "On average, Strange Planet comics have 35 words. The shortest comic has 5 words and the longest comic has 74 words. Panel 3 is the most likely to have no words (14% of comics have an empty third panel).", "The comics are also getting slightly longer as time goes on:", "There does not appear to be a strong trend regarding how many words in to a comic the description appears. However, it is more likely that the description will show up in the third or fourth panel than in the first or second (if the descriptive word is included more than once in a comic, all instances are shown below).", "I ran two models to look at what words were used most frequently in posts. In the first model, I did not exclude stop words\u00b9, because I thought the language of the beings in the Strange Planet universe may not have the same stop words as Python has assigned to the english language. I found that the top 20 most frequently used words in the comics fell in to the category of stop words, so I made a new model excluding stop words. (Frequent readers will not be surprised to find \u201csustenance\u201d towards the top.)", "From the second word list, I also built a word cloud to show the most frequently used words in Strange Planet.", "I utilized the Na\u00efve Bayes\u00b2 sentiment analysis from the TextBlob library. From this analysis, I recorded the likelihood that a comic or description word has a positive sentiment.", "A few things to note from this sentiment analysis:", "The description tends to be a longer word than the average word in the comics as is shown by the two histograms below. The word lengths in the comics tend to be right skewed while the description word has a more normal/bimodal distribution averaging at a longer word.", "Thus far, a stop word has never been used as a description. To both simplify my model and make it (probably) perform better, I assumed a stop word would never be used to describe a post.", "Of all the comics, only two descriptive words are used twice (the rest are unique):", "d e l i b e r a t e", "c o m p l e t i o n", "I made a similar assumption for the purpose of model building that a description word would never be resused. Even though I know that this is not true, it is the case frequently enough that I would prefer to use the assumption to be correct more often knowing that I will be incorrect when a word is duplicatted.", "Typically, when you are creating a classification model, you want it to take input data and output a classification for that data:", "However, in this instance, we aren\u2019t exactly looking at a word and guessing whether or not it is the description. Instead, we are looking at lists of varying lengths and predicting what word in that list is the description.", "To get around this issue, I have converted my training data\u00b3 in to a traditional classification problem in which each word in a comic is a unique sample. The prediction being made on each word sample is placing it in to one of two categories: \u201cis the description\u201d or \u201cis not the description.\u201d This allowed me to build a standard classification model (in the case of this project, a random forest model).", "Once I built the model, I processed my testing data in a slightly different way. For each word in the comic, I used the classification model to assign a probability of being the description to each word in the comic. A separate model then selects the word with the highest probability as its guess for the description.", "Because of the method I am using to create my training data set, my data is split such that:", "With imbalanced classes, I struggled to create a model that wouldn\u2019t just assume all samples were not descriptions. In order to address this, I used both the oversampling and undersampling techniques listed here on my training data.", "To convey how resampling changes the data my model is built on, here are two pair plots showing some of the input features my model is using. In the plots below, blue dots signify words that are in the comic but not the description. Orange dots signify description words.", "To the left is the data before I rebalanced. The right is the data after I rebalanced it. Notice how much larger a percent of the points are orange in the right image.", "Notice also that some of the observations listed in the EDA section can be seen in the scatterplots and histograms above. For example:", "I am sad to say that my model performs pitifully. Of the 37 comics I attempted to fit the data to, I got exactly zero words correct. See below for the word I was trying to guess (\u201cword\u201d) versus the word my model predicted (\u201crf_predict\u201d).", "When I fit the model on the resampled training data, I had reason to believe the model would perform well. My f1 score was 0.95 and my accuracy was 0.97. This was well above the baseline accuracy that I sampled to of 75%.", "My first instinct with a model that performs well with training data and performs poorly with testing data is that the model is overfit to the training data. However, that may or may not be an issue in this case.", "The training data had a much easier classification problem to solve:", "Is a given word the description or not ?", "With random guessing, this model could be correct 50% of the time.", "The testing data however was a much more challenging ask:", "Of this list of words, which word is the most likely to be the description?", "With random guessing, the odds of being correct vary from ~20% all the way down to ~2%.", "Some other reasons it was quite difficult to predict the description:", "I had very much hoped to make a model that could tell you the description of a post most of the time (or some of the time, or at least once). Unfortunately, after many updates to my model, I couldn\u2019t get there.", "As an homage to Mr. Pyle and a way to express how I felt seeing the performance of my predictive model, I drew the following comic.", "I also took comfort in knowing that there already exists a Strange Planet cartoon acknowledging how challenging it can be to make certain predictions:", "[1] Stop words are words that are both frequently used and convey little meaning. In English, these words include: I, the, it, who, that, because, any\u2026 It is often useful to remove these words because they primarily add noise to models.", "[2] In Natural Language Processing (NLP), Na\u00efve Bayes models start with the assumption that all words are independent from one another. In some instances, this can be problematic (for example, if the text says \u201cnot happy,\u201d the words \u201cnot\u201d and \u201chappy\u201d are interpreted as unrelated). Though this may seem like a na\u00efve assumption (get it? get it? :) ), it often can create helpful predictions. In this case where I am comparing a comic\u2019s sentiment analysis to a word within the comic\u2019s analysis, I believe I will get the best result by analyzing each word independently.", "[3] When making a predictive model, you always want to split the data you have available in to training data and testing data. Your model builds itself around the training data it is given. Then, in order for you to see how predictive the model actually is, you give it your test data set (that it has not seen before) to make predictions.", "In most cases, you would process the training data and the testing data in the same way. However, for the purposes of training my model more clearly and testing my data more realistically, I processed my training data and testing data differently.", "Your home for data science.
