A theory of multiple intelligences. I found it interesting to read and discuss these points. Frames of Mind: The Theory of Multiple Intelligences was released in 1983 by Howard Gardner. He is currently the senior director of Harvard Project Zero, and since 1995, he has been the co-director of The Good Project. He has written hundreds of articles and thirty books.", "The theory I will outline is his most famous theory. It may reduce his theory to shorten it in this manner, yet I will do my best. As such this is reciting information followed by a short reflection.", "It must be said that Gardner does not support labelling learners to a specific intelligence. The following theory should \u2018empower\u2019 not restrict", "According to Gardner, an intelligence is \u201ca biopsychological potential to process information that can be activated in a cultural setting to solve problems or create products that are of value in a culture.\u201d", "An immediate reaction made me think of RITMO a research group at the University of Oslo, they study:", "\u2026to reveal the basic cognitive mechanism(s) underlying human rhythm, using music, motion and audiovisual media as empirical points of departure.", "It is highly interdisciplinary, combining methods from musicology, psychology and informatics. A presentation that was made earlier this year showed that they through this interdisciplinary work had improved their robotics work drastically. Previously I wrote about algorithms enhancing or replacing musicians (AI-assisted or AI-created music).", "My key takeaway is the lens from which to see intelligence should not be pigeonholed to simply reason or logic. There is more to intelligence.", "During the launch of the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence recently there was additionally a video about the tech environment at Stanford. How new creations had been made in an artistic and creative environment combining different sorts of people from different backgrounds.", "The constructed boundaries are certainly blurring.", "There is so much more to intelligence.", "Indeed, what do you believe intelligence to be?", "This is day 24 of #500daysofAI, I hope you enjoyed it.", "As an afterthought this theory has received criticism. One criticism is that it overemphasises the autonomy of the domain, and some are critical of the lack of empirical evidence both from within the fields of psychology and neuroscience. You could rather use it as a thinking piece than an absolute rule. A theoretical framework does not mean truth.", "I am challenging myself to write and think about the topic of artificial intelligence for the next 500 days with the #500daysofAI. It is a challenge I invented to keep myself thinking of this topic and share my thoughts.", "This is inspired by the film 500 Days of Summer where the main character tries to figure out where a love affair went sour, and in doing so, rediscovers his true passions in life.", "Your home for data science.
