Getting those articles can be challenging though as you will have to go through quite a few hoops to get to the actual data \u2014 finding the right news sources, exploring their APIs, figuring out how to authenticate against them and finally scraping the data. That\u2019s a lot of work and no fun.", "So, to save you some time and get you started, here\u2019s list of public news APIs that I was able to find, with explanation how authenticate against them, query them and most importantly examples for how to get all the data you need from them!", "First and the best source of data is in my opinion New Your Times. To start using its API you need to create an account at https://developer.nytimes.com/accounts/create and an application at https://developer.nytimes.com/my-apps/new-app. When creating the application you get to choose which APIs to activate \u2014 I recommend activating at least Most Popular, Article Search, Top Stories and Archive APIs. When your application is created you will be presented with the key which you will use to interact all the selected APIs, so copy it and let\u2019s start querying!", "The simplest query we can do with NY Times API is look up for current top stories:", "The snippet above is very straightforward. We run a GET request against topstories/v2 endpoint supplying section name and our API key. Section in this case is science, but NY Times provides a lot of other options here, e.g. fashion, health, sports or theater. Full list can be found here. This specific request would produce response that would look something like this:", "Next and probably the most useful endpoint when you are trying to get some specific set of data is the article search endpoint:", "This endpoint features lots of filtering options. The only mandatory field is q (query), which is the search term. Beyond that you can mix and match filter query, date range ( begin_date, end_date), page number, sort order and facet fields. The filter query ( fq) is interesting one, as it allows use of Lucene query syntax, which can be used to create complex filters with logical operators ( AND, OR), negations or wildcards. Nice tutorial can be found here.", "Example response for above query might like this (some fields were removed for clarity):", "Last endpoint for NY Times that I will show here is their Archive API which returns list of articles for given month going back all the way to 1851! This can be very useful if you need bulk data and don\u2019t really need to search for specific terms.", "The query above searches for all articles from June of 1852 and from the result below we can see that even though we search for really old articles we still got 1888 hits. That said, most of these lack most of the useful data like keywords, word counts, author, etc. so you are probably better off searching for little more recent articles.", "These were just some of the (in my opinion) more useful APIs provided by NY Times. Beside these, there are bunch more available at https://developer.nytimes.com/apis. To explore each API, I would also recommend playing with query builder like the one for article search, which lets you and build and execute your test query right on the website without any coding.", "Next up is another great source of news and articles \u2014 The Guardian. Same as with NY Times, we first need to sign up for an API key. You can do so at https://bonobo.capi.gutools.co.uk/register/developer and you will receive your key in an email. With that out of the way, we can navigate to API documentation and start querying the API.", "Let\u2019s start simply by querying content sections of The Guardian:", "These sections group content into topics, which can be useful if you are looking for specific type of content, e.g. science or technology. If we omit the query ( q) parameter, we will instead receive full list of sections, which is about 75 records.", "Moving on to something little more interesting \u2014 searching by tags:", "This query looks quite similar to the previous one and also returns similar kinds of data. Tags also group content into categories, but there are a lot more tags (around 50000) than sections. Each of these tags have structure like for example world/extreme-weather. These are very useful when doing search for actual articles, which is what we will do next.", "The one thing you really came here for is article search and for that we will use https://open-platform.theguardian.com/documentation/search:", "The reason I first showed you section and tag search is that those can be used in the article search. Above you can see that we used section and tag parameters to narrow down our search, which values can be found using previously shown queries. Apart from these parameters, we also included the obvious q parameter for our search query, but also starting date using from-date as well as show-fields parameter, which allows us to request extra fields related to the content - in this case those would be headline, byline, rating and shortened URL. There's bunch more of those with full list available here", "And as with all the previous ones, here is example response:", "For more tech oriented source of news, one might turn to HackerNews, which also has its public REST API. It\u2019s documented on https://github.com/HackerNews/API. This API, as you will see, is in version v0 and is currently very bare-bones, meaning it doesn't really provide specific endpoints to - for example - query articles, comments or users.", "But even though it\u2019s very basic it still provides all that\u2019s necessary to, for example, get top stories:", "The snippet above is not nearly as obvious as the previous ones, so let\u2019s look at it more closely. We first send request to API endpoint ( v0/topstories), which doesn't return top stories as you would expect, but really just their IDs. To get the actual stories we take these IDs (first 10 of them) and send requests to v0/item/<ID> endpoint which returns data for each of these individual items, which in this case happens to be a story.", "You surely noticed that the query URL was parametrized with query_type. That's because, HackerNews API also has similar endpoints for all the top sections of the website, that being - ask, show, job or new.", "One nice thing about this API is that it doesn\u2019t require authenticate, so you don\u2019t need to request API key and don\u2019t need to worry about rate limiting like with the other ones.", "Running this code would land response that looks something like this:", "If you found an interesting articles and wanted to dig a little deeper, then HackerNews API can help with that too. You can find comments of each submission by traversing kids field of said story. Code that would do just that looks like so:", "First, we look up story ( item) by ID like we did in previous example. We then iterate over its kids and run same query with respective IDs retrieving items that in this case refer to story comments. We could also go through these recursively if we wanted to build whole tree/thread of comments of specific story.", "As always, here is sample response:", "Finding popular and good quality news API is quite difficult as most classic newspapers don\u2019t have free public API. There are however, sources of aggregate news data which can be used to get articles and news from newspapers like for example Financial Times and Bloomberg which only provide paid API services or like CNN doesn\u2019t expose any API at all.", "One of these aggregators is called Currents API. It aggregates data from thousands of sources, 18 languages and over 70 countries and it\u2019s also free.", "It\u2019s similar to the APIs shown before. We again need to first get API key. To do so, you need to register at https://currentsapi.services/en/register. After that, go to your profile at https://currentsapi.services/en/profile and retrieve your API token.", "With key (token) ready we can request some data. There\u2019s really just one interesting endpoint and that\u2019s https://api.currentsapi.services/v1/search:", "This endpoint includes lots of filtering options including language, category, country and more, as shown in the snippet above. All of those are pretty self-explanatory, but for those first three I mentioned, you will need some extra information as their possible values aren\u2019t really obvious. These values come from API endpoints available here and in case of languages and regions are really just mappings of value to code (e.g. \"English\": \"en\") and in case of categories just a list of possible values. It's omitted in the code above to make it a bit shorter, but I just copied these mappings into Python dict s to avoid calling API every time.", "Response to above request lands the following:", "If you aren\u2019t searching for specific topic or historical data, then there\u2019s one other options which Currents API provides \u2014 the latest news endpoint:", "It is very similar to the search endpoint, this one however only provides language parameter and produces results like this:", "There are many great news sites and online newspapers out there on the internet, but in most cases you won\u2019t be able to scrape their data or access them programmatically. The ones shown in this article are the rare few with nice API and free access that you can use for your next project whether it\u2019s some data science, machine learning or simple news aggregator. If you don\u2019t mind paying some money for news API, you might also consider using Financial Times or Bloomberg. Apart from APIs you can also try scraping HTML and parsing the content yourself with something like BeautifulSoup. If you happen to find any other good source of news data, please let me know, so that I can add it to this list. \ud83d\ude42", "This article was originally posted at martinheinz.dev", "Your home for data science.
