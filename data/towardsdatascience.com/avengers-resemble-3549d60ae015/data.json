Humans are incredibly adept at recognizing faces, but it is a fairly recent trend that we have been able to train computers to do a close enough job to warrant using it in more applications. Faces contort, age, and pose in all directions, which creates major challenges for how you match them across multiple images. Advancements in deep learning, such as the FaceNet research, have truly changed the game and made these processes much easier to perform with incredibly accurate results.", "If you\u2019re someone who fears what teaching computers a skill like this means, I understand the sentiment. There are many positives to what we are able to do with facial recognition. A few examples of how it can be incredibly helpful: increased security features in a growing digital world, helping find a missing person, helping the blind navigate the world, and (potentially) helping build better tools to fight crime. Privacy, however, remains the primary concern with this technology. What level of comfort do we have, as a society, for our image being taken and used for some classification purpose? It might feel okay on a personal device for security, but how about getting targeted ads when you are out in the world? It is some really tricky stuff, but as we continue to work through it, it is important to remember:", "\u201cWith great power comes great responsibility\u201d", "This leads me to a quick project using facial recognition, hopefully showing a creative use for the technology.", "The problem: It\u2019s almost Halloween! You work for a costume company and they want to make a fun and interactive way for customers to find a costume that fits them best. What if you used facial recognition to find which actor they look most like and recommend costumes based on that match? Sounds like a plan. This year has been a big one for the Avengers movies, so let\u2019s use those actors and their related characters to create an Avengers Resembler!", "There are a few nice tools out there for face detection and recognition (like OpenCV) but I am going demonstrate using the Python library face_recognition. It is a really fast and accurate package built using dlib\u2019s face recognition build with some impressive results (accuracy of 99.38% on the \u201cLabeled Faces in the Wild\u201d benchmark). Detecting a face in an image (finding and returning bounding box location) and getting the face encodings (vector representation of the face) is as simple as three lines:", "Awesome! In just a couple lines, we found the face and converted it into a numerical vector representation we can use to compare with other images. While most facial recognition is looking to for a true match (ex. photo applications labeling a face and finding that person in all other images, your phone matching the users face to allow access), what I am doing is looking for the best \u201cclose enough\u201d. Here is the general workflow and functions I created to get my Avengers Resembler:", "3. Run all the images through my function and create a new dictionary that has the character name and their array with face encodings:", "4. Pickling my encoding dictionary. This makes it so I can easily open it back up later without having to re-run face_recognition on my known faces:", "5. Create a function for returning the top match for an image, based on the known encodings:", "6. Test adding a new image and seeing what the closest match is:", "If you would like to try it for yourself, you can check out my code here on GitHub. It currently will run in Terminal with some fun ASCII decoration:", "This might work best as a web app, which I may try to build out further, but fun to see the principles of how this can work.
