Rayshard Brooks had been arrested for a suspected DUI and tried to run away from the police officers. He managed to steal a taser and attempted to shoot an officer with it while running away. However, CNN did not show that last part of the altercation (caught on another camera), but they did quickly mention it.", "I was curious to see how people would react to the entire incident and to CNN leaving out part of the story. Just to be very clear, I am not giving my opinion here, I am just analyzing what is being said about the incident.", "I scraped the Youtube comments using selenium. In total, I scraped 1,460 comments. The following article shows exactly how I did it: https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-youtube-comments-with-python-61ff197115d4", "Here is what the data looks like:", "This is a big part of any NLP project. Here is the function used to clean the text:", "Here is what the function does:", "Let\u2019s now apply the function to the data:", "I decided to lemmatize the text, which is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analyzed as a single item, since they have a similar meaning (walking becomes walk, officers becomes officer, etc.).", "The nltk.WordNetLemmatizer() function does just that. Here is the code:", "Finally, I removed all empty comments from the data (some people just comment emojis, punctuations or things like that).", "This leaves us with 1,441 comments to analyze.", "Let\u2019s begin by looking at the word frequency, i.e. what words are repeated most often in the comments, using the FreqDist function from nltk.", "That does not give us much idea about how people feel about the video. Still, here are a few noteworthy mentions:", "Let\u2019s look for the most frequent bigrams, which means the most frequent pair of words that are next to each other in a comment.", "Ok ok, now we are starting to see some interesting stuff. The bigram \u201cresist arrest\u201d came up the most. There is also a lot of mention of the taser here (shoot taser, take taser, cop taser, etc), even if the video showing the taser being discharged by Rayshard Brooks is not shown in the clip. The famous \u201cfake news\u201d also came up almost 30 times.", "Here is the plot for the most popular trigrams:", "I think this graph really highlights what people are thinking. A lot of fake news mentions and a lot of mentions about the use of the stolen taser. There is also mentions of the use of deadly force.", "Using Textblob\u2019s sentiment function, we can look at the polarity of a comment, which is a float number ranging between -1 and 1 that is meant to represent if a comment is positive (1) or negative (-1). For instance, the sentence \u201cTextblob is great\u201d has a polarity of 0.4.", "Here is how to get polarity for every comment and the distribution of said polarity:", "The vast majority of comments are what could be considered as rather neutral, with the mean comment having a polarity of -0.005. About 75% of the comments have a polarity of less than 0.06, meaning there are very few positive comments (I sure hope so, it\u2019s a shooting after all!). In fact, only 45 of the 1,441 comments have a polarity of more than 0.5.", "With all that being said, here are a few conclusions that I think can be drawn from this analysis:", "There you have it. We managed to get a good idea of how people are feeling about the video CNN posted and the incident that occured.", "It this case, it\u2019s hard to classify comments (positive vs negative for instance) since we don\u2019t know the \u201ctrue\u201d class of a comment. We don\u2019t have known labels from which we can build and evaluate a simple machine learning classifier.", "There are however ways of labeling text data (manually, using polarity, using the count of positive vs negative words, etc.), which I will cover in an upcoming article. Keep in mind however that it will never be possible to know the true performance of a model if we don\u2019t know the true class of a comment. That\u2019s one of the reason NLP can be so challenging!", "Full code is available right here.", "Your home for data science.
