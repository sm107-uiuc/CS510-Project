Three years ago, I hopped between several courses, books, and resources in hopes of developing my understanding of machine learning.", "I initially tried Udacity\u2019s Machine Learning course but found it too complex for a beginner. I then tried Coursera\u2019s Machine Learning course, and it was a great course to learn the theory behind each model, but it wasn\u2019t taught in Python. Lastly, I tried Udemy\u2019s Machine learning A-Z course but found that I was simply copying their code and didn\u2019t fully understand what I was doing.", "It wasn\u2019t until later on that I came across a simple resource that accelerated my career. In this article, I\u2019ll help you create your very own machine learning model in two simple steps.", "By reading this article, I hope to help you achieve the following:", "If you get stuck anywhere in the process, go to the section on My First Machine Learning Model to see what I did or feel free to reach out to me on Linkedin!", "Personally, I found that Kaggle\u2019s Intro to Machine Learning course was the best resource to getting started and the reason being is that it\u2019s VERY basic \u2014 it literally provides you with the bare minimum to build your first machine learning model. And you might think that this is a bad thing but as a beginner, but there are a few reasons why this is good:", "As you go through this course, keep the following points in mind:", "Once you finish this, you can then move on to the second step to making your own machine learning model:", "Kaggle provides much more than online courses \u2014 it has thousands of datasets that you can use to explore with and create models with. Below are the steps required to complete your very own first model.", "First, go to Kaggle\u2019s list of datasets here and pick one that interests you. Think about what variable you would like to predict. Do you want to predict life expectancy? Real estate prices? Taxi usage? The world is your oyster.", "Then click on \u2018New Notebook\u2019. This is where you\u2019ll be replicating the code that you learned from Kaggle\u2019s introductory course.", "Once you\u2019re in your new notebook, the rest is easy. Simply replicate the code that you were introduced to in Kaggle\u2019s Intro to Machine Learning course. Then there\u2019s only a couple of things that you need to change:", "And that\u2019s it! You\u2019ve created your very own machine learning model with a dataset that you chose yourself. It may not seem like much right now, but a few more months into your data science journey and you\u2019ll back at this and see how much progress you\u2019ve made.", "For my first algorithm, I wanted to create something that I thought would be relevant later in my life. I decided to use a \u201cUsed Car Dataset\u201d from Kaggle, which has over 600,000 used car listings. The algorithm I created aimed to predict the price of a used car based on a number of features, including the year it was built, the manufacturer, the odometer (number of kilometers), and more.", "You can see how I coded my first model here and you can see that it\u2019s not much, but seven weeks later, I was able to improve it significantly with many more steps (see my improved model here).", "There\u2019s a million things that you can learn to improve your model \u2014 here are some articles that you can start with if you don\u2019t know what to do next:", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
