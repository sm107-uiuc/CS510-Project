I was intrigued by the culture and drawn to the challenge of learning a language that wasn\u2019t European. I didn\u2019t want to fall victim to the usual trap of it feeling like a chore, so I started using a diverse range of resources including Duolingo, LingoDeer, Talktomeinkorean.com, flash cards, Korean dramas and \u2014 obviously \u2014 several thousand hours\u2019 worth of BTS albums.", "The Korean language (Hangul) is very logical, interesting, and significantly different to English in many key ways. It took months to get grips with topic markers, honorifics, and different conversation levels, but eventually I got to a point where I have enough familiarity with the structure of the language that I\u2019m focused on picking up more vocabulary.", "However \u2014 as many learners may agree \u2014 I have found that translating with google isn\u2019t always useful, as not only are translations often slightly off the mark, but because Korean sentences are structured subject-object-verb (rather than S-V-O), use particle markers, and deploy descriptors differently, a translated passage doesn\u2019t easily show me which words are the verbs, nouns, adjectives.", "I\u2019ve been working on several different courses recently, all of which involve using a lot of python. I, therefore, thought \u201cthere has to be a way that I can bring these two great loves together\u201d and after a lot of research, the following plan was born:", "The basic idea was that I wanted to be able to pass a passage of Korean text (e.g. a news article, recipe, song lyrics) through python and have it tell me clearly which parts are nouns, verbs etc. I would then translate each part and use a dataframe to print a vocab sheet. Spoiler alert: I did it.", "The good news is, as always, almost all of the hard work had already been done by some great developers. I decided to use the KoNLPy module and the Google Translate API to keep it relatively simple. [KoNLPy is a python package for natural language processing of Korean, and it is seriously cool.]", "For all the details on setting up the module, a very clear walk-through can be found here. All I needed to do was install the Java Development Kit, a correctly versioned JPype wheel, and KoNLPy at the command line before importing into my python environment. There are several classes available, but I\u2019m using OKT which is a wrapper for \u201cOpen Korean Text\u201d:", "I set up my \u2018text\u2019 to be the sentence \u201cI am eating cake\u201d, and initialised the class as an object, before calling the pprint utils class. I\u2019ve included some parameters that will normalise the sentence and reduce words to the root form:", "The output was exactly what I wanted, showing me the nouns \u201cI\u201d and \u201ccake\u201d, the two particles (subject and topic) and the stem of the verb \u201ceating\u201d, \u201cto eat\u201d.", "Now on to the fun bit.", "The final script makes use of just three libraries:", "Putting it all together was fairly straightforward. This time I took a paragraph of text, and made a dataframe with the results after using KoNLPy as above:", "Next, I split the results in to two columns, removed any duplicate rows or punctuation, and sorted the values:", "Then, I set up the translator and added a column to append the results in the dataframe. I dropped the original column and printed the dataframe to a markdown:", "Finally, I set two options: to either export to_csv as a .txt file, or to save to_html as .html:", "And there we have it. You can see here that the html file looks like a proper vocab chart that I think is pretty effective!", "If you made it this far \u2014 thanks very much! I\u2019d love to know what you think. This is just a humble starting point with a lot of potential, but once K-pop twitter gets hold of it, I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be a great success :-).", "Check out KoNPLy: https://konlpy.org/en/latest/ Eunjeong L.
