In the retail e-commerce world of online marketplace, where experiencing products are not feasible. Also, in today\u2019s retail marketing world, there are so many new products are emerging every day. Therefore, customers need to rely largely on product reviews to make up their minds for better decision making on purchase. However, searching and comparing text reviews can be frustrating for users. Hence we need better numerical ratings system based on the reviews which will make customers purchase decision with ease.", "During their decision making process, consumers want to find useful reviews as quickly as possible using rating system. Therefore, models able to predict the user rating from the text review are critically important. Getting an overall sense of a textual review could in turn improve consumer experience. Also, it can help businesses to increase sales, and improve the product by understanding customer\u2019s needs.", "The amazon review dataset for electronics products were considered. The reviews and ratings given by the user to different products as well as reviews about user\u2019s experience with the product(s) were also considered.", "The goal is to develop a model to predict user rating, usefulness of review and recommend most similar items to users based on collaborative filtering.", "The electronics dataset consists of reviews and product information from amazon were collected.

Final merged data frame description is shown below:", "In order to reduce time consumption for running models, only headphones products were chosen and the following method was adopted.", "The following summary statistics was obtained", "The summary statistics for headphones dataset is shown below:", "Since, text is the most unstructured form of all the available data, various types of noise are present in it and the data is not readily analyzable without any pre-processing. The entire process of cleaning and standardization of text, making it noise-free and ready for analysis is known as text preprocessing. In this section, the following text preprocessing were applied.", "HTML tags which typically does not add much value towards understanding and analyzing text. HTML words were removed from text.", "Accented characters/letters were converted and standardized into ASCII characters.", "Contractions are shortened version of words or syllables. They exist in either written or spoken forms. Shortened versions of existing words are created by removing specific letters and sounds. In case of English contractions, they are often created by removing one of the vowels from the word.", "By nature, contractions do pose a problem for NLP and text analytics because, to start with, we have a special apostrophe character in the word. Ideally, we can have a proper mapping for contractions and their corresponding expansions and then use it to expand all the contractions in our text.", "One important task in text normalization involves removing unnecessary and special characters. These may be special symbols or even punctuation that occurs in sentences. This step is often performed before or after tokenization. The main reason for doing so is because often punctuation or special characters do not have much significance when we analyze the text and utilize it for extracting features or information based on NLP and ML.", "The process of lemmatization is to remove word affixes to get to a base form of the word. The base form is also known as the root word, or the lemma, will always be present in the dictionary.", "Stopwords are words that have little or no significance. They are usually removed from text during processing so as to retain words having maximum significance and context. Stopwords are usually words that end up occurring the most if you aggregated any corpus of text based on singular tokens and checked their frequencies. Words like a, the , me , and so on are stopwords.", "Based on the functions which we have written above and with additional text correction techniques (such as lowercase the text, and remove the extra newlines, white spaces, apostrophes), we built a text normalizer in order to help us to preprocess the new_text document.", "After applying text normalizer to \u2018the review_text\u2019 document, we applied tokenizer to create tokens for the clean text. As a result of that, we had 3070479 words in total. After cleaning, we have 25276 observations.", "A clean dataset will allow a model to learn meaningful features and not overfit on irrelevant noise. After following these steps and checking for additional errors, we can start using the clean, labelled data to train models in modeling section.", "After collecting data, wrangling data then exploratory analyses were carried out. The following insights were explored through exploratory analyses.", "The most positively reviewed product in Amazon under headphones category is \u201cPanasonic ErgoFit In-Ear Earbud Headphones RP-HJE120-D (Orange) Dynamic Crystal Clear Sound, Ergonomic Comfort-Fit\u201d.
