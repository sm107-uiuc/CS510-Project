Looking for a solution that would speed up the process of training and deploying a model, I stumbled upon Microsoft\u2019s Azure ML Studio, and boy was I NOT disappointed.", "In the No-code Machine Learning arena, there are a few notable contenders:", "I will explore each of these in-depth in a series of posts culminating with a point by point comparison. I\u2019ll be using this Kaggle dataset, from an old competition where the goal is to predict whether an auction car is a \u201ckick\u201d (i.e. a damaged car) or not.", "Today, we start with Azure ML Studio.", "The main area in Azure ML Studio is the Experiment canvas. Here you have the modules on the left, grouped by purpose, and you can drag any module to the main canvas. The right-hand side of the canvas is used to show the properties of whatever module is currently selected, or to customize some of its parameters.", "Each module comes predefined with some input and output ports. Each of these ports also has a type, that shows as a tool tip when you hover the mouse over it. This is very useful when you want to know what type of input is expected.", "In Azure ML Studio, we build a machine learning pipeline by connecting modules: the output of one module becomes one of the inputs of the next module in the pipeline.", "We can have a sequential pipeline as well as parallel pipelines, where one output is redirected to more than one input, as long as the types of both input and output are compatible.", "For example, in the image below, we see that the output of the dataset module is of type GenericCSV.", "The next module has an input that is expected to be of type Dataset, which has many implementations or subclasses, one of which is GenericCSV; so we can connect the former output to this input.", "Moreover, when we are dragging from an output down to an input of the next module, that input dot turns green if it is compatible with the output we are trying to connect it to.", "You basically have 7 stages in any ML pipeline:", "Each of these stages maps to a set of modules in Azure ML Studio.", "For this step, you\u2019ll be using the modules under Data Transformation. The two most important subsections are Manipulation and Scale and Reduce. There is good enough variety there to cover most use-cases: one-hot-encoding of categorical variables, binning of continuous variables, cleaning missing data, etc.", "Let\u2019s take one of these modules, \u201cClean Missing Data\u201d, as an example to explore the properties panel. Here we are asked to select which columns we want to use as candidates for cleaning, what are the minimum and maximum missing value ratios to perform the cleaning, and finally how we want to deal with missing values. Several options are available:", "And in case we need something fancy that is not available as a module, we have the \u201cApply SQL Transformation\u201d module where we can run arbitrary SQL code, which we can enter directly in the editor embedded in the properties panel. Notice that this module has 3 input ports, meaning we can process up to 3 datasets with this module, referred to as t1, t2, and t3 within the SQL code.", "To create new features, you will follow a similar process to data preprocessing and use pretty much the same modules. The one difference is that it\u2019s better to create your features after you have split your data, on the training data only. On the testing data, you must either find a way to apply a similar transform, using only information from the training data, or even better, you can use the \u201cApply Transformation\u201d module to reuse the transform that was created using the training data. Here\u2019s a simple example of that process:", "In the example above, we are binning a column in the training data, using only the values found in the training data to choose the edges of the bins. Then we are applying those bins to the test data.", "This process avoids information leakage, which would happen if we had created the buckets before splitting the data because in that case, we would have used information from the test data to train our model.", "For feature selection, Azure ML provides three options, the two most frequently used being \u201cFilter Based Feature Selection\u201d and \u201cPermutation Feature Importance\u201d. The former is used before training a model and is based on a user-selected metric such as correlation or mutual information between predictors and target, whereas the latter requires a trained model and selects feature based on how much that mode\u2019s performance is degraded after randomly swapping values in each feature.", "The bread and butter of any machine learning project, in Azure ML Studio you have many types of models you can train. These can be found under the \u201cInitialize Model\u201d group:", "You\u2019ll find all the usual suspects in there: logistic regression, decision trees, random forest, boosted trees and neural networks. For classification, both 2-class and multiclass models are supported.", "Scoring in Azure ML terminology means \"making predictions\". You can choose to output only the predictions (in the case of classification, you'll have predicted probabilities as well as predicted class) or to append the prediction columns to the output.", "When you visualize the output of the \u201cEvaluate Model\u201d module, the metrics you\u2019ll see will depend on the type of model used. For regression, you\u2019ll see the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and others. For classification, you\u2019ll see the AUC and logloss, and you\u2019ll have a threshold you can play with to see the confusion matrix, the precision and recall, the accuracy, etc.", "The \u201cEvaluate Model\u201d has two inputs, allowing you to pit two models one against the other and see which one performs best. Here\u2019s an example with 2 classification models:", "If you want to compare more than 2 models at the same time, you\u2019ll have to use several \u201cEvaluate Model\u201d module.", "Here Azure really shines. Deploying a model after it has been trained is literally a matter of 3 clicks.", "And now\u2026believe it or not, your model is already deployed and ready to work! You have an API key you can use to call the endpoint programmatically (to see the end point\u2019s URI, you have to click on the REQUEST/RESPONSE link ). What\u2019s more, you can download a pre-configured Excel file where you\u2019ll be able to call the model at the click of a button and make predictions directly from within Excel.", "Unfortunately, at the time of writing this post, my Azure Machine Learning add-in was not working. This is the first time it happened to me, and I have a feeling that it is because I logged in with another outlook email. I haven\u2019t been able to fix the problem this morning, and since I\u2019m not getting any error messages (the Azure Machine Learning add-in is just stuck in loading mode), it\u2019s hard for me to debug it. As with many things Microsoft, when it works, it works great. But that 1% of the time it doesn\u2019t\u2026you\u2019re in for some pain!", "Notwithstanding, I maintain that the ease with which a non-technical person can deploy and serve a model is mind-blowing. The above-mentioned Excel file can be shared with anyone who you wish to grant access to your model.", "Up to now, we have been talking about Azure ML Studio (classic), and while the above deployment mode is just for testing/debugging, Microsoft has been rolling out Azure Machine Learning designer (preview), a similar but much-improved version of the ML studio, with enterprise-grade scalability and security among other benefits.", "Another thing worth mentioning is that everything we have done above can also be done through coding in python by using a dedicated API.", "Finally, while the purpose of this post was to show what can be done with no coding, if you want to take it further, you can very easily connect an R or Python component, where you can execute arbitrary code, even using your modules if you need to. Both input and output are expected to be data frames.", "I love the product and would use it to build a commercial product. I haven\u2019t tested the new Azure ML Designer yet, but that\u2019s on my to-do list. Assuming I can have fine-grained control over my deployed solution, I believe the total time to prod can be massively reduced just by avoiding the usual boiler-plate code.", "Feel free to experiment on your own and share your opinion with me.", "Your home for data science.
