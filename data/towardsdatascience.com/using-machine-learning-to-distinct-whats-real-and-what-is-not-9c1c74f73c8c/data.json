The world is becoming stranger and we are receiving more info from sources all over the internet, some of them being dishonest at best. The ability to know if what you read is fake or genuinely bizarre and shocking is getting harder and harder. And with USA elections being less than a month away, it is important to be able to stand out reality from fake news.", "I will try to use a Machine Learning (ML) technique to classify headlines as fake or not and compare it to humans.", "I think we should start with an experiment. I would use two titles the one is from a fake article (from The Onion) and the other one is from a real article.", "The answer isn\u2019t obvious and sadly that\u2019s not the only case. You can find the answer at the end of the article but don\u2019t spoil yourself.", "I decided to do one more little experiment. I chose six headlines (three fake and three real). Then I went to Instagram and I did a poll between my followers. I know, the sample is more than biased by not being representative for nothing but my friends, nonetheless it is going to be an indicator.", "Collective human knowledge had a success rate (accuracy) of 0.5.

For those that don\u2019t know \u201cThe Onion\u201d is an American parody website covering both real and fictional events with a satirical tone, mimicking a real news organization. It\u2019s not trying to deceive people, but to entertain them. So, it\u2019s not exactly fake news in the bad way, we just use this dataset because we know we can easily and objectively classify them as fake.", "The real headlines are from a subreddit called r/NotTheOnion which contains various surreal headlines from the real world that the users could misinterpret and /or hope as Onion news.", "The dataset is used widely and there are lot of experiments done on the data some of them with better accuracy than mine.", "I decided to implement a different technique from the ones I found online as side project to sharp my NLP (nature language processing) skills.", "After doing preprocessing on the data I produced a Tf-idF and trained a neural network to classify the news.", "But first let\u2019s get some basic understanding of our dataset.", "We have 24k headlines distributed as 62.5% Not Onion articles and 37.5% Onion articles.", "Let\u2019s go deeper into the technical aspects of the project.

We are going to use the NLTK suite for this part.", "First, we keep only lowercase alphanumerical characters, and we discard the special ones. Then we start a process where we tokenize the words, then we clean the stop words and finally we stem the words. It\u2019s a standard NLP procedure that NLTK help us do very easily.", "Now that we have done a basic text preprocessing, before proceeding in the next step let\u2019s visualize the word clouds of the two labels.", "The next step is to split the dataset and produce the tf\u2013idf of the data.", "After we have the tf-idf we shall proceed to our model.", "The dataset is simple, so we are going to build a small and basic model.", "Let\u2019s run the headlines from my Instagram experiment and see how it goes versus the crowd.", "The accuracy of our evaluation is 0.83 better than the crowd.", "We implemented a basic model and got some descent results, better than the human experiment. If we had a bigger dataset and a better technique, we could easily achieve more than 90% accuracy.
