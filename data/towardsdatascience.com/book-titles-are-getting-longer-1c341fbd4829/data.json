We know for example that song titles are shortening along with our attention spans. Why might the world of literary fiction be different?", "To investigate this claim, I used the New York Times Books API to collect data on all bestsellers since 2011. Below I show how longer titles are just one of many trends in the world of books.", "To verify that book titles are in fact getting longer, I grabbed all available bestsellers from the New York Times Combined Print and E-book Fiction lists. Then I counted the number of words in the titles of these novels. Below is the plot of the average number of words in fiction titles for every month since February 2011.", "It\u2019s clear that there is a noticeable upward trend since 2016. Fiction titles went from averaging about 2.5 words to almost 3 now.", "To double check this, I also counted the number of letters in fiction titles. Here again, the regression line shows a noticeable upward trend. Novels now are likely to have 14 letters in their title instead of 12.", "Looking more closely at the longest titles, I noticed that many of them are from famous series \u2014 most noticeably the \u201cGirl With the Dragon Tattoo\u201d books. Below is a list of all bestsellers with 7 or more words in the title. Many of them are sequels or prequels to other successful works.", "Being part of an established series, these titles need to reference past work, making them less concise. Also, the novels that aren\u2019t from some famous trilogy are often still by established authors (eg. Nieil Gaiman, Fredrik Backman). Selling into an existing reader base means that these authors are able to play around with their titles and get more creative.", "I suspect that the shift to e-readers and online purchasing also influences how novels are named. Online, away from crowded store shelves, readers don\u2019t have to peruse multiple books at once. They don\u2019t need to wait for some punchy title to catch the eye. Besides, from my admittedly anecdotal experience, book stores and airport kiosks seem to stock mostly non-fiction these days. On the other hand, novels are free to be niche and weird, just like the internet that sells them.", "As I noticed a few years ago, the most popular novels seem to center around one enticing word \u2014 \u2018girl\u2019 . Using updated 2019 data, it seems that \u2018girl\u2019 is still the one word that sells more than any other.", "However, this doesn\u2019t mean that fiction titles don\u2019t change over time. In 2018, words like \u2018dark\u2019 and \u2018death\u2019 caught up with \u2018girl\u2019 in popularity. Like children\u2019s names, the most popular titles tend to evolve and reflect the current mood.", "After 2016, there seems to be a subtle but noticeable shift in the tone of fiction titles. We can see this by plotting the popularity of certain words per year. For instance, \u2018love\u2019 has lately fallen out of favor, while \u2018night\u2019 has become fashionable. Similarly, \u2018light\u2019 has made \u2018way\u2019 for \u2018dark\u2019 in book titles.", "Also, for reasons that I cannot fathom, novels with the word \u201cdeath\u201d in them seem to be popular in even-number years. It seems that like the Giants, the grim reaper doesn\u2019t like odd numbers.", "The same analysis that I applied to fiction bestsellers can easily be applied to their non-fiction counterparts. Below I plot the number of words/nonfiction title per year. On the right are the number of letters/title per year. As we can see, there is no significant lengthening trend.", "Given that non-fiction works are rarely part of a series and that they still sell heavily in big stores, this is not so surprising. In fact, non-fiction titles have other significant differences from their fiction counterparts. For example, below are histograms of the number of words in fiction and non-fiction titles.", "It\u2019s clear that non-fiction bestsellers have a wider spread of words per title. In fact many of them have just one word on the cover (eg. \u2018Bossypants\u2019, \u2018Sapiens\u2019, \u2018Moneyball\u2019, \u2018Hunger\u2019, \u2018Freakonomics\u2019).", "Examining the most popular words in non-fiction titles, we see that the focus is less on mysteries and more on biographies of politicians. This explains the common use of words like \u2018America\u2019 and \u2018President\u2019 (eg. \u2018Trump\u2019 and \u2018Kennedy\u2019).", "Perhaps because of this political quality, non-fiction titles have become more negative in the post-Trump era. Plotting the average sentiment (or positivity) of these titles over time, we see a sharp drop after 2016.", "In fact, some of the most negative book titles center around Trump era topics and were published in the last 2 years.", "Survey data from the National Endowment for the Arts suggests that women read more works of fiction, while men focus on non-fiction books. After examining the differences between fiction and non-fiction bestsellers, it\u2019s clear to me that this observation is correct.", "This is best seen by comparing the NYT descriptions of their bestsellers. Let\u2019s look at fiction books first.", "Below I plot the most common words in the descriptions of fiction books. The cloud on the left only removes \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 from the plot. On the right, all common english words are removed, leaving only unique words.", "It\u2019s clear that bestselling fiction is often part a \u2018book series\u2019, most likely a \u2018trilogy\u2019. It usually involves a \u2018woman\u2019 \u2014 either a \u2018lawyer\u2019 or an \u2018agent\u2019. Or better yet, a \u2018detective\u2019. On \u2018her\u2019 journey, our protagonist will likely \u2018investigate\u2019 a \u2018killer\u2019. Perhaps it\u2019s a \u2018case\u2019 of a \u2018murdered\u2019 \u2018friend\u2019 or \u2018former love\u2019. In the process, she will \u2018return\u2019 to the \u2018past\u2019, unearth \u2018secrets\u2019, \u2018discover\u2019 the \u2018murderer\u2019 and maybe even find \u2018new\u2019 \u2018love\u2019. She may even find a \u2018new family\u2019 along the way.", "The same word clouds for non-fiction bestsellers are shown below. On the left, all major english stop-words are removed. On the right, they are included, but \u2018the\u2019 and \u2018a\u2019 are removed.", "In non-fiction, the protagonist seems more likely to be male . \u2018His\u2019 story is likely a \u2018memoir\u2019, a \u2018biography\u2019 or simply the \u2018account\u2019 of his life. Possibly he is a \u2018former\u2019 \u2018American\u2019 \u2018president\u2019. Or maybe he is a \u2018journalist\u2019 or \u2018comedian\u2019 who just wants to \u2018tell\u2019 his \u2018life\u2019 \u2018story\u2019 for the \u2018first\u2019 time. His book will likely be \u2018humorous\u2019 and \u2018political\u2019. It may \u2018discuss\u2019 \u2018death\u2019, \u2018relationships\u2019, \u2018family\u2019 or \u2018war\u2019. Either way he will definitely spill plenty of ink looking \u2018back\u2019 at his \u2018career\u2019, telling his \u2018personal\u2019 \u2018stories\u2019, and just maybe, complaining about his \u2018mother\u2019.", "The conventional wisdom is that media is shaped primarily by its consumers. Still, the percentage of the population who reads fiction is declining and is increasingly dominated by women. Furthermore, the internet has upended old paradigms of distribution, creating new incentives for all players in the literary world. This has led to a few interesting trends. Fiction titles are getting longer while non-fiction titles are not. Non-fiction titles are getting more negative while the trend in fiction is more subtle (the proliferation of \u2018dark\u2019 books). Finally, men and women seem to be diverging in their reading habits. As we fracture culturally and politically, it makes sense that our print media should follow suit.", "Your home for data science.
