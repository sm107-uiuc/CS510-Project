It\u2019s essentially a collection of numerical values assigned to the specific timestamps and it\u2019s used to describe how things change over time. Data from IoT devices, sensors, weather forecasts, click-stream, financial stock market data, or even your heart rate measurements \u2014 those are all examples of time-series.", "The use cases that require to track changes over time are so pervasive that many products on the market have been designed specifically to store this type of data efficiently. During the re:Invent in 2018, AWS announced a new cloud service, Amazon Timestream, that should offer a 1000 times faster query performance and a reduction of costs by a factor of ten as compared to relational databases [1]. And the best of it is that it\u2019s serverless, making it easy to scale as the amount of time series data stored over time keeps growing.", "Even though the product has been announced already in 2018, it was not generally available until last week.", "In this article, we will look at Amazon Timestream\u2019s features, benefits, limitations, and pricing, followed by a short demo and conclusion.", "AWS has proven many times that they want to make it easy for their customers to use their services by abstracting away the IT Operations and things needed to start using their products. Timestream is no exception \u2014 there is no Ops, even if you wanted to do it. All that you can configure for your database is the database name, and for how long you would like to keep the data inside of this database. Technically speaking, you get to choose the retention period for the short-term in-memory storage tier and for the long-term magnetic store. This distinction is crucial, as it highlights one of the main advantages of using Timestream over typical databases. Let\u2019s explain why.", "Imagine that you are managing a fleet of servers, and you need to provide a real-time dashboard that displays all relevant metrics with respect to memory and CPU utilization, etc. For this purpose, you are continuously feeding new measurements over time to your time-series database. Since you want to see only the \u201cfresh\u201d recently updated data for metrics collected within the last couple of hours, you don\u2019t need to keep the data from last month in memory \u2014 this would be a waste of expensive resources. At the same time, you likely don\u2019t want to throw this last week\u2019s data away because you may want to use it to analyze trends over time and detect anomalies that can only be detected when looking at a larger time window.", "We often call those recently updated, frequently accessed records hot data. In contrast, everything that happened a long time ago and that you access only for a few specific analytics and data science use cases is referred to as cold data [2]. Amazon Timestream allows you to store both within a single database, which is really useful. Before Timestream, in order to provide low-latency dashboards, you would usually have to cache the hot data in some in-memory data stores such as Redis, and the cold data would have to be stored in some other database that is able to handle large amounts of data without breaking the bank.", "Amazon Timestream manages the movement of data between memory and magnetic store automatically under the hood. Within our database, we can have many different tables. Then, per each table, we can specify how long we want to store this data in each storage tier \u2014 in the image below, we define that we want to keep the hot data for 24 hours in memory and, after that, move it to the long-term magnetic store.", "We don\u2019t need to guess in advance for how many years we want to store this data \u2014 we can easily edit this configuration later:", "The changes to the retention period apply immediately.", "Overall, the primary advantage is the fact that it\u2019s a serverless fully-managed database, and AWS takes care of scaling, monitoring, and maintaining the underlying storage and compute resources. Above that, high speed and low costs will likely play a large role in choosing the service over competing products.", "AWS puts an emphasis on security, therefore all data, both in transit and at rest, stored inside of Timestream is encrypted.", "Another advantage of the product is the SQL interface that allows retrieving data in a simple commonly-known query language. Apart from the SQL interface, there is also an SDK integration so that you can interact with the service via libraries such as Python boto3, and there is a JDBC connector that will let you query Timestream like a traditional relational database with SQL clients such as Datagrip.", "When it comes to writes, there is one feature that stands out \u2014 Timestream incorporates the \u201cfirst writer wins\u201d semantic, which automatically checks for duplicates when data gets written to the database. This way, if you try to write an identical record for the second time, Timestream will keep the first record and will discard the second write. This is particularly useful if you want to track changes over time, and if no change occurred, you wouldn\u2019t end up having thousands of identical rows.", "Despite all the benefits mentioned so far, my favorite feature is that this service has been specifically designed to easily manage common time-series operations \u2014 there are many useful functions to:", "On top of that, AWS offers a Grafana plugin (for Grafana version \u2265 7.1) and AWS Quicksight integration to build beautiful time-series dashboards.", "Overall, we can create many tables within each database. Each table can then store several records. A collection of records can build a time-series, as long as it has a timestamp column and at least one dimension, measurement name, and measurement value columns. The image below shows the relationship between table, time\u00a0series, dimensions, and measurements.", "In a table form, it could look as follows (in the image above you can see the third row):", "The table above was retrieved from the sample dataset provided by AWS with the following query:", "At the time of writing, the pricing is based on [3]:", "In the animation below, I demonstrate how to create a Timestream database and use the sample IoT table to experiment with the service. By using the sample queries provided by AWS, you can see how to perform on-the-fly aggregations with the bin(time_column, time_interval) syntax which downsamples the numerical data to the specified time interval \u2014 in the example below, it is one day (1d).", "Here is the sample query from the demo that shows how to use time-series functions:", "From the left sidebar, you can also go to Monitoring to view metrics such as the query request latency or the number of successful query results.", "There are three main points that you should consider before using Timestream for any production workloads.", "The last two limitations place emphasis on the thorough planning of your data model. Even though you don\u2019t need to specify the table structure with DDL because Timestream infers the columns during the data ingestion, it still pays off to think about it in advance.", "In this article, we looked at the main features of the recently released Amazon Timestream, which is a serverless time-series database. We investigated the benefits and limitations of the service, discussed the pricing, and showed how this database can be used to efficiently manage time-series data.", "To answer the question from the title: yes, this database seems to be worth giving it a try. From my perspective, the biggest advantage is the ability to store hot and cold data within a single system without having to move data around between in-memory databases for serving real-time dashboards and a centralized database for analytics workloads. On top of that, Timestream can speed up development due to the time series functionality that allows grouping by time and aggregation on the fly, interpolation of missing data, and integration with Grafana, SQL clients (via JDBC), and Python boto3 SDK.", "Overall, I\u2019m glad that AWS finally released the service because I work a lot with time-series data. I don\u2019t know why it had to take two years to be finally released, but knowing AWS, they likely wanted to further test and improve the service until working with it feels almost \u201cboring\u201d.", "Thank you for reading! I plan to create a follow-up article with a deep dive into specific features and a more in-depth review after having worked with the service with my own data \u2014 follow me to not miss it.", "Your home for data science.
