The most notable of them include Citi Bike NYC, Divvy, and Capital Bike Share.", "A much smaller player in this ecosystem is LA Metro bikes which started in 2016 and has logged up to 580,000 rides. Having previously been criticized for a $3.50 price per 30 minutes, they recently made headlines for a revamp of their pricing structure.", "Under this new structure, the price for each half hour has been cut 50% to $1.75. Furthermore, duration based passes are now cheaper as well.", "While this price change is rather drastic, were there any better pricing options available? Can optimization models in Python help shed some light on this? Shreenath Bhanderi and I set out to answer these questions.", "We start by pulling a year\u2019s worth of bike sharing data from the LA Metro data site. Before we get into optimization with PuLP however, we go through the usual data cleaning process.", "We see that there are over 286,000 rides over the past 4 quarters. The data also gives us information regarding which bikes were used, locations of start and end stations, and the length of each ride.", "As with most datasets, the dates are strings when read in. We run a quick pd.to_datetime function to convert the start_time and end_time columns into datetime objects.", "We use the missingno package to check for NA values in the dataframe. As the number of missing values seem almost negligible compared to the total number of observations, we drop the rows.", "We need more detailed information on the bike stations like number of docks and addresses. To do this, we download the json file from LA Metro which includes addresses and capacities of different bike stations.", "Parsing out the relevant fields, we obtain the kiosk_id to identify the station with in the main dataframe, address information, and number of docks at each station.", "We then merge this station data twice with the main dataframe, once for the starting station and once for the ending station.", "A quick look at missingno again indicates that there is about 20% of records with missing station information. As this is a sizable portion of the dataset, we can take a closer look to see how to deal with these missing values.", "As it might be a tedious effort to fill in all the information for the stations, let\u2019s first take a closer look at the descriptive statistics around the stations.", "The most common starting station was featured in 11,437 rides while the least common station was featured in only 6 rides. Should we only fill the stations above the mean of 2269 counts?", "With a median of 1544, it seems that 2269 counts might be too high. We will thus use the median of 1544 instead. Only stations above 1544 counts will have information filled in.", "A look at the average and median number of docks show that they are both around 22 and we can reasonably fill in the missing dock values with 22.", "By creating a mask and quick filter, we obtain a list of station id\u2019s that we can use to fill the dataframe with.", "With a mix of manual search and Google API, we obtain the following information about some missing stations.", "Filling in the extra station information with DataFrame.where, we take a look at the missingno matrix again.", "After dropping the last null values, we obtain a dataframe with 250,513 records. We have gained around 25,000 extra values after filling in some address details.", "Another topic of note was the utilization of the LA Metro bike fleet.", "While all the bikes have been active in the past year, around 1259 or around 86% of all bikes were used at least once in the past month. This seems like a relatively healthy number but actual utilization and inventory analysis will be conducted in the next part of this series.", "For now, we identify bikes inactive in the past 6 months and code them in an additional column as 0. Active bikes in the past month get a value of 1.", "The dataset also includes multiple categorical variables. Two that could be of particular interest later on are passholder type and trip category.", "Here we create dummy variable columns for both and join them to the main dataset.", "Given that the pricing system for LA Metro bikes is based on how many 30 minute blocks a user spends on the bike, an additional column will be coded that calculates the number of 30 minute blocks spent by each rider on a trip.", "Given that passholders get the first 30 minutes of their ride free, they would be charged for one less time block than the walk up riders.", "With the dataset largely cleaned and additional features added, we can get started on the optimization problem.", "The goal for this optimization is to maximize total revenue for LA Metro bikes. For this linear optimization, we will be utilizing the PuLP library.", "The two main sources of revenue are:", "LA Metro can look to increase its total revenue by changing its pricing structure or altering which plans it offers.", "LA Metro bikes recently implemented a new price structure as follows. The previous plans and current plans are as follows:", "To derive the appropriate price to demand relationship, a further demand model will have to be estimated. To factor in price and quantity relationships in optimization requires a quadratic formulation however. This is done in the next article with SciPy and CVXOPT.", "For a simple linear model, we seek to answer the two key questions:", "We will require an estimate of the number of passes sold in each pass type to estimate the total revenue. We begin by taking a look at some aggregate metrics:", "As we do not have unique identifiers for passholders, we refer to the data page of LA Metro bikes to find out how many passes have been sold.", "With roughly 575,281 trips completed and 42,870 passes sold since it\u2019s inception in July 2016, it would be safe to expect roughly 20,000 passes sold during the year-long period of this analysis.", "We will estimate the sales of each pass type from a breakeven perspective. What is the average number of trips needed to cover the price of a pass?", "As most trips (>60%) are \u201clast mile\u201d trips from metro stops and the median duration of trips is 12 minutes, we conduct the following breakeven analysis for trips under 30 minutes.", "By using an average of the current and previous price for ride fares and pass costs, we arrive at the following:", "Looking at the number of rides required of breakeven and assessing the numbers, the numbers seem to be on the low side.", "Daily pass holders are likely to perform more than a round trip if they were purchasing a day pass.", "Monthly pass holders are likely to be the occasional commuters and even at a conservative 2 rides/week to work would tally 8 rides a month.", "Annual pass holders are the hardest to gauge due to the low $40 price point of the flex point from the previous pricing plan. For now, they\u2019ll be scaled to the same factor as day and monthly pass numbers.", "Scaling daily passes up to a conservative 3 rides is a 50% increase in rides while scaling monthly rides up to a conservative 8 rides is a 40% increase. For conservative estimates, we scale the three estimates by a common factor of 40%.", "The estimated passes sold is thus calculated by dividing total rides in each pass type by average rides needed to breakeven, yielding the following:", "The total number of estimated passes sold during this period is around 23,833. This is roughly inline with our previous estimate of 20,000.", "Lets now formulate the objective function for this optimization model to maximum total revenue from pass sales and rides.", "The total revenue can be split into the following:", "A quick calculation can be run now to see what our current total revenue is with the estimated number of passes sold over the past year.", "The old pricing scheme is used here to estimate the price. Here, annual passholders pay $40 a year for a annual (Flex) pass and $1.75 for every half hour. The first half hour is not free.", "Now we can represent this objective function in PuLP.", "An easy-to-follow framework for linear programming in PuLP is as follows:", "To answer the two key questions we posed before, we will require two separate PuLP models. One incorporating the previous pricing structure and one incorporating the current pricing structure.", "1. Initiate the problem in PuLP", "Here we create an LpProblem in PuLP and set it to a maximization problem with pulp.LpMaximize.", "3 pairs of decision variables are created for a total of 6 binary variables. Each pair represents a yes and no decision for whether a pass type is implemented.", "For example month_yes represents that a monthly pass should be sold and month_no represents otherwise.", "Now we need to formulate the objective function for this optimization model with regards to total revenue.", "The granular breakdown of our current total revenue is as follows:", "With regards to the alternative pricing if a pass type was cancelled, we assume rides would be charged as walk-ups.", "Given that riders have already been complaining about the $3.50 per half hour block rate, any dropping of passes in the past pricing scheme would have led to a precipitous drop in ridership. Furthermore, given the fierce competition in the area of bike and scooter sharing, the dropping of certain passes could simply lead to riders moving to other competitors.", "We assume a baseline attrition of 30% for each category and adjust the parameters as we run the model.", "Representing each revenue stream in Python, we get the following:", "We then add this to the PuLP model.", "We then have to define additional constraints such that only one decision variable from each binary pair can and must be true.", "For example, the binary variables month_yes and month_no can represent either 0 or 1. The sum of these two variables cannot be either 0 or 2 as that would denote an impossibility of both a monthly plan being implemented and not implemented at the same time.", "We enforce this constraint by setting the sum to 1.", "Let\u2019s see what our model looks like now:", "Solving the model with model.solve(), we obtain the following solution:", "The above solution can be understood as such:", "This conclusion is reached with a 30% attrition rate should any passes be cancelled. The reality is that attrition rate would vary across different passes.", "For example, those holding annual passes would be much less likely to attrit as they are likely the ones who require the use of the bikes the most.", "After adjusting some parameters and attrition rates, we arrive at the following:", "Total revenue at these edge attrition rates yield us an optimized $ 1,136,357 total revenue.", "These high attrition rates make sense due to the high price of $ 3.50 that LA Metro had been charging previously. Had attrition been assumed at 30% and LA Metro cancelled monthly plans, they would been able gain revenue by charging the remaining 70% of riders walk-up rates.", "Let\u2019s now repeat the same scheme for the current pricing where rates have been halved.", "As the new annual pricing scheme is completely separate from the previous annual (flex) pass and are listed separately in the data , we maintain the $ 40 annual pass price. The current $ 150 price is factored into later optimizations.", "Given the drastic measure of slashing half hour rates by half to $ 1.75, it is unlikely for attrition to be as high should any plan be cancelled.", "Furthermore, the current optimum solution suggests that even if there was no attrition and we could charge every pass holder by the walk-up price, the daily and monthly passes should be kept.", "The annual plan, on the other hand, should only be kept if more than 25% of annual pass holders attrit upon a plan cancellation. Given that annual pass holders are the least likely to attrit as they probably do require the service for commuting if they paid for the pass, LA Metro\u2019s recent decision to axe this annual (Flex) plan could well be the right move.", "While PuLP can only handle simple linear optimizations, there are many other powerful libraries out there such as CVXPY, IPOPT, and SciPy.", "In the next article, I tackle a quadratic optimization problem with some demand curve estimations to look at other pricing schemes for LA Metro bikes.", "Thanks for reading and feel free to check out the notebook on
