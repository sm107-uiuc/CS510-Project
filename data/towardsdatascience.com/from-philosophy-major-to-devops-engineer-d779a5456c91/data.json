Those on my team with STEM degrees often tell me it's an advantage to have a non-STEM degree. But the path to becoming a DevOps Engineer wasn\u2019t a short one, and I made mistakes along the way. Many reach out to learn how I navigated the bizarre path from philosophy degree to DevOps Engineer. This article will shed some light on how I did it. In short, it was a little bit of luck, significant family support, and a lot of hard work and patience. But first, a story.", "I was working at Oracle as a Cloud Engineer when my manager asked if I could do some recruiting at UCSD, my alma mater. When I arrived, the line to enter the UCSD Tech Job Fair was long. I met with such a diverse range of students. Some handed me a resume with a 4.0 Computer Science GPA but couldn\u2019t communicate a coherent thought and others that couldn\u2019t output \u201chello world\u201d in any programming language.", "But I remember one student in particular. She was a non-STEM major with some interesting technical projects. When she handed me her resume I could tell she was self-conscious, worried about how I might perceive her skillset or lack thereof. Before I could even ask a question she began defending her resume. I said, \u201cHey, I get you\u201d. When I told her that I graduated from UCSD in philosophy her eyes lit up. We later connected on LinkedIn. I gave her some advice and encouraged her to continue.", "I graduated from UCSD with an undergraduate degree in philosophy. Honestly, I had no idea what I was doing. I majored in philosophy as a double major so that I could continue my work with this Voter Registration Organization that I helped start called SOVAC. Upon reflection adding a philosophy major to continue working on SOVAC was a ridiculous reason to stay an extra year in college. My dedication to my student org was getting in the way of my future. When I graduated I realized I had no marketable skills. Luckily, right before I graduated I was awarded a National Science Foundation (NSF) grant to work on a passion project.", "The NSF grant gave me just enough money to survive, but I knew it wouldn\u2019t last. The grant snowballed into a company I started with one of my friends from college. We built an online polling service and signed a paying customer, The San Diego Union-Tribune. Having an idea, turning an idea into a product, and selling it to a paying customer flipped a switch. I knew there was something here. I caught the tech bug.", "I eventually got a full-time job working as a consultant for a good government non-profit, but my mind was entrenched in the NSF work and eventual company I started. My college friend who helped build the product was eventually offered a Software Engineering job with Facebook. He, like me, was a non-STEM major but before graduating decided to pursue computer science and become a Software Engineer. I no longer had the luxury of changing my mind in college. I was already in the real world working as a non-profit consultant. Could I turn back?", "I remember getting a call from my manager at the time about whether I wanted to become a full-time employee and a member of the staff. Again, I had no real plan and declined. In hindsight, I probably should have pursued a full-time job to keep my options open. Maybe I could have worked during the day and took night classes, but I didn\u2019t think that far. I just knew I wanted to get into tech.", "At the time Bootcamps were beginning to gain a lot of traction. But I decided to get my feet wet with an intro to Java class at a community college. I was already working full-time so this class was a pretty big commitment of my time. I quickly realized that I had a passion for programming. What excited me most was being able to build applications with what little I learned. It was at this time that I decided to go back to school for computer science.", "I decided to enroll as a computer science graduate student because I wanted to understand the fundamentals and have a document that validates the skills I developed. I spent far too much time preparing for the GREs. In the end, I enrolled in a program that didn\u2019t even require a GRE score. I realized that undergraduate courses are about the same no matter where you go. It didn\u2019t really matter where I attended concerning the coursework.", "Getting a degree amounted to job security. Many told me getting a degree was a waste of time, and I could learn whatever I needed to get a job. This is true to an extent. Reflecting now, it\u2019s hard to say what would have been the better path. I think the faster path is enrolling in a Bootcamp or simply taking some online courses in data structure and basic programming. But I thought getting a degree was safer though much slower. The fact is that a computer science degree does not guarantee anything.", "After about a year and a half into my master\u2019s degree, I started getting antsy. I wanted a job. By this time, I had completed almost all of the undergraduate coursework required for a computer science degree. I looked at some of the masters level coursework and felt the advanced coursework wouldn\u2019t amount to much. I just wanted a job and the experience. I didn\u2019t want to take out more loans and spend more time completing a degree. I simply started applying for everything under the sun. I bombed a few interviews. I was clearly rusty. Eventually, I landed a job interview with Oracle as a Cloud Engineer. Honestly, I had no idea what cloud was or that Oracle even had a cloud service. I didn\u2019t even know what a cloud engineer did.", "I prepared and thought I failed the job interview, but I was surprisingly given an offer. I was excited about getting my foot into the door. Reflecting on it now, I think my time was better spent working at Oracle than finishing my masters. At the same time, I don\u2019t have a degree which, I argued earlier, would give some job security and document my skillset. But now I have experience working as a tech engineer which some might argue is better than a degree. Although in the long run, it might be more advantageous to have a degree. In any case, it is my long term goal to eventually complete my degree and maybe get an MBA.", "I recently accepted a job offer to work at OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) as a DevOps Engineer which made me reflect and motivated me to write this article. If someone like me could get here, anyone can. I can appreciate the progress I have made, but I still have a ways to go. Frankly, deciding to pursue computer science, engineering, and a job in tech is a life-long commitment to learning. The tech ecosystem is vast. Technology is always changing. There is some new paradigm being formed as we speak. Anyone who chooses this life must be willing and interested to keep up.", "Many ask me what I would have done differently, and I have mixed advice depending on who is asking. But I will do my best to inform the tenacious twenty-something-year-old me deciding I wanted to change paths.", "I would take courses in basic programming (in C++, not Python), data structure, and algorithms either online or in-person (at a community college or somewhere to ask questions). Then I would read \u201ccracking the coding interview\u201d, do a bunch of Leetcode questions (in Python), work on some small projects, and apply for software engineering internships. The biggest question is how long would it take before getting an offer?", "I have some friends that graduated with CS degrees and it still took them 1 year to land a tech job. Having a computer science degree doesn\u2019t necessarily convince employers to offer you a position. You must prove yourself. Working on projects help. This means publishing code to Github showing consistent commits. The more you can show interest in the field, the more confident the recruiter or hiring manager will be to invest in you. Because ultimately the recruiting process amounts to risk mitigation. The more you show, the less risky their decision to employ you.", "The good thing about enrolling in a graduate program or even Bootcamp is that you are surrounded by people that have the same objectives as you. You can learn how they pursue those goals, exchange notes, and build a network. I still keep in touch with my former peers. One thing I regret is not taking advantage of friends who were already working in tech. I should have reached out more and perhaps asked for an interview. Don\u2019t be prideful. Accept help when it\u2019s offered. And when you\u2019ve achieved some success, pass it forward. In the end, It takes a village. Very few succeed on their own. You are unlikely to be the exception.", "Tech is hard. Imposter syndrome is rampant. Everyone at one point or another feels the burden of calling themselves an engineer. Just remember that you are not alone. The path to success is fraught with failure and disappointment. Sometimes I let the fear of failure paralyze me. Deep down I was worried that I might give up if I bombed an interview. Maybe I would be so discouraged from the engineer\u2019s feedback that I would stop trying. But after each failed interview I learned so much about myself. I was invigorated because I felt closer to getting an offer. After each interview, I began to realize what mattered and focused my effort.", "Your home for data science.
