The upside of that and the intervention of neural models into NLP is, it has pushed the envelope in a lot of tasks but the downside is it has complicated the learning scene for the newcomers who are trying to break into the field. I feel obligated to bring some clarity by sharing the mental model I use to reason about NLP based prediction tasks. As promised in the title, I have tried to convey everything I wanted to convey in a single diagram, please consider this mental model as a compass and not as a map. That being said please note this post is not for absolute beginners.", "Before diving into the meat of this post, allow me to set the context, clarify a couple of terminology nuances and scope of the coverage.", "A quick note on the terminology that will be used in the mental model.", "I have deliberately used \u201cwords\u201d instead of \u201ctexts\u201d or \u201ccharacters\u201d or \u201cphrases\u201d as the tactical unit in the mental model below for easier understanding because A. Language is compositional and words are the lowest tactical unit that comes with a variety of combinations (when compared to characters or anything else) and B: Most of the NLP literature uses \u201cwords\u201d as the default choice when discussing NLP problems and solutions. Word N-grams could mean 1 word (1-gram or unigram when N=1), a word pair (or bigram, when N=2) and so on. Same applies to char N-grams.", "While we know that in machine learning \u201cembedding\u201d is a fancy way to say, a technique that takes raw text data and \u201cembeds\u201d it into a vector space. Because machine learning algorithms are \u201chappiest\u201d when presented training data in a vector space. The reasons are not surprising: we can do vector math or calculate the distance between the vectors and so on. (courtesy: Prof.Sridhar Mahadevan, from Quora.com)", "But to take it to another level, learning an embedding is nothing but learning a representation of the underlying text corpus. Word-embeddings are a context-independent embedding or representation (here context means pragmatic context and not semantic context) and language models like ELMo, BERT learn a context-dependent embedding or representation. Check this Google BERT post for more deeper insights.", "\u201cA word is characterized by the company it keeps\u201d \u2014 J.R.Firth", "Semantic context is well-documented concept, but here is a quick recap of it. Language is symbolic: the words hamburger and milkshake are semantically related as \u201cfood items\u201d only for humans, but we need a technique to feed that knowledge to machines. The distributional hypothesis loosely states words occurring in a similar context tends to have similar meanings. So it's fair to think hamburger and milkshake typically occur in a context of food in text corpora. This is called the semantic context and algorithms need ways to figure out the notion of semantic relatedness.", "Semantic context ignores all the pragmatic contexts. Now, what do I mean by that? Let\u2019s consider this example: \u201cHe went to the prison cell with his cell phone to extract blood cell samples from inmates\u201d (courtesy: Ajit Rajasekharan, from Quora.com). An embedding that takes into account both semantic and pragmatic context would generate different vectors for the three vectors for the cell. The first cell (prison cell case), for instance, would be closer to words like incarceration, crime, etc. whereas the second \u201ccell\u201d (phone case) would be closer to words like iPhone, android, galaxy, etc..", "This mental model covers all NLP based prediction tasks that can be framed as N:1 supervised learning task i.e. Input is a text sequence of arbitrary length (N) and output is a label or score.", "This mental model does not cover NLP based tasks that take the form of N: N or N: M supervised learning tasks where input and output are text sequence of arbitrary length(N) or input and output text sequence of arbitrary length N and M respectively. e.g., the best example for N: N is sequence tagging (NER, POS), automatic speech recognition and canonical example of N: M would be machine translation and text summarization.", "If you look closely, I have deliberately omitted data cleansing and preparation as they are very domain and task-specific. So when you are applying this mental model, make sure you are injecting the appropriate data cleansing and preparation techniques at the right time.", "You can see that with smaller datasets classic ML worked well, but they faded away with larger datasets.", "Your home for data science.
