But generally, those tutorials do not mention much about how to maintain the quality of predictions generated from the ML systems.", "Maintaining the predictive power of the deployed model is deemed to be more difficult than building the ML model from scratch and hence is our topic of discussion today.", "But before starting with the details of \u201cmodel retraining\u201d, let\u2019s have a quick primer on \u201cmodel training\u201d first:", "Now, lets put more emphasis on what we mean by \u2014 \u2018as long as possible\u2019?", "It never happens that the final ML model deployed once takes away the worries forever and keeps giving accurate predictions.", "Why is that? Lets figure out below:", "To understand this, let us recall one of the most critical assumptions in ML modelling \u2014 train and test dataset should belong to similar distribution. And, the model will be good if the new data is similar to the data observed in the past on which the model was trained on.", "So, we understand that if test data distribution deviates from that of train data, the model will not hold good. But what could be the possible reasons for such deviation. Well, it can be attributed to many reasons depending on the business case, e.g. change in consumer preferences, fast moving competitive space, geographic shift, economic conditions etc.", "Hence, the drifting data distribution calls for an ongoing process of periodically checking the validity of old model. In short, it is critical to keep your machine learning model updated; but the key is when? We will discuss this and a lot more as we proceed, so stay tuned.", "People/entities that get affected by the outcome of the ML models may deliberately alter their response in order to send spurious input to the model, thereby escaping the impact of the model predictions. For example, the models such as fraud detection, cyber-security etc receive manipulated and distorted inputs which cause model to output misclassified predictions. Such type of adversaries also drives down the model performance.", "3. When ground truth is not available at the time of model training", "In most of the machine learning models, the ground truth labels are not available to train the model. For example, target variable which captures the response of the end user is not known. In that case, your best bet could be to mock the user action based on certain set of rules coming from business understanding or leverage the open source dataset to initiate model training. But, this model might not necessarily represent the actual data and hence will not perform well until a burn-in period where it starts picking (aka learning) the true actions of the end user.", "What all comes under the scope of model retraining?", "Ideally, retraining involves running the entire existing pipeline with new data, that\u2019s it. It does not involve any code changes or re-building the pipeline.", "However, if you end up exploring a new algorithm or a feature which might not have been available at the time of previous model training, then incorporating these while deploying the retrained model will further improve the model accuracy.", "How to measure the decline in model performance?", "Under the assumption that the predictions are stored and mapped with the ground truth values, the decline (or not) is calculated on a continuous basis to assess the drift.", "But what if the prediction horizon is farther into the future and we can\u2019t wait till the ground truth label is observed to assess the model goodness. Well, in that case, we can roughly estimate the retraining window from back-testing. This involves using the ground truth labels and predictions from the historical data to estimate the time frame around which the accuracy begins to taper off.", "Effectively, the whole exercise of finding the model drift boils down to inferring whether the two data sets (training and test) are coming from the same distribution, or if the performance has fallen below acceptable range.", "Lets look at some of the ways to assess the distribution drift:", "How much new data should be collected before retraining?", "Should it be \u2019n\u2019 rows in and \u2019n\u2019 rows out? Or, should we keep adding the new data without removing older data. What is a good mix? Well, there is \u201cno one solution fits all\u201d answer to this, but largely it depends upon the following factors:", "Your home for data science.
