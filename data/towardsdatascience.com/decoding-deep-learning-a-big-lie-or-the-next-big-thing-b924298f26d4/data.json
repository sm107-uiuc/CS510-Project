With a multitude of analytics technologies projected as the panacea to business\u2019 problems, one wonders what this additional \u2018cool thing\u2019 is all about.", "For people on the business side of things, there are no easy avenues to get a simple and intuitive understanding. A Google search gets one entangled in the deep layers of neural networks, or gets them bowled over by the math symbols. Online courses on the subject haunt one with a bevy of stats terms.", "One eventually gives in and ends up taking all of the hype at face value. Here\u2019s an attempt to demystify and democratize the understanding of deep learning (DL), in simple english and in under 5 minutes. I promise not to show you the cliched pictures of human brains, or a spider web of networks :-)", "Let\u2019s start with the basic premise of machine learning (ML). The attempt is to teach machines on how to get to a desired outcome, when presented with some input. Say, when shown the past 6 month\u2019s stock prices, predict tomorrow\u2019s value. Or, when presented with a face, identify the person.", "The machine learns how to do things like this, obviating the need for laborious instructions every time.", "Deep learning is just a disciple (or, discipline) of machine learning, but with a higher IQ. It does the same thing as above, but in a much smarter way.", "Let me explain this by using a simple example of face detection.", "Traditional face recognition using machine learning involves first manually identifying noticeable features on a human face (such as eyes, eyebrows, chin). Then, a machine is trained to associate every known face with these specific features. Now show a new face, and the machine extracts these preset features and does a comparison to get the best match. This works moderately.", "Now, how does deep learning solve the same problem? The process is nearly the same, but remember this student is smarter. So, instead of spoon-feeding standard facial features, you let the model creatively figure out what to notice. It may decide that the most striking feature in human faces is the curvature on the left cheek, or how flat a forehead is. Or, perhaps something even subtler.", "It silently figures out this connection between the input (face) and output (name), when shown tons of such pairs. Then, when presented with a new face, voila it gets it right magically. Compared to earlier recognition techniques, DL hits the ball way out of the park, in both accuracy and speed.", "To be fair, there is a connection.", "Lets review how a child learns the first lessons. You show flash cards with the picture of an elephant, and read it out aloud. After a few such instances, when the baby looks at any semblance of an elephant, she identifies it instantly. Irrespective of the pose, color or context. We didn\u2019t teach her about the trunk, tusk or shape of ears, but she learnt it in totality. And she just gets it.", "Just as we are unsure how the baby learnt to identify what makes up an elephant, we really don\u2019t know how neural networks, the technology behind deep learning figures this out. This is where all similarities to the human brain and neural connections spring up, but I\u2019ll stop here and save you the hassle.", "It suffices to know that deep learning is insanely smart at automatically identifying the most distinguishing signals (features) in any given data (face). In other words, it is a master at feature extraction. When given tons of input-output pairs, it identifies what to learn and how to learn it.", "Deep learning figures out the strongest pattern in any presented entity \u2014 a face, voice or even a table of numbers.", "Inspite of the stellar advances in machine learning, the biggest challenge facing the discipline has been\u2026 you guessed it right, feature extraction. Data scientists spend sleepless nights discovering connections between an input (a hundred factors of customer behavior) and output (customer churn). Then the machines conveniently learn from them.", "So, the difference between top accuracy and poor results is the identification of best features. Now, thanks to deep learning, if machines can do this heavy lifting as well automatically, won\u2019t it be neat?", "Deep learning can be applied anywhere there is a fitment for machine learning. It can comfortably thrash problems with structured data, an area where traditional algorithms reign supreme. Based on what we\u2019ve seen, it can crash the learning cycles, and push accuracy to dizzying levels.", "But the biggest bang for buck is in those areas where ML is still stuttering without a brisk start. Take the case of images, video, audio or deeper meaning from plain old text. Deep learning has crushed problems with such data types that need machines to identify, classify or predict. Lets look at a few.", "Well, the biggest advantage of deep learning is really its shortcoming. The very fact that humans don\u2019t have to identify distinguishing features means that the machine defines what it deems important. We humans are creatures of reason, and we have trouble with anything that doesn\u2019t fit a mould.", "Trouble brews in this paradise when one tries interpreting the meaning of machine identified features, or attempts to transparently explain why a machine\u2019s decision must be implemented. After all, how comfortable is a business decision maker to bet millions, or worse place lives of people at the altar of cryptic, but accurate recommendations by a tool, invented years ago?", "Interpretability of deep learning algorithms and visual explanation of results is a rapidly evolving field, and research is fast catching up. And yes, it needs tons of data to even get started. So yes, there are some hiccups in this area, but the stellar and stable results clearly outweigh the cons, for now.", "So, that\u2019s deep learning in a nut shell.
