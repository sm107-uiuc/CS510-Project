It can often be difficult to get the accuracy of your model up to a comfortable 98\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Machine-learning is a complicated and diverse topic that can certainly seem daunting to newer Data-Scientists. It can often be difficult to get the accuracy of your model up to a comfortable 98 percent, and beginners can certainly struggle substantially in trying to make their models more accurate. Fortunately for most Data-Scientists, there are tons of things you can do to potentially mitigate such an issue, and as a result sometimes finding the way to high accuracy is more involving of finding out what your model needs your data to look like coming into it.", "One of the easiest and most effective ways to boost accuracy when working with a continuous model is by scaling the model\u2019s features. There are several different types of feature scalers in existence, some of which might not even be beneficial to machine-learning. The most important of these scalars is most likely the standard scaler. The standard scaler, z-score scaler, or normal scaler uses a normal distribution to normalize the data. This boosts accuracy because numbers that stray away from the normal\u2019s impact is reduced compared to what it would normally be. What is great about that is that you don\u2019t end up losing the data, but still it ends up being valuable for your accuracy. There are two others that might be used in machine learning, mean normalization and scaling to unit length. However, typically these aren\u2019t as well-used and in most situations, you will be better off going with a standard scaler instead.", "In order to calculate a normal distribution, we will take each number in an array of numbers and subtract it by the average before dividing it by the standard deviation. In code, that would look a little something like this:", "And we will get some numbers that look something like this:", "It\u2019s safe to assume that the average of this array is 13.5, so 13.5 is actually equal to 0 on our normal distribution. This is a bit misleading, however, because if we were to have 13.5 in our data it would shift the zero in the distribution.", "Another scaler that you could potentially run into is a MeanNormalizer. In order to normalize data based on the mean, we subtract each sample by the average and then divide it by the minimum value minus the maximum value. In code, this would look something like this:", "Notice the slight difference in the results:", "Another incredibly easy and surprisingly way to easily boost a model\u2019s accuracy is to get rid of any outliers in your data. There are several ways to go about removing outliers from your data, one great way of doing so is using the z-score. Another way to do this will involve getting rid of any values above the third quartile of your data. The reason why we do this is because these values can, of course, affect our mathematical representation of the data like the mean or standard deviation. This could almost certainly cause the model, which likely works off of values like the mean and standard deviation, to predict low or high, depending on where your stray data is.", "The easiest way to remove outliers from data like this is to replace any values that are problematic with the mean. To start, we will get the third quartile of the data. Alternatively, you could get the mean of all of the data above the mean.", "For this example, we will be switching over to Python. I will be using both languages in this article as they are both rather similar, and using both in conjunction will make it more accessible to developers on both sides of the spectrum. Consider the following DataFrame:", "If we were to fit a model to this data, whichever column we decided to use for our feature would have some pretty radical outliers in it, which would certainly cause some problems for us in the future. In order to remove them, we will grab z_score from scipy.stats and use a conditional mask to filter the values that don\u2019t adhere to a conditional to hold down values radically above the center of our normal distribution:", "Now if we show new_df, we can see that our outliers are gone!", "Another great way to easily boost your accuracy by modifying data is by removing bad features. It\u2019s all too common \u2014 you have the correct model, but not the correct data. Although a lot of times some features might seem important, they might not necessarily be so. There are often features that might not even be improving your score at all, as a matter of a fact, they could even be making your accuracy worse. So bad features are certainly something to watch out for!", "But how can you avoid them?", "The best way to avoid using a bad feature in your model is to use statistical testing to measure how statistically significant that feature is to your target. Another great way to do this is to get your feature importances, which might be a bit more difficult in certain situations, but when it isn\u2019t will certainly be a much easier way than statistical testing.", "One of the most widely used pre-processing methods for machine-learning with categorical variables is probably a one hot encoder. A one hot coder takes your data and turns it into true or false binary batches across all of the categories in a given column. The one hot encoder is incredibly useful because of its ability to turn categorical features into numerical data that can be easily analyzed by a mathematical algorithm.", "While one hot encoding is great, in a lot of circumstances an ordinal encoder will give you far better accuracy. Ordinal encoding essentially involves mapping unique labels to integer values. Another encoder that might be of use as well is a label encoder.", "One of the more difficult solutions you could approach to solving a problem like this is feature engineering. Feature engineering allows you to create a new features from the ones available to you to produce better accuracy. Although feature engineering might be hard to do sometimes, it can certainly create great accuracy a lot of the time, and will definitely be a beneficial investment in the long run if the features are significant.", "One thing that I think is slightly underrated in the field is the power of sample boosting and bootstrap aggregating. This is probably one of the most common ways that Data Scientists boost their accuracy.", "Bootstrap aggregating, also called bagging, is an ensemble meta-algorithm. A great thing about using bootstrap aggregating is that it also reduces the variance of your data, which makes it far less prone to bias problems like over-fitting. Boosting on the other-hand usually involves using lots of models to solve a single problem together. It also reduces the variance and can help to reduce bias and prevent overfitting.", "Although Data Science is certainly a hard subject that will require you to learn more and more as you continue to engage with it, there are some rather simple and easy things that you can do to make your models better and create better algorithms overall. Not only are these incredibly easy, but a lot of them can raise your accuracy by more than 10-percent. Needless to say, using these methods is certainly a great idea!", "Your home for data science.
