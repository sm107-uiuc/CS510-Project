Their interactivity, sense of \u201crealness,\u201d and dynamic responsiveness have made them incredibly popular. Right now, it is estimated that over 300,000 chatbots exist on Facebook Messenger alone which interacted with some 1.4 billion people in 2018 alone.", "Unlike websites, which only reside at a given URL (internet address), chatbots are designed to \u201clive\u201d on multiple platforms. For example, the same chatbot can exist on both a dedicated Facebook Messenger channel as well as a pop-up on a website. After Facebook opened up its Messenger platform to chatbots in 2016, almost all of the other popular messaging apps did as well, including Skype, Whatsapp, Kik, Twitter, Viber, and WeChat.", "Chatbots and their close cousins, voice assistants, can also be accessed via Amazon\u2019s popular series of \u201csmart speakers\u201d as well as Google\u2019s Home devices and Android mobile phones and tablets. Most people are familiar with voice assistants such as Siri, Alexa, and Cortana, but these rely on billion-dollar artificial intelligence engines to perform their functions. Most voice assistant \u201cchatbots\u201d are much simpler in scope such as Hound, which allows you to call for an Uber or access your personalized news feed on NPR, Lyra, that allows you hands-free access to your calendar or one of your music playlists, and Butleroy, which helps you intelligently respond to meeting and scheduling requests.", "With its early lead, Facebook remains the most popular \u201chome\u201d for chatbots, including both \u201cbuttons-based\u201d chatbots and those that are voice-activated. Currently, most of these chatbots serve a business purpose, and it is estimated that some 80% of businesses will be using chatbots by 2020. Even banks, traditionally the slowest to adopt to new technologies, are expected to offer their services via chatbot by 2020. Right now, however, the primary business use case for chatbots is for marketing purposes such as lead generation, lead qualification, and sales funnels or for providing customer service, particularly answering frequently asked questions and providing basic information such as your business\u2019s address, phone number, and hours of operation.", "Facebook has strongly encouraged the use of chatbots. Facebook\u2019s advertising arm allows you to purchase ads that click through directly to a chatbot. And considering that the chatbot conversion rates are significantly higher than traditional mediums such as email or direct marketing, it\u2019s no wonder that so many businesses are adopting chatbots. Chatbots can also be used for e-commerce purposes, allowing users to buy items directly from inside the chatbot. At least a third of all adults in countries like the United States have expressed a willingness to buy directly from a chatbot, and that number is only expected to grow.", "In addition to running directly on Facebook\u2019s Messenger app, Facebook allows for chatbots to \u201clive\u201d directly on a Facebook Page. This allows businesses to reach their customers wherever they are, whether it\u2019s directly one-on-one via the Messenger app or by leaving a comment on the business\u2019s Facebook Page. In the past two years, Facebook has significantly upgraded a chatbot\u2019s ability to provide this multichannel response, giving chatbots increased power and scope. And since chatbots work 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, they are \u201calways on\u201d and able to reach customers no matter where \u2014 or when \u2014 they are online.", "But while chatbots are designed to seamlessly operate on Facebook, the underlying code doesn\u2019t actually exist anywhere on Facebook\u2019s platform. To get a chatbot up and running on Facebook, you either need to host and code it yourself or else use one of the popular chatbot frameworks that offer such services such as Chatfuel or Manychat. Designed for chatbot builders who don\u2019t know how to code or simply want to avoid the expense and time necessary to write code, these platforms offer everyone the ability to create a chatbot quickly and easily.", "Founded in 2015 and originally designed to run on Telegram (then the only messaging app that allowed chatbots), Chatfuel now exclusively powers Facebook chatbots. With an intuitive drag-and-drop building system, anyone can create a chatbot and get it up and running on Facebook in just a matter of minutes. Chatfuel offers a free tier that allows your chatbot to interact with up to 5,000 users, more than enough to play around with all of its capabilities before needing to upgrade to a paid subscription plan. Chatfuel, Manychat, Mobile Monkey and their literally hundreds of competitors offer free templates that you can easily modify to suit your needs.", "For chatbot creators who know a little coding, more powerful chatbot frameworks exist, the most popular of which are Google\u2019s DialogFlow, IBM\u2019s Watson, and Microsoft\u2019s Bot Framework. While the downside is that they require a lot more technical know-how to get a chatbot up and running, these frameworks generally allow more integrations or the ability to plug the same chatbot into numerous channels, including social messaging apps, websites, inside of mobile apps, and even via phone text messaging services like Twilio.", "Whether it\u2019s a drag-and-drop interface like Chatfuel or a hands-on coding framework like DialogFlow, chatbots rely on something called APIs in order to deliver richer, more dynamic experiences. API is a protocol that allows for information to be exchanged between different websites or internet services. For example, a chatbot that recommends nearby restaurants might use Google Maps\u2019 API to find nearby restaurants to your current location and cross-index it with Yelp\u2019s API to find the top-rated restaurants in the area. And since API requests must be coded precisely in order to work, this leaves most advanced chatbots too complex for most people to create.", "But there\u2019s a lot more to chatbots than simply business applications. Some of the most popular chatbots offer services such as providing tailored weather forecasts or playing games such as trivia quizzes. One of the most interesting emerging uses for chatbots is serving as a personal avatar. Instead of serving as the \u201cface\u201d of a business or as an anonymous service that can play a game or provide information, the future of chatbots is as a stand-in for individual people.", "One such company taking advantage of this new trend is AIBRO. Although only available in beta form right now, AIBRO plans to offer individual users the ability to create no-code chatbots to stand in as their personal avatar. Imagine having a chatbot that knows the difference between your friends, family, and colleagues and is able to have an intelligent conversation with all of them simultaneously based on your own, unique inputs.", "Concurrently with the surge in mobile phone ownership is a phenomenon known as FOMO or \u201cFear of Missing Out.\u201d Since there\u2019s always something interesting happening somewhere, there\u2019s no possible way that an individual person can ever keep up, leading to anxiety pangs of FOMO on something. And now that people can be reached 24 hours a day no matter where they are, many people are, likewise, expected to always respond. Furthermore, people are expected to respond to all messages, regardless of their priority, from absolutely everyone.", "AIBRO\u2019s mission is to allow individuals the ability to not have to worry about FOMO while also being able to respond to messages when it is most convenient. Furthermore, since not all messages have the same priority \u2014 i.e. some may be considered spam, low-priority, or from people that you just don\u2019t want to respond to at the moment \u2014 AIBRO\u2019s chatbot will allow individuals to automatically reply to these messages while filtering out higher priority messages that require an individual touch. In other words, AIBRO\u2019s chatbot will allow you to automatically respond to your annoying uncle or a spammy business hounding you to sign up for their services while letting you manually respond to something more high priority like a message from your mother or a current love interest.", "In the near future, it\u2019s likely that everyone will have a personal chatbot that can intelligently respond to messages. For a potential employer, a personal chatbot can respond with the user\u2019s resume (CV) and answer questions about the user\u2019s experience and skill level. For family members and close friends, a personal chatbot will be able to respond with status updates. And personal chatbots will be able to filter out spam messages or anything else considered annoying that doesn\u2019t quite rise to the level of an outright block or mute. The personal chatbot will become a \u201csecond you,\u201d allowing you to efficiently and conveniently manage your online presence when you can\u2019t or aren\u2019t willing to be online.", "Despite their rising popularity across every online medium, the future of chatbots is only beginning. One can imagine a world in which your own personal chatbot can interact not just with business chatbots but with other people\u2019s personal chatbots as well. Chatbots will help learn your personal preferences, bring you news and information that is precisely tailored to you, and allow you to communicate more easily with other people. Chatbots, in short, will soon help you reduce the need to always be online, bringing you exactly the information (including personal messages) that you want \u2014 and when you want it. In a few short years, the question won\u2019t be if you have a personal chatbot but how you ever managed to live without one.", "Your home for data science.
