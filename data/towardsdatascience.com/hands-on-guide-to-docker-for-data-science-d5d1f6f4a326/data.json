Docker lets you separate and isolate applications as you develop them. As a data scientist, it is common to rely on virtual environment libraries like pyenvor virtualenv \u2014 but using Docker can unlock you to not just prototype but build production-grade applications. While virtual environments are excellent for quick dev work, Docker provides a great way for collaborating with colleagues and to also deploy data science applications in cloud. In this blog we will cover the Docker fundamentals you need to know for data science and machine learning development.", "There are many resources to learn about Docker, but when I was first starting out, I wanted a small tutorial that got me working with a Dockerfile quickly rather than go through a lot of theory. My hope with this blog is to be that tutorial. Anyways, let\u2019s get started.", "Here are a few reasons why Docker is great for data science applications:", "To get started, download Docker from here for Windows, Linux or Mac. Also, create an account at Docker Hub: hub.docker.com \u2014 Docker Hub is like Github where you can publish and use other people\u2019s images. For example \u2014 you can see a bunch of Python images here. Usually, you begin with an image from Docker Hub and build on top of it for your own specific requirements.", "As this is a hands-on guide, let\u2019s start by first creating a Dockerfile. You can choose to either work with an existing project or create a new project folder. We will go through a workflow with scripting mode. If you prefer working with Jupyter notebooks, we will cover them in separate section in the end.", "Dockerfile is a text file that contains all the commands needed to build a Docker image. A Docker image is built from a series of layers. Each layer represents an instruction in the image\u2019s Dockerfile. Anytime a layer changes in a Dockerfile, when you rebuild the image, all layers after that changed layer are re-built. Let\u2019s write our Dockerfile! Create a new Dockerfile using vim Dockerfile with:", "Here we are doing the following steps: 1. Building from Docker Hub\u2019s Python 3.8 Slim Buster image. There are many images available from Python officially. Slim Buster image is a good trade-off on size, performance and features for most cases. Read more here. 2. Creating a new app folder inside Docker container. Making app as our work folder \u2014 by default this will be location of all our commands from this point on. 4. Running pip install to download the libraries we need for our project. These are all the common libraries needed for machine learning project such as Numpy and Pandas for data exploration, Scikit-Learn for data scaling, shallow modeling, feature selection and metrics, TensorFlow for deep learning models, and finally, Seaborn for data visualizations.5. Copying our local files in the current directory into app directory.", "A Docker image is a read-only template file that contains the source code, libraries, dependencies, tools, and other files needed for an application to run. It is built with a set of layers. The basic idea of a docker command from the Command Line is:", "Important commands to know for Docker images is:", "As per above, let us now run docker image build -t hello . inside the folder with the Dockerfile. It will show something several steps of installation of all the libraries and their dependencies. Finally, it will show:", "If we only wanted Python 3.8 image without the additional commands we could run: docker image pull python:3.8-slim-buster", "Docker Container are running instances of Docker Images \u2014 containers run the actual applications. Container includes an application and all of its dependencies. Container shares the kernel with other containers, and runs as an isolated process on the host OS. Images can exist without containers, whereas a container needs to run an image to exist. You can have many running containers from the same image. Important commands to know:", "Now you want to run the Docker image you have built,", "If we only to run a few bash commands inside a Python 3.8 container we could run: docker container run -it python:3.8-slim-buster bash", "The following image helps illustrate the difference between a Dockerfile, docker image and docker container:", "Docker compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. Even if you are running a single application, it can be a useful tool for you to not remember all the different volumes arguments, port settings etc. To create a docker-compose file, run vim docker-compose.yml inside the same folder as Dockerfile:", "This Docker file is a YAML file which tells docker to build various services from different Dockerfiles, configure the image names, environment variables, volumes and ports.", "To run this file, do docker-compose build hello\u2014 this will build the hello image like before. This followed by docker-compose run hello bash will run the container and set up the volumes etc. This command replaces the entire docker container run -it -v $PWD:/app hello bash command from Step 3.", "Now you can code away and analyze and run data science code inside a Docker image!", "As you build more docker images and containers, you need ways to manage all of these on your system. These commands will help you navigate Docker world. Let\u2019s learn about some docker system commands.", "If you prefer working with Jupyter notebooks instead, it is little more tricky but we can build from our knowledge in previous sections. You\u2019d have to modify your image and docker-compose file as well.", "Create the above Dockerfile in your existing project and then change your docker-compose file to:", "Here are the commands to run:", "As before, you run build command. But instead of invoking bash, you just run up and using the ENTRYPOINT above, your Docker will start off a Jupyter notebook server that you can access locally at http://127.0.0.1:8888/?token=<token> Now you can Jupyter away on a Docker container using a browser on your computer.", "Congratulations! The above workflow will hopefully be very useful to your data science development. Let\u2019s quickly recap what is possible when you combine Docker and data science projects:", "1. You can share your Dockerfile and docker-compose files with other data scientists for ease of working together. 2. You can deploy this image to AWS ECR to be deployed into a SageMaker endpoint. This will allow you to build your model as an endpoint to be used by users using your website etc. I have written a blog detailed these steps here. 3. You can deploy these containers inside AWS ECS Fargate to run a machine learning model periodically. If you do not want to expose a model to an end-user but rather run it periodically over say all new users that came this month, you can use this approach.", "This concludes this hands-on guide on using Docker and data science.", "Check out my PODCAST! I have started a podcast called \u201cThe Data Life Podcast\u201d. If you deal with data already in your job, or want to get better at machine learning or data science, this is the podcast for you \u2014 the unique thing here is that I cover the life aspects as well, with a recent episode on Women in Tech. You can listen to it on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, or Overcast.", "If you have any questions, drop me a note at my LinkedIn profile!", "Your home for data science.
