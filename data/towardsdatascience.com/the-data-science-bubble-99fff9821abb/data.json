Last year Gartner estimated that as many as 85% of data initiatives fail.", "For the lucky folks far away from corporate boardrooms, it may be hard to imagine convincing executives at a fortune 500 company to give you 10\u2013100 million toward some project with only a 15% chance of success, but it happens all the time.", "Some would say it\u2019s time to call it quits, hang up our neural nets and retire our GPU\u2019s and go back to the physics labs or math buildings we came from.", "Me, I\u2019m not so sure. The problem isn\u2019t that data science is a sham, its that data science is inherently risky. When working on really cutting edge problems it\u2019s just hard to say at the start of a project whether it will work out or not.", "The good news is someone has already figured out how to solve this problem, enter startups.", "\u201cA startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty.\u201d \u2014 Eric Reis The Lean Startup", "If that isn\u2019t your average data science project I don\u2019t know what is. The implications of approaching data science from an entrepreneurial path are immediate and far reaching. To keep this read under five minutes, I\u2019ll briefly highlight three big takeaways.", "\u201cIf You\u2019re Not Embarrassed By The First Version Of Your Product, You\u2019ve Launched Too Late\u201d \u2014 Reid Hoffman cofounder LinkedIn", "Hoffman\u2019s comments transfer perfectly to models.", "The first model should be terrible, consider it a Minimum Viable Model.", "The reality is unfortunately, quite often the opposite. Data science projects are often black holes into which money is poured, one day a pristine model emerges with nice scores and beautiful underlying data. The team is always shocked to discover the model isn\u2019t solving the customer\u2019s real problem.", "And that\u2019s exactly the issue, data science for all it\u2019s talk of experimentation and science might be the least agile branch of software.", "Instead of treating data science projects as Ph.D dissertations, they need to be treated as what they are, entrepreneurial software projects. Build an MVM, get it in front of users and keep iterating on it.", "The genius of the startup funding model is simple.", "Risk mitigation through repeated project valuation.", "Data science projects are notoriously difficult to evaluate, part of the reason for this is they often promise something so brilliantly innovative that it has literally never been done before. Funding projects like this is no different than funding a startup claiming some industry changing technology.", "It\u2019s worth noting the most damaging kind of failure is not a proposed project failing to be funded, it\u2019s a fully funded project spending it\u2019s full budget, delivering a non operational model, and learning nothing meaningful in the process. This means within the entrepreneurial mindset risk is reduced not by getting closer to completion but by reducing the uncertainty around the validity of the proposed solution. One might then give a tongue in cheek description of entrepreneurship as search for local minima of work required to reduce a systems entropy by some factor.", "A project repeatedly shows how it has reduced risk by proving or disproving validity, and receives funding based on how this proof shows greater expected value for the project. If the project begins to stutter consider pivoting, maybe this project won\u2019t solve the problem it set out to solve, but is an ideal solution for something else.", "Most data science organizations claim to be flat but are extremely hierarchical. Money and project ideas flow down from the top, rather than organically emerging from whatever minds devise them.", "Data science is evolving too fast for top down organizations to keep up.", "Enabling an open environment where projects can originate at any layer of seniority is the only way an organization can hope to keep up with the dizzying pace of the field. Inter-organizational competition needs to be seen not as a threat, but as a necessary fitness function which allows the best ideas rise to the top.", "\u201cThe more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.\u201d \u2014 George. S. Patton", "While not a traditional startup leader General Patton\u2019s ideas on competition certainly ring true in the competitive space of data science. The reality is that regardless of whether an organization stifles competition or accepts it, the second it\u2019s products leave it\u2019s premises competition is a very real thing.", "Data science has produced some of the greatest tech innovations in the past decade, but as practiced in many organizations it\u2019s also completely unsustainable. Producing more relevant models, mitigating risk and keeping up with the pace of the field will require organizations to rethink how they do data science. Structuring data science as entrepreneurship makes it a great investment once again.", "Your home for data science.
