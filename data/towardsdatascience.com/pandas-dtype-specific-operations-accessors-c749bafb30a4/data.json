For instance, extracting the month from the date can be done using the dt accessor.", "In this post, we will see various operations with 4 accessors of Pandas which are:", "Note: We will work the examples on Pandas Series which can also be considered as DataFrame columns.", "Str accessor provides methods to work with textual data. Let\u2019s start by creating a series that contains the words of a text.", "Split, as the name suggests, splits the data based on a specified character (the default is space). We then used the explode function to use each separated word as a new item in the series.", "Cat is the opposite of split. It concatenates strings in a series.", "The upper and lower methods convert all characters to upper case and lower case, respectively.", "The capitalize method only converts the first letter to upper case.", "The replace method can be used to replace the whole or part of a string with another string.", "The len method returns the length of the strings in a series.", "Str accessors allows to use indexing on strings. For instance, we can select only two first two characters as follows:", "We can also check if all characters are alphabetical with isalpha method.", "It returns false if there is at least one not alphabetical character.", "Startswith and endswith methods allow to check if strings start or end with particular characters.", "We can also count the number of the occurrences of a character or a set of characters in a string.", "The lstrip and rstrip methods can be used to trim off the strings.

The syntax is similar for quarter and year.", "Cat is the accessor for categorical data type. For categorical data, it is more efficient to work with categorical data type than using the object data type.

We cannot update an item to a category other than these 3. We will get a value error if we try to.", "To solve this problem, we can add new categories even if there is no data point belongs to that category yet.", "We can now update a data point to category D.", "Sparse data structure of Pandas allows to efficiently store sparse data. When it comes to sparsity, we tend to think of arrays consist of mostly zeroes. However, sparsity might also be due to other values (e.g. NaN). Sparse data structure means that the object is compressed by omitting data points that match a specific value (e.g. 0, 1, NaN).", "Let\u2019s stick to the traditional case with mostly zeroes.

The first one is the data type of the elements that are actually stored. The second one show the element of sparsity which is not stored.", "In order case, sparsity is due to zero so zeroes are not actually stored.", "The sparse accessor provides methods to check properties of sparse data structures. The npoints method returns the number of non-fill_value points (the points that are actually stored). The fill_value point is the value of sparsity.", "The sparse array contains 20 ones and remaining values are zero.", "The fill_value method shows the element of sparsity and density returns the ratio of non-fill_value points to the entire array.", "Finally, the sp_values method returns an array that only contains non-fill_value points.", "We have covered a significant part of the methods associated with accessors. There are, of course, more methods but these are the ones I think you will be using a lot in your data analysis process.
