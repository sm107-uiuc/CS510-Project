You perform data exploration and cleaning, select a model, tune it, train it. After several iterations and fixes, you run some performance metrics, and the results are great. You think that your work here is done, but then you are asked to put your model into production. The model works fine on your laptop, but they wanted you to create a model that users can consume, right?", "One of the issues that data scientists sometimes face is that their work seems to be disconnected from everyone else\u2019s. They work on their own, tinker with their models, and produce some results that might be relevant for the problem at hand. If the results are indeed useful, the stakeholders will want the best model put into production. However, at that point, models are frequently unsuitable to be productionized. Often, a team of -data, ML and/or software- engineers will have to convert them into a usable model to be deployed and potentially integrated with some existing application or pipeline.", "Luckily, productionizing a machine learning model is gradually becoming easier, faster and more accessible to everyone overall. The main cloud providers offer dedicated services for developing machine learning solutions, such as Microsoft\u2019s Azure Machine Learning, Amazon\u2019s AWS SageMaker, or Google Cloud AI Platform. These services enable the management of the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, by implementing machine learning-oriented DevOps (also known as MLOps) to build, train and deploy models in automated pipelines. They all support popular frameworks and programming languages (such as Python, R, scikit-learn, XGBoost, Tensorflow, or PyTorch), smoothing the transition from working locally regardless of which tools someone might be accustomed to.", "The aforementioned disconnection between the data science and the engineering tasks can be problematic if the data scientists are unfamiliar with the latter. But with the easiness of use of these cloud services, this doesn\u2019t have to be the case anymore. Even with some basic knowledge of the cloud infrastructure and elementary experience with such tools, data scientists would already be able to better understand the engineers\u2019 work and decisions, facilitating the communication and cooperation between both sides and thus fast-tracking the productionization of machine learning solutions.", "For this tutorial, we will be using Microsoft Azure and its Machine Learning service, along with the Azure ML SDK for Python.", "Note that the purpose of this article is to showcase the ease of use and speed of the Azure Machine Learning service, particularly for model deployment. Hence, the code and explanations are reduced to the bare minimum that is required to quickly deploy a working model in Azure that can be consumed by other applications and users.", "However, to productionize a machine learning model for a real-world application, there are several additional aspects that need to be considered during deployment. Mainly, the deployment task is expected to be included in a CI/CD pipeline, but there are further considerations to be done within the Azure Machine Learning service itself. Some examples would be performing authentication on the REST endpoint, or deploying the model in a compute cluster instead of a single container if we want the service to be scalable.", "Moreover, at Info Support we advocate for the usage of Azure Machine Learning and similar MLOps frameworks during the whole development lifecycle, and not only during deployment. In this article, I decided to focus on the latter, under the assumption that good MLOps practices were followed during the building and training of the model \u2014 hopefully, those can be covered in future articles.", "Yes, really. While some operations can involve a waiting time of several minutes (namely, the creation of an Azure Machine Learning workspace and the web service deployment), the actual work that needs to be done can be completed in just a couple of minutes.", "To demonstrate this, I have made the following video, where I cover the fastest way to perform all steps (from uploading an already trained model to consuming the deployed web service):", "If you want to delve more into each of these steps, or if you prefer to learn how to perform every step using a code-only approach, continue reading.", "As I previously mentioned, we assume that we have already succeeded at all the steps prior to deployment: we have obtained, explored and cleaned the data; selected a model, and trained it, achieving a good enough performance to start using this model in production.", "For the sake of demonstration, we will start this tutorial with a very simple solution based on a toy dataset directly available in scikit-learn: the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Database. We will fit a decision tree to try to predict the chance that a breast tumor is either benign or malignant.", "The dataset contains measurements for several characteristics of the breast mass, extracted from an image of its cells. We will make use of the first 4 available features, which roughly correspond to the mean values of the radius, texture, perimeter and area of the breast mass.", "Again, note that this model is used for demonstration purposes, and we are therefore not focusing on the algorithm choice or the actual performance. Our goal is to obtain any trained model whatsoever, in order to deploy it and test it in Azure Machine Learning.", "Let\u2019s say that we have run some evaluation metrics on the test split, and we are satisfied with the performance of our model. We are ready to make it accessible to other users or external applications. But in order to load our model into the cloud, we first need to store it.", "Trained models can be stored by serializing them \u2014 or how it is often called in Python, by \u2018pickling\u2019 them. Pickling a model means converting it into a binary file that can be stored, copied, moved, transferred, and eventually loaded in order to retrieve the original model.", "This can be done by using a library that\u2019s precisely called pickle. However, for serializing machine learning models in Python, an alternative library is often recommended: joblib. This library enables an efficient storage and loading of Python objects that might contain large data structures, which can be expected from some machine learning models.", "Continuing our previous script, we can easily serialize and store our trained model like this:", "For the filename, .joblib or .bin are examples of supported extensions. It is also possible to use other extensions (such as .z) for further compression, if needed.", "It is strongly suggested noting down the Python version and the versions of the dependencies that were used to create the stored model, as they might be needed to deserialize it and use it while ensuring full compatibility. In this specific case, we do need the Python version to match whichever Python version is currently supported by Azure Machine Learning, as well as to indicate scikit-learn\u2019s version when registering our model.", "It is possible to deploy an already trained model in Azure Machine Learning using the Azure Machine Learning portal GUI only, and without a single line of additional code. However, the deployment of a web endpoint in a single container (which is the quickest way to deploy a model) is only possible via code or the command-line.", "This is why, along this tutorial, we will be making use of the Azure ML SDK for Python. Code snippets for executing every step of the deployment will be provided, aside from explanations of the procedures via the GUI when applicable.", "To install the Azure ML SDK with the default packages, we run the following command in our local terminal:", "Note that Azure Machine Learning uses interactive UI authentication when developing with the Azure ML SDK. The first time we make use of the SDK with our subscription ID, Azure will hence prompt us to log into our subscription account.", "We have a functioning model in storage, great! Now we can actually start delving into Azure Machine Learning.", "Assuming that we already have an account and an active subscription in Azure, we navigate to the Azure Portal and search for Services > Machine Learning.", "We give our new workspace a name, and select the subscription we want to use. As we assume we are starting a project from scratch, we will create a new resource group. We can select the Basic workspace edition, as it offers all the capabilities we need for our tutorial.", "It is also possible to create a workspace directly using the Azure ML SDK. With the create() method from the Workspace class, we can provide identical parameters as the ones provided through the Azure portal:", "Once the resource group and the workspace have been created, we can access the latter through the Azure Machine Learning dashboard, at ml.azure.com.", "Now, we need to obtain the JSON file with the details of our workspace and subscription. Within the Azure ML portal, on the upper-right corner navigation bar, we click on Change subscription > Download config file, and place the file in our project directory. This config file can also be downloaded by navigating to the newly created workspace in the Azure portal and clicking Download config file in the Overview page. Once we have this file located within our project folder, we can deploy our model directly from our Python IDE.", "To upload and register our already trained model, we go to the Models section on the left-side menu and click on Register model. We name our model, indicate the framework we used to train it (in this case, scikit-learn), and optionally write a description for additional metadata. We browse our machine to select and upload our serialized model file, and then we click on Register.", "This whole procedure can also be quickly done with a Python script and the Azure ML SDK. We first need to connect to the workspace using the from_config() method, which will search for our config file within the root directory of the project. Then, we are able to register our trained model by using the Model class. We can define the same parameters as the ones previously indicated within the GUI:", "After running this script, we can go back to the Azure Machine Learning portal, and verify that our model has been registered under the Models section.", "Once our model is registered, we can already deploy it as-is. This means that our deployed web service will take the same input data as our trained model (in this case, an array of four floating numbers denoting our four selected features), and will output the prediction (here, 1 for benign and 0 for malignant).", "To do so, we locate our registered model in the workspace, and make use of the deploy() method from the Model class, providing a name for our web service and the pointer to the model:", "By doing so, our model will be deployed in an ACI (Azure Container Instance). ACIs in Azure Machine Learning are meant to be used for development and testing purposes, as they only support low-scale workloads on CPUs. Yet, they can make use of up to 16GB of RAM and 4 CPUs, which might be enough for a proof-of-concept or even for productionizing a prototype model, depending on the application.", "And that\u2019s it! Our web service will now appear in the Azure Machine Learning portal, under the Endpoints section. There, we can obtain its REST endpoint\u2019s URI and send some test POST requests to the API, to verify that the deployment was successful. The JSON-formatted input expected by this web service is the following:", "Note that the value of the \u201cdata\u201d key can also be a 2D array containing several samples, and that the web service will then return all the corresponding predictions.", "With the method parameter, we can indicate the value predict if we want the web service to output the predicted label (0 or 1), or the value predict_proba if we want to obtain the exact probabilities output for each label.", "When sending two samples from the split evaluation dataset (for instance, via Postman), we see that we obtain the expected predictions (the first sample corresponds to a benign tumor, and the second to a malignant one):", "Our deployed model is therefore ready to be consumed by external applications. As an example of how to consume it using Python, we send one of the previous data samples:", "We have seen how easy it is to deploy our model as-is. However, depending on our model or the kind of application we want to build, it might feel limited.", "When we deploy our model with the script above, what we are actually doing is deploying it in a compute instance with a predefined configuration (10% usage limit of a single CPU core and 0.5GB of RAM) and an environment with default packages and frameworks (precisely including scikit-learn).", "But what if this compute target setup does not provide enough computational power for our model? Or what if we use certain libraries that are not included in the default environment? Furthermore, we might want to have more flexibility to define how the web service interfaces with external users: for instance, we may have to carry out additional operations on the input data before feeding it to the model, such as normalizing the input features or dealing with missing values in some particular way.", "We can do all of this with two extra steps: specifying an inference configuration (by providing an entry script for our web service and a custom environment) and a deployment configuration.", "The entry script (also called scoring script) must contain the two following functions:", "An example of a bare scoring script for our model would be the following:", "The other parameter we need for our inference configuration is an execution environment. We can create an Environment object, give it a name, and indicate the Conda or pip dependencies that we want to have installed. Note that the azureml-defaults package is always required for the model to be hosted as a web service.", "We can now create the inference configuration needed to deploy the model:", "Lastly, we define the deployment configuration. We can create, for example, a compute instance with one CPU core and 2GB of RAM:", "We provide both configuration objects to the deploy() method we already used during the default deployment:", "We can now run it to deploy our new web service, which we can send requests to by simply providing our input data:", "Our model has been successfully deployed in Azure. As mentioned at the beginning of the article, my goal was to showcase how fast and easily we can deploy models using the Azure Machine Learning service. There is, however, still a lot left to do if we want to productionize our models in a real-world application.", "To continue delving into what Azure Machine Learning has to offer, check this repository from Microsoft where they provide several Python notebooks on how to use the Azure ML SDK, as well as Azure Machine Learning\u2019s official documentation.", "Moreover, if you have any questions about some step of the tutorial, or if you\u2019re running into any issues when executing the code, feel free to ask me in the comments below or via LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
