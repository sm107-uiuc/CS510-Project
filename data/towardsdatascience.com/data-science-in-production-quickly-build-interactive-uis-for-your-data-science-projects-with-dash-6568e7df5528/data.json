This series will go over the basics of the tech-stack and techniques that you can get familiarized with to face the real data science industry for specializations such as Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and ML Infrastructure. It will be a walkthrough of how you can take your academic projects to the next level by deploying your models and creating ml pipelines with best practices used in the industry. This is second part in the series and you can have a look at the first part here: Data Science in Production: Building Flask APIs to serve ML models with Best Practices", "This blog will go over how you could quickly build interactive web applications which uses machine learning and how to deploy those applications into Heroku cloud. Anything showcase-able on your resume adds 10x more value than something which is just text.", "Dash is an open-source web framework built by Plotly specially designed for Data Science and AI applications. Full Stack applications that would typically require a front end, back end, and DevOps team can be built and deployed in hours by data scientists with Dash. Yes! you can do everything in Python which is beautiful\u2764.", "Dash is built on top of Flask, Plotly.js, React and React Js but in this exercise we will be writing most of the code in python with some embedded html and css elements.", "The first step always would be to set up your own project environment so that you can isolate your project libraries and their versions from interacting the local python environment. There are two ways in which you can set up your python environment for your project specifically: Virtualenv and Conda. Just to be on the same page I will be using Python 3.7.3 for this entire project but you can use any version and that should be fine.", "After any of the above commands in your terminal. you will be in your project\u2019s own virtual environment. if you want to install anything in the virtual environment than its as simple as the normal pip install. It\u2019s always a standard practice in the industry to create virtual environments while you are working on any of the projects.", "Once you are in the virtual environment, use the requirements.txt from the github repo in app folder: https://github.com/jkachhadia/ipl-prediction/tree/master/app", "Let's make this a little more fun, so we will building predictive models for the game of cricket and we will be using this dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/nowke9/ipldata which is on Indian Premier League (IPL). IPL clocks reach of 462 million, watch time of 338 billion minutes in 12th season on TV.", "If you have already cloned the repo shared above, there is an ipython notebook in there which shows you how you can preprocess the ball-by-ball data and matches data. It\u2019s a little bit complex so I won\u2019t be explaining the preprocessing steps over here as that\u2019s not our main aim. That notebook results into 6 preprocessed datasets which we will be later on using in our Dash application. We will be building an application in such a way that any user could tweak model parameters to get the required predictions. We will be building 3 models: Score Predictor, Win probability predictor after first innings and Win probability predictor when 10 overs are left.", "We will start crunching some code now to build our dash app. let's create a new file named app.py and start with importing libraries that we would require.", "Now let's declare all the global variables which we will be using in multiple functions.", "We will be importing all the preprocessed training data to save our app\u2019s time on preprocessing. All the preprocessing steps are in the ipython notebook.", "Now, lets initiate our dash application with an external css stylesheet (Stylesheet part is not mandatory)", "We will now design the look and feel of the web app using dash\u2019s internal html component definitions. It would be great to have some html and css knowledge but not necessary as it\u2019s not too complex.", "This is the layout of the webapp that we want to design and it's pretty straight forward in terms of UI design. We have to define each and every element in the UI in our dash layout. We have to specify ids and styling of each element to be able to control and fetch data from them and process it in the backend. A good way to understand would be to read and write the below code and compare it with the above UI.", "We want to make it completely dynamic such that when random forest or neural networks are selected then and only then we get an option to tweak model parameters and don\u2019t see them otherwise. so, we will be using callbacks to change the UI dynamically when the dropdown option changes.", "These six callbacks will make visibility of parameter setting completely dynamic and is easy as duck because of just some conditional statements to check values and set properties likewise when there is a change in the dropdowns for algorithms.", "Now we will do the fun part which is making the dynamic ML component which will basically update the predictions quickly when we update the features or model parameters. We will again be using dash callbacks to update prediction components of the page when there\u2019s a change in feature or parameter components.", "As you can see above, we have added 3 callbacks to update the predictions. All you need now is some code to run the server.", "yes! we are kinda done with our first mini gig. Let\u2019s run this on our local. Open your terminal and run app.py (make sure you are in the project folder where app.py is there and you are in the virtual environment which we created before)", "Heroku is a cloud platform that helps you deploy backend applications on their cloud. Yes, we will be deploying our dash app now in the cloud.", "Let\u2019s get started. Create your account on heroku.com. Once you do that and go to the dashboard you will have to create a new app.", "You click on create new app and name it accordingly as I named mine \u2018iplpredict\u2019", "Awesome! Now, you can click on your app, go to settings and add python to your buildpack section.", "You can do this the other way as well by installing the Heroku CLI which we would have to eventually do to deploy our application.", "After installing the CLI you can also create an app from the command line as shown below:", "I love the CLI way as I have been an Ubuntu/Mac person since 5 years now.", "Now we will add two files which is the Procfile and runtime.txt to the app folder.", "Procfile will basically run your app with gunicorn. make sure you have that installed in your virtual environment. Now, we will go through how you can create your own requirements.txt file.", "This will basically dump all your app/virtual environment\u2019s dependencies into a requirements.txt file.", "Now, If you go to the deploy section of heroku, they have super clear instructions written there about how to deploy but I will put them below.", "These commands will push your code to the heroku cloud and build your flask application with dependencies. Congratulations! you have deployed your dash app into cloud/production.", "Now you can go to https://<your-app-name>.herokuapp.com/ and you will see the same webapp that we saw on our local system but will take some time initially as its free haha!. Also, you can check my app version here: http://iplpredict.herokuapp.com", "If it\u2019s running. You are all set! Woohoo!", "Thus, we built our very own dash web application and this could be used in your other projects or you could showcase it on your resume rather than just putting in what you did like you use to. This is something live, interactive, and proof of something that you have really built. Dash has lot of other things to offer like building real-time visualizations and dashboards.", "Shoot your questions on [myLastName][myFirstName] at gmail dot com or let\u2019s connect on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
