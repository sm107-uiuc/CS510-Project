It\u2019s a term used to excite business executives to make them feel like Google or Amazon. The reality is that big data doesn\u2019t mean anything and its meaning is only going to reduce.", "As companies become more familiar with data processing and service providers abstract away more complexity, big data will just become data. Big data engineers will just become data engineers and any data engineer worth their salt will be handling what we now call \u201cbig data processing\u201d.", "Fear not though, this doesn\u2019t mean your big data knowledge is obsolete, just that its name might not mean as much as it once did.", "It isn\u2019t dead at all. In fact, it\u2019s only going to become more prominent. By 2025 it\u2019s predicted that the global \u201cdata sphere\u201d will be 175ZB (zettabytes), up from 50ZB today.", "All of this data is going to need crunching one way or another so how can big data be dying?", "The answer is that \u201cbig data processing\u201d itself isn\u2019t going anywhere, it will just become the norm. Because of this, we\u2019ll no longer be calling it big data and need specialised \u201cbig data engineers\u201d. The complexity and scaling behind big data applications will be abstracted away by cloud providers like Amazon so that all data engineering could in effect be \u201cbig data engineering\u201d.", "This isn't a new phenomenon either, it started back in the early days of Hadoop. When Facebook started out using Hadoop to manage its huge data sets, they found writing MapReduce jobs long, laborious and expensive. This is because at the time MapReduce jobs required programming, so they built Hive.", "Hive is SQL on Hadoop. Facebook abstracted the complexity away from writing MapReduce jobs and they became simple SQL queries. This meant that anyone who knew SQL had the ability to build big data applications, not just big data engineers.", "Fast forward to today and you have on demand scaling data solutions like Amazon Redshift or Google Big Table. Most modern services cater to small data but can be easily scaled to work for big data.", "You could use Amazon S3 as the data store for a \u201csmall data\u201d application but if your data footprint grows then you can still use S3 as a data lake as it\u2019s effectively an unlimited data store. There are even data processing tools like Athena that sit on top of S3 now making it even more compelling.", "None of us really know what the next big marketing buzz word will be. Data Science is already following a similar path. At the minute it\u2019s the poster child of the data world but again, as its complexity gets abstracted away then the need for specialised data scientists will reduce and its buzz will dwindle.", "The important thing to take away is not that big data processing is dying, but the term \u201cBig Data\u201d itself is dying. Behind all of the abstractions, big data processing techniques will still be there. We\u2019ll still be using horizontally scaling clusters, we\u2019ll still be reducing data ingestion latency and processing petabytes of data. None of this is going away, these techniques are just being hidden so they are more accessible to everyone.", "We will still need data engineers who are skilled in data extraction and manipulation. We\u2019ll also still need data scientists and analysts who can build predictions and provide reporting.", "What will be missing is the ability of the engineers to build a robust and scalable data lake from the ground up, as this can be deployed with the push of a button. The data scientists won\u2019t need to understand as much of the \u201cnitty-gritty\u201d maths either. Instead, they\u2019ll only need to know which models are required and what data to provide. The complexity of training and deploying the model will be abstracted away and provided as a cloud service.", "My opinion is that any job in the field of data is a safe bet for the future. However, you need to keep on your toes and start thinking about how you can offer services faster and cheaper for businesses, even if that means using off the shelf solutions.", "As cloud abstractions of complex big data and data science services grow, your ability to use these services and knit them together will be the most important, even if you could have built it yourself from scratch.", "Looking for more great Data Engineering content?
