In this article, I will show you how to implement it using TensorFlow."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The world is full of unstructured data rather than a structured one. It includes images, texts, graphs, and many more. Those data are difficult to analyze until Deep Learning starts to exist once again. Deep Learning is a sub-branch of Machine Learning that is inspired by the mechanism of how the brain works, especially on the neurons. The artificial neurons combine to make something called a Neural Network.", "Deep Learning makes an impactful progress, especially on image data. Image data is so complex because it doesn\u2019t have a tabular format to it, and it has huge parameters on it, especially on the pixel. Suppose that you want to predict which image represents a cat and which one represents a dog when you use the machine learning model such as SVM and Logistic Regression, you have to determine which characteristics make a cat distinct to a dog by yourself.", "Which characteristics that divide a cat and a dog? Well, you can say by its nose, eyes, ears, and many more. To capture those features, you can use the convolution operation to capture those features. But there are some problem if we want to extract the features. It\u2019s that the images don\u2019t have the same form by each other. Therefore, we should have a method that can learn by itself the parameters for extracting features from the images.", "There are 2 tasks we must tackle, to extract the features and to predict the images. We can use the Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to solve our problems.", "What makes it so special than conventional Machine Learning is that it can capture the non-linearity of the data. The algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Logistic Regression only estimate a linear function from the data to divide them into classes. The neural network, on the other hand, can estimate a nonlinear function that divides the data into their class thanks to the activation function.", "The other reason why neural networks are so powerful is that the model can engineer the features by itself, and it learns to capture the feature and also to predict the data correctly thanks to the power of backpropagation. Therefore, the neural networks are the perfect model to discover knowledge from the unstructured data.", "The article will show you on how to solve an image classification using Convolutional Neural Network by using a LeNet 5 architecture, the first CNN architecture that exists, by Yann LeCun. Then, we will implement that using the TensorFlow library in Python. The goal of this article will look like this,", "Right before we will get into the implementation and to make sure you will not get confused, I will show you the fundamentals of the Convolutional Neural Networks. It consists of the convolution layer, the subsampling (pooling) layer, and the fully-connected layer.", "The convolution layer is the layer for capturing features of the image using convolution filters. As mentioned before, convolution is an operation for calculating pixels with a given filter by multiplying it element-wise and then adding them as a single number.", "The filters will reduce the dimension of the data, except for the number of dimensions that will increase over time. If we want to maintain the dimension of the image, we can set the padding. Padding adds the missing pixel at the border of the image. Therefore, it will have the same dimension as the previous one.", "Or if we want to avoid overlapping pixels while doing convolution, we can use stride. Stride is a manipulation where the convolution process will jump with its given numbers. By using that, it can jump several steps with the given number.", "The layer will learn the parameters that fit to the data, and therefore it can predict the images accurately. Also, because it wants to capture the nonlinearity of the image, the layer contains an activation called Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) that will set the negative value with 0, and else will be the value itself. Therefore, by using this layer, we don\u2019t have to extract features manually.", "The pooling layer is basically a layer to reduce the dimension of the data. The mechanism of the layer is similar to the convolution layer, except it doesn\u2019t apply any filters. The examples of the pooling layer is the max-pooling layer. It will take the maximum value of each region corresponding to the image as we can see the image above. The layer is useful for summarizing the image by taking the maximum value of each region of the image.", "Right after the convolution and the pooling layer, now the image gets into the fully-connected layer. The layer will handle the prediction result. It is similar to the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) layers because it contains nodes, and it\u2019s useful to predict the image that has been downsampled, and its features are already retrieved. The mechanism is also similar to ANN, but it adds with the convolution layer before to automate the feature extraction.", "After we know the building blocks of CNN, how can we implement that? We can refer to the existing research on it, and we can use its architecture as our reference to build our own CNN model. For this article, we will use the first architecture of the CNN that exists. It comes from a paper called \u2018Gradient-based learning applied to document recognition\u2019 by Yann LeCun and his team in 1998. They propose an architecture called LeNet 5. It looks like this,", "In general, the architecture consists of several layers. The flow will look like this,", "It will do two general steps. They are Feature Extraction (Conv => Pool sequences) and the fully-connected layer for predicting values. If we look at the detail, each layer repeats at least twice. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called Deep Learning because it learns the data more depth than existing Machine Learning models.", "After we know the architecture, we can straight into the implementation. To implement this, we will use TensorFlow with its Keras API for doing it. We will use the high-level API from Keras, so you can implement the model easier rather than using the low-level API.", "Right before we implement this, I will give you an overview of what we will do for implementing the architecture using TensorFlow,", "Right before we will implement the model, we have to prepare the data. First, we will import the data. The source of it is from Digit Recognizer competition on Kaggle. It consists of 60000 rows. Then, it divides into 42000 observations for training data, and the rest for the test data of the model. After we import the data, the data looks like this at first,", "The dataset still on tabular format. The columns represent the label and the pixels that correspond to the image. Because of that, we have to reshape the dataset. But before doing that, make sure you normalize the image first, then reshape the dataset. And finally, we split the training data into 2 parts, the training and the validation dataset for the model.", "The code for doing that looks like this,", "For the preview of the data, it will look like this,", "After we prepare the data, we can build the model. We will build the model based on the architecture, and we adjust with our dataset because the data has different dimensions from the original paper, which is 28 x 28 x 1. As we stated before, the flow of the model will look like this,", "Here is the code to build that,", "After we build the model, the summary will look like this,", "As we can see, we can see that the dimension of the image got decrease, but the number of filters got an increase. After we extract the feature, we reshape the image into a one-dimensional vector to predict it. Also, we can see that each layer, except the pooling layer, will have the number of parameters to it. In this case, there are 44426 layers to learn by the model. The model will learn those parameters to achieve greater accuracy for predicting the images.", "To fit and optimize the model, the code will look like this,", "After that, The model fits the data, and it repeats several times based on the number of epochs. For the evaluation, the model achieves the accuracy like this,", "As we can see, we conclude that the number epoch of 5 achieve slightly better than any epoch numbers. Therefore, we can build the model only with 5 epochs, and we can use it to predict values.", "We already have build the model on MNIST dataset using the LeNet 5 architecture. The accuracy of our model is already great, but we can improve the model even more. To improve the model, we can augment the data, fine-tuning the model, add more filter and depth of the model, and many more.", "There are many CNN architectures that exists, such as VGG-16, ResNet, AlexNet, and many more. I have to tell you that this is only the beginning. There are many things that we could learn about Computer Vision. I hope that the article will be a great start for you to begin the journey on Computer Vision, and I hope you can make a great application using CNN or else.", "Your home for data science.
