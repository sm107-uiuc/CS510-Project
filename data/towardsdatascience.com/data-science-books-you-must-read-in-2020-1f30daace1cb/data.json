It also emphasizes the usefulness of the various concepts from the Data Science and Statistics world along with its purpose.", "Practical Statistics for Data Scientists explains the core notions from the subject by relating them with practical examples from the past and the more recent years that are relevant to the Data Science industry. Even though it does cover a majority of the concepts, if not all, the book recommends additional reading.", "As the title of the book suggests, it focusses heavily on the practical implementations of Python for Data Analysis, to primarily analyze structured data stored in a variety of forms. It goes into the details about the role of Python, its broad collection of libraries for Data Analysis related tasks, and the benefits it provides for Data Science.", "Essential Python libraries covered in this book include NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, IPython, and SciPy.
