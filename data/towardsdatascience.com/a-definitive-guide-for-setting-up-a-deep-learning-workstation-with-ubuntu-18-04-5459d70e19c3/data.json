I knew the process involved, yet I somehow never got to it.", "But this time I just had to do it. So, I found out some free time to create a Deep Learning Rig with a lot of assistance from NVIDIA folks who were pretty helpful. On that note special thanks to Josh Patterson and Michael Cooper.", "Now, every time I create the whole deep learning setup from an installation viewpoint, I end up facing similar challenges. It\u2019s like running around in circles with all these various dependencies and errors. This time also I had to try many things before the whole configuration came to life without errors.", "So this time, I made it a point to document everything while installing all the requirements and their dependencies in my own system.", "This post is about setting up your own Linux Ubuntu 18.04 system for deep learning with everything you might need.", "If a pre-built deep learning system is preferred, I can recommend Exxact\u2019s line of workstations and servers.", "I assume that you have a fresh Ubuntu 18.04 installation. I am taking inspiration from Slav Ivanov\u2019s excellent post in 2017 on creating a Deep Learning box. You can call it the 2020 version for the same post from a setup perspective, but a lot of the things have changed from then, and there are a lot of caveats with specific CUDA versions not supported by Tensorflow and Pytorch.", "Before we do anything with our installation, we need to update our Linux system to the latest packages. We can do this simply by using:", "So now we have everything set up we want to install the following four things:", "The first step is to add the latest NVIDIA drivers. You can choose the GPU product type, Linux 64 bit, and download Type as \u201cLinux Long-Lived\u201d for the 18.04 version.", "Clicking on search will take you to a downloads page:", "For you, the file may be named differently, depending on the latest version.", "We will now need to install the CUDA toolkit. Somehow the CUDA toolkit 10.2 is still not supported by Pytorch and Tensorflow, so we will go with CUDA Toolkit 10.1, which is supported by both.", "Also, the commands on the product page for CUDA 10.1 didn\u2019t work for me and the commands I ended up using are:", "The next step is to create the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and append to the PATH variable the path where CUDA got installed. Just run this below command on your terminal.", "After this, one can check if CUDA is installed correctly by using:", "As you can see, the CUDA Version is 10.1 as we wanted. Also, check if you can use the command:", "For me, it showed an error when I used it the first time, but a simple reboot solved the issue. And both my NVIDIA graphic cards show up in all their awesome glory. Don\u2019t worry that the display says the CUDA version supported is 10.2. I was also confused, but it is just the maximum CUDA version supported by the graphics driver that is shown in nvidia-smi.", "What is the use of all these libraries if we are not going to train neural nets? CuDNN provides various primitives for Deep Learning, which are later used by PyTorch/TensorFlow.", "But we first need to get a developer account first to install CuDNN. Once you fill-up the signup form, you will see the screen below. Select the cuDNN version that applies to your CUDA version. For me, the CUDA version is 10.1, so I select the second one.", "Once you select the appropriate CuDNN version the screen expands:", "For my use case, I needed to download three files for Ubuntu 18.04:", "After downloading these files, you can install using these commands. You can also see the exact commands if anything changes in the future:", "And finally, we reach the crux. We will install the software which we will interface with most of the times.", "We need to install Python with virtual environments. I have downloaded python3 as it is the most stable version as of now, and it is time to say goodbye to Python 2.7. It was great while it lasted. And we will also install Pytorch and Tensorflow. I prefer them both for specific tasks as applicable.", "You can go to the anaconda distribution page and download the package.", "Once downloaded you can simply run the shell script:", "You will also need to run these commands on your shell to add some commands to your ~/.bashrc file, and update the conda distribution with the latest libraries versions.", "The next step is creating a new environment for your deep learning pursuits or using an existing one. I created a new Conda environment using:", "Here py37 is the name we provide to this new conda environment. You can activate this conda environment using:", "You should now be able to see something like:", "We can now add all our required packages to this environment using pip or conda. The latest version 1.3, as seen from the pytorch site, is not yet available for CUDA 10.2, as I already mentioned, so we are in luck with CUDA 10.1. Also, we will need to specify the version of TensorFlow as 2.1.0, as this version was built using 10.1 CUDA.", "I also install RAPIDS, which is a library to get your various data science workloads to GPUs. Why use GPUs only for deep learning and not for Data processing? You can get the command to install rapids from the rapids release selector:", "Since PyTorch installation interfered with TensorFlow, I installed TensorFlow in another environment.", "Now we can check if the TF and Pytorch installations are correctly done by using the below commands in their own environments:", "If the install is showing some errors for TensorFlow or the GPU test is failing, you might want to add these two additional lines at the end of your bashrc file and restart the terminal:", "You might also want to install jupyter lab or jupyter notebook. Thanks to the developers, the process is as easy as just running jupyter labor jupyter notebook in your terminal, whichever you do prefer. I personally like notebook better without all the unnecessary clutter.", "In this post, I talked about all the software you are going to need to install in your deep learning rig without hassle.", "You might still need some help and face some problems for which my best advice would be to check out the different NVIDIA and Stack Overflow forums.", "So we have got our deep learning rig setup, and its time for some tests now. In the next few posts, I am going to do some benchmarking on the GPUs and will try to write more on various deep Learning libraries one can include in their workflow. So stay tuned.", "If you want to learn more about Deep Learning, here is an excellent course. You can start for free with the 7-day Free Trial.", "Thanks for the read.
