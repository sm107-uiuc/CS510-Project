The basic principle of contact tracing involves identifying people who may be at risk to a disease and notifying them to either be tested (in the case of diseases like AIDs) or self-isolate (in the case of COVID-19).", "We\u2019re going to consider the version of the world proposed by the team who developed The Decentralised Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T). There are other proposals for how to do contact tracing like those proposed by Apple and Google but the same basic concepts still hold true. We\u2019re going to look at how the protocol works and how it\u2019s designed to protect each individual\u2019s privacy.", "The basic algorithm can be broken down into 5 steps:", "In the white paper published by the designers of the algorithm, the random codes are called ephemeral identifiers or EphIds. The authors explain that at the start of each day, a phone should generate (60*24)/l different pseudo-random EphIds. l is left as a configurable parameter and represents the number of minutes that each EmpId is broadcasted for \u2014 for this article let\u2019s assume it\u2019s 1. These Ephids are sent with Bluetooth low energy to surrounding phones. Rotating improves privacy as it makes it harder to track an individual\u2019s movements.", "The exact details of how these are generated are fully explained in the white paper if you\u2019re interested in learning more. It is worth knowing that the method of creating EphIds is deterministic for each user but appears to be random \u2014 the reason for this design decision will become clear later.", "In addition to sending EphIds, your phone also need to listen to and record a list of all Ephids from phones near-by. The Ids are stored securely the device along with the date. EphIds only need to be stored for 14 days, the maximum incubation time for COVID-19.", "The authors of the paper suggest that when an individual takes a test they should be given an access code to upload their results to a central database should they need to. This code is only activated if the patient tests positive. The individual then has the option to instruct the app to upload the first Ephid from the first day, they were contagious (on average 5-6 days before showing symptoms [2]).", "Only the first Ephid from an individual's contagious period needs to be uploaded because, as mentioned above, since the creation of Ephids is deterministic, all other Ephids can be recreated by a user.", "Every day your phone can download from the central database a list of Ephids and the day they were transmitted on. Your phone can reconstruct the full series of Ephids during the contagious period and they are cross-referenced with the Ephids that your phone has heard in the same time period. If matches are found then it is recorded and will contribute to a custom risk score based on the number of matches and when those matches were found. The risk score is designed by the local health authority and is a function of the number of Ephids matched to the central database.", "The elegancy of algorithms like this is that they never require to know an individual\u2019s location and doesn\u2019t need access to GPS data. Neither does it know what an individual\u2019s daily habits are or whether or not they are being compliant with lockdown policies. Apps that use the protocol are only concerned with the safety of the users.", "DP-3T contact tracing is a privacy forward, lightweight and secure method for contact tracing. If implemented well, it has the opportunity to reduce the spread of COVID-19 significantly and help to save lives.", "Your home for data science.
