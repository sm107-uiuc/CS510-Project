We say that it is so complex that we still couldn\u2019t understand it completely. I will make an assumption for the structure of the brain and, I will examine the case which is mentioned in \u201cThe Brain That Remade Itself\u201d.", "Nerves are just binary switches. When they are used for an information, they are 1. When they are not used, they are 0. How does it happen? When an information comes, the information is connected to the closest empty neuron(0) to the door of input. To give a basic example, let\u2019s assume that when we see a dog, one neuron which is connected and close to the visual input door is activated. The image of dog that we saw is assigned to that neuron. When we see the same dog exactly in the same condition that we saw it before, that neuron is activated so that we understand that it is the same dog. What happens if we do not see that dog for a long time? The assignment of that dog image to the neuron is deleted, which means that we forget that dog. So, how do we forget?", "There is a forgetting rule in the brain. If the neuron which is assigned to an information is not activated for a long time or in a necessary frequency(if any electricity is not passed through that neuron), then the information assigned to that neuron is erased.", "Firstly, we have neurons and axons as everybody says. The brain is composed of only neurons and axons. The type of the neurons are exactly same in all areas of the brain. In brain, there are no special fields reserved for performing certain tasks. These fields are created by the general working principle of the brain, which I will also explain after I explain the structure of it. The areas are used for specific tasks because of the time of learning. What do I mean by that?", "The first place to get the input and process it to the brain is the place that the sensors are firstly connected. So, when an input comes, first place it will be placed is the closest empty nerve that the input is connected in brain.", "When a baby is born, first thing it actually senses is the light (Babies cannot see as a normal human, it just sense the light). So, the first input to the brain is coming from the eyes. Eyes are connected to the back field of the brain firstly. So, the visual inputs that the baby gets start being placed in the empty neurons which are closest to the area that the optical nerves are connected.", "This condition applies to all sensor activities in human body. The auditory information starts being placed in the neurons which are closest to the input door of hearing.", "To answer this question, let\u2019s check which place is the farthest to the input doors such as hearing, seeing, etc\u2026 The answer is frontal lobe. First information that we assign to neurons comes by our sensors(input doors). The farthest place to these regions in brain contains the neurons which are assigned to the most complex information. The information we get by our sensors and assign to our neurons are the infrastructure of the more complex information. While the firstly assigned neurons represent most basic information, lastly assigned neurons represent most complex information we learned.", "In Figure 1, the structure of the brain is shown in a simplified structure. Circles represent neurons, arrows between neurons represent axons, the neurons painted by red represent first neurons which are assigned to the first auditory information, the neurons painted by black represent first neurons which are assigned to the first visual information, Hear6 represents one of the neurons which contains auditory information, See7 represents one of the neurons which contains visual information, Hear6+See7 represents the neuron which is assigned to a complex information related to the information in Hear6 and See7.", "The case is about a boy. The boy had a tumor in the back of his brain. Doctors removed the tumor, by removing 1/3 of his brain\u2019s right hemisphere. He could lose his sight after surgery, because the area which is removed was assigned to for vision, but he didn\u2019t lose it.", "I will take the parts from the article and explain it by relating the case to the structure of brain and nerves I explained above. I won\u2019t use the boy\u2019s name, because his parents may not want it. I will just write \u201cboy\u201d to express him.", "Surgeons cut out the lobes that are important for processing the information that passes through our eyes\u2019 optic nerves, allowing us to see while they are are also critical for recognizing faces and objects and attaching corresponding names. There was no way of being sure whether the boy would ever see again, recognize his parents, or even develop normally after the surgery.", "Despite the loss of more than 15 percent of his brain, the boy turned out to be fine.", "The one exception is the loss of peripheral vision in his left eye.", "\u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s blurred or it\u2019s just black there. It\u2019s, like, all blended,\u201d the boy says.", "The left side has assumed all the responsibilities and tasks of his now largely missing right side.", "The fact that the brain has a malleable(forgeable) capacity to change itself isn\u2019t new. What\u2019s less understood is how exactly the brain does it.", "It is said that the way the brain forges itself is unknown. How it is done according to my brain structure model is told in article 1.", "To what extent can the remaining structures of boy\u2019s brain take over the functions of the part of his brain that was removed?", "The answer is yes. The remaining structure of boy\u2019s brain can take over the functions which are placed in the removed part of his brain. He will be as normal as anybody.", "And can science describe how the brain carries out these changes, all the way down to the cellular level?", "The changes are explained below in the Figure 1.", "When the boy had seizure: \u201cIt\u2019s like my brain froze,\u201d he says. \u201cI was really confused, and then I\u2019d get really nauseous, throw up, and then I\u2019d be kind of acting normal again.\u201d", "Disturbance of electrical activity in the brain causes seizures. The neurons start passing electricity randomly without any input. The reason was the tumor he had. The tumor cells created unplanned electrical activities in brain. It is like giving a random input to your neurons. Because of this, he gets confused and nauseous. When the random inputs are finished, the seizure ends and he feels normal again. But having seizures for a long time would cause structural disturbance in his neurons, which may later cause memory loss permanently or, non-functioning neurons. That\u2019s why it was crucial for him to have the surgery.", "\u201cWe know that the pediatric brain has plasticity, [and] that we\u2019re constantly creating new algorithms in the brain to live life. But when you have seizures on top of that, those disrupted electrical networks that are the seizures prevent any kind of meaningful remapping.\u201d says Christina Patterson.", "Reason for having problem with meaning remapping is the unbalanced electrical activities. As it is shown in Figure 2, new connections between neurons are created with respect to the electrical charge of the neurons.", "The boy recognized his parents after the surgery, but he couldn\u2019t match their faces to their names. The problem resolved itself in a couple of days.", "As it looks like, the boy also lost some axons and neurons which connect the names and faces of his parents. An example of connection creation between two neurons assigned with information before can be seen in Figure 2. The boy lost this kind of connection in his brain after the surgery. So, he could not match the faces and names of his parents.", "Children\u2019s brains are young and still developing and therefore have the most potential for neuroplastic change.", "The neurons are assigned in an order. I told that they start being assigned to information by the closest neurons to input doors. When we get old, the information we learn gets more complex. Because of this, losing the neurons which are assigned to base information may affect an adult\u2019s life more dramatically than the boy. But, if the adult loses the neurons assigned to complex information (for example removing a part from frontal lobe), it will be easier to recover the lost information while it affects the adult\u2019s life less.", "In the 1960s, scientists David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel mapped the visual cortex of kittens to learn how vision is processed. Then, in an admittedly grisly procedure, the scientists closed (sewed) the eyelid of one of the kittens in the study. Upon opening the eyelid, they found that the visual areas of the kitten\u2019s brain responsible for processing images from that eye didn\u2019t develop, leaving the kitten blind in that eye, even though nothing was biologically wrong with the eye. The researchers discovered that if kittens\u2019 brains were to develop normally, they had to be able to see the world around them between their third and eighth weeks of life.", "As we see, the kitten with sewed eye could not see with the sewed eye well, while it can use its other eye very well. David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel closed the input door of the eye to the brain. Because there were not inputs coming, there were no neurons assigned to visual information near to input door.", "But another discovery from the study proved even more important \u2014 and earned Hubel and Wiesel the Nobel Prize. \u201cThe part of the kitten\u2019s brain that had been deprived of input from the shut eye did not remain idle,\u201d Doidge writes. \u201cIt had begun to process visual input from the open eye, as though the brain didn\u2019t want to waste any \u2018cortical real estate\u2019 and had found a way to rewire itself.\u201d", "After some time, even though there were no inputs coming from the closed eye, more neurons were needed to assign the visual information from the open eye. The closest place was the other unused side which is close to the optical nerve of closed eye. So, they go on being assigned to information from there.", "In boy\u2019s case, the question was whether the fully intact left hemisphere of his brain would pick up the functionality of the missing third of his brain, especially the task of facial recognition, which is typically carried out by the right hemisphere.", "By analyzing brain scans using a neuroimaging technique known as diffusion tensor imaging, which shows how water travels along the brain\u2019s white-matter tracts, Behrmann has found that the white matter of the brain the (electrical wiring) that underlines communication between multiple neurological regions actually changes. Areas of the brain that weren\u2019t connected before create new links, an example of neuroplasticity in action that may preserve brain functionality. But scientists still don\u2019t know what triggers the cells of the white matter to behave in this way.", "The paragraph above assures the structure and functioning that I presented in Figure 2.", "In a follow-up study Marlene Behrmann conducted with the boy and nine other children (all of whom are missing areas of either their left or right hemisphere) eight of them, including the boy, showed absolutely normal vision function. The two who did not are children whose brain damage from seizures was more severe prior to their surgeries.", "As I said above, the seizures may cause permanent memory loss or, non-functioning neurons. In the case of non-functioning neurons, if there are enough number of healthy neurons left in the brain close to input doors enough to make connection, the visual information still can be assigned to those healthy neurons. If there are no more healthy neurons left or, if the remaining healthy neurons are not close enough to make a polarity between neurons so that they make connection, then the deprived visual information cannot be assigned to a new neuron.", "It may even be the case, Taylor Abel and Behrmann point out, that some of the reorganization that took place in boy\u2019s brain started prior to his scheduled surgery. It\u2019s not something Behrmann can prove, since all the research conducted on boy has taken place post-surgery.", "\u201cWhen you have an abnormality in your brain that\u2019s causing seizures, that abnormality can actually cause the brain to reorganize or start reorganizing before the surgery actually takes place,\u201d Abel says. \u201cBut the other thing that sometimes happens is that the seizures affect the functions in the brain, and the brain doesn\u2019t reorganize.\u201d", "According to the proposed structure of neurons and brain, if the seizures are local and not affecting all the brain, then the unused neurons which are close to the neurons affected by seizure can connect to the base neurons of the affected neurons to assign the information. By this, the information is retrieved.", "The answer is YES. Structure is same, but the amount of neurons and input door structure and output door structure (arms, tongue, mouth, legs, etc.) are different. Number of neurons can only affect the information amount that will be assigned to the neurons. But input structure and output structure are the only difference between humankind and all other mammals. If we would be able transform input doors of a dog to exactly same input doors of a human, we would see that the dog could be able to talk like a human. We also need to remember that the input doors that mammals have are enough developed to feel the pain and sadness as much as us. So, it becomes more sad when we remember the bad behaviors made to animals. Because there is not any difference between making those bad behaviors to human and to an animal.", "AI Developer In \u201c>\u201d, Interested in Artificial Intelligence, Human Intelligence,
