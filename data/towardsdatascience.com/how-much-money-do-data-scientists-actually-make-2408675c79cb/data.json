Even amongst the same company, the range of salary can vary in the thousands depending on the seniority of the position. I have interviewed with several companies, and while I cannot say specifics about them and their respective salaries, I can attest to publicly documented salary ranges provided online. I will be outlining the three main seniority tiers of data science positions along with their salary ranges. Additionally, I will comment on roles that could provide more or less money based on the required skills within the job description. I will report the salary from a reputable website and also comment on a generalized salary from my experience.", "Salary is always a touchy subject, whether you are not allowed to talk about it, or do not want to talk about it. Our society has made it incredibly taboo to discuss salaries, which I completely disagree with. I know there are companies that are working to make their salaries public as Indeed does. However, you could really get wronged by an employer if you unconfidently suggest a salary that you think is somewhat high, but still pretty low relatively, and then later find out that the company was planning on offering thousands over what you suggested. But, since you suggested the salary first, the company just then saved a ton of money, which seems incredibly wrong to do of them. It is almost as if employers want their employees and their peers to not know what they are making salary-wise to protect them, but then it backfires, because you will have, say, 10 employees, who have the same experience with highly varying degrees of salary, and it eventually gets out and feelings can then be hurt.", "The biggest snippets of advice I can give to anyone negotiating salary, not just data scientists, is to know your worth, be honest with yourself, and to not settle for less. Do not ask for hundreds of thousands of dollars, but look at the average salary, and ask yourself, what have I done to do better in my career and education so far. To add to my advice, I want to give readers a summarized report of reported salary and generalized salary expectations from my personal experience. All of my salary output will be in regards to dollars of the United States.", "Continue reading below if you want to know more about the data science salary from the three different sub positions, along with comments on additional compensation.", "A role like junior data scientist does not last very long, so do not worry if this salary range is not up to your standards or expectations. Because data science is a fairly new position in the workforce, or at least officially as a title, most junior roles consist of just your first position, which will most likely last a year. After that, you can work towards a normal, mid-level tier data scientist position. But let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves. Because Indeed has up-to-date (it will include the updated at date with the day, month, and year) and popular information on salaries in general, I will be using them as my main reference for salary.", "Here is the average salary for a junior data scientist:", "Indeed Reported Junior Data Scientist Salary Approximation [2] \u2014 $86,000", "They also have a range of $32,000 to $168,000, which seems a little outrageous. Therefore, I will give a little of my own input. I would say from generalizing that you can expect a more specific and narrowed down range of:", "My Reported Junior Data Scientist Salary Approximation \u2014 $90,000", "However, I do know of some junior positions offering much less, but I simply would try to apply somewhere else if you can, especially if you have a master\u2019s degree.", "A mid-level data scientist can also be thought of as a normal, average data scientist with 1\u20133 years of experience, some would say 2\u20133 instead. After you get that first year done with, you will have more confidence in not only your data science abilities, but your abilities to negotiate as well. Some companies may offer less or more than what I will report on below; however, it is also important to know in general what you know your worth is. When interviewing, do not shyly provide what you think could and might make, but tell them what you know you should make. It is critical to look at other characteristics than just years of experience, but these as well:", "To me, this reported summary salary seems a little high; however, it could be weighed more from people who have three years of experience versus those with one or two, or from reports in larger, more expensive-to-live-in cities.", "I believe if you are looking for a role right after your first year, something around $110,000 is more accurate.", "A senior role in data science typically is anywhere from three to infinity amount of years. There are other roles that sometimes suggest higher than a senior position and salary like:", "Indeed Reported Senior Data Scientist Salary Approximation [4] \u2014 $151,000", "I believe this reported salary is a little too high; however, if you are in cities like New York City, San Francisco, and Los Angeles, salaries could exceed this average.", "I think this is a more fair expectation for a senior role if you are just getting to that level.", "As with all of these reported salaries, I assume that you are going from the previous position to the next, so you will, therefore, be at the lower end of the salary range.", "Opposingly, you can expect to exceed over the average for all three of these roles once you are already at a senior position, for example, switching to another senior position.", "Other ways to increase your salary are to widen your skillset. Some skills that are typically lucrative include, but are not limited to:", "There are forms of pay other than salary to keep note of. Those forms usually include bonuses (5\u201315% of salary per year) and stocks.", "Of course, there are multiple sites and information from personal experiences for generalizing data scientists' salaries, but it is always changing, and is based on a variety of factors. The best thing you can do is to do your research, assess where you are in your career, and go for a salary that fits your expectations.", "I hope you enjoyed my article.
