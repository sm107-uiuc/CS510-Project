I\u2019ve worked as an architect for 4 years, and I know the frustrations that architects, engineers, and contractors face when it comes to building code compliance. There needs to be a better way to design code-compliant buildings \u2014 and there is, thanks to a startup named UpCodes.", "As a brief overview\u2014 building codes are standards that ensure building user safety and accessibility. For example, building codes restrict long distances to an exit in case of a fire, they require more doors in rooms that contain more people, and enforce a maximum height for steps on stairs.", "While building codes are not meant to inhibit the creativity of architects and designers, it can often be an obstacle to creative solutions to a design problem. Architects often see diagrams of what is code compliant \u2014 and just want to provide exactly what is shown to ensure compliance. Suffice it to say, building code can be a frustrating and agonizing requirement that often inhibits the creative flow of the design process.", "To further complicate things, the enforceable building code can be different from one jurisdiction to another. Different building codes may be adopted at the local level or state level, which can get really confusing! There are maps and other documents that show code adoption by state.", "Without going into too much detail, for example, a new apartment building in Miami, Florida will have different building code requirements than the same building in San Francisco, California. In Miami \u2014 the building code insists on design requirements that address the potential for hurricanes and storm surge, while in San Francisco \u2014 the building code posits the need for more robust construction for the building to endure earthquakes.", "Once we figure out the building codes that the jurisdiction uses, we have to make sure we reference the right section of the code. There are different chapters that address various aspects of the building design. There are chapters on occupancy, building height & area, building construction type, egress, interior finishes, and more.", "So as we design the building, we have to hunt through the pages of a physical codebook (or a PDF document if you\u2019re lucky) to find the right section that we need to reference to ensure compliance. The IBC 2018 (a common building standard) alone has 726 pages \u2014 and that's probably one of many building codes that your project has to comply with. So you likely have to reference thousands of pages for your project.", "It can take years to develop enough experience and expertise as an architect to become familiar enough with building code to develop a sensibility for code-compliant design. What I\u2019ve noticed is this: younger designers often are not sure if a particular design decision is code-compliant or not, until more senior architects can check their work. This leads to a lack of confidence to design safe and accessible spaces, having to re-do work, and success hinges on the reliance of older, more experienced staff.", "So now that you understand the headache of building code, there\u2019s got to be a better way, right? Since the advent of computers, tech companies have revolutionized the way that architects design buildings. Autodesk has transformed the way that architects produce drawings through AutoCAD and Revit. Adobe has transformed the way architects produce diagrams, renderings, and presentations through Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign. So, how can tech address the problem of building code compliance?", "Enter: UpCodes. This startup has wrangled the power of data and software development to create two tools for architects. The first tool is UpCodes Web \u2014 which is a search engine, (think Google) enhanced with machine learning and analytics, with the sole purpose to find the building code you need, super fast. The second tool is UpCodes AI \u2014 which is a plug-in for Revit that allows us to view code errors in real-time! These tools have the potential to save AEC professionals thousands of painstaking hours per year.", "Instead of checking across multiple codebooks, websites, or PDFs, Upcodes Web is a one-stop-shop for finding building code. By providing \u201cproject inputs\u201d like our building type, construction type, sprinkler system, and building occupancy classes, UpCodes can filter to only show building code that uniquely pertains to our project. This helps architects and engineers of all ages navigate the code more swiftly and confidently.", "Sometimes, jurisdictions will make modifications to common building codes, like the International Building Code (IBC) \u2014 and UpCodes helps us identify those changes. UpCodes keeps the UpCodes Web tool up-to-date with any amendments that our jurisdiction may have put into effect recently, so we are always looking at the most current guidelines.", "In the early phases of design, architects need to determine a construction type that supports the scale of the building. In general, the larger and/or taller a building gets, the more robust the construction system has to be. There are restrictions related to building area, floor numbers, and building height that change with the building occupancy, construction type, and other factors. To address this \u2014 the UpCodes Web tool has a calculator functionality that, after providing your \u201cproject inputs\u201d, allows us to check that we haven\u2019t exceeded allowable building area, building height, or the number of floors.", "UpCodes Web has turned code research into a more friendly and engaging social activity! By creating a project within UpCodes Web, teammates can comment, bookmark, and share code excerpts that may require further review or may provoke design changes in the project. We can have a conversation about the building code while looking at the building code.", "UpCodes AI is a plug-in for Autodesk Revit. For those of you who are Revit users out there, have you ever had this thought:", "\u201cIt would be so nice if Revit just told me if this (stair, corridor, door, ADA toilet, etc\u2026) is code compliant or not.\u201d", "Guess what: that\u2019s exactly what UpCodes AI does! Currently, the program focuses on just two aspects of building code: egress and ADA. In the future, hopefully, more facets of building code will be supported to make the tool more holistic and robust.", "To use the tool, you just download and install the plug-in, and it integrates with your existing Revit model \u2014 automatically analyzing the model\u2019s components and geometry. The tool flags and sorts building code errors by category, whether its ADA, bathrooms, or doors. We can click into these categories to highlight individual issues in the model. From here, we can make the necessary design changes to be code-compliant. This tool has the potential to change the way we use building code, integrated into the primary software that we use to model and document the building design. No longer do we have to wait for a code review from more experienced and senior architects (or an external consultant). With this tool, everyone can check their work for code compliance as they go. UpCodes AI allows us to check our work as we design, rather than after designing. Check out the video demo of UpCodes AI below.", "When we view issues in UpCodes AI, the tool gives us a display that shows specific code information related to the error. First, it gives us a brief overview of the issue. Second, it interprets the often cryptic language of the building code into \u201clayman\u2019s terms\u201d so that everyone can understand the problem. Third, it provides the original code excerpt for reference, which can take you to the UpCodes Web app with a single click, to view more of the building code if desired. And finally, it itemizes every code violation instance in our model \u2014 and we can use the \u201cInspect\u201d button to visually explore each violation. See the diagram below.", "Over time, UpCodes automatically updates with new features. Feedback from users of UpCodes AI determines how the tool is developed and evolves. They prioritize the most popular requests from user feedback. You can contribute by leaving feedback to the UpCodes AI changelog here.", "It would be interesting to learn more about how UpCodes AI tool works under the hood, and how it could be improved moving forward. Is it simply accessing Revit parameters that guide dimensions of modeled elements to determine compliance?", "How else can UpCodes AI use machine learning algorithms to predict problem areas? Can it use Natural Language Processing to extract the meaning of that room name, to then predict and assign those rooms an occupancy class? Or does it have to rely on occupancy class parameters that architects manually input in the Revit model? There are likely many ways that this tool can potentially improve through data science and machine learning / AI endeavors.", "UpCodes seeks to disrupt the way that architects design buildings, in a more inclusive and user-friendly way. Essentially, building code is a collection of rules that architects and engineers must abide by to create safe and accessible spaces for people to use. As a profession, we have always manually checked those rules for compliance across several different resources, until now.", "UpCodes Web has centralized building code into a single web app and harnesses project data to make code-compliance easier and more intuitive. UpCodes AI takes this a step further and allows us to code-check within the software environment that architects are used to. The future of architecture lies with data and the ways we can use it to be more productive and effective to design our built environment. UpCodes may be a big part of this future.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Business Intelligence Manager @ Turner & Townsend.
