What exactly is AI? How did it come about? Is it a modern day phenomenon? What has the history of AI been like, what is the present situation and what does the future look like?", "Before I started working, whenever I heard the word AI I would think of robots and of super computers being able to think like humans. My impression of AI was influenced by movies such as Terminator or Age of Ultron. But as expected, I realized later that these were as close to reality as anything else from Hollywood could be.", "In that case what is an AI or how do we define what an AI is? One possible definition that comes from Wikipedia defines AI as:", "The simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions", "Simple and straight forward on first glance, but is it though? Lets take an example of a simple tool that we have been using since we were kids: a calculator.", "It is a machine that has been programmed to do what humans invented and something that only we can do, mathematical operations.", "As such shouldn\u2019t it be considered as an example of AI?", "If it is indeed one, then what is so new today that so many people are talking about? Does it deserve all the attention it is getting now?", "To know more about this we need to dive a bit into the history of AI and what is known as symbolic/classical AI.", "The goal of classical AI was to explicitly represent human knowledge using facts and rules. That is you program a machine with some rules and when you input a query, it gives the answer based on the rules.", "Taking the example of the calculator, it is programmed with the rules of mathematical operations and when you input 2+3, it returns 5.", "Expert systems such as WebMD are another example. WebMD has a database of medical knowledge and rules compiled by experts from the medical field such as doctors. When you input your symptoms into it, it goes through the database to find what you could possibly be suffering from.", "While classical AI worked very well in certain situation, but it still suffered from a major problem, that of rules. What if there are lots of rules or if the rules are not well defined. In these situations it becomes difficult to codify or specify the rules explicitly. One example is if you want a machine to identify a cat, what rules would you specify to be able to identify it?", "All these problems led to a mismatch between the expectations and realities of AI and led to an AI \u2018winter\u2019. During this period, primarily in the 70s and 80s, there were a lot of funding cuts towards AI research and the pace of growth slowed down.", "There\u2019s a popular joke which goes: whats the difference between AI and automation? The answer being automation is something that has already been achieved and AI is something that has not been.", "Humans have from time immemorial have tried to get machines and contraptions to do what they do or at least make it easy. Be it anything like the printing press or automatons to transport water. It started off by having machines do simple tasks and as humanity advanced, have it do more complex tasks. As such classical AI is simply a continuation of that trend and served well during that time period. But with advancements we needed a different form of AI, one that could do even more complex tasks that classical AI could not.", "Modern AI is the latest incarnation of AI which is meant to handle many of the weaknesses of classical AI. Unlike classical AI, modern AI doesn\u2019t need people to explicitly specify rules for it. It is capable of learning rules on it own.", "You specify the inputs/queries and the expected outputs/answers to a machine and it can infer and extract the rules and patterns required to get from the input to the output. If you want a machine to be able to identify cats, you give it tons of cat pictures and have it understand what are the common features of cats. Then whenever it sees another cat it is able to match its features and identify it as one.", "In that way it is similar to how people learn. Nobody explained to you what a cat looks like, you saw cat pictures or real cats and yourself understood what are its features.", "Modern AI is in short a powerful method of pattern recognition and in many ways mimics how people learn.", "The rise in modern AI can be attributed to three factors:", "Recent years have seen a rise in the amount of data collected from the internet or from the devices you use. The rise in computing power due to better CPUs and GPUs means that the vast amounts of data aren\u2019t simply stored in databases but can now be used. This allows for applying new statistical models on the vast amounts of data using better computing resources to extract valuable information and patterns. We can in short call this as machine learning.", "Lets take one example such as facebook\u2019s friend recommendation algorithm. For instance say person A has many friends made over the years. The algorithm is able to pick up on all these friends and then creates a network allowing it to find common patterns. In the network there might be predominant clusters formed corresponding to the circles he moves in. One cluster might correspond to people he knows from childhood, other cluster is people he met in university, another of colleagues and so on.", "From these clusters the algorithm is able to learn and identify common features and then predict who else person A might be knowing and recommend them as friends.", "Here machine learning is used to teach/learn the rules and patterns and AI is the action of applying it to recommend friends. Classical AI used rules to power AI and modern AI uses machine learning to power AI. Over time the definition of AI has not changed, only that which powers it and makes decisions.", "Data, and not just any amount of data but huge amounts of data. But why large? Say an AI was exposed to this image of a cat:", "But then it wont be able to identify either this:", "as a cat. With a small amount of data modern AI becomes very narrow and it takes a lot of data to generalize.", "And its not just data, but labelled data. You might have lots of data/pictures online but you also need to know what it means. Is this a photo of an elephant, is this a cat? Which is why you often hear people saying \u2018data is the new oil\u2019(maybe not nowadays). Proper data, and not just data but labelled data is hard to come by and is extremely important for modern AI.", "Any AI is only as good as its training data. If the data contains any bias then the AI will also inherit it. Some examples might be job recruitment algorithms or loan approving algorithms. If a company did not hire many women before then any AI trained on its past hires will also learn to discriminate against women. As such great care needs to be taken while training and using AI for any day to day purposes.", "Most AIs today are narrow AIs, they can only do what they are trained on and fall flat while trying to do anything outside their domain. Added to that AIs see the world differently compared to what we as humans do. Both these suggest that something like a general purpose AI or for that matter a self-conscious AI seem like a distant possibility. There might be a requirement for a completely new theory to address these challenges.", "Research towards AI will continue on considering the recognition of its importance and what its capabilities are. This will lead to better performance and more proliferation of AI in various fields. In time it might be as common place and ubiquitous as a mobile phone. Will it replace humans? I think not, it will act more as a complement to what people can do, enabling us to make better decisions by giving us more information. Think of it like how Iron Man operates, an ordinary man using AI to augment his decision making in battle. Ultimately only time will tell.", "Your home for data science.
