It sheds light on how I identified a problem and thought about it from an optimization perspective. Optimization is not just a mathematical research topic. If wielded correctly, it can be used to solve real problems which apply to different disciplines.", "With the right techniques, one can model the problem to maximize/minimize for a certain outcome.", "Management science is an approach to decision making based on the scientific method. It makes extensive use of quantitative analysis. A variety of names exists for the body of knowledge involving quantitative approaches to decision making; in addition to management science, two other widely known and accepted names are operations research and decision science.", "Two developments that occurred during the post\u2013World War II period led to the growth and use of management science in nonmilitary applications.", "Problem-solving is the process of identifying a difference between the actual and the desired state of affairs and then taking action to resolve the difference. Decision making refers to structuring the problem and then analyzing it to choose an alternative. When we are experiencing a lot of success, it is difficult to comprehend the need for making decisions using data. Our intuition (read ego) really downplays the role of luck in the decision you have made that has yielded a favourable result.", "Data Science has taught me the importance of quantification during the decision making process. Adding numbers or quantifying the probability of an outcome helps alleviate ambiguity in the situation and adds consistency to the decision. Without a proper data-driven analysis, as a decision-maker, you leave yourself vulnerable to all kinds of biases and wishful thinking.", "The field of Analytics is growing at an exponential pace; terms such as AI (Artificial Intelligence), ML (Machine Learning) and Deep Learning are commonly used in the Tech Industry. Personally, amongst all of these areas of practice, there is an often underappreciated discipline \u2014 Optimization. I recently worked on an optimization problem which is something we generally encounter when trying to plan an event or schedule a meeting.", "Earlier this year, my father was appointed as the President of a local Toastmasters club in our area. Toastmasters International is a nonprofit educational organization that operates clubs worldwide to promote communication, public speaking and leadership. One of his tasks was to assign roles to each of the members in the club for prospective meetings.", "During his term as the President, he would be chairing 27 meetings, and the current strength of the club was 26 members (including himself). There are different roles that a member can play in each meeting, such as that of a \u2018Speech Evaluator\u2019, \u2018Speaker\u2019 or \u2018Table Topics master\u2019. To successfully conduct a meeting, 17 roles have to be assigned to the different members present.", "My father created an excel spreadsheet in which he tried his heuristic best to assign roles to each member in a logical manner. After several frustrating attempts, he asked me to have a look at his on-going masterpiece. From a planning perspective, it wasn\u2019t an impossible task. Through multiple trial-and-error iterations, we would be able to solve the problem. However, my fundamental issue with it was that if there was another member who joined during his term or somebody dropped out. This time-consuming process had to be repeated.", "I told him I would be keen to develop a model to improve the rostering for his club. Mathematical models are a critical part of any quantitative approach to decision making.", "For example, if it takes 10 hours to build a custom table, 10x is the mathematical model the defines the total number of hours invested in constructing x tables.", "For me, the main objective of this exercise was to develop a fair way to assign roles to each individual and maximize their engagement over the season. There were several other requirements that the mathematical model had to follow:", "Given below is the formulation of the problem to develop Toastmaster\u2019s Maximum Engagement Roster.", "For example, if x_10_2_3 had the value 1, it meant that member number 10 in the second meeting would perform role number 3.", "2. Defining the objective functionStated earlier, the model is trying to maximize the engagement of each member in the club", "3. Setting up the constraintsAs with any optimization problem, the constraints of the model usually require the most analytical reasoning. I prefer to break the problem down into a toy example and test how the model behaves when a particular constraint is applied.", "An important part of the quantitative analysis process is the preparation of reports based on the model\u2019s solution. The decision-maker must easily understand the results of the report. It should include the recommended decision and other pertinent information about the results that may be helpful to the decision-maker.", "Upon solving the rostering model above, I decided to create an excel report that printed out the values of each decision variable. There were 11,934 decision variables in this model which again reinforced the argument to solve this problem using programming.", "For programming, I assigned a numerical value to the variable \u2018Role\u2019 and mapped it using the table below.", "The table reads that Role 5 corresponds to the first speaker in the meeting.", "As you can see from the snapshot of the excel report above, the Value of 1 activates the decision variable. This implies that Member 10 has been assigned the role of Speech Evaluator 4 for Meeting 10.", "To make this easier for the decision-maker to comprehend, I created a simple pivot table in Excel.", "As seen from the report above, each member has gotten the opportunity to perform every role at least once. The cell values of 0 imply that the corresponding member on that particular meeting isn\u2019t assigned a role.", "As I approach towards the end of the article, given below are a few key learnings I have picked up as a part of the research, and I would like to summarize them for your benefit.", "Thank you for reading until the end. I hope this article motivates you to analyse different problems in your life using a more quantitative lens.", "For anyone interested, the code can be found in my GitHub repository. Feel free to download it and analyze the information for your use case.", "[1] Anderson, Sweeney, Williams, Camm, Cochran, Fry, Ohlmann.
