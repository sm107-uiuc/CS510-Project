Here are some practical tips I\u2019ve accumulated through my Kaggle journey. So, either build your own model or just start from a baseline public kernel, and try implementing these suggestions !", "Although Kaggle\u2019s policy is to never feature twice an identical competition, there are often remakes of very similar problems. For example, some hosts propose a regular challenge on the same theme yearly (NFL\u2019s Big Data Bowl for example), with only small variations, or in some fields (like medical imaging for example) there are a lot of competitions with different targets but very similar spirit.", "Reviewing winners\u2019 solutions (always made public after competition ends thanks to the incredible Kaggle community) can therefore be a great plus, as it gives you ideas to get started, and a winning strategy. If you have time to review a lot of them, you will also soon find out that, even in very different competitions, some popular baseline models seem to always do the job well enough :", "You can either look for similar competitions on the Kaggle platform directly, or take a look at this great summary by Sundalai Rajkumar.", "Reviewing past competitions can also help you get hints on all the other steps explained in the following. For example, getting tips and tricks on preprocessing for similar problems, how people choose their hyperparameters, what additional tools they have implemented in their models to have them win the game, or if they focused on bagging only similar versions of their best models or rather ensembled a melting pot of all available public kernels.", "This is far from being the most thrilling part of the job. However, the importance of this step cannot be overemphasized.", "Preprocessing is also the step where you have to carefully think about what cross-validation method you will rely on. Kaggle\u2019s motto could basically be : Trust Your CV. Working on your data will help you know how to split it : stratify on target values or on sample categories ? Is your data unbalanced ? If you have a clever CV strategy, and rely solely on it and not on leaderboard score (though it may be very tempting), then you\u2019re very likely to get good surprises on private final scores.", "Hyperparameter searching helps you find the optimal parameters (learning rate, temperature of softmax, \u2026) your model should have in order to get the best possible performance, without having to run a thousand boring experiments by hand.", "The most common hyperparameter searching strategies include :", "There are many AutoML tools that can do the job very well for you. Just take a look at the excellent Medium & TowardsDataScience ressources on this topic :", "However, you have to be careful and keep a solid intuition of what hyperparameters values mean. If you don\u2019t have a solid validation set and homogeneous data, hyperparameter optimization pushed too far can lead into the overfitting-lion\u2019s den. Always prefer some rationally explainable parameter choice to a millidecimal accuracy win on training data.", "I have found that there are some model wrappers you can use to get better results. They work on different levels :", "Apart from data augmentation, there is probably no technique more efficient than blending (also known as bagging) to improve your performance.", "My personal tip is that I always save each and every model prediction I have run, both from my folds and from final models, and I average all of them (just basic averaging, I never found any evidence that \u201cclever\u201d ensembling such as weighting models by their solo performance was adding anything in final score). Don\u2019t forget to blend public kernels as well.", "The more models you have in your ensemble strategy, the more likely you are to survive private leaderboard shakeup. Indeed, diversifying your models make your final result more robust. It is the same idea as the one underlying portfolio diversification in finance : instead of one asset with a given return and a given variance, take a lot of different assets of same return and same variance, since it is much less likely that they will all draw down simultaneously, and losses on one will be compensated by wins on others. In the same idea, instead of relying solely on one model, make a lot of different models vote : the target predicted by the majority of them (in classification) or the mean of the targets predicted by each (in regression) will very likely be closer to the true answer.", "Your home for data science.
