Ethnologue.com (21st edition) has data to indicate that of the currently listed 7,111 living languages, 3,995 have a developed writing system (such as English, French, Yemba, Chinese, \u2026). NLP applications include text categorization, spelling & grammar correction, information extraction, speech recognition, machine translation, text to speech synthesis, synonym generation, as well as more advanced domains such as summarization, question answering, dialog systems and speech imitation.", "In this post, we review existing approaches in solving Truecasing on a practical example. Truecasing is a NLP problem of finding the proper capitalization of words within a text where such information is unavailable. Truecasing aids in NLP tasks, such as named entity recognition, automatic content extraction, and machine translation. Proper capitalization enables easier detection of proper nouns, and helps increasing accuracy in translation.", "There are several practical approaches to the Truecasing problem:", "We will explore each approach, looking for existing open-source libraries and code snippets. We will implement and test the promising approaches and explain how they work or do not. Finally we will come up with a recommendation, as well as open concern and future work.", "Let\u2019s consider the sentence below, where most words are in low-case.", "The Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is well-known by computer linguists and NLP specialists. It was originally created in 2001 as part of a computational linguistics course at the University of Pennsylvania. It provides an intuitive framework along with substantial building blocks, giving users a practical knowledge of NLP without getting bogged down in the tedious house-keeping usually associated with processing annotated languagedata. NLTK is installed by running the following commands on a Python Anaconda prompt.", "NLTK comes with Tokenizers. They work similar to regular expressions and are used to divide strings into lists of substrings. Especially, the sentence tokenizer is used below to find the list of sentences in our text.", "As we see the first word if each sentence is correctly capitalized. However words like john or london remain to be handled properly.", "In order to be able to recognize the words john and london as a person name and a city, we use the so-called Part of Speech technique, which is the process of marking up a word in a text as corresponding to a particular part of speech, based on both its definition and its context. It is a supervised learning solution based on context, trained on the popular Penn Treebank tagset. The POS tagger in the NLTK library outputs specific tags for certain words. For example NN stands for a noun, in singular, such as stone, john, and guy. NNS stands for plural nouns. Below we capitalize all nouns in our text.", "As we see, the POS method achieves better result than the sentence segmentation method. However we are capitalizing words like grass and dog which should not be capitalized in standard English.", "spaCy is a fast library for industrial-grade NLP. It supports word vectors, semantic distributions and has many statistical models, which we can use not only for better part-of-speech tagging (POS), but also for named entity recognition (NER).", "While part-of-speech tagging (POS) tagging aims on identifying which grammatical group a word belongs to, so whether it is a noun, adjective, pronoun, etc.; named entity recognition (NER) on the other hand tries to find out whether or not a word is a named entity, such as persons, locations, organizations, etc.", "spaCy comes with pre-trained language models, usually convolutional neural networks for various language processing tasks, such as POS and NER. We will be using the en_core_web_lg model, an English multi-task CNN (700 MB). It is also possible to use a smaller model en_core_web_sm (10 MB) with slightly worse results.", "spaCy is installed by running the command pip install -U spacy, followed by python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg on the Anaconda prompt to download the model. Below we display the words in our text with their corresponding POS tags and NER.", "We obtain more detailed tagging than with NLTK, but we can still can\u2019t make the difference between NN tags for objects (stone) and cities (london). Although john is recognized as a person by the NER processor, spaCy does not recognize the first instance of the word stone as a person.", "The task of inferring the correct capitalization often presents ambiguity: consider the word stone in the sentences he has a stone and he talks to stone. While the former relates to an object, the latter refers to a human person. A statistical method for truecasing was suggested in this paper to deal with such ambiguity. We adapted its implementation below.", "This model requires information on the frequencies of unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams obtained on a training corpus. Such a pre-trained set of frequencies is provided by the author, and is referred below as distributions_english.obj.", "This appears to be the best result achieved so far. Issue remains to identify the first instance of the word stone as a person name, that should be capitalized. Although famous names like snow are correctly recognized and capitalized by the algorithm, stone is not inferred as a person name. The word stone was probably not appearing as a person name in the training corpus used by the author of the method.", "StanfordNLP is a Python natural language analysis package, built on the top of PyTorch. It is recommended by the community especially for recognizing entities related to person names. It is a bridge to the Stanford CoreNLP, originally written in Java, but there are ways to use it even with NLTK (source).", "If not already installed, following packages are required:", "Additionally, we need to run the following command to download the English models for the neural pipeline. This will bring ca. 1.96G of data to our machine.", "The following code creates a pipeline with POS processor, and evaluates the StandfordNLP model on our text.", "The resulting POS tags obtained with StandfordNLP look great! The first instance of the word stone is now correctly recognized as a person name, allowing a correct capitalization as shown below.", "Stanford CoreNLP also provides a set of powerful tools. It can detect the base forms of words (lemma), parts of speech, names of companies, people, etc. It can also normalize dates, times and numeric quantities. It is also used to mark up phrases and syntactic dependencies, to indicate sentiment, and to get the quotes people said. StanfordNLP takes few lines of code to start utilizing CoreNLP\u2019s sophisticated API. For those who want to get deeper, check the post linked here.", "In this post, we investigated case restoration for text without case information. All techniques used were operating at the word level using the NLTK, spaCy and StandfordNLP toolkits. An approach using character-level recurrent neural networks (RNN) is proposed in the article linked here, for some heroes among us.", "Your home for data science.
