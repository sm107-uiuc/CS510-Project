A lot of sensible and responsible data visualisation measures have been emphasised lately. The most notable ones are from Lisa Charlotte Rost, Amanda Makulec, and Evan Peck. Let us deep dive to adopt some of their suggestions and generate similar adequate visualisations using the R software.", "Let\u2019s get the data from two sources \u2014 John Hopkins University COVID-19 Repository, and Oxford University Government Response Tracker(OxCGRT).", "The first database gives us country-wise and date-wise Confirmed, Recovered, and Deaths. A separate Active column was calculated by subtracting the numbers from recovered and deaths from confirmed. Let\u2019s check the first few rows and columns of the database.", "And the second database looks like:", "Clearly, the second database needed some refining and reshaping, as follows:", "The most basic and commonly observed COVID-19 visualisation is the cumulative bar graph.", "Easily obtained by using the ggplot2 package in R \u2014", "In the Global Cumulative Confirmed Cases graph, we can see that the cases started to emerge from the end of January (database limitation: We know that this is not true as China had cases much earlier than that. There were no data records for Jan in the database).", "Notice the sudden explosion in the number of cases?", "The cases summed up to 700k (1k=1000) over the first two months, but then almost doubled up further to reach 2000k in the less then a month.", "The same pattern can be observed in the number of deaths.", "However, apart from the significantly low numbers for deaths relative to confirmed cases, it is rather difficult to interpret the differences between the two graphs.", "This leads us to the follow up question \u2014 do we really need to visualise number of deaths individually as a scary-looking exponential increase? Public health professional, Amanda, quite aptly pens down \u2014", "\u201cCOVID-19 is NOT a death sentence, and our visualisations need to reflect that. Including recovered cases is an essential piece of context in visualising case numbers.\u201d", "We must convey clearly what the data reveals to us \u2014", "A senior data scientist, Robert Wood, had a good go at this. In our case, using the first database can solve both the points, as follows \u2014", "Right away we can see that this is not only visually appealing but also more adequate to this sensitive scenario as it caters to both the emphasis points above.", "Notice the deliberate use of manual colour fills? Reason?", "Unfortunately, there has been many COVID-related deaths. However, instead of visualising the cases with an alarming RED, adopt a different colour, like black (marks a sign of respect).", "Now if we want to get the estimates of each of the 3 components, we can make set the position parameter to dodge, inside geom_bar\u2014", "What if we want to observe the same but on a country by country basis? We can leverage from the option of facet_wrap\u2014", "Notice some issues with the above figure?", "Let\u2019s solve these issues using ggarrange function from the ggpubr package. But firstly, let\u2019s arrange the database in descending order of confirmed cases.", "Now we can pick these top countries in the facet grid. However, for ggarrange, we need to have individual ggplot objects for every country. Let\u2019s first create a function that does this job for us. And then apply it on all the desired countries.", "Now that we have the individual ggplot objects for all the countries, we are ready to use ggarrange. Keeping US separate on the left, and following 6 countries as a 3x2 matrix on the right.", "The previous visualisations were quite straightforward. We must do more. But these are fine lines, and we must be cautious \u2014", "Epidemic profiles are exponential curves and as the curve shoots up, it gets difficult to visualise and capture significant (and possibly useful) details. Sean Fleming, a senior writer at the World Economic Forum, wonderfully emphasises on the benefits of this logarithmic scale to get the bigger picture behind the pandemic data. These are further reflected in Lisa\u2019s excellent pandemic visualisations page at datawrapper.", "Let\u2019s see what we get with the log scale. And BOOM \u2014", "In the case of a pandemic, we MUST leave the microscopic level data analysis and interpretations to the epidemiologists. Plus, we must be mindful of all the data collection and recording uncertainties in every country. This motivates to smooth the profile of cumulative confirmed cases using a seven day rolling average. The rolling average can be calculated using the rollmean function \u2014", "Also, note that the x-axis corresponds to the number of days since the 100th case was registered in each country. Hence, let\u2019s create a separate column as a day counter (dc) after conditionally removing rows having number of cases less than 100. This aligns the confirmed-cases profile to start from the Day 1 and Confirmed Cases = 100 for all the countries.", "Finally let\u2019s represent the roll_means vs dc on a logarithmic scale using two variables, breaks and minor_breaks.", "Once again, owing to the uncertainties associated with total confirmed cases on a country to country level, it is best to visualise the same for total deaths to gauge how every country performed. Replicating all the above steps for deaths give us \u2014", "Now if we want to observe the rate of change in the numbers, say a change over 5-day periods, we can get some more insights from the data. We can use the lag() function to get the previous instance values.", "We smooth the growth rate using a 3-day rolling average this time and the growth rate vs day counter plot gives us \u2014", "We can straightaway notice the sinusoidal behaviour in the rate of change of change and while there has been an overall decline in the growth rates, some countries like India and Japan are more prone than others to experience an increase in the growth rate.", "Again, visualising death cases is always a safer bet to analyse the COVID-19 action. Hence, replicating the same steps for the number of deaths gives us \u2014", "We see some striking revelations here. Again, there is a general decrease in the rates of change in number of deaths. However, Japan\u2019s situation is worrisome with an increasing rate of change over the last almost 10 days. Similarly, US has also started to experience an increase in the rate of change.", "Data visualisation in the case of a pandemic requires a great degree of mindfulness and caution. We must realise that by sharing the work on public domain, we risk misinforming people and inciting fear amongst the masses. The aim should otherwise be to make people aware and aid in decision-making towards optimal possible health, well-being, and economic prosperity at a crisis situation. Following are some of the key pointers gathered\u2014", "The source code for all these graphs and the database can be found in my github repository.", "Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
