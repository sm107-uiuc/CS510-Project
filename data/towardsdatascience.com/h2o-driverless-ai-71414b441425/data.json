One of the leaders is H2O\u2019s Driverless AI offering. It has some great features that impressed me. One drawback I had in this evaluation was that I didn\u2019t have enough time to train the \u2018Watson\u2019 dataset properly. While the results are unavailable, I have been able to share enough of the experience for you to get a feel for the tool.", "I\u2019ve seen several demos of Driverless AI over the past couple of years. I\u2019ve done an evaluation myself using a trial in my AWS account in 2018. I know from experience and reputation; this is one of the top autoML tools available. They tout their visualizations, and I was impressed with them two years ago.", "Like DataRobot, Driverless AI is a licensed product. Since last year, Driverless AI is available through IBM as well as other cloud platforms. I am unable to find the exact license cost for one named user for 2020. Based on my research, the price appears to be comparable to the DataRobot cost of $80k per year.", "Lucky for us, we can do a free trial of Driverless AI. There are a couple of options. You can get 14 days on a cloud implementation or 2 hours of a hosted platform. In the past, I\u2019ve used the AWS Marketplace offering. For this demo, I\u2019m using the hosted platform. Two hours is a short period, so I need to be efficient.", "I set up an account on Aquarium. There are several labs available to work through. As suggested, I started the test drive lab. I was not initially sure if I could load my dataset. I was happy to see I could.", "Once the lab spun up, I got a URL that pointed to an AWS instance. Quick and easy.", "To keep parity across the tools in this series, I will stick to the Kaggle training file. Contradictory, My Dear Watson. Detecting contradiction and entailment in the multilingual text using TPUs. In this Getting Started Competition, we\u2019re classifying pairs of sentences (consisting of a premise and a hypothesis) into three categories \u2014 entailment, contradiction, or neutral.", "6 Columns x 13k+ rows \u2014 Stanford NLP documentation", "Loading the data is super easy, and some very nice visualizations are available before any training takes place. You can also add graphs to the list, so that\u2019s a nice feature. Most autoML tools aren\u2019t going to give you correlation graphs and radar plots. I thought the data heatmap was a bit weak, but that appears to have been due to the variety in the data (text). Interestingly when you download the visualizations, they arrive in .svg format. Nice if you have an Adobe license.", "It\u2019s pretty simple to get the models training. Launch Experiment. You can tune the Accuracy, Time, and Interpretability dials to what your preferences are. There are also MANY expert settings you can review.", "Between this main visualization and the logs, you can get an excellent idea of the progress your training job is making. I appreciate this! I may have been too aggressive with my dials, and I was not able to fully make it through an entire experiment during my time allotment.", "Well, I didn\u2019t have enough time to train the models with the time I had. I tried to start a new lab and try again, but I just got a \u2018waiting for worker\u2019 message for 45 minutes. I would have been interested in taking a look at the generated features. Feature generation is one of the noted differentiators of this tool.", "The good news is that there are pre-run projects that you can poke through on your own.", "I did see H2O added an AutoReport feature! Very nice addition. The report isn\u2019t quite as extensive as DataRobot\u2019s, but it\u2019s good work in the right direction.", "H2O has a free booklet on model interpretability that I highly recommend. They are a leader in this area.", "When you click Interpret this Model, you have to wait while the process runs. Don\u2019t stare at the screen or you\u2019ll find your eyes circling with the status\u2019.", "Slowly the explanations become available. The result is worth the wait.", "Driverless AI is a great tool. They provide interesting visualizations and allow you to add additional ones. The model interpretability metrics and graphs are terrific. As with DataRobot, you pay for greatness.", "The labs are free, so I encourage you to try them today. The pre-trained projects give you a good jump start so that you can take a look for yourself.", "If you missed one of the articles in the series, here are the links.", "Your home for data science.
