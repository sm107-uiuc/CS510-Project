You might think that your day to day\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/finnqiao/", "anchor_text": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/finnqiao/", "paragraph_index": 39}], "all_paragraphs": ["If you\u2019re in the middle of a statistics/computer science degree or in the midst of a career switch, you\u2019ll likely be in the market for a data science internship.", "You might think that your day to day would be comprised of cleaning data and trying out some scikit-learn models. But is that really the case?", "Like internships in all other industries, the real answer is: it depends.", "The goal of this article is to provide a brief overview on the key characteristics of data science internships that I\u2019ve gleaned from a series of networking calls, chatting with fellow interns across different organizations, and my own internship at DoorDash.", "There are two high level characteristics that define your time at your internship: degree of structure and role expectations.", "The article ends with a list of key questions that I\u2019ve found to be very effective in parsing out key pieces of information in helping you understand more about both the internship and organization.", "On the surface, it seems like the greatest determinant of your data science internship structure is the size of the company on paper.", "For example, a large technology company like Facebook is likely to have a built out, structured internship programs while a startup coming off their initial funding rounds might just throw ad-hoc projects at their interns. The reality is more nuanced than this and it would be more informative to understand the high level structure of data science internships.", "In these internship programs, you are likely to find yourself with a single project over the course of summer. There is often a key question that you are (trying) to answer and as such, clear expectations are laid out regarding what you should have achieved by the end of your 10\u201312 weeks. You might find yourself with a mini project or ad hoc assignment in the beginning just to ramp you up and get you familiarized with the organization\u2019s data infrastructure.", "You will find yourself with direct mentors or managers that you schedule weekly check-ins with. There are also a clear group of stakeholders that you will be reporting to and are likely who you\u2019ll be presenting your findings and results to in the end. This layer of organizational structure is incredibly valuable in understanding how organizations grow and construct their org charts.", "With regards to the technical stack and tooling, there are usually suites of internal tools and apps that are optimized for the daily operations of the organization and the way internal data is structured and stored. This usually also means a more structured on-boarding with internal data tools to get you ramped up as soon as possible as you are often dealing with big data (potentially terabytes or more) for your project.", "Oh, structured, longer-running internship programs have the best swag too.", "Semi structured programs are often found in fast growing companies that have gotten over that initial hump of getting their data infrastructure set up and need the manpower to answer key business or product questions. As such, you are likely to get multiple projects over the course of the program that requires a fair bit of juggling on your end to manage your time and mitigate the risk of context switching.", "You usually have a primary manager but are likely to have multiple other mentors across your multiple projects. This is especially true for cross-functional product-focused teams. It is usually put to you to reach out and set up time across the organization to understand the relevant data and business problems of your projects.", "While much of the data infrastructure has already been set up, there are often growing pains that you will encounter such as a lack of documentation or inconsistent labels across different tables. With a less involved on-boarding, it might take a little more time to visualize the table connections in your mind but the ability to do so and quickly skim and understand columns in a table and what data story they could potentially tell will prove to be a valuable skill later.", "There might be a library of internal tools starting to be built out but much of what you will be using will be 3rd party apps or packages. This is often a great opportunity for getting hands on time with a wide breadth of 3rd party apps. Given that we are in the golden age of SaaS products, being able to quickly pick up and run with any of these new products is core to understanding how these products were designed with data users like you in mind.", "What Structure?There are usually 2 key company types that have unstructured internships: a mature company that\u2019s just starting to explore what being a data-first organization could look like or an early stage startup that is just building out its data science team. It is part personal bias that I will be focusing on the latter here.", "To say that being the first intern at a fast growing early-stage startup is a challenge is quite the understatement. These positions are almost always never listed publicly and requires a fair degree of hustle to get that initial foot in the door. Once you\u2019re in, you\u2019re fully expected to perform immediately at the level of a full-time data scientist.", "The questions that determine your projects here tend to be a lot more open-ended and prepare to be directly responsible for multiple projects usually in the form of extended ad hoc requests. There will be no formal on boarding and it is largely up to you to explore the data and potentially be part of determining the best infrastructure. There might also be way fewer data points than what you would see in larger companies and you\u2019ll have to get creative with either sampling techniques or incorporating 3rd party data. Get excited because you\u2019re likely to be the first person looking and analyzing some of this data and can provide incredibly actionable recommendations with each sprint.", "While a number of companies will advertise their roles under the same label of \u201cData Analyst\u201d or \u201cData Scientist\u201d, it really pays off to read the fine print (literally anything below the job title) to find out what is expected of you. You wouldn\u2019t want to head into your internship expecting to build neural nets when all they want out of you is to query for key business metrics and trends with SQL.", "Your day to day is almost entirely comprised of writing SQL queries to answer business questions. There might be a short modeling stint at the very end but might not exceed that of a basic logistic or regression model. This is a more common in structured programs in which the company has a strong data infrastructure to query from and better defined business problems.", "SQL or MapReduce techniques often needed for you to create and aggregated the data that you need. A good chunk of time is spent reading academic papers for the relevant techniques and packages and experimenting with multiple models and hyper parameters. Oftentimes you are required to put the model into production as well, which requires additional technical expertise with production code and ETL pipelines.", "Technical scope for such an internship role is usually extremely clearly stated. While data scientists are usually more statistically focused and have a basic grasp of scripting languages, data engineers focus on the building and maintenance of the databases that data scientists interact with. This is a purely technical role that is very close to that of a software engineer and is most important for any potential intern to identify before they decide whether their skillset is a match at all.", "Not only do you need to be very adept at SQL and scripting basic models, you need to act like a part-time consultant for such a role. A data scientist here needs to be comfortable with communication, explaining key technical concepts to potentially non-technical stakeholders, and translate technical processes into business needs and metrics.", "While you still require a good technical foundation, this type of role requires a comprehensive understanding of the underlying business model and product to be able to effectively feature engineer or design experiments for feature testing.", "Most typical of unstructured programs in early stage startups or companies with an extremely prominent data culture. As the name suggests, you\u2019re expected to set up ETL pipelines and infrastructure, query and aggregate relevant data, build models around the data, and connect your findings to key business questions. Such an involved role requires a much broader skillset encompassing software engineering and statistics.", "So whats the best way to get a handle on what your potential internship is expecting? I would highly recommend either cold emails or cold calls with a specific focus on the following questions.", "What is the degree of autonomy I should be expecting?", "This question most directly addresses the degree of structure for your internship program. For structure programs, you\u2019re likely to be following set guidelines or predefined initiatives whereas you\u2019ll likely receive much more autonomy to define projects or ask to shadow projects in more unstructured programs.", "How is your data organization structured?", "Data organizations can be a centralized function that responds to ad hoc request or could be split into specific pods based on internal functions. As a data scientist you could also be tasked on multiple cross functional projects at once or only focus on a single group to prevent context switching. It is thus important to understand the internal structure of the data organization to best anticipate the degree of cross functional work and the types of group you will be supporting.", "What does your tech stack look like?", "This is a good question to understand the type of role you are applying for. Certain roles only require python, R, and SQL and that will be the extent of the tech stack. Full stack roles for example might bring up other dev ops tools or data warehousing tools. The answer to this question would be very useful in helping with technical interview preparation and pre-internship preparation.", "What does a breakdown of your day look like?", "By asking them to share a snapshot of their day-to-day activities, you force the employee to provide a weekly estimate of the amount of time and effort dedicated towards very specific tasks. A very SQL heavy position could quote up to 90% of the week dedicated towards SQL which could be a red flag if you were looking to focus on deep learning for example. A much more structured organization with a well organized data infrastructure team would also lead to much less time spent on data cleaning and data quality checks.", "Reading into the specifics of the answer to this question provides a nuanced overview of both the degree of structure within the organization but also characteristics of the role itself as well.", "These above characteristics are of course still relatively broad generalizations and in depth articles could be easily written on individual internship scopes. Furthermore, the lines separating these organizations and roles can be extremely blurred and you might find yourself in crossover roles that touch on a combination of what was covered above.", "Ultimately, it comes down to a personal understanding of your strengths, technical capabilities, and cultural preferences that determines the types of internships you prioritize over others.", "While this is a high-level overview of data science internships, there could be potential future articles on specific roles or interview preparation as well. If there are specific topics of interest you would like covered do feel free to comment as well!", "Thanks and feel free to connect on LinkedIn at https://www.linkedin.com/in/finnqiao/ !", "Your home for data science.
