Through some experiments, I ran across the strange phenomena that they can increase flow by reducing channeling.", "Typically, if you grind coffee too fine, your espresso shot will choke as well as channel causing low extraction. Adding a paper filter at the bottom has been shown to allow increased extraction. The initial theory is that the paper filter stops the filter basket holes from clogging, but my work in staccato shots showed filters don\u2019t clog due to fine grinds. Staccato shots have a layer of fines at the bottom, and their ability to work means that the filter holes themselves don\u2019t clog.", "In this article, I will present a few experiments I\u2019ve done to understand the impact of paper filters and refine how I have used paper filters.", "When examining this problem of channeling, I found that a paper filter could reduce side channeling. I suspected this was due to water traveling through the path of least resistance, which would be the paper filter rather than the coffee. As a result, the water coming down the sides would then spread out across the paper filter.", "I used paper filters and colored dye to understand how water spreads across the filter. I knew from trial and error (as well as other people\u2019s experiments) that a filter needed to be damp. If it was too wet, the first few drops out of the shot would be weak, but if it was dry, the filter would make the shot worse. I also knew that using two filters performs differently than one filter. Coffee age can affect what is the best amount of paper filters to use.", "To get a damp filter, I wet the filter, and then I dap it with a towel so it is still damp, but not wet. I added 2 damp filters as some of my testing has involved multiple paper filters. I also compared dry and soaking wet. I used bleached and unbleached filters.", "The dry filter doesn\u2019t do much good in helping the liquid spread, and oddly enough, neither does the soaked filter. The soaked filter is saturated with water, so additional water doesn\u2019t move so easily across it. The two damp filters don\u2019t spread out the dye as well as the single. It is probably an excess of water.", "We can look at the damp filter with dye at the edge, and the dye quickly spreads out.", "We can do the same for the center, and the dye shoots across the filter.", "Here is a one-to-one comparison of unbleached and bleach paper (damp). It seems the bleached paper allows the dye to move more quickly, which follows my own experience in flow times between bleached and unbleached filters.", "I ran a quick test with a few paper filters in a filter basket of my Kim Express, and I ran hot water through them as I normally would for a shot. I wanted to understand how the filters affect flow.", "From the weight graph, we can see with the more layers, the higher the weight (thus flow rate).", "With flow rate, the rate oscillates a lot due to the scale vibrating. These curves were already smoothed flow rate, so there is still quite a bit of regular oscillation.", "I\u2019m putting these definitions here because just after this section, I evaluate different amounts of paper filters using these metrics.", "I used two metrics for evaluating the differences between shots: Final Scoreand Coffee Extraction.", "Final score is the average of a scorecard of 7 metrics (Sharp, Rich, Syrup, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Aftertaste). These scores were subjective, of course, but they were calibrated to my tastes and helped me improve my shots. There is some variation in the scores. My aim was to be consistent for each metric, but some times the granularity was difficult and affected the final score.", "Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is measured using a refractometer, and this number is used to determine the percentage of coffee extracted into the cup in combined with the output weight of the shot and the input weight of the coffee, called Extraction Yield (EY).", "I have experimented with multiple paper layers previously, but it wasn\u2019t until I used a cloth filter when I realized how much I didn\u2019t understand about paper layers.", "I got the idea of using a cloth filter from a James Hoffman video on cloth filters for coffee. They were simple to find, but the trouble is that they are thick. They are 5 times the weight of the paper filters cut to the same size. However, coffee flowed so quickly through them.", "I started to experiment using 1, 2, or 3 paper filters. I have some paired data where 2 layers is the baseline. There was some fluctuation in Final Score and EY, which means that some times it is better to have more layers or less. I didn\u2019t control the cut of the filter as much as I would have liked. If anything this shows that 2 filters are a nice compromise.", "I took a look at filters used 4 times or less to filters used more than 4 times (old filter or multiple use). This didn\u2019t show a better pattern than before.", "I also looked at the time for extraction in Time to Cover Filter (TCF) and Total Time. 3 filters seemed to slow down the shot, but between 1 and 2 filters, the shot time seemed very similar.", "Ultimately, I stuck with using only one filter at a time for the middle filter.", "When the concept of paper filters became popular, people also added a filter on top of the puck as well. This was to help the water distribute more evenly across the puck. I have not found a top filter to be helpful, but I didn\u2019t understand why until now.", "Part of the issue I had with the top filter is that with a staccato tamped shot or a staccato shot, the top layer has less density, so usually there isn\u2019t a channeling problem. I added a top filter, and the result was a major donut as seen below.", "I took apart the puck looking for clues. The puck showed a dark ring indicating water was going faster through the center and the sides. Water going through the center made sense because I distribute my grounds to have a lower density in the center than the sides.", "I had two paper filters in the middle of this puck which can tell me how the flow is going at the halfway point. Both of these filters also had the dark ring.", "Finally, I looked at the top of the puck below (upside-down), and it also had the dark ring indicating the channeling went all the way to the top. The dark ring are areas where coffee was less extracted.", "Looking at previous pucks, the grounds on the top half outer ring are usually clumped together indicating they aren\u2019t as well extracted. The showerhead doesn\u2019t go to the edge of the filter basket, so when water going into the coffee, there is some delay before the water reaches the edge of the basket and starts causing the side channeling that causes donuting.", "So the paper filter seems to cause the water to spread out to the sides of the basket faster than normal which means the top filter increases the side channeling.", "To verify this, I cut the top paper smaller to just the size of the shower screen. This would allow the top filter to not increase side channeling.", "It was hard to tell from video what was going on in the shot because it still had a donut extraction. So I looked at the puck again.", "The top of the puck looked normal. The presence of coffee grounds on top of the filter indicates that the grounds were swimming around in the water and not well-connected. This seems normal because the top tamp is lighter than the bottom tamp.", "There was donut thing on the bottom as you can see with the dark spots but it was not as bad as a previous shot. Again in the filters in between the shot, there\u2019s some dark spots as part of the donuting. The top of the looked relatively normal but there are also some dark spots and clumps.", "This showed having a smaller paper filter on top helped the sides stay solidified which indicates that having a full paper filter makes side channeling worse. This may not be the case for regularly tamped shots, but for staccato tamped, the top layer has a much lighter tamp.", "This is not to say the top filter doesn\u2019t help because my transparent portafilter experiments have shown that even a packed puck will be greatly disturbed by water flow in, even if it is even. However, with a lever machine, the water is coming in from the sides of the cylinder, so using a top filter requires some experimentation to see what works best for your machine.", "This is an example of the bottom filter on a staccato tamped shot. There is also a middle filter. This allows the coffee to become more evenly distributed.", "For flow rate, a long pre-infusion leads to flow rate slowing down, and then during infusion, flow rate goes high and then comes down. This shot also used pressure pulsing which is why the output weight fluctuates.", "Post-shot analysis shows that the top half of the puck is very much intact, which is a good sign. The paper at the bottom has some spots which indicate some channeling in the center with some dark spots at the sides where coffee flow stalled.", "The top of the puck is intact which has been generally good. The crack in the puck happened during dissection.", "I have started to use a bottom filter regularly now, but there is a caveat which I will explore in the next article of this series.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far, you have gone through quite a few experiments that have helped me better understand the use of paper filters in espresso, how they work, and what\u2019s best to avoid. I hope these experiments better help explain the mechanics of espresso, and I hope future developments can build off of them.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
