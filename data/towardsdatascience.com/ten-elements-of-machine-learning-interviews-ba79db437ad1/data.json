The challenge comes from the fact that there is so much more than model fitting in a ML project. Most textbooks cover rather technical details that are under the hood of model.train(). It takes two very different sets of skills to derive everything in a ML textbook and to find the appropriate ML solution for a use case. In addition, breaking down the complexity of a ML project and talking through it coherently under pressure is no joke. When preparing for machine learning interviews at tech companies, I tried to keep a broad scope and reverse engineer the most widely used ML use cases.", "2. Andrej Karpathy\u2019s blog post is great as it outlines a highly practical process for doing deep learning, which is starting with the simplest baseline and iterating from there gradually. I\u2019m a big believer in the process. It is kind of contrary to what many people do in the sense that they have the urge to immediately use the most complicated model. Also, from an interview perspective, name dropping fancy models is more dangerous than impressive unless you really know your stuff.", "3. This Airbnb blog post covers how they built experience search in several different stages. It is awesome that they shared so many details about how they approached the problem. When you prioritize the right aspects of a problem, the solution would emerge naturally. During a ML interview, it is crucial to define the primary objectives and be aware of constraints.", "4. I think Kevin Murphy\u2019s book is a great reference for people with graduate-level math background and the patience to get through it. However, the book by Hal Daum\u00e9 III is much more concise and the cheatsheet below has most pop quiz concepts. You don\u2019t want to blank on a basic question or spend time on unnecessary math (for the sake of interviews).", "5. If there are enough high quality labeled data as in most Kaggle competitions, using random forests or gradient boosting off the shelf would get you there. Mostly likely you won\u2019t beat the Kaggle winner but in practice who\u2019d care about the 0.1% improvement? Elements of Statistical Learning has nice chapters on random forests and gradient boosting but below is a shorter article. Also, it is probably worthwhile to know how feature importance is calculated in scikit-learn.", "6. Simon Funk\u2019s matrix factorization algorithm for the Netflix prize is surprisingly simple and the logic behind it is intuitive. We are simply doing a linear projection of the user vectors and item vectors into a latent space where their similarity determines the probability of recommendation. One could argue that learning suitable latent representation is the essence of ML.", "7. In practice though, there are many use case specific considerations compared to the Netflix competition. The Netflix competition basically has fixed data but what if new data arise constantly? Also, what if we can incorporate data about the items themselves? This Google course provides a more comprehensive guide.", "8. This Instagram blog post definitely takes recommendation system design to the next level. It builds on the things mentioned above and heavily optimizes for their specific use cases.", "9. This Facebook video offers a perspective from model deployment and surprisingly unveils their ML solutions to several use cases at a high level. Anybody who wants to throw deep neural networks at every problem should watch this video.", "10. Back to the point about experimentation, everybody hears about multi-armed bandit but how does it actually work?", "Your home for data science.
