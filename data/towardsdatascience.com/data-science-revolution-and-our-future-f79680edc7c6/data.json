That includes analogies and tools created to exploit any data or to try to understand the meaning of the data. 2020 is a perfect time to ask how we should employ Data Science for our own benefit.", "Data Science is a software and technique used in large-scale data analysis that is being used to find patterns and develop statistical models based on very small amounts of data. At the heart of Data Science is data. Many tools, processes and materials have been developed over the years in order to increase the scalability of data analysis.", "There are a lot of different approaches to Data Science. An algorithmic approach generally includes several steps. The first step is standardization. This is when the data is converted into a format that is easier to work with. The data is then transformed into computer code (a Python script, another programming language, for example) and executed for processing. One important question is whether there are constraints on what the model should do. An algorithm that is not allowed to do something might be less useful than an algorithm that can do it all.", "For instance, if it is forbidden by a law or regulation to reduce the output temperature to 0 degrees Celsius, this can render a task boring and impossible. Instead, the solution can be implemented in a machine learning algorithm that has been specifically designed to follow such laws and regulations.", "An example is to have a parameter, called weight, that can represent the importance of an individual site. Under such a system, each site will get its weight based on the ratings from users. The model will be able to have an interaction between each site and the user. Each site can then use the effect of the weight to evaluate user satisfaction and can decide whether to promote or downvote. Such a system would be more useful for monitoring the popularity of a single site and monitoring user activity than a linear statistical model.", "An elegant framework for dealing with multiple variables is Bayesian modeling. Given a model and some underlying data (which might include numerical and communication signals) the complexity of the model is calculated. The way in which the data is transformed into the model (e.g. the form of the dependencies) determines the level of complexity, the number of parameters, and the number of times the model is compared to real data.", "For instance, say we want to know the score of the most popular restaurant in town. The model will be based on some information about the customers, such as location and number of ratings. But this information is worthless for the true measurement of the restaurant\u2019s popularity. This requires more in-depth knowledge in order to compute a model like what sort of dishes you\u2019re serving, when, how big is your restaurant, how pricey it is, etc.", "There are several approaches to data analysis and Data Science. A simple one is to simply run a traditional statistical model. But to find patterns with a large amount of data there is the possibility to use machine learning methods.", "We are in the middle of a computer revolution that came by way of data.", "You need data to build a business perspective and extract actionable insights. Today, data and data science is arguably the most critical factor to successful innovation, as automation creates the more efficient alternatives that can\u2019t be made by any one person.", "Data can be the most necessary thing of all. A data scientist can help people visualize and understand data, and have evidence-based insights that show improvement", "The advent of personal computing has made it possible to collect data directly from anywhere around the world, and one of the most commonly used data points is the ability to understand pictures.", "The other important trend is the access to Big Data at a low cost. We have more than one billion people in the world who can now monitor their health or visit hospitals for various reasons. Digital photography has become a ubiquitous source of imagery that allows us to quickly understand the world around us.", "Data analysis has proven time and time again that it does very well in order to solve serious problems, like poverty, illegalities and crimes, education, and prevention of accidents, for example.", "Just think of big data. Let\u2019s face it: not all the data is useful, although we can and should aggregate more data. However, when you break down the data, what you see is a big picture that is full of noise and neutral. And by neutral, I mean it\u2019s not about the actual meaning of the data. Think for example about the stock options and the market noise \u2014 on a daily basis you get a ton of data just by following trades, if you add on top of that all the news, you\u2019re truly looking at big data and not everything here will be of the same importance.", "Since data collection technology is getting better and better each year, data scientists are increasingly hard to find.", "Every child should have access to high quality physical and digital education where they can freely choose what to study based on their interests.", "The government should increase spending on research related to data related to natural disasters and major disasters in order to serve people with better preventive solutions.", "People should be allowed to consume the contents of the books or films they want to, regardless of copyright (or with some waivers), to gain better understanding of what is happening around the world.", "Data should be attributed to a specific person based on a number of sources, like age, gender, location and other characteristics. This would allow us to control any bias that may appear in data science models.", "Since visualization is one of the primary areas where data can be used to help people understand what is happening around them, such an approach can be applied to society and culture. In addition, there is almost no way that algorithms will ever be able to grasp the reality of a particular person, and a human intervention is necessary in this respect. But algorithms are good at averaging and giving an \u2018approximately good answer\u2019 to our needs. That\u2019s why thinking about bias in our models is important.", "The main question we have to raise from this perspective is what is a good data scientist. The answer is simple: it depends. But it has to do with a balance of skills, of background, of willingness to study, to change, to experiment, to fail, and to keep experimenting to understand the reality of problems and how technology can help to solve them. If we can achieve this balance, good data scientists will provide those services to us.", "However, there are several areas in which data is of particular importance.", "The most important one is very likely education. The amount of data we collect at school can be used to help children learn math and data science, and much more. The transformation of education based on data will benefit all people. Also, education and data-driven decisions such as establishing public institutions are very often linked together in how society operates.", "The second most important area is health care. There are innumerable innovative approaches to health care in the field of data, like interventions that generate specific data in cases of diseases. Data can also be very useful for the development of disease prevention strategies, as well as advanced monitoring and monitoring in cases of certain diseases. It should also be able to create personal systems in which health data is managed by the affected individuals.", "The third most important area is our social life. Data in the form of geographical information can provide information to do with things like public transportation, shopping, and more. It allows us to optimise our routes, or shopping time by suggesting what we might be interested in buying. Data privacy also has to be taken into account, as long as data is not used for financial gain.", "The fourth most important area is research related to education, health care and technology. There will always be areas of innovation and we will always need data. In order to make sure that data is used in the most efficient way possible, we have to be very careful when we go about pushing trends related to data, so that we don\u2019t shoot ourselves in the foot later.", "Educating ourselves for what we need is the best way to learn about our problems and to figure out the solutions.", "If you want to learn Data Science check my two articles about books you might want to read:", "Your home for data science.
