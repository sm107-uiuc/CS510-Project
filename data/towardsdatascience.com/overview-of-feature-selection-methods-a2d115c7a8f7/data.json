Computing and using feature importance scores is also an important step towards model interpret-ability.", "This post shares the overview of supervised and unsupervised methods for performing feature selection I have acquired after researching the topic for a few days. For all depicted methods I also provide references to open-source python implementations I used in order to allow you to quickly test out the presented algorithms. However, this research domain is very abundant in terms of methods which have been proposed during the last 2 decades and as such this post only attempts to present my current limited view without any pretense for completeness. For a more comprehensive study, you can check the following review.", "There are supervised feature selection algorithms which identify the relevant features for best achieving the goal of the supervised model (e.g. a classification or a regression problem)and they rely on the availability of labelled data. However, for unlabeled data, a number of unsupervised feature selection methods have been developed which score all data dimensions based on various criteria, such as their variance, their entropy, their ability to preserve local similarity, etc. Relevant features identified using unsupervised heuristics can also be used in supervised models as they may discover other patterns in the data additional to the correlation of features with the target variable.", "From a taxonomic point of view, feature selection methods usually fall into one of the following 4 categories detailed below: filter, wrapper, embedded and hybrid classes.", "This approach evaluates the performance of a subset of features based on the resulting performance of the applied learning algorithm (e.g. what is the gain in accuracy for a classification problem). Any learning algorithm can be used in this combination of search strategy and modelling.", "Implementation: these algorithms are implemented in the mlxtend package, find here an example of usage.", "This approach consists in algorithms which simultaneously perform model fitting and feature selection. This is typically implemented by using a sparsity regularizer or constraint which makes the weight of some features become zero.", "Other examples of regularization algorithms: Lasso (implementing l1 regularization), Ridge Regression (implementing l2 regularization), Elastic Net (implementing l1 and l2 regularization). An intuitive depiction of these different regularization types shows that Lasso regression constrains the coefficients to a square shape, ridge creates a circle and elastic net is in between:", "A comprehensive description of these algorithms can be found here.", "This approach evaluates the importance of features based only on their inherent characteristics, without incorporating any learning algorithm. These methods tend to be faster and less computationally expensive than wrapper methods. If there is not enough data to model the statistical correlation between features, filter methods may provide worse results than wrapper methods. Unlike wrapper methods they are not subject to overfitting. They are extensively used on high dimensional data where wrapper methods have a prohibitive computational cost.", "The extended algorithm, ReliefF applies feature weighting and searches for more nearest neighbors.", "In order to correctly apply the chi-squared in order to test the relation between various features in the dataset and the target variable, the following conditions have to be met: the variables have to be categorical, sampled independently and values should have an expected frequency greater than 5. The last condition ensures that the CDF of the test statistic can be closely approximated by the chi-square distribution, more details can be found here.", "\u201c Features are relevant if their values vary systematically with category membership.\u201d", "Thus, good feature subsets contain features highly correlated with the classification and uncorrelated to each other. The method calculates the merit of a subset of k features as:", "Another option of implementing feature selection consists in a hybrid approach of combining filter and wrapper methods into a 2 phase process: an initial filtering of features based on statistical properties (filter phase) followed by a second selection based wrapper methods.", "There is a very abundant literature tackling feature selection problem and this post only scratches the surface of the research work which has been done. I will provide links to other resources that exist and that I haven\u2019t yet tried.", "A comprehensive list of other feature selection algorithms that I haven\u2019t mentioned in this post have been implemented in scikit-feature package.", "Other ways to identify relevant features is by using PLS (Partial least squares) as exemplified in this post or by performing linear dimensionality reduction techniques as presented here.", "Your home for data science.
