Redesigned photo by our designer. We own a full exclusive full license to this photo..", "In the world of the rising numbers of Machine Learning (ML) related projects, simplified ML frameworks and environments, and prepackaged ML solutions in the cloud \u2014 the voice of disappointment can be heard more and more often.", "This ever growing voice is coming from the top experts in the matter, so we at Avenga Tech would like to take a moment to share our opinion about whether deep learning is really hitting the wall. Is the current state of enterprise AI in need of another major breakthrough, or can we use current techniques and not worry?", "Avenga has extensive expertise in data science and deep learning in particular. So, here we are to help you understand the reasons and practical implications of the current situation.", "AI has improperly, but surely, become synonymous with Machine Learning, and machine learning is almost always related to deep learning (also false, because there are more techniques), and deep learning usually relates to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN, a type of artificial neural networks that learns how to recognize and classify the patterns in input data).", "For a given set of problems, usually pattern recognition, deep learning enables very high accuracy, relatively quick learning, and the fast and low resources model execution including mobile battery powered devices. Decades old ideas became accessible because of the algorithm optimizations, and the great progress in parallel vector computing that utilize GPUs or even more specialized hardware (i.e. TPUs).", "The deep learning revolution enabled things that were not possible before their implementations started to be popular.", "Face recognition. Redesigned photo by our designer. We have full exclusive rights for this photo.", "Computer vision is one of those applications \u2014 pick up your phone, it will recognize your face with very high speed and accuracy, and unlock the phone. It took many years to come to this level of performance and quality.", "Speech recognition \u2014 talk to your digital assistant \u2014 the voice recognition percentage is very high. It may not have the answer, nor will it be able to have the same conversation as a human, but the recognition is already highly accurate.", "Speech synthesis \u2014 driving a car, running, commuting, sound is the only option for communication. The advancements in speech synthesis are so great that it gets harder and harder to recognize a computer generated voice from a real human voice.", "NLP \u2014 automatic translations \u2014 not perfect today, but enormously better than they used to be a few years ago. You can understand web articles written in any language today after one click of the button.", "Selected computer games \u2014 AI winning chess, then GO, and then the Starcraft 2 game. The progress is visible and is reaching the front pages of the news.", "Number of ML projects is growing, and the machine learning experts are getting harder and harder to get.", "At some point, many people believed we would be moving towards a more general machine intelligence because of those successes. Just give the algorithms more data and computing power; everything\u2019s solved!", "Machine learning. Redesigned photo by our designer. We have full exclusive rights for this photo.", "We keep on seeing very insanely narrow areas where ML is better than humans, at the expense of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) areas, where ML is far behind human capability and seems not to have progressed at all.", "Systems heavily depend on humans feeding them enormous amounts of data (thousands of times more than a human brain needs), performing lots of manual data labelling, and providing feedback.", "Even then, models trained on data set and passing all the tests, suddenly fail in the different data input sets for no known reason and usually, in completely different scenarios where humans would likely make mistakes. Like in the famous example of image recognition with wolves being recognized as wolves because of the white (snow) background, and then failing when the background is green, for instance.", "Another known problem is the learning process itself. Based on tons of data from the past or prepared data in the lab \u2192 a model often fails when it faces a new set of real world data, and the process repeats again.", "For instance, sometimes ML won\u2019t recognize our face and let us in for an almost impossible reason; as we all experience on our phones and laptops from time to time.", "Still it\u2019s always humans who define high level concepts like type of animal. DL is still at a very low level and the higher level concept support is poor.", "Is DL hitting the wall? It seems so in the words of the top data scientists. A few years ago it seemed easy. With larger and larger datasets and more TPU/GPU/CPU power, we were able to solve more AI related problems. Now there\u2019s more scepticism and new ways of doing things are expected to be found.", "For instance, car companies promised dates such as 2020 or 2030 for autonomous cars, and now they refrain from promising that autonomous cars will ever be possible. On the other hand people can drive just after a few hours of training, and can recognize properly the objects and situations they haven\u2019t seen before.", "Another issue with the current state of DL, is lack of predictability on one hand and lack of explainability on the other. Most of the time it works very well, but people want to know why. Especially when DL is used for decision making process \u2014 people always want to know why. And currently, even the top scientists admit they have problems themselves explaining the network\u2019s behavior.", "The current set of algorithms was built without taking that requirement into account. Like a black box, some scientists claim changing them to be more explainable would impair their effectiveness significantly.", "DL is expected to learn more efficiently and generalize faster based on a lesser amount of data while consuming less energy.", "AI, DL or something else, is expected to discover, figure out the high level abstracts and do them out of distribution generalizations, domains, and relations. AI is expected to have better knowledge of the world, human-like perception and finally to have \u2018common sense\u2019.", "Now one can say that DL recognizes various patterns but it doesn\u2019t understand them, and therefore it\u2019s hitting the wall.", "Some scientists suggest starting over from the beginning (like evolutionary algorithms in a new version), and consider DL as a dead end solution. Others see a path, like a migration from the current state of DL towards a more general machine intelligence. Scientists are also looking at nature, like how cognitive processes work and why, especially in neuroevolutionary algorithms with mutations of not only the weights but also structures of the network themselves. Maybe meta algorithms, algorithms to design algorithms, are the answer?", "Our machine learning scientists, with practical experience, share their views.", "Lyubomyr Senyuk, Director of R&DOlena Domanska, ML competence lead", "Let\u2019s take voice synthesis and machine translation as an example: if you go straightforward you get an ugly result. The generated speech has no intonation and it is really hard to listen to it. You understand words but the more complex language constructions are absent and your brain struggles to identify what the voice is talking about. Which is the main and which is secondary? In translators, we have a similar situation. Without \u2018understanding\u2019 what the text is about, it is impossible to translate the text (except in really close languages). However, there are DL techniques of statistical machine translation that can give impressive results, and they even can do cross translations; i.e. Japanese to Polish having only a model trained on Japanese-English and English-Polish. Speech generation models can be built on similar principles and they give results much more pleasant to listen to, but on complex sentences and topics where real humans are using intonation, additional explanatory element DL speech synthesis models usually fail. The same happens with translators: if context goes outside a few words the model fails", "So, the current state of DL definitely fails here, but it is hard to say this about DL itself. Maybe putting small features in, that will allow NN to change it\u2019s own topology on the fly, will dramatically change the situation and we will just need to increase the power of computers 100x to reach feasible learning curves for such NNs to mimic, for example 10 year old humans.", "The idea of \u2018thinking machines,\u2019 meaning they are not programmed with explicit instructions, is not new. Deep learning attempts to mimic the human brain by using mathematical matrix manipulations in artificial neurons. Though biological neurons inspired the idea of DL, artificial ones are a much-simplified version. The largest neural network in the world consists of 16 million neurons, which is the size of a frog\u2019s brain. Deep learning is only an implementation of the idea of an artificial brain with its limitations in size, topology, signal handling, and structure. Right now, we do not even understand how human brains manage to work so efficiently and we do not understand how general intelligence works. So, what will happen to DL if we find out? Will we figure out a new way to implement brains, and the idea of living forever as a machine will become real? Let\u2019s see.", "Even after creating hypothetical human-like NN, we should think about ways to interact with it. And here I think, the current DL approaches are definitely hitting the wall. After feeding tons of data to this human like virtual creature and having no reasonable explanation for its decisions, is definitely not what we are looking for.", "Deep learning continues to have the same barriers it has had throughout all its existence: the amount of labeled data to train on and computational powers. Until only a decade ago, DL was thought of as a dead-end by most researchers in the field. Although the first CNNs were created in the 1980s, they didn\u2019t progress until switching from computing on CPUs to GPUs, which allowed multithreading and faster computing. Another boost followed after the creation of the CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets. Development of the TPUs by Google, to perform tensor computation, gave an additional boost to the field. Current GPUs and TPUs are more capable than ever, but the growth is not as exponential as it was. So it would be a fair assumption that we are close to the \u2018ceiling.\u2019 However, there is another technology we must keep in mind \u2014 quantum computing. It may transform and speed up computing in general, but deep learning can be one of the most affected by this technology.", "Recently, natural language research has embraced a new paradigm: self-supervised learning or autonomous supervised learning, which uses large amounts of existing text to pretrain a model\u2019s parameters, with no data annotation required. Humans can determine the semantic meaning of the word from context. Similarly, the Word2Vec algorithm predicts the semantic context of a word, based on surrounding words. Self-supervised learning follows the same principle and uses the naturally available context. This technique has the potential to solve a significant limitation of DL, but requires a lot of training examples.", "Besides, just a few months ago a smarter and simpler way to train neural networks was proposed by researchers, called a Lottery Ticket Hypothesis. The main idea is that a large neural network will contain a smaller subnetwork that, if trained from the start, will achieve the same or similar accuracy as a larger structure. This hypothesis may relieve the computationally expensive aspects of DL.", "This field is so young and so popular that its researchers continuously come up with new paradigms and architectures. There are continuous improvements in the most popular subfields: NLP and CV. There have been amazing and even dangerous results, such as the ability to fake videos by substituting face or audio recordings that look like and sound just like real things, animating still images, and generating creative fictional texts, poetry or other literary art.", "Maybe the progress is slow, but something developed today could be a break-through in the future.", "This is a tricky question. I would probably answer with an example. Imagine you want to identify people by face but you have photos from different angles. Better to decompose tasks and have some face parameter measurements, like rotation angles as a separate subtask (can be also NN) and classification as a separate subtask, rather than feeding all photos into one NN. This gives you additional parameters that can be used in tuning global algorithms and handling thresholds.", "On the other hand, if we think more globally about the opposite question, \u201cWhere should we use DL?\u201d I would answer, in healthcare. Biological life produces very complex challenges for what we call logical thinking, and thus binary logic of computers, so having a blackbox that will heal people with a high statistical probability is a big deal for now, and in the future, when AI will be able to build theories and explanations of its decisions in the scope of those theories.", "One more example of a field that is, at the moment, better off without DL is robotics.", "Most likely, all of us have heard about Boston Dynamics. Their robots, designed to do various tasks, seem to be one of the most successful creations yet. What is their secret to having control of the robots\u2019 movements? They simply don\u2019t use deep/reinforcement learning.", "Robotics is the field in which people, so far, have achieved much more success by using the laws of physics. It limits the functionality, but it can still cover a good enough portion of the robot\u2019s engine.", "Deep learning is always hungry for tons of data to learn from. This amount of data is impossible to collect in a real robot. Millions of trials would be too expensive and take too long to execute.", "In general, deep learning can solve multiple complex tasks in areas such as Computer Vision or Natural Language processing, but it\u2019s not a panacea. Deep Learning is most potent with supervised learning, meaning that models are trained with labeled data. It can achieve high accuracy, find more complex patterns, and doesn\u2019t require explicit feature engineering, but it only becomes possible with enough compute and labeled data. In the picture below, we see how the performance of classical machine learning models and DL depend on the amount of labeled data:", "How data science techniques scale with amount of data. A photo drawn by our designer. It\u2019s a unique photo. We have full exclusive rights for this photo.", "For problems that have a limited amount of labeled data or that need fast prototyping, it can be overkill to use deep learning. It will be a waste of resources when we actually could have gotten the same results by using a more simple approach, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest for the classification or Linear Regression/XGBoost Regressor for prediction. When we need to interpret and explain the results, it is more beneficial to start with linear or tree-based algorithms to understand feature importance. Last but not least is data quality, garbage in \u2014 garbage out. With low-quality data, any model performs poorly, let alone a deep learning model. It is not the area of the project that matters for DL. What matters is the task, the data, and the business need.", "\u2192 Read more on what Avenga Data Science team is doing to help the community as they participate in the Kaggle competition.", "What\u2019s next for deep learning. Redesigned photo by our designer. We have full exclusive rights for this photo.", "Besides improving DL techniques like Capsule Neural Network which is the enhancement of Convolutional Neural Networks, there are a few important global trends that should be mentioned to draft the future of AI:", "Deep Learnings\u2019 soft spot for many businesses is considering a neural network as a black box decision-maker. This results in an inconvenience for projects in which the model has a substantial economic impact. For many businesses, it is just not acceptable to make critical decisions and lose money while relying on the uninterpretable outcome of a DL model. That\u2019s why we have a lot of research in the direction of interpretable AI, which will be able to provide data and reasons to justify the decision.", "Integration of deep learning and symbolic systems into hybrid AI architectures. Redesigned photo by our designer. We have full exclusive rights for this photo.", "The dream of artificial intelligence (AI) is to understand how that magic thing that allows humans to see and hear, think and reason, and hope and dream \u2014 the brain \u2014 works and then recreate a version of it in the engineering of intelligence systems.", "Current DL models excel at completing specific tasks and making predictions. What DL lacks is analogy or a concept making/generating ability to extrapolate beyond training sets, and it is poorly interpretable. Fortunately, DL is not the only AI tool. Symbolic artificial intelligence pioneered in the \u201960s was the dominant paradigm in the AI community until the late 1980s. Implementations of symbolic reasoning are called rules engines or knowledge graphs. These are a set of nested \u2018if-then\u2019 statements drawing conclusions about entities and their relations. In DL the algorithm learns rules as it establishes correlations between inputs and outputs. In symbolic reasoning, the rules are created through human intervention. This is why symbolic AI is so powerful at interpretability, generalization and incorporating prior knowledge, but deals poorly with massive empirical data streams. These two approaches complement each other perfectly, as the weaknesses of the first are the strengths of the second, and vice versa. Thus the integration of deep learning and symbolic systems into hybrid AI architectures, such as neural-symbolic systems combining with deep reinforcement learning, may be the next step towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), the intelligence that adapts patterns for the behavior and can act on general tasks. It would be wonderful to see some achievements in this direction.", "\u2192 Learn more how AI, deep learning, advanced analytics and big data can assist the pharmaceutical industry in clinical trial management and drug development.", "As you can see AI is not a simple topic, as in deep learning itself the actual business value for your organization comes with skills based on experience.
