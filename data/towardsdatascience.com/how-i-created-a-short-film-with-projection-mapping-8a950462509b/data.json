On the weekend of March 27, I took part in the virtual Stuck At Home 48 Hour Film Project. I would have exactly 48 hours to make a complete short film. This would be 48 Hour Film Project number fifteen for me\u2026 you could say I\u2019m a tad obsessed. To amp up the challenge, I decided that I would use the project as an opportunity to dive deeper into projection mapping.", "What would happen if I created a fully projection-mapped film?", "Projection mapping, also referred to as spatial augmented reality, is a technique where projected visuals interact and fit onto non-flat, three-dimensional surfaces. You can projection map everyday objects, buildings, flowers, people \u2014 anything you can imagine, you can projection map! Find out more through Projection Mapping Central here.", "Lightform has streamlined the projection mapping process for us creatives. They have designed an application that is like Photoshop for light in the real, non-digital world! It\u2019s mind-blowing. I\u2019m completely in love with this company.", "Lightform has streamlined the projection mapping process for us creatives.

Projected augmented reality uses projectors to add digital information and magical effects to real life. Unlike the current forms of AR and VR, projected AR can be seen with the naked eye, no need for a headset or phone.", "We want to design a future where digital art and information are seamlessly integrated into real life, unrestricted by rectangular screens.\u201d", "In \u201cNew Thought / No Thought,\u201d a drawing realizes she is living on a piece of paper and experiences a shift in her consciousness.", "I was inspired to tell the story of my mental health journey. Through meditation, I have experienced a shift in my perception of reality. I have pushed beyond what I had once perceived as the extent of reality. It is quite difficult to describe this experience with words, but it is beautiful and life-giving. This film is my attempt to portray that experience.", "Augmented reality projections on physical drawings felt like a very fitting medium to portray a story about the expansion of one\u2019s perception of reality.", "Augmented reality projections on physical drawings felt like a very fitting medium to portray a story about the expansion of one\u2019s perception of reality.", "After plotting out the concept and storyboard, I was able to narrow down the visuals to five key drawings. These drawings served as my main shots that I would be projection mapping onto.", "I left the drawings simple to give myself flexibility with the projection design. I would be able to add life and movement to the line drawings.", "Next, I utilized Lightform to scan my drawings and design the projections. I utilized some of Lighform\u2019s built-in effects and textures and sourced additional royalty-free animations and clips (like the sunset timelapse clip in the window).", "I also projection-mapped myself for one of the scenes! Talk about mixed reality\u2026 It\u2019s quite trippy to be projection-mapped.", "I filmed \u201cwide\u201d shots of the entire sheet of paper as well as close-ups of the faces and other projected details for editing options in Adobe Premiere.", "Here is the final film \u201cNew Thought / No Thought,\u201d completed all within 48 hours!", "Capturing projection mapping on camera is one thing, but experiencing it in person takes it to a whole new level. There are so many exciting possible uses of projection mapping: interactive installations, filmmaking, live shows and more.", "I have a slew of upcoming projects where I\u2019ll be experimenting further with the technology.
