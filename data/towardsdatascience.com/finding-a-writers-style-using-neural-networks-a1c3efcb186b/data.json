Part of the keys to becoming a well-known and respected writer is honing that style and creating something entirely unique to you and your life experience. Music, as an art form, allows for an entirely unique form of expression, and some artists are truly peerless in their writing. As students that love music, and have seen what neural networks have been able to do with text classification, we wanted to test the boundaries of such a network.", "The problem we are examining is difficult enough for a human. By looking at lyrics alone, could you tell who had written them?", "From these lyrics, it may be hard to tell who has written them, unless you are very familiar with both the band and the songwriters involved.", "In fact, it is difficult for us to even make an educated guess- we need more context before we could even begin to come up with an answer.", "These lyrics are obviously from \u201cNorwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\u201d by The Beatles, written in partnership by both Lennon and McCartney.", "With this in mind, we must train our network on not only a wide range of artists, but also a deep sampling of their catalogue, so that we can provide the context that the model needs in order to give an answer.", "Our goal through this Neural Networks project was to see if a network could find and learn and artist\u2019s style, and be able to predict who had written a selection of lyrics. The idea as that, given enough data, the model could be trained on the lyrics of a popular artist, and be able to classify later inputs as the given artist.", "This article is under the assumption that you have a basic understanding of neural networks and their concepts. We will be discussing the programming language Python, and various libraries we used in order to shape our network.", "As far as data, we used the Genius API- an interface that allows us to connect to the website and gather as much data as necessary. We were able to access this API using the LyricsGenius Python library- it made querying much easier. We will assume the audience has a familiarity with libraries that are used to create neural networks, such as Keras and TensorFlow.", "Our first step in this approach was to gather our data. Although there are numerous lyric repositories available on websites such as Kaggle, we found that while many of these files had a wide breadth of artists, they did not have enough songs per artist to give the network a deeper idea of lyrical style.", "We decided to use data from Genius, a lyrics website wherein people can add annotations and comment on songs. Genius is written by its\u2019 users, similar to Wikipedia, but also is cross-referenced with official lyric data and other sources before being vetted as correct. As mentioned before, Genius was queried using the LyricsGenius Python library.", "Genius has a very large repository of crowd-sourced lyrics, and made it very easy to not only get a wide range of artists, but also give us enough data if their discography is large enough. Given the artists we had chosen to examine, finding a wealth of songs with which to sample was not much of a problem.", "One thing we wanted to make sure with the data is that the songs would be written primarily by the performing artist. Nowadays, it is common for an artist to have a team of songwriters, which certainly helps to form a style, but also may draw away from the artist\u2019s personal style. That said, we chose artists that had long spanning careers, and were primarily singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan. However, we found this not only difficult to sustain, given there may also be uncredited writers on any given track.", "With this in mind, we selected 10 well-known artists to start with, and collected lyrics from 100 of their songs. We chose artists with deep discographies, that would easily be able to give us 100 songs each. Based on Genius\u2019s API, these lyrics were pulled from their 100 most popular songs on the Genius website.", "After gathering our data, we had to clean it. The Genius API provided not only the lyrics to a song but also annotation data which wasn\u2019t important to our project. Using a script, we cleaned the files so that we had the raw text of the lyrics and nothing else. This was compiled into JSON files.", "Given the size of the data, and also the range of song lengths, we also chose to limit the songs to only 100 words. This limitation would give us a standard for each song, as in case some artists had a tendency towards longer songs. Once the data was cleaned, we needed a way to feed in the data to our network. We did so by tokenizing all the lyrics in a given song. So each word has a value and can be fed into the network as we need.", "The general idea of tokenizing is to create a unique numerical representation of each word so that it can be fed into a network. In this case, each song would be represented as a vector of numbers, and each artist would be represented as a one-hot encoding of a 10-vector. We would feed these into the network as part of our training of the model.", "At the beginning of the project, we had started with a simple sequential network from the Keras python library. Although we had gotten results, the performance of the network was very poor. We found that the network had quickly reached an upper bound, and would not improve.", "As you can see here, our training accuracy was higher than the validation accuracy, which is to be expected, but overall both values were very low, with only a 20% accuracy. With such a poor output, we thought it was best to search for a new approach.", "After finding this article, we settled on an LSTM network that would provide better results in text classification. Using LSTMs is a very common approach for this type of problem and has already been studied extensively. LSTMs are common for this type of problem because they can remember sequences of past data.", "As you can see in our results below, the training accuracy was very close to 100%, while the validation accuracy capped at around 40%. Though, it should be mentioned that these results were reached after 30 epochs, as opposed to the hundreds of epochs for our previous model.", "That being said, we again reached a barrier when we found that our training accuracy was very high while our validation accuracy stayed relatively low. With only 40% validation accuracy and over 90% training accuracy, the network was clearly overfitting.", "To solve this problem, we believe we would need a lot more data and a wider variety. For instance including entire songs without cutting them off at 100 words, or adding different metrics of the songs to the input such as average word length and sentiment. Though these changes are possible, it is difficult with the rudimentary techniques and limited storage we had available. On top of this, the network could be modified in small ways through trial and error to perform well in this specific environment.", "After this project, we can conclude that our text classification remains a long way off to being able to analyze such stylized prose as song lyrics, especially with the small amount of data that we were able to use. Although the results we have gathered are novel, we find that approaching this topic again requires even more data. That said, there is potential in this topic.", "While we didn\u2019t achieve the performance we had hoped for, we still learned a lot through this investigation. After training the network, we fed through the lyrics of artists that it had and had not seen before and the results were interesting, giving results that would be better than an educated guess.", "While the network had seen The Beatles and Taylor Swift before, it hadn\u2019t seen Drake or ACDC. By inputting data the network had never seen before, we could get a new perspective on how our model classifies lyrics. When fed in lyrics by Drake, the model output that the song was written by Lil Wayne, which given both of their styles is an understandable guess.", "Though when fed in \u201cBack in Black\u201d by AC/DC, the model output that the song was written by J. Cole. There is something to be said about the model learning \u2014 when we fed in songs that were already seen by the network, the correct artist was output.", "The Beatles, \u201cHey Jude\u201d -> The Beatles", "Taylor Swift, \u201cLover\u201d -> Taylor Swift", "As mentioned earlier, there is potential. Not only in lyric classification but in the broader problem of NLP text author classification. This could be used by intelligence agencies to identify who wrote an email or text message, or by companies like Google and Apple for auto identifying the author of new emails and texts.", "Check out all of the source code and data on Github here.", "Your home for data science.
