In this post, we will use a worked example to understand how data science is leveraged to issue better loans.", "The immediate goal is to gain a sense of how to create a financial technology (fintech) product from start to finish. The larger goal is to make loan applications a transparent process.", "Before introducing the characters in this system, please bear in mind that behind the titles everyone involved is human. This means that not everything can be quantified and, in many cases, the ultimate decision might be based on human judgement.", "Creditors are those with money to lend, and must be careful not to squander their assets on dead-end endeavors. Traditionally, lenders would rely on the 5 Cs of credit:", "A loan applicant needs to prove their credit worthiness. The information needed can vary from lender to lender, and navigating the application process can be perplexing.", "The need for both sides of the marketplace to understand the risks and rewards is therefore clearly apparent. In this post we will use Lending Club data to create LoanHelp: a simple website capable of helping both creditors and borrowers find out if that loan is worth it or not.", "Feel free to check out the GitHub repo for the detailed analysis: https://github.com/NadimKawwa/loan-help", "For this project we are going to use data from Lending Club, an American peer-to-peer lending company, collected from 2007 to 2018. The data is available for free download on Kaggle. The files contain information on all loans issued, such as current loan status and the latest payment information.", "The data also contains features such as credit score, number of financial inquiries, zip code, and collections. Overall we have around 890,000 observations and 75 features. To reiterate, our goal is to predict whether or not an individual will pay back their loan or default.", "Prior to conducting any steps, we sort by issue date and make the last 10% of observations the test set. For better visualization consider Figure 1:", "This method entails that the testing data will not be seen in the exploration phase, adding another safeguard against leakage. This is common practice as we have no means to know for sure what the future is.", "Our goal is to predict whether or not an individual will pay back their loan or default", "Some information in the data occurs in the future after the loan has been issued, such as installment: the monthly payment owed by the borrower if the loan originates. This information is indicative of the future and constitutes a data leak and should be discarded. Overall, in this step we discarded about 50 features from the analysis.", "The dataset contains a lot of missing inputs, and it is tempting for data scientists to discard a feature if more than half are missing. However, it is advisable to take one\u2019s time and give each feature its due diligence. There is joy in uncovering patterns amidst chaos, it\u2019s what data scientists do.", "Figure 2 below shows the distribution of missing observations as a percentage of each feature. We make the judgement to drop all the features that have more than 50% missing values. For those with less than 10% missing we fill in the mode of that feature.", "Some features are categorical data such as job titles. For the latter and similar features, we engineer our own features that attempt to assign jobs to relevant categories. For example, titles such as Nurse and Doctor tick the mark as \u2018health\u2019 occupations. In addition, we created a binary feature for \u2018executives\u2019 who have titles such as president, CEO, and regional manager.", "For many machine learning algorithms, a standard scaler instance can boost performance. Before diving in, consider the image below:", "It makes more economic sense to scale observations by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) than the whole nation. If the first digit of a zip code indicates a state, the second two digits denote the central post office facility for that area.", "We shall therefore keep track of statistics such as the mean and standard deviation of samples grouped by the first 2 digits that we shall denote as the \u2018macro\u2019 statistic. The reasoning behind this is that $20,000 has a different value in Austin, TX than say, San Francisco, CA (the author wishes he paid less rent).", "So who are the debtors of Lending Club? The company assigns each a letter sub grade (more on that later), such that A1 is the best possible grade and G5 is the worst. The distribution appears to be skewed to the right, with most users having OK to good grades.", "One interesting result is the plot below comparing annual income of paid and default loans. Note that the distributions seem identical, whereas those who tend to default have on average a slightly lower income.", "Perhaps then the two plots are of greater interest. We see that a higher interest rate (int_rate) correlates with a higher likelihood of default. In parallel, a lower sub grade is also indicative of a possible default. We have presented these two plots together since applicants with a lower sub grade are deemed risky and are subject to a higher interest rate. This is therefore an example of feature correlation.", "With the data cleaned, we opted to try several supervised learning algorithms in order to pick a winner and develop it further.", "Given the imbalanced nature of the dataset, relying on accuracy alone is not enough. Metrics such as Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) and the f1 score are useful in the case of imbalanced datasets. Figure 3 below shows the ROC curve for different models:", "Note that each classifier was instantiated with the default parameters, therefore results might vary depending on the parameters. In a more advanced study, one would compare the best of each model against the best of other models. For the sake of limiting the scope of the project, we decided to go with XGBoost given its overall superior performance. Overall XGBoost was able to achieve an AUC of 0.68.", "As with all machine learning algorithms, cross validation and grid search are useful tools to get the most out of performance. Hyperparameter tuning can be a computationally expensive process, it is therefore preferably done with a google colab notebook. The model hyperparamteres were tuned, however, only for a small number of trials.", "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) is a US agency in charge of consumer protection and regulates business practices, among other things. Depending on where you live, there is probably a government agency with similar tasks.", "The FTC may require an institution to justify why certain loan requests were denied or face legal ramifications. Therefore, model explainability is paramount for legal compliance. Furthermore, if any feature relates to personal information like gender or ethnicity: drop them. It\u2019s not just unethical, it\u2019s also against the law.", "From a product standpoint, users on the website might want to understand why their application did not go through. Could it be their age? Credit score? Were there any elements in their favor? Frustrated users tend to abandon the platform altogether. Opaque machine learning models are a guaranteed way to lose business. Explainability is not just the law, it is also key to growth.", "Hence this section deals with understanding what are the underlying features at play and how they sway the model\u2019s decision.", "Opaque machine learning models are a guaranteed path to poor decisions", "We make use of SHAP values in order to gain a case by case explanation of model outputs. Note that SHAP feature importance is quite distinct from feature permutation importance. Indeed, permutation is based on the decrease in in model performance whereas SHAP is based on the magnitude of feature attributions.", "Figure 4 is a density scatter plot of SHAP values for each feature to identify how much impact each feature has on the model output for individuals in the training dataset.", "Figure 4 limits the output to the top 30 features sorted by the sum of the SHAP value magnitudes across all samples. The top feature is the \u201csubgrade\u201d (a Lending Club assigned grade), such that the best grade is A1 and the worst is G5. Intuitively, it makes sense to have the best rated applicants the most likely to pay off their loans.", "The next feature is \u201cterm\u201d and refers to the number of payments on the loan, such that values are in months and can be either 36 or 60. The third feature \u201cdti\u201d is \u201ca ratio calculated using the borrower\u2019s total monthly debt payments on the total debt obligations, excluding mortgage and the requested LC loan, divided by the borrower\u2019s self-reported monthly income\u201d.", "We move our attention to home ownership, which can be one of owns, mortgage, rents, any, other, or none. In the feature engineering portion of the project, we decided to replace these observations with a numerical value such that owning a home has the highest value. We bring our attention to this feature because for a subset of users, being a homeowner can be an indicator of a pending default. It is worth noting here that feature interaction might play a role in this assessment.", "With our model trained and results up to satisfaction, we can wrap it up into a script where users can input information about themselves and receive a credit assessment.", "The larger goal is to provide a case-by-case explanation, to make loan applications a transparent process", "We must take into account what we can reasonably ask of the users. For example, what does a sub grade of C1 mean? How does a user know where they stand? Therefore, we refer to Lending Club\u2019s SEC filing which provides a table of sub grade versus average FICO score (see page 49). Below is a plot of this relationship between sub grade and FICO:", "Note that this chart is not exactly as robust as we want it to be. Notice that there are kinks in the plot that defy logic: F1 has a better FICO score than E5. We would expect an almost total positive linear correlation between the FICO score and sub grade. There are other considerations for how to calculate the sub grade, perhaps hidden in other parts of the SEC filing. However, for the context of this study we shall consider this information sufficient.", "We must also take into account user fatigue for this portion and the scope of our application. In terms of app development, can we ask the user to input 30+ pieces of information about themselves for a preliminary evaluation? For practical considerations, we will cap the required inputs to key items such as:", "We make use of python\u2019s Flask framework to create a simple website. We then use heroku, a cloud platform as a service supporting several programming languages, to deploy it online:", "Below is a demonstration of how to use the website. We begin by filling out information:", "Hitting the submit button results in a decision and information about the loan:", "The most important lesson for developing an application on Heroku or anywhere else: Always specify the python dependencies with versions explicitly specified.", "In addition, consider the amount of traffic expected and how to reduce computation time. For example, loading the pickled model as soon as the page is opened saves us the effort of having to load it every time we make a prediction. On the other hand, the website is hosted on a free domain that sleeps after 30 minutes of inactivity.", "Finally, consider what input types and values we expect and place hard restrictions where needed. W3schools provides an easy tutorial for those looking to get started.", "So far we have been able to explain the model\u2019s output in such a way that is digestible for creditors and loan applicants. We can further extend our findings into a practical method to assess risk and increase revenue for creditors. In this section we will briefly show how data science can be applied to loan insurance.", "Some creditors might want their assets insured in case of default. How do we calculate the expected gain? Let\u2019s assume a simple case where an applicant is given a $1000 loan.", "At the end of each month, the debtor is expected to pay the money back with interest. If there is a 5% chance of default at any month then the expected profit for the creditor is:", "Where n_paid is the number of times the end of month fee was paid, and n_unpaid the number of missed payments. If all billing cycles are paid off, the credit will get their money back plus interest. If at any point the debtor defaults on the loan, any future payments are considered lost.", "How does this apply on a larger scale? Insurers will have a mix of reliable and less than stellar debtors. By pooling these portfolios together, insurers can offer lower rates since the loss from defaults is offset by premiums paid in full by worthy debtors. Data science plays a key role here since it produces a probability of default for each loan.", "Typically, we want to present our best performance metrics and call it a day. However, will the deployed model consistently return the same results? How can we guarantee a minimum performance to stakeholders?", "Using the .632 Bootstrap method by Bradley Efron and Robert Tibshirani, we are able to construct confidence intervals. We found out that 95% of the time, the AUC is between (0.64, 0.67).", "The machine learning model would eventually reside on dedicated a web server and be called upon by creditors and debtors who use the service. Setting aside the time needed to load the webpage and access the data, how much time does it take to make a decision?", "We performed this exercise on the test data and found that on average a prediction is made in 203 microseconds with a standard deviation of 62 microseconds. Performance can probably be optimized, however the time is quite reasonable.", "Using consumer data, we were able to help both sides of the marketplace assess the outcome of a loan and make wiser decisions. The inputs and results are given in plain English and do not require expert knowledge.", "Despite our best efforts, we could not achieve a model that is almost always right. This is in part due to the fuzzy nature of the problem. In addition, some critical features are not present in the data such as age, education level, and micro/macro economic factors.", "As with any machine learning model, it is crucial to regularly update our training data. Over time consumer trends change, new products become available, the ground truth shifts, and as a result our metrics start taking a hit.", "How often we retrain the model and which data to use is beyond the scope of this article, but a necessary consideration prior to production deployment.", "Hope you enjoyed reading this article!", "Got questions?
