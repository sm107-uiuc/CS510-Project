Humans have always been fascinated by the concept of predicting the future, like with a crystal ball in a fairy tale.", "It is true that a prediction might tell you what will happen, but not why. And in some situations, you may still have to understand that.", "A good example of this is the weather, you can\u2019t predict it yourself, and you can\u2019t change it. It\u2019s the same for a predictive artificial intelligence (AI), that will generally be designed to tell you what will -probably- happen, but not why. This is the \u201cblack box\u201d effect or \u201cinterpretability problem\u201d.", "So, when do you still need that predictive AI? In fact, there are only two cases:", "Let\u2019s ask this question: Are you going to become a millionaire? Would you rather get a prediction about that, a simple \u201cyes\u201d, \u201cno\u201d, or even \u201cwhen\u201d based on historical data, or would you rather prefer a detailed explanation about what you have been doing that helps and what does not?", "This is where the Butterfly Effect hops in. As a human, you make decisions all the time, and a lot of those decisions are going to have an impact on your future. Some might seem like insignificant decisions, but will still have a dramatic impact, for example on whether you\u2019ll meet the love of your life or not.", "So, let\u2019s say you\u2019re a smart person, a hard worker and you have a good idea about what you should do to be successful, and then you get a prediction (e.g. from a crystal ball), that you\u2019re definitely going to become a millionaire in about three years. Then, you start being lazy and decide that you prefer poetry over big data, and since you\u2019re going to become a millionaire you assume that\u2019s OK.", "Well, that prediction about you becoming a millionaire has now expired. Because this is the real world, not a fairy tale, and your poems are not that good.", "If you think about it for a bit you will see that you would have been better off understanding how to become a millionaire rather than get a mere prediction of whether you\u2019ll succeed or not. Because all the decisions you make can have an impact on the outcome, thus anything you will do after you get the prediction can make it go wrong, like, for example, deciding to become a lazy poet. And you need to understand that, the \u201chow\u201d and the \u201cwhy\u201d.", "Let\u2019s take another example, this time you are an irascible 60 year old Emperor of Rome around 136 AD. You\u2019re already quite ill, with recurrent nosebleeds and edema, and the augur (there was no crystal balls in the ancient Rome) says you\u2019ll die from a heart attack at 62 years old. In this case and at these times, having a clear understanding of why people get heart attacks, thus helping to prevent them, would probably have been much handier than the augur\u2019s prediction. By the way, that\u2019s an interesting story (except the augur, that was me), try googling it.", "Now when you look at things from a company\u2019s perspective: Would the CEO prefer a prediction of the financial income for the next year, or a clear understanding of what has led to an increase or a decrease in income in the past years?", "Companies have access to a lot of data (endogenous or exogenous), and that data can be correlated with an increase or decrease in income. Once you understand these correlations, you can start searching for causal links and root causes, and then improve. So before predicting the income, shouldn\u2019t we try to understand how to increase it?", "Financial income, or any other indicator directly related to it is typically an outcome (sorry for that) which will be impacted by decisions, operational or strategic, made by everyone in the company, from front-line workers to the CEO.", "So, before we put all our money and energy into predictive analytics, we should leverage advanced analytics techniques and skills to help us discover the patterns, correlations and causal links, to understand faster and better why we get this particular outcome and how we can act to change it to our favor. If the data is available, AI, modern analytics and data science can deliver enormous business value by helping to explain the \u201cwhy\u201d of things, why some things work, and why others don\u2019t. And I\u2019m talking about AI designed to explain or help explaining stuff, not \u201cexplainable predictive AI\u201d that would make a prediction and also explain how or why.", "Let\u2019s take a practical example: Sales. A sale translates into data as an \u201cobject\u201d, and this \u201cdata object\u201d (maybe a line or a group of lines in a database) has attributes (maybe the columns in the database), such as:", "All these business \u201cattributes\u201d of a sale will generally be available within the data into the information system, maybe millions of lines of sales data.", "You can start analyzing manually, using a traditional Business Intelligence tool (or Excel\u2026), and you might find out the sales were good in the US, and bad in Japan. But that does not tell you much. So, you continue analyzing, and you might find that in Japan sales were very bad for one product category in particular. You continue analyzing and you might find that some products from a specific product category performed worse than others, and some of these products, performing bad overall, performed well for some client categories, and bad for some other client categories. And this process goes on until you have a complete \u201cscenario\u201d to investigate, and then you\u2019ll start searching for root causes to tackle.", "Now imagine that you give me the raw data, and I give you the list of the most influent attributes + the list of the worst scenarios (combinations of attributes), and their \u201cweight\u201d relatively to the outcome (bad sales).", "One of these scenarios could look like this:", "Now you can start analyzing not one attribute at a time, but complete scenarios, with a clear idea of where to start. You instantly know that this product did not sell well for that client category in a specific city during a specific period, and that accounts for 5% of the \u201cbad sales\u201d. So, you can start right now, investigating root causes, remediating and improving.", "And you have a whole list of scenarios that you can investigate, and they are all relevant and worth investigating because they have been selected by the algorithm based on that specific criteria (through the attributes influence and the scenarios weight relatively to the outcome). It could be a list, or it could look like this, with the bad scenarios in orange and the good ones in blue:", "With that kind of visualisation, you instantly see that there is an issue with Japan sales, and you can dig into each branch to understand why, through the analysis of the detailed scenarios.", "Now, you could have asked the data & analytics team to design an algorithm that would predict the sales for next year. That algorithm would probably have told you that sales were still going to be bad in Japan, and that would not have helped you understanding why and how to remediate this.", "I\u2019m not saying predictive analytics is useless, but for a lot of companies, this kind of \u201cinterpretative\u201d or \u201cexplanatory\u201d analysis accounts for a lot more use cases than predictive analytics. And there is no deep learning or super complex stuff there, it\u2019s only statistics, not so simple ones but not science fiction.", "We monitor a lot of indicators for which a clear understanding of what leads to a good or a bad outcome would bring a lot more business value than a simple prediction of the outcome. Because when you have a clear understanding of the different variables and their impact on the outcome, then you can act on these variables, to optimize and improve the outcome.", "In conclusion, before investing into a new predictive algorithm, ask these two questions:", "If both answers are \u201cyes\u201d, then reconsider and focus on understanding rather than predicting. That way you\u2019ll be able to not only adapt, but improve.", "Typically, if you ever felt frustrated because of a predictive algorithm that did not help explaining why a specific outcome had been predicted, that may be because you needed to understand, not predict.", "Thank you for reading, please let me know your thoughts, and don\u2019t hesitate to share.", "Your home for data science.
