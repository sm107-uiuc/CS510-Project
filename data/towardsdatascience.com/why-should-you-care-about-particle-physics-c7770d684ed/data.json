I\u2019m studying a research paper while you muster me up and down.", "\u2018Why did you become a particle physicist?\u2019", "\u2018Because I enjoy it,\u2019 I reply bluntly.", "\u2018Yeah but \u2014 your job is funded by the government. So obviously there should be some public interest in what you\u2019re doing?\u2019", "\u2018Yes, of course. Science is always of public interest. That\u2019s because it\u2019s deeply human to be curious about how the world works. And science is the best way to find out!\u2019", "\u2018Of course, but shouldn\u2019t we be targeting bigger problems with science? There are more important things than funny little particles! Cancer, humanitarian crises, wars\u2026\u2019", "The science of today is the technology of tomorrow", "\u2018You\u2019re right,\u2019 I admit. \u2018Of course those problems are much more pressing, and we should definitely fund scientists and organizations to try to solve them.", "\u2018But we should also fund particle physicists. Think about it: Einstein published his theory of relativity more than a century ago. Yet without it, we wouldn\u2019t have GPS today!\u2019", "\u2018Well, GPS works with satellites that orbit around the Earth. Your position on Earth is calculated from the distance that each of these satellites have to your device. But you need to take into account that they orbit around Earth pretty fast. Einstein\u2019s theory predicts that time ticks a little faster for objects that move rapidly. If we wouldn\u2019t take that into account, GPS would be so inaccurate that you could hardly make use of it.\u2019", "\u2018Oh, wow. So if the government hadn\u2019t funded Einstein to do his theories, we\u2019d still be using maps without our current position?\u2019", "\u2018In fact, you\u2019d have GPS anyway. Einstein is quite an exception \u2014 he did his physics research in his spare time while he was working as a patent attorney. He didn\u2019t get any funding for developing his theories.\u2019", "\u2018See? You\u2019re obsolete!\u2019 you blurt out with a sheepish grin on your face.", "\u2018Well, no! Without funding for particle physics, we wouldn\u2019t have the World Wide Web.\u2019", "\u2018You heard me right. The WWW was invented by particles physicists at CERN.\u2019", "\u2018Those guys must be geniuses. Why weren\u2019t they concentrating on their particles though?\u2019", "\u2018You see,\u2019 I begin, \u2018at CERN, a huge amount of data is produced every year. And a lot of researchers only stay at CERN for a year or two, and then continue to work on their projects from their home laboratories. So the scientists developed a system with which they could access information from anywhere. Et voil\u00e0, the World Wide Web was born!\u2019", "I smile. \u2018Yes, hadn\u2019t that happened thirty years ago, the world might be a very different place today.\u2019", "\u2018Okay but that\u2019s a while ago. So why are people still working there today? Aren\u2019t we wasting our money?\u2019", "\u2018Well, first of all, we\u2019re still curious about elementary particles. That\u2019s the main motivation. The Higgs boson has been discovered, but there\u2019s still a lot of mysteries that we\u2019d like to solve.", "\u2018Plus, this tool of particle physics, called World Wide Web, reached a very widespread use. New tools are constantly being developed in and around CERN. Why shouldn\u2019t those be useful to the public, too?\u2019", "\u2018What kind of tools would those be?\u2019", "\u2018Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, for example. Particle physicists are among the earliest developers and adopters of these technologies. They help to make sense of the enormous amounts of data they gather.\u2019", "\u2018So particle physics is, like, a lot of data science?\u2019", "\u2018Exactly. And that\u2019s why particle physicists at CERN and all over the world are on the cutting edge when it comes to developing these algorithms. That doesn\u2019t mean that they\u2019re the only ones \u2014 there are lots of computer scientists, data engineers and others involved, too.", "\u2018But particle physicists are really helping to move this field forward because they need these tools for their work on particle data. We\u2019re still at the very beginnings \u2014 but you can expect AI to change the world in similar ways as the World Wide Web did.\u2019", "\u2018We\u2019ll see whether that happens\u2026 Speaking about technological revolutions, there\u2019s also Quantum Computing. That could also be important in the future, right? Do particle physicists work on that, too?\u2019", "\u2018Not that much. Quantum physics has a lot to do with particle physics, but they\u2019re not the same. At the same time, Quantum Computing, and especially the Quantum Internet, might revolutionize scientific computing as a whole. Particle physicists could profit from that, as well as many many other branches of science. And who knows what kind of technological and societal advances will result from that?\u2019", "\u2018Yeah, who knows?\u2019 you reply, gazing out of the window. \u2018That does sound quite cool. Seems like particle physics plays quite a large role in everybody\u2019s lives, but in ways that you wouldn\u2019t expect.\u2019", "\u2018You\u2019re perfectly right,\u2019 I reply, smiling contently as we move towards the door to exit the train.", "Your home for data science.
