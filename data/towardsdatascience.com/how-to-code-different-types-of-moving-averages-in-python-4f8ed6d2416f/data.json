The different \u201cknown\u201d types of moving averages are:", "We will go through each one, define it, code it, and chart it.", "As the name suggests, this is your plain simple average that is used everywhere in statistics and basically any other part in our lives. It is simply the total values of the observations divided by the number of observations.", "Mathematically speaking, it can be written down as:", "In python, we can define a function that calculates moving averages as follows:", "The function takes your data structure represented by the Data variable, the moving average period (20, 60, 200, etc.) represented by the period variable, what do you want to apply it on (on OHLC data structures, choose 3 for close prices because python indexing starts at zero) represented by the onwhat variable, and the where variable is where do you want the moving average column to appear. Note that you must have an array of more than 4 columns for this to work, because it doesn\u2019t automatically create a new column, but simply populate it.", "As opposed to the simple moving average that gives equal weights to all observations, the exponential moving average gives more weight to the more recent observations. It reacts more than the simple moving average with regards to recent movements.", "Mathematically speaking, it can be written down as:", "The smoothing factor is often 2. Note, that if we increase the smoothing factor (also known as alpha) then, the more recent observations will have more weight.", "In python language, we can define a function that calculates the EMA as follows:", "The function is self-explanatory as it merely reproduces the EMA function presented above.", "This moving average takes into account the general picture and is less impacted by recent movements. It\u2019s my favourite trend-following indicator. Mathematically speaking, it can be found by simply multiplying the Days variable in the EMA function by 2 and subtract 1. This means that to transform an exponential moving average into a smoothed one, we follow this equation in python language, that transforms the exponential moving average into a smoothed one:", "It is a simple moving average that places more weight on recent data. The most recent observation has the biggest weight and each one prior to it has a progressively decreasing weight. Intuitively, it has less lag than the other moving averages but it\u2019s also the least used, and hence, what it gains in lag reduction, it loses in popularity.", "Mathematically speaking, it can be written down as:", "In python language, we can define a function that calculates moving averages as follows:", "Basically, if we have a dataset composed of two numbers [1, 2] and we want to calculate a linear weighted average, then we will do the following:", "This assumes a time series with the number 2 as being the most recent observation.", "If you are also interested by more technical indicators and using Python to create strategies, then my best-selling book on Technical Indicators may interest you:", "So, which one to choose? That question is left to the risk profile of the trader and her familiarity with the moving average. Some prefer plain simple moving averages while others try to dig deeper by using combinations of exponential and smoothed moving averages. It all depends on you to find your favourite one. My advice?
