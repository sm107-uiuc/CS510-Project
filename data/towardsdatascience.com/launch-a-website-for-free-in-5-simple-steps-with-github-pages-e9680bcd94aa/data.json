Actually, it doesn\u2019t have to cost anything at all, can be done by anyone- regardless of experience level- and can be up and running in under 10 minutes! (You can check out mine here)", "GitHub Pages is a feature of GitHub which allows users to host static webpages straight from repositories. It\u2019s ideal for hosting a personal portfolio website, showing off projects, or for a small organisation to host their page. In this post I\u2019ll demonstrate just how simple it is for anyone to get a website onto the web, hosted through GitHub Pages.", "If you already have a GitHub account, feel free to skip this step. If not, you can sign up here.", "I\u2019ll try not to assume prior knowledge throughout this article, but I\u2019d recommend you familiarise yourself with Git concepts if you\u2019ve never used it before. This article offers a great introduction to Git and GitHub from the complete basics:", "A repository is where you store all the code for your project, or as GitHub\u2019s help page explains:", "\u201cA repository is like a folder for your project. Your project\u2019s repository contains all of your project\u2019s files and stores each file\u2019s revision history. You can also discuss and manage your project\u2019s work within the repository.\u201d GitHub Help", "Therefore, to get started with our project, the first thing we need to do is to create a repository for our website\u2019s code to reside. Now that we have a GitHub account this is easy to do. Simply navigate to the top right of the GitHub homepage, and under the \u201c+\u201d menu, select \u201cNew Repository\u201d.", "This will open the \u201cCreate a New Repository\u201d page where we can choose a repository name and choose whether our repository is \u201cPublic\u201d or \u201cPrivate\u201d. It\u2019s important that we give this repository a specific name so that GitHub knows that this repository should be hosted through GitHub pages. This should be [your_username].github.io . So, for example, since my GitHub username is emilegill743, my repository name- and as we will see later also my website URL- will be emilegill743.github.io. We will also want to set our repository as \u201cPublic\u201d, since GitHub Pages only allows hosting of \u201cPrivate\u201d repositories if we upgrade to GitHub Pro.", "Once we have completed this, GitHub will take us to our newly created repository and explain several ways we can get started working with a local copy of the repository. If you\u2019re not familiar with working with Git on the command line, the easiest way to \u201cclone\u201d this empty repository to your local system is to use the \u201cSet up in Desktop\u201d option. This will open up GitHub Desktop- which can be installed here- creating a local copy of the repository at a location of your choice. You\u2019ll now have an empty folder with the name of your repository on your local filesystem which will be tracking any changes we make. These changes can then be \u201ccommitted\u201d and \u201cpushed\u201d to our remote repository on GitHub.", "Now, if you\u2019re hardcore you might want to design your website from scratch. Theoretically, you could do that; all we need is an index.html file in our remote repository and GitHub will go ahead and render our website. However, since the purpose of this post is to get our website up and running as quickly as possible, we\u2019ll use a template to get us started. This will allow us to create a sleek, responsive, professional website with minimal work involved.", "There are many sites offering templates for website designs, some can be purchased for a small cost, but many are available for free. A particular favourite of mine is HTML5 UP, which offers a selection of beautiful designs, perfect for a personal portfolio website. All designs are free under the Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 License, meaning that we are free to use it as we wish, so long as we credit HTML5 UP for the design.", "Feel free to do your own research and find a design that best suits you; for demonstration, here I will use HTML5 UP\u2019s Strata theme.", "Now that we have selected our design, we can download its associated files and transfer them into our local repository. We can then commit our changes and push this to our remote repository. Again, if you\u2019re comfortable working with Git, go ahead and do this via the command line, but if you\u2019re new to this you can equivalently use GitHub Desktop.", "This is where the magic happens. Open up a web browser and navigate to the URL [your_username].github.io .", "Our website is live! Now let\u2019s look at how we can add the final touches and personalise it, right now it\u2019s just a template.", "For this final step, we\u2019ll need a text editor. If you\u2019re a coding pro, you\u2019ll probably already have a text editor of choice. Any will do, but I\u2019d personally recommend Visual Studio Code, which you can install here.", "Opening the folder containing our repository in our text editor we will see all the files contributing towards the design of our website. The most important of these is our index.html file, which denotes the structure of the main page of our website. There will probably also be some .css files and maybe some .js too. Don\u2019t worry too much if you\u2019re not familiar with any of these, I wasn\u2019t when I created my first website! A basic summary is that HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) forms the building blocks of the structure of our webpage, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) describes how our webpage should be styled, and Javascript defines the interactive behaviour of our webpage.", "The first thing I\u2019d suggest is that you download the \u2018Live Server\u2019 extension for Visual Studio Code, which will enable us to preview our website as we edit it, automatically refreshing when we save changes. Alternatively, you can just open up the index.html page in your web browser and manually refresh to check changes.", "I won\u2019t go into too much detail about how to write HTML, otherwise, this could quickly become a tutorial. The basic syntax is composed of \u2018tags\u2019 which form HTML elements, the building blocks of an HTML web page. These tags normally consist of a start tag, any attributes of the tag, some content and then an end tag.", "It\u2019s up to you how much you want to customise your website. At the most basic level, you\u2019ll want to change the content of the HTML elements in your webpage to reflect your personal information. You\u2019ll also probably want to change the images in the webpage. To do this all you need to do is copy the image that you want to use into your repository (if you\u2019re using an HTML5 UP template it\u2019ll probably already have a folder designated for images) and then adapt the src attribute of the image element to reflect the path to your new image, <img src=\"path_to_image.jpg\"/> . It\u2019s worth noting here that image elements are composed of a single tag containing their attributes, rather than a start and end tag like many other HTML elements.", "If you\u2019re interested in learning more about HTML, CSS and Javascript so that you can take your website personalisation to the next level, I\u2019d strongly recommend Harvard\u2019s CS50W: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. This is a completely free course on edX, the first couple of chapters of which focus on Git, HTML and CSS and later goes on to look at Javascript. It provides a great introduction to the skills we need to really make the website our own.", "For further inspiration, feel free to check out my website at emilegill743.github.io and the corresponding GitHub repository linked below.", "If you enjoyed this post, feel free to check out some of my other articles:", "Your home for data science.
