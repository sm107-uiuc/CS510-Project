Fortunately, this is easily done. The answer is \u2018Yes.\u2019 Everyone has dirty data and that means you have dirty data. Now that we\u2019re over that hurdle, the next two questions we must pose are more challenging to answer, \u201cWhich data is dirty?\u201d and \u201cHow do we clean our data?\u201d", "Over the years I\u2019ve seen many companies and teams compose a herculean effort to clean their data. They involve large dedicated teams, major project schedules, and months or years of effort. All of them have ended in much the same way, failure. At least the original task of the company\u2019s data being clean at the end of the project was a failure.", "The truth is the shape of the project tends to change. It morphs from a linear project with a beginning and end, followed by an expected deliverable of clean data into a cyclical process that will persist indefinitely. However, the ultimate goal of clean data for analysis and insights is achieved.", "Before I explain the steps involved in a successful cyclical process for cleaning data, let\u2019s take a moment to explore the reasons gargantuan data cleaning projects like the example presented above will always fail. The linear project approach to cleaning data has an inherent assumption leading us to repeated failure. It assumes the data you are cleaning is somewhat static in nature. New data will enter your system, but the new data will be entered correctly and not contain errors or be dirty. But if dirty data is somehow introduced into the source systems again, the processes you have put in place account for all possible forms of dirty data issues that could come your way in the future.", "This is not a realistic picture of how source systems work. For example, let\u2019s say we have software used by the human resources department. It allows the HR staff to enter employee names and track their progress through all the on-boarding requirements from initial date of hire to the employee being fully trained for their position.", "This software has been written (or at least customized) by a 3rd party software development team your company used to tailor the software to its particular on-boarding processes. The software saves all data into a SQL transactional database, as we would expect. One of the fields in the database stores each employee\u2019s score for each of their assessments throughout the on-boarding process. Of course, if a particular assessment has not been completed, no score would be entered. Your initial review of the data reveals the incomplete assessments contain an empty string in the score field whereas the completed assessments contain an actual score value in the field.", "Your team implements cleaning transformations to ensure these empty string values are changed into NULL values in your analytics data tables so that you can easily find and ignore them during your calculations. Problem solved! Or so you think\u2026", "Months after your data cleaning efforts are complete, one of the HR employees finds an issue in the HR software itself and they raise the concern with the software development team. The 3rd party team chooses to resolve the problem by changing the behavior of their software to no longer use an empty string value for incomplete assessment scores, but they now use a zero as the incomplete placeholder. At first, this seems to solve the problems for HR, but soon their reports from the analysts begin reflecting extremely low score averages across the onboarding groups.", "When your team is finally asked to investigate, you realize the issue comes from the averaging methods being used. Since empty strings were initially the incomplete indicators and you converted them to NULLS, the average of the scores could be completed with a simple average function because it ignores NULLS. It does not ignore zeros. Therefore, the averages are now including the zeros from the incomplete assessments.", "While the above example is a simple one and real life problems are much more complex, it clearly demonstrates the problems inherent with linear data cleaning approaches.", "Instead, we constantly change and add to the processes affecting the data throughout our business and therefore, we are continually changing our circumstances introducing new opportunities for problematic data. And to make matters worse, we not only change the processes, systems, sources, fields, and numerous other elements involved with the collection of data, we are adding new data at an ever increasing rate.", "By the time you\u2019ve created a method for cleaning the data and implemented it, many or all of these factors have changed \u2014 many times over.", "The linear data cleaning path is doomed to failure and should be abandoned. Instead, let\u2019s begin with a systemized version of the cyclical process everyone ends up adopting in the end. Instead of wasting the time, energy and resources on the linear version and then landing a disorganized cyclical method of data cleaning compounded with your team\u2019s feeling of failure like everyone else, you can structure the cyclical process correctly from the beginning and everyone will be successful, know why they are successful, while doing their work with the feeling of success. Doesn\u2019t that sound better?", "The cyclical process to data cleaning is rather simple. It\u2019s composed of 5 stages similar to that of a Hospital Emergency Room. While hospitals vary in their exact implementation of ER procedures, the same basic stages apply. The first phase is triage. In this phase, medical professionals assess the patient, assign the patient a priority based on their severity, and assign them to the proper group for treatment. The second phase is the treatment phase. It consists of actually treating the patient and assigning any required follow up that needs to occur both prior to the patient\u2019s discharge and after the patient\u2019s discharge.", "Using these ER and triage processes as a guide, let\u2019s consider what cyclical data cleaning looks like.", "People don\u2019t just show up to the ER to hang out or get a cup of coffee. They are there for a reason. The context of the visit is unmistakable even if the cause of their ailment is yet to be diagnosed. The same is true for data cleaning.", "One of the difficulties with the more traditional linear approach to data cleaning is the abstract nature of the situation. Let\u2019s think about this for a minute. If we\u2019re looking at data in our database, but not actually trying to analyze anything for the company (ie. monthly sales trends or attrition) dirty data may or maybe not be obvious. But once we begin calculating revenue, profit, churn, and the other typical items our business is asking to know, dirty data rears its ugly head. Data, out of context, can easily mask itself as clean data. So, in the linear approach, we often miss many data fields that actually contain dirty data. The resulting \u201cclean\u201d data at the end of a linear cleaning project will need to be revisited the first time an analyst discovers the numbers in the profit column simply do not add up.", "Using the cyclical process of data cleaning, we begin with analysis. Just go ahead and turn the analysts loose in the data. Tell them to make requests of the data engineers, work their analytical magic, and not be bashful about raising questions when something in the data doesn\u2019t look correct. This is help and context our cleaning process desperately needs in order to correctly and holistically clean the data we currently have.", "Whenever an analyst finds something concerning the data, this becomes a reason to send the patient to the ER. It\u2019s the stomach pain or shortness of breath or high fever that brings the data to you for cleaning. Of course, once an analyst sends a \u201cdata\u201d patient to your ER, your data triage staff must be ready to perform.", "When someone walks into the emergency room, the first thing the medical team does is assess the patient. They take their temperature, blood pressure, itemize a list of the medications the patient is taking, get a description of the symptoms, and so on. The same is true when beginning to assess a \u201cdata\u201d patient.", "Of course in a medical situation, most of this information is compared to the known range of normal. Nurses and doctors know if your temperature or blood pressure is higher than the acceptable range. Those normals have already been established. But in a data situation, the normals may need to be established before you can verify the patient\u2019s health.", "Your \u201cdata\u201d triage team will assess the patient sent to them by the analyst (the referring physician). In this stage of our cyclical process, your team will work alongside the analyst and possibly other business team members to verify the data is indeed dirty. You will also want to assess the business cases using this data and its impact on the company or subsections of the company.", "Our first example of questions to ask in this phase are \u201cWhat should this data look like: summed or averaged or as a dimension or whatever?\u201d Without a proper understanding of what the data should be, we have a very high likelihood of making changes that do not clean the data. We may merely change the data into another form of dirty data.", "Next, you will need to understand the impact and importance of the data. Does the CEO or CFO use this data to make market decisions, product decisions, report company progress to the street? Is this data used by customer care to better your clients\u2019 experience? Does marketing use this data to plan their next ad strategy? Is this data stored and used for trend analysis later this year for the board of directors? There are endless possibilities, but the impact and importance of the data will help you properly prioritize this patient.", "Even patients in the ER have a varying degree of urgency. One patient may be feeling nauseous and another having extreme chest and arm pain. Yet another may be unconscious or suffering from burns. While they all need medical attention, there are only so many medical professionals present to assist them and the worst situation will merit the top priority. Of course, many factors are used to determine the severity of someone\u2019s ailment and the consequential priority assigned. The same is true for \u201cdata\u201d patients.", "Once you understand, in context, what the data should be and its importance and impact, you will need to assign it a priority. All teams have limited resources and your data cleaning team is no different. This exposes yet another problem with the linear cleaning approach. When you linearly clean data every identified occurrence of dirty data tends to get equal priority because it becomes part of a large project that will consider the data clean at the end of the project. In today\u2019s world, most teams have very limited resources. Undertaking all problems with equal priority significantly delays the team releasing the most important and impactful results.", "Your data team will need to establish its own rules for prioritization. Perhaps anything specifically coming from a customer\u2019s request or trouble ticket jumps to the top of the list. Or maybe the C-Suite requests receive top priority. Every company culture has its own dynamic and your team should work together with company leaders to determine the best course of action for prioritizing requests. However, once that criteria is defined, your team should use the context, impact, and importance gathered in the assessment along with the established criteria for prioritization and assign each request accordingly.", "Hospitals often employee an ER doctor for each shift. This doctor will see every patient and address every condition coming into the ER during her shift. However, should a specific ER patient come in that requires a specialist, the shift doctor will work to stabilize the patient and then assign him to a department. The doctor on call for that specific department will take over this particular case. If a particular patient requires multiple specialists, multiple departments can be assigned and assist in the overall treatment plan.", "The practice of assigning a generalist or possibly even multiple specialists is the same when cleaning data. You must conclude the best teams to involve for the best outcome. In order to do this, your team of data specialists, perhaps the generalists need to learn more about the dirty data in question.", "Begin by determining the sources for this data and any transformations the data undergoes before it\u2019s ultimately saved in the database for the analyst to use. Again, your team may need to secure the assistance of data engineers, data wranglers, database administrators, or more business team members to properly assess the patient. You might even enlist the help of a software developer if you determine the application related to the source data is incorrectly saving the data to the database. Do not be afraid to work with others and ask for assistance.", "By outlining the source systems for the data and any ETL, you can more easily and quickly acquire the necessary resources from the correct teams. If it\u2019s accounting data, you may need to engage the data team for those servers. Or perhaps if it\u2019s the geoscience data, you need to reach out to some of the geo-scientists to understand the ETL process they helped design with the data engineers. You get the idea.", "Performing this upfront work, places your \u201cdata\u201d patient in the best possible care and ensures the quickest \u201crecovery\u201d or cleaning time.", "With the proper team in place, the treatment of the patient can now begin. The assembled team will need to decide how to best clean the data for use and storage in the database used by the analysts. Of course, this could be a fast process or it could take some time depending on the complexity of existing ETL or the dirty nature of the source systems involved.", "Once the necessary steps have been identified, tested, and agreed upon, they need to be documented and, of course, implemented. It\u2019s always best to use a development, test, production environment architecture and first implement the change into development. Then promote to the testing environment and only once everything is verified as correct, promote the final solution to the production environment. But these environments and steps to deployment differ from company to company and you\u2019ll need to follow your organization\u2019s outlined process.", "In a hospital, once the patient has been treated and is considered well enough for discharge, they still may have follow-up appointments or tasks they need to perform like taking medication. With data cleaning, multiple follow-up tasks may also be necessary, but the one follow-up task that is always required involves automation.", "No matter what your company\u2019s change process is, the one thing you must do is make the changes persistent through automation. Automation comes in many forms. You may need to change the existing ETL process or introduce an automated process that cleans the data post ETL. Automation can be achieved through any language or system that works for you and your company: SQL, Python, C#, SAS, and the list goes on. A common automation system for companies using Microsoft products is SQL Server Integration Services (or SSIS). The scheduled execution of these tasks can be as simple as cron or Microsoft Task Manager or SQL Agent. It doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be sophisticated. But it needs to be automated.", "If you allow the cleaning process to remain manual, you will very quickly overwhelm your team with recurring manual work and hope of taking on new data cleaning efforts will be forfeited.", "I\u2019ve said this elsewhere, but the quickest way to render your team useless is to overwhelm them with recurring manual work. All exploratory, cleaning and initial data wrangling work is manual. But once the process is cleanly defined, it must be automated if your team has any hope of continuing to impact your company\u2019s insights and decisions.", "Now that you\u2019ve taken the cleaning process all the way through analysis, identifying, assessing, prioritizing, team assignment, establishing a cleaning process, and automating the cleaning process \u2014 now it\u2019s time to repeat the process. Analysts will confirm the result of your team\u2019s work and be thankful, but they will also send you new \u201cdata\u201d patients and the process starts again for these new patients who are ill and need your healing touch.", "The doctors and nurses saving lives in the hospital emergency room aren\u2019t just winging it. They\u2019ve been training for years. They can practically perform their work in their sleep because it has been ingrained in them through hours of formalized training. Not only have they been diligently trained in medical procedures and knowledge, the policies and procedures used in the ER to triage a patient, admit a patient, prioritize a patient, all the way through treating the patient have been thoroughly studied and formalized in order to give any patient coming through their doors the best chance of survival.", "Medical personnel and hospital administrators know that a strong, formalized plan leaves much less chance of error and that leads to greater success. The exact same benefits from formalizing a plan are true for data cleaning.", "As outlined in the opening of this article, large linear based projects for data cleaning typically end up with this same cyclical process in the end. The linear process failed them and because the work must still be accomplished, the team tackles each problem as it comes to light. But many times arriving at this same process after a failed linear attempt leaves the process in an informal state. It\u2019s really just performed in an ad hoc manner.", "Without formalization, the process outcomes will ebb and flow between success and failure. The successful cleaning of each newly discovered dirty data issue will always be up for grabs. Your team will work inconsistently and their motivation for the job will come and go. Even if your ad hoc approach begins to work well over time as your team gels, it\u2019s upended every time a team member leaves or a new member is hired. And here\u2019s why\u2026there\u2019s no plan to follow.", "Some days your team will knock it out of the park when they are feeling good about what they do. But other days the recurrent work and recollection of failure from the initial data cleaning project will push them to question their work and the nature of their job.", "\u201cWhy can\u2019t we create a process to fix all of this instead of constantly facing a fire every day?\u201d", "\u201cWhy doesn\u2019t management care that we are already overworked? They just keep sending us more requests.\u201d", "\u201cWhen will we ever catch up?\u201d", "If you will take the time and give the effort to formalize the cyclical process of cleaning your data, your team will have a roadmap to follow and the other departments in your organization will have a guide to properly interact with your team. In many ways, it\u2019s just perspective, but the formalization of the process removes the ambiguity and gives purpose to the work being done. Formalizing is a necessary step to ensuring a consistently successful outcome to data cleaning for your team.", "Rod Castor helps companies Get Analytics Right!
