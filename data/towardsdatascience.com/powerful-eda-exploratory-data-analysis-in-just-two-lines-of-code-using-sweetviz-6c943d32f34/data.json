Given the repetitiveness and similarity of such tasks, there are a few libraries that automate and help kickstart the process.", "One of the latest is a new open-source Python library called Sweetviz (GitHub), created by a few contributors and myself for just that purpose. It takes pandas dataframes and creates a self-contained HTML report.", "It packs a powerful punch; in addition to creating insightful and beautiful visualizations with just two lines of code, it provides analysis that would take a lot more time to generate manually, including some that no other library provides so quickly such as:", "Here is a link to a report generated by Sweetviz for the well-known sample Titanic Survivor dataset. We will be analyzing this report in this article.", "Being able to get so much information so quickly about the target value and compare different areas of the dataset almost instantly transforms this initial step from being out all about tedium to being quicker, interesting and even to some degree\u2026 fun! (to this data geek, at least!) Of course EDA is a much longer process but at least that first step is a lot smoother. Let\u2019s see how it works out with the well-known sample dataset.", "For this article, we will be analyzing the sample Titanic Survivor dataset you can find here.", "After installation of Sweetviz (using pip install sweetviz), simply load the pandas dataframes as you normally would, then call either analyze(), compare() or compare_intra() depending on your need (more on that below). The full documentation can be found on GitHub. For now, let's start with the case at hand, loading it as so:", "We now have 2 dataframes (train and test), and we would like to analyze the target value \u201cSurvived\u201d. I want to point out in this case we know the name of the target column in advance, but it is always optional to specify a target column. We can generate a report with this line of code:", "Running this command will perform the analysis and create the report object. To get the output, simply use the show_html() command:", "After generating the file, it will open it through your default browser and should look something like this:", "There\u2019s a lot to unpack, so let\u2019s take it one step at a time!", "The summary shows us the characteristics of both dataframes side-by-side. We can immediately identify that the testing set is roughly half the size of the training set, but that it contains the same features. That legend at the bottom shows us that the training set does contain the \u201cSurvived\u201d target variable, but that the testing set does not.", "Note that Sweetviz will do a best guess at determining the data type of each column, between numerical, category/boolean and text. These can be overridden, more on that below.", "Hovering your mouse over the \u201cAssociations\u201d button in the summary will make the Associations graph appear on the right-hand side:", "This graph is a composite of the visuals from Drazen Zaric: Better Heatmaps and Correlation Matrix Plots in Python and concepts from Shaked Zychlinski: The Search for Categorical Correlation.", "Basically, in addition to showing the traditional numerical correlations, it unifies in a single graph both numerical correlation but also the uncertainty coefficient (for categorical-categorical) and correlation ratio (for categorical-numerical). Squares represent categorical-featured-related variables and circles represent numerical-numerical correlations. Note that the trivial diagonal is left empty, for clarity.", "IMPORTANT: categorical-categorical associations (provided by the uncertainty coefficient) are ASSYMMETRICAL, meaning that each row represents how much the row title (on the left) gives information on each column. For example, \u201cSex\u201d, \u201cPclass\u201d and \u201cFare\u201d are the elements that give the most information on \u201cSurvived\u201d. For the Titanic dataset, this information is rather symmetrical but it is not always the case.", "Finally, it is worth noting these correlation/association methods shouldn\u2019t be taken as gospel as they make some assumptions on the underlying distribution of data and relationships. However they can be a very useful starting point.", "When a target variable is specified, it will show up first, in a special black box.", "IMPORTANT: only numerical and boolean features can be targets currently.", "We can gather from this summary that \u201cSurvived\u201d has no missing data in the training set (891, 100%), that there are 2 distinct possible values (accounting for less than 1% of all values), and from the graph it can be estimated that roughly 60% did not survive.", "When you move the mouse to hover over any of the variables, an area to the right will showcase the details. The content of the details depends on the type of variable being analyzed. In the case of a categorical (or boolean) variable, as is the case with the target, the analysis is as follows:", "IMPORTANT: a \u201cwidescreen\u201d monitor is required to see the full detail area for the moment.", "Here, we can see the exact statistics for each class, where 62% did not survive and 38% survived. You also get the detail of the associations for each of the other features.", "Numerical data shows more information on its summary. Here, we can see that in this case about 20% of data is missing (21% in the test data, which is very consistent).", "Note that the target value (\u201cSurvived\u201d in this case) is plotted as a line, right over the distribution graph. This enables an instant analysis of the target distribution with regard to other variables.", "Interestingly, we can see from the graph on the right that the survival rate is pretty consistent across all ages, except for the youngest which have a higher survival rate. It would look like \u201cwomen and children first\u201d was not just talk.", "As with the categorical data type, the numerical data type shows some extra information in its detail area. Noteworthy here are the buttons on top of the graph. These buttons change how many \u201cbins\u201d are shown in the graph. You can select the following:", "Note: to get to these buttons, you need to \u201clock in place\u201d the current feature by clicking on it. The feature then has a RED OUTLINE to show it is locked in place and you can access the detail area.", "For example selecting \u201c30\u201d yields a much more granular graph:", "For now, anything that the system does not consider numerical or categorical will be deemed as \u201ctext\u201d. Text features currently only show count (percentage) as stats.", "In many cases, there are \u201clabel\u201d columns that you may not want to analyze (although target analysis can provide insights on the distribution of target values based on labeling). In other cases, you may want to force some values to be marked as categorical even though they are numerical in nature.", "To do all this, simply create a FeatureConfig object and pass it in to the analyze/compare function. You can specify either a string or a list to kwargs skip, force_cat and force_text:", "Even if you are only looking at a single dataset, it can be very useful to study the characteristics of different subpopulations within that dataset. To do so, Sweetviz provides the compare_intra() function. To use it, you provide a boolean test that splits the population (here we try train[\"Sex\"] == 'male', to get a sense of the different gender populations), and give a name to each subpopulation. For example:", "Yields the following analysis: (for this screenshot I used feature_config to skip showing the analysis of the \u201cSex\u201d feature, as it is redundant)", "Note that the target value (\u201cSurvived\u201d in this case) is now plotted as separate lines, one for each compared dataset (e.g. male in blue, female in orange).", "EDA is a fluid, artistic process that must be uniquely adapted to each set of data and situation. However, a tool like Sweetviz can help kickstart the process and get rid of a lot of the initial minutiae of characterizing datasets to provide insights right off the bat. Let\u2019s go through all the features for the Titanic dataset to see what that could look like.", "All this information from just two lines of code!", "Using Sweetviz easily gives me a significant jump-start when I start looking at a new dataset. It\u2019s worth pointing out I also find it useful later in the analysis process, for example during feature-generation, to get a quick overview of how new features play out. I hope you will find it as useful a tool in your own data analysis.", "Your home for data science.
