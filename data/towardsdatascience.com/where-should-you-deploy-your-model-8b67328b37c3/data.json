You\u2019ve engineered features, destroyed missing values, and created a model that is well-suited to predict your target. You are finally ready to put this model into production, but the overwhelming amount of options you have to deploy your model with is overwhelming. Although we are very fortunate to live in an era where cloud computing has taken a large domain in the machine-learning market, this also has a draw-back in that all of the options can often make it difficult to narrow your decision down to which one is going to best suite your model and your personal situation.", "Another really neat article on this topic is this overview on deployment by neptune.ai, if you would like to learn even more about deploying API\u2019s, this is a great resource for that! Here is a link:", "While Amazon Web Services (AWS) is, of course, a great option for most applications, it is also rather expensive and simply not needed for a lot of rather basic endpoints. On the other hand, automated services like Heroku make it incredibly easy and even free to host models, but also make the endpoints usability relatively limited in scope. With all of these great options balancing together in the domain of endpoint deployment, what is the best option to apply to different situations?", "Make no mistake, in terms of performance to cost, AWS has nearly every other service completely blown out of the water. This is why many jobs have AWS experience as a requirement for employment. For many enterprise applications, AWS is a nearly perfect tool because it can allow for grouped instances scaled using compute and cost across a large scale of different servers.", "While AWS is a great solution for models that need a lot of computational power, it can certainly be argued that a line needs to be drawn at some point in the ratio of price to performance. AWS can get rather expensive rather quickly, and this might not be optimal if you plan to use a lot of computation with small returns. If it isn\u2019t possible for you to make your money back on the computation, then it likely isn\u2019t worth hosting in the first place. For some applications that might be intensive over the long term, but not necessarily need an immediate delivery of power, a more frugal option might be necessary. On top of that, AWS is notoriously hard to use. In my experience, I have run into situations where I have been unable to find options in the AWS dashboard, or actually been blocked from doing certain things via SSH by AWS, which has certainly been frustrating.", "If you\u2019re like me and you use Linux everyday, know how to use NGINX and Apache, and understand how to run a Unix command line, Linode could quite possibly be the best option for you. Linode has the advantage of not only being cheap, but also similarly to AWS being extremely scalable. Need more memory for a specific operation on your server? Linode allows you to pick individual parts to be used for your server, so your memory issue would be solved. Here is an article I wrote which goes into more depth on the benefits of Linode:", "The great thing about Linode is that it\u2019s not built to do one thing or the other. While this means that a Linode server is incredibly dynamic and free, it also means that it can be a bit more complicated than some of the other options you might have at your disposals. With a Linode server, you\u2019re going to need to do the \u201c Docker stuff\u201d and setup web-servers and things of that nature. If you\u2019re not prepared to do so, then Linode might not be the best option for you personally, regardless as to whether or not it is for the model you are looking to deploy. Luckily, I have published quite a few different articles on how to setup an NGINX server and deploy Gunicorn3 into production, like this one:", "Linode is a great middle-ground between something managed yet complex like AWS and something incredibly managed but incredibly simple like Heroku. While it might not provide the same raw performance, or perfect connections that AWS can provide, it runs at a simple flat rate that you can expand as you desire.", "Where you deploy your model is a question which has an answer that depends not only on what you seek to accomplish with your model, but also what you yourself are capable of. If you are a beginner and just started managing virtual environments, Heroku is a great option to get you familiar with the deployment process to some extent. Heroku is a service that will setup a unique virtual environment for your services and deploy them automatically with your dependencies loaded from said environment.", "Although it is rather convenient, Heroku only gives a free-tier user about three deployments before begging them for money. Another problem with a Heroku app is that it is embedded into the Heroku system by default, which gives you very little flexibility to add anything or expand your services in the future. Models that automatically train themselves, for example, would be a very difficult thing to implement on a Heroku platform.", "If you are capable, or just really able to apply yourself and maybe have an old computer lying around, there is absolutely nothing stopping you from hosting your endpoints all by yourself! While there are disadvantages to self-hosting like reduced internet speeds and electricity costs, there are also some very real and convincing advantages that you might want to consider before throwing the idea away entirely. The biggest advantage to hosting your own server is that you have control over the hardware involved. While this is somewhat of a negative, as it can mean some rather high start-up cost, it also means that you can upgrade all of your components freely as you desire.", "Having the freedom to do whatever you need to do with your server, access it locally, or even go non-headless can be a serious advantage. Sometimes it might be more convenient to mount a flash-drive to transfer a large file, rather than secure copying it over. The advantage of having your own physical server is like the advantage to having more storage on your phone itself, rather than cloud storage; there is no middleman, and you are the sole proprietor of your server. If running a server is something that you might wish to pursue, I have written a tutorial on how to do exactly that here:", "While there are many more options than these four for deployment of course, I thought this is a great outline of the general server hosts that you might find across the board capable of deploying endpoints. For me personally, I enjoy working with as few restrictions as possible, and I am pretty good with Linux. As a result, I would consider the Linode and self-deployment options the most. The option you select is going to depend entirely on what your model is for, how it works, what it needs, as well as your dev-ops skills as a developer. I also would like to thank you for reading this article. If you happen to be reading this article on September 1st \u2014 September 2nd, I would like to demonstrate a self-hosted HTTP server that will only be up for those two days, so I hope you enjoy my surprise!", "Here is a link for those of you on desktop:", "And here is a link for the mobile users out there!:", "Your home for data science.
