How many times have you quoted or seen Einstein\u2019s famous equation about matter and energy?", "One of the most famous probabilistic formulas is the celebrated Drake equation, which was devised by Frank Drake in the 1960s to help stir discussion and debate about the odds that there is life elsewhere in our galaxy and that we might be able to communicate with it.", "A particularly controversial element of such efforts is whether or not we should be undertaking a passive search or a more active search for intelligent life that might elsewhere exist. A passive search involves the act of simply trying to catch ahold of any signals and then be on-earth internally alerted that perhaps something is out there. An active search consists of sending out a signal to let the beyond-our-planet listeners know that we are here, and we do so in hopes of sparking a response. Of course, generating a response might be good or bad for us and the renowned Stephen Hawking had forewarned that we might stir-up a hornet\u2019s nest that will ultimately cause our own destruction and demise.", "What is the chance of there being intelligent life somewhere in our galaxy other than here on earth, you might be pondering?", "Let\u2019s first agree that we\u2019re primarily interested in intelligent life, meaning that if there is some kind of primitive life oozing someplace and for which it or they cannot communicate in any modern means, we\u2019ll set those aside as being unworthy for the moment of trying to find.", "Presumably, an intelligent life form would be emitting various kinds of electromagnetic radiation, doing so as we indeed do here on earth. Astronomer Frank Drake had been using a large-scale radio astronomical device in West Virginia in the late 1950s to scan for radio waves bouncing off our planet.", "100 Million Worlds Likely Can Sustain Life", "There were numbers floating around by scientists and astronomers especially that there might be 100 million worlds in the universe that could sustain life as we know of it. How did the 100 million number come to be derived? It was based on the belief that there might be 10 million million million suns, and perhaps one in a million of those suns that had various planets revolving around the sun, and of those perhaps one in a million million that were planets composed of the needed aspects to foster life. If you multiply that out, you arrive at the handy number of 100 million planets that in-theory could have life on it.", "Frank Drake opted to put together a small conference of those keenly interested in the serious pursuit of intelligent life and hoped to get vigorous discussion going. In preparing for the conference, he decided to jot down a means to predict the odds of there being intelligent life in our galaxy.", "The equation that Frank presented has since then become famously known as the Drake equation, giving due credit to his having derived it. Over the years, there have been many that point out the equation as failing to include a number of other factors that should presumably be included. That\u2019s fine and it was not Frank\u2019s assertion that his equation was the end-all be-all.", "Frank Drake\u2019s equation consists of trying to arrive at a number N, which would purport to be the number of civilizations within our galaxy that might exhibit intelligence and for which it might be possible to communicate with them.", "Here\u2019s the Drake equation: N = R-star x Factor p x Factor ne x Factor 1 x Factor i x Factor c x Factor L", "Essentially, you multiply together seven key factors and it will get you to the number N. Each of the factors is logically sensible in terms of what you would expect to consider when making this kind of an estimate. The factors tend to build upon each other, doing so in the manner of considering a type of pie, wherein you might slice up a pie, doing so incrementally until you get to the final slice.", "I hope you can see that the Drake equation is actually quite simple and readily digested. I am not denigrating the formula by saying so. In fact, I applaud the equation for its ease of comprehension.", "Had the formula been arcane, I doubt that it would have gained such widespread interest and popularity.", "Multiply the Factors to Get to N", "Another fascinating aspect is that the factors are all multiplied together. Again, this suggests simplicity.", "The factors appear to be simple and the equation appears to be simple, which makes it ideal for being used and discussed. Meanwhile, let\u2019s all agree that coming up with the numbers that go into those factors is a bit more challenging. In fact, most of the debates about Drake\u2019s equation is not the equation per se, but instead the estimates that one might plug into the factors of the equation.", "What was the N that Drake and his colleagues came up with in 1961, based on his formula? Well, the group decided a range would be the more prudent way to express N, and they generally arrived at a vale of between 1,000 and 100,000,000.", "In defense of the estimated range, you could say that they came up with a number greater than zero and that it is also less than some truly large number such as estimates into the billions.", "The Drake equation is kind of like a helpful anchor. Having an anchor is like planting a tree, and you can then watch as additional discourse grows around it.", "What does this have to do with AI self-driving cars?", "At the Cybernetic AI Self-Driving Car Institute, we are developing AI software for self-driving cars. One of the most outspoken national and worldwide debates involves when AI self-driving cars will be \u201chere\u201d in terms of being available for use. This question continually arises at conferences and by those within this field, along with it being asked by the general public, and by regulators, and by many other stakeholders.", "I propose that we derive a kind of Drake equation to aid in the debate. Allow me to elaborate.", "I\u2019d like to first clarify and introduce the notion that there are varying levels of AI self-driving cars. The topmost level is considered Level 5. A Level 5 self-driving car is one that is being driven by the AI and there is no human driver involved.", "For self-driving cars less than a Level 5, there must be a human driver present in the car. The human driver is currently considered the responsible party for the acts of the car. The AI and the human driver are co-sharing the driving task.", "Another key aspect of AI self-driving cars is that they will be driving on our roadways in the midst of human driven cars too.", "Returning to the topic of predicting the advent of AI self-driving cars, let\u2019s consider the characteristics of an equation that could aid in such an important endeavor.", "First, consider the matter of who makes predictions about the advent of AI self-driving cars.", "There are various technologists that offer their opinions about AI self-driving cars and proffer when we\u2019ll see those vehicles on our streets and byways. One upside about technologists is that they hopefully are versed in the technology and are able to judge the efficacy of how AI and autonomous capabilities are progressing.", "Let\u2019s also though consider that those technologists truly versed in AI self-driving cars and making predictions might do so without any tangible rhyme or reason. Sometimes they make a \u201cgut\u201d or instinct proclamation.", "Throughout the history of technology, we\u2019ve certainly seen quite a number of rather overly optimistic predictions that did not come to fruition in the time frame offered. It\u2019s an easy trap to fall into.", "We also need to clarify that technology in the case of AI self-driving cars can cut both ways, presenting capabilities to achieve autonomy, but also inhibiting autonomy due to the lack of as-yet known approaches, techniques, and computing tools. As such, I find it useful to consider technological advances and how they are formulating, while also considering technological obstacles that are known are even unknown and will be discovered further down the road.", "Many technologists that make predictions often do not include other seemingly non-tech related factors that can mightily impact the pace of technology. This is a delinquency of omission, one might say.", "What kind of factors will affect the advent of AI self-driving cars?", "For Now, Investment and Regulation Favors AI Self-Driving Car Development", "There are economic factors that will either encourage spending on the development of AI self-driving cars or might dampen and undermine such spending if pulled away and used for other purposes.", "Another key factor is society and societal acceptance or resistance to the advent of AI self-driving cars. There could be a tough choice to be made about the progress for AI self-driving cars in terms of unleashing them onto our public roadways, and yet at the same time having them get involved into deadly car accidents.", "It is also crucial to consider the regulatory environment and how it can impact the advent of AI self-driving cars. Currently, regulations about using AI self-driving cars on our public roadways is relatively loose and encourages this budding innovation. If regulators are suddenly pressured to do something about AI self-driving cars, such as when deaths or injuries arise while the self-driving cars on the roads, it could quickly swing toward a tightened regulatory setting.", "Cannot Rely Soley on a Technologist Perspective", "I trust that you are now convinced that any equation trying to predict the advent of AI self-driving cars should not rely solely on a technologist perspective alone. We would want to include the economic perspective, a societal perspective, and a regulatory perspective too. This provides a mixture of perspectives and will hopefully avoid getting caught unawares or blindsided when using solely a single factor.", "Each of these factors is not necessarily independent of the other. In fact, the odds are they will tend to swing in the same direction together, though at times on a delayed basis.", "In exploring the set of factors, you might argue that each factor can end-up being a proponent for and propelling forward AI self-driving cars, or each factor can be an opponent that tends to cause resistance or a dampening to the advent of AI self-driving cars. This is a push-pull kind of tension. It would be vital to encompass this tension in the factors that are used in an equation for making such predictions.", "Besides the core factors, there are other matters to be considered. For the purposes of this new equation, let\u2019s assume that we are trying to predict the advent of true AI self-driving cars at the Level 5 of the accepted standard.", "I\u2019d like to also mention that we need to agree on what it means to have an advent of something. If you could make one AI self-driving car at a Level 5, have you achieved reaching an \u201cadvent\u201d of that item? No, I don\u2019t think so. Though you might have done a great job and arrived at Level 5 instance, until we have some semblance of those AI self-driving cars driving around, it seems questionable to say that there is an advent of them.", "How many then is an advent? If there are dozens of true AI self-driving cars traveling on our streets, would that be an advent, or do we need more like hundreds, or maybe thousands. What is the number at which we would have a prevalence of true AI self-driving cars?", "There are various ways to measure the prevalence. I\u2019m going to keep things simplified and suggest that we use as a measure the percentage of cars in-use at the time. We will gradually see a switchover to AI self-driving cars, as mentioned earlier, and this will see the retirement of conventional cars and the rising population of AI self-driving cars.", "Of the total population of all cars, we might agree that once a certain percentage becomes true AI self-driving cars, we have reached a prevalence. Assuming you are willing to go along with that premise, we can then debate whether it is 1%, 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or possibly even 100% before you would refer to it as a prevalence (I used rounded numbers by the tens, but it of course could be any number of 1% to 100%).", "Let\u2019s Set 20% As Meaning Prevalent", "I\u2019m going to use 20% for now. Why? In various areas of study, 20% is often used to indicate a prevalence. This comes from environmental and often biological areas of research. It seems like a large enough percentage that it is isn\u2019t trivial, and yet not so large that it seems somewhat impossible to reach.", "In the case of the existing number of conventional cars in the United States, which as mentioned is around 250 million, an advent of AI self-driving cars would at 20% be a rather daunting 50 million such cars. That\u2019s a daunting number because think about how long it would likely take to reach that number. In other words, even if AI self-driving cars were immediately ready tomorrow, it would take a while to produce that many self-driving cars, along with a while for those AI self-driving cars to be purchased and put into use.", "I\u2019ve previously predicted that once we do achieve true AI self-driving cars, there is likely going to be a rather rapid adoption rate. I say this because those true AI self-driving cars are going to be money makers. When there is money to be made, the demand will go through the roof. This is not just fleets of cars, but as I\u2019ve argued there will be an entire cottage industry of individual consumers that will buy AI self-driving cars to leverage those vehicles as both personal use and for making money.", "I\u2019ve now laid the groundwork for making an equation that can be used to predict the advent of AI self-driving cars.", "The last piece to the puzzle is coming up with a base of when the advent might be reached. By using a base, you can then multiply it by the various factors and see whether the resulting N is the same as, larger than, or smaller than the strawman base. I\u2019ll refer to the base as B-star.", "Take a look at Figure 1.", "We are trying to solve for N. There is the base B-star which is then multiplied by eight factors.", "As per my earlier discussion, there are four overarching factors involving technology, economic, societal, and regulatory matters. For each factor, there is the push-pull, meaning that each factor can be construed as an element that will foster and push along the advent of AI self-driving cars, and there is also a companion factor that is the pull that yanks away from the advent of AI self-driving cars. That\u2019s then four key factors which is doubled to account for the push-pull effect, arriving at 8 key factors.", "Similar to the earlier remarks about the usability of equations, I\u2019ve kept this equation to 9 elements, which is on par with the popular magical number seven plus or minus two rule-of-thumb. The factors are all readily comprehensible. The equation is readily comprehensible.", "It is not intended to be the end-all be-all. It is intended to provide a kind of anchor around which discussion and debate can take place. Without having an anchor, arguments and discussions on this matter are often vacuous and roundabout.", "Take a look at Figure 2.", "As shown, I\u2019ve populated a spreadsheet to make use of the equation.", "At first, I\u2019ve opted to show what might happen if you were to consider a solo-factor only perspective. For example, you might be using solely a technologist\u2019s perspective and so those factors are the only ones populated (the rest are assumed to drop out of the equation, rather than being say the value of zero, which would of course wipe out the calculations). Likewise, I show a solo-economic perspective, and then a solo-societal perspective, and a solo-regulatory perspective.", "In the last two rows of the spreadsheet, I provide a full mix.", "I\u2019ve also opted to show an optimist\u2019s viewpoint and a pessimist\u2019s viewpoint, doing so for each of the solo-factor instances and for the full mix instance. This is in keeping with trying to arrive at a range of values, rather than a singleton value. The optimistic view and the pessimistic view provide an estimated lower bound and an estimated upper bound, respectively.", "For the base B-star, the question arises as to what number to use for it. Since there are many pundits that seem to be floating around the number of 15 years, I\u2019ve used that in this illustrative example. We could use 5 years, 10 years, 20 years, 25 years, or 30 years, all of which have been bandied around in the media. Presumably, whichever base you choose, the factors should ultimately \u201ccorrect\u201d it to tend toward whatever the \u201cactual\u201d prediction will be.", "We are in the midst of carrying out a Delphi method approach to arrive at substantive lower and upper bounds. The Delphi method is a well-established forecasting method, often referred to as ETE (Estimate-Talk-Estimate). In this case, a set of experts in the field of AI self-driving cars have been canvased to participate in a series of Delphi rounds. With each round, the selected experts can see the indications of the other experts and adjust their own estimates as they deem appropriate to do so.", "Though the Delphi method is generally held in high regard, it can be criticized for its potential of groupthink and can at times be weakened by excessive consensus. Nonetheless, it is instructive, and another means to spark useful discussion about the topic.", "When will there be an advent of AI self-driving cars? Some answer this question by amorphous hunches. Via the use of the proposed herein equation, it is hoped that a more tangible and structured discussion and debate can take place.", "You might not like the factors used, or you might want to add additional factors, but at least either way this equation gets the tree planted. From these roots will expectantly spring a widely sophisticated undertaking on the advent question.", "Some critics of AI self-driving cars have said that we\u2019ll never have a true AI self-driving car. If that\u2019s the case, I guess the number for N is either zero (which we\u2019ll define as meaning it will never happen) or maybe infinite. I suppose I\u2019m more optimistic and would like to assert that there is a number for N, which is not zero and nor infinite, and more akin to a value less than one hundred, and likely less than 50.", "Equations, we love them, and we at times hate them (such as when memorizing them for taking tests or quizzes). Take a look at my proposed equation and see what you think. Plug-in some values. Mull over what might occur in the future. Though not a crystal ball, it is a kind of playbook of how to think about the future and the emergence of true AI self-driving cars.", "For free podcast of this story, visit: http://ai-selfdriving-cars.libsyn.com/website", "The podcasts are also available on Spotify, iTunes, iHeartRadio, etc.", "More info about AI self-driving cars, see: www.ai-selfdriving-cars.guru", "Dr. Lance B.
