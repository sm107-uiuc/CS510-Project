There are several practical takeaways that the team behind the blog post, Uizard, discuss in the context of mainly object detection, but the one I found most interesting is the following:", "Pseudo-labels are high confidence predictions, made on the unlabelled data, by a model trained on the labelled (and/or previously pseudo-labelled) training samples. Pseudo-labelling (also known as self-training) can be used to automate much of the data annotation process, drastically cutting down on the associated labelling costs. However, it is prone to errors: in particular, any biases that the model picks up early on, will likely only get amplified down the road. One of the ways to remedy this issue is manual verification of the pseudo-labels. Typically, verification is less time consuming than labelling from scratch, so there is still substantial value added by pursuing this approach. In the blog post, the author describes another solution that Uizard found effective, in particular for the object detection task. This solution is heuristic pseudo-label refinement. Their blog post example deals with detection of certain furniture pieces in images of apartments. Here the sort of heuristics that can be used to automatically refine pseudo-labels can go along the lines of: a dresser and a kitchen island look somewhat similar, but a bed and a dresser are much more likely to be found in the same image than a bed and a kitchen island. So if you detect a bed, and a kitchen island, that \u201cisland\u201d is most likely a dresser. Simple, right? One can imagine many such heuristics in real-life use cases, so this strategy definitely sounds like one to keep in mind.", "Active learning is often considered separately from semi-supervised learning, but essentially, the former can be seen as a subtype of the latter. I have already discussed the theory behind active learning in one of my previous blogposts:", "The basic idea is to train a supervised model on the labelled data, then use the trained model\u2019s predictions on the unsupervised set to prioritize the instances to be labelled next. However, a model trained on a small quantity of labelled data clearly will not deliver the best performance. Now, what if instead of doing supervised training inside the active learning loop, we performed semi-supervised training? A nested semi-supervised approach of sorts, utilizing unlabelled data both for training and for the human-in-the-loop labelling pool. A variation of this idea turns out to work quite well, as discussed in:", "While we are on the subject of active learning, here is a new query strategy one can employ in natural language processing (NLP) problems: how surprising is a given phrase?", "In order to quantify the answer to that question, the authors of Cold-start Active Learning through Self-supervised Language Modeling use BERT. Namely, they use it to compute what they refer to as surprisal embeddings. To give you an idea of the outcome, consider this example from the preprint: the phrase \u201cthey feel ambivalent about catholic psychedelic synth folk music\u201d is deemed to be more surprising than \u201cthis is my favorite television show\u201d. (Cannot really argue with that.) This property becomes part of the query strategy used to prioritize the data annotation that follows:", "In the domain of computer vision, active learning approaches are most often evaluated on either image classification or object detection (meaning, we aim to either assign image-level class labels, or draw bounding boxes around objects and identify them). However, another common computer vision task, semantic segmentation, where class labels are assigned at the pixel level, is typically much more costly to annotate the data for. This, of course, makes it a particularly desirable candidate to tackle with active learning!", "In addition to the standard query strategies (such as variations of uncertainty sampling, etc), we can define a measure that is specific to the segmentation problem \u2014 much like the \u201chow surprising is this phrase\u201d was specific to NLP in the preprint discussed above. Here this new measure is going to be the difficulty of creating a segmentation mask: e.g. selecting the small pedestrian figures is likely going to be more difficult than selecting a large rectangular building, or a bus in the figure above. Incorporating this difficulty into the active learning process is discussed in:", "So this is my other takeaway from the machine learning reading that I did over the past two weeks: be creative. In life, in work, and, more specifically, be creative with your query strategies for active learning.", "On that note, see you in November!", "Your home for data science.
