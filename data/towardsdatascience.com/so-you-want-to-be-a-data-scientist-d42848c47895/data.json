I made sure to keep note of what I was doing well and what I was not doing well during these interviews. Sometimes, I was lucky enough to get straightforward advice from the companies themselves. This article will lay out how to land the job as a data scientist, as well as some useful tips on the interview process.", "Before focusing on how to interview for this position, it is integral in knowing the definition of a data scientist.", "With my experience in several roles and also applying to countless companies, I have come up with my own definition. While it might not be 100% accurate for all positions, I think it serves as a valuable way to look at data science as a career.", "Say you want to perform a linear regression or A/B test, this role might be more known as a statistician. Data science differs in that it requires coding languages and packages like sklearn and TensorFlow to automatically implement machine learning algorithms like random forest, for example. This algorithm would then be incorporated into a holistic data science pipeline that would:", "\u2014 draw new training and evaluation data in with SQL", "\u2014 clean that data and prepare it for the model", "\u2014 apply a machine learning algorithm from a package", "\u2014 evaluate new data and output predictions", "\u2014 input predictions into a data table and/or user-interface", "With a pretty inclusive and complicated process, data science can be overwhelming and there can be key points in the process that calls for specialization. This point is important in landing a job as it will determine what type of data scientist you will be. I believe there are two main types of data scientists.", "Now that we know what it means to be a data scientist, let us turn our focus on the interview process. With most interviews, there is some variability, but over the course of experiencing several of them, there are key similarities between them that are useful to acknowledge.", "\u2014 keep your resume up-to-date with projects that have had a great impact on your previous business. An example of what you would put as a point under a job would be: \u201cCreated a logistic regression to classify 90% of users into this bin, ultimately saving the company 20%\u201d.", "The overall application will include a part and if not, you will need to stress why the company is a fit for you and why you are a fit for them, features to think about are the company culture and mission statement.", "\u2014 another chance at first impressions depending on the company, yes, some companies will barely look at your resume and see if you have the overall base requirements and really get to know you during the first call. Therefore, it can be just as important as your resume. You will expect to explain your resume essentially including your past work, skills, and why they are applicable for the job you are interviewing for.", "\u2014 the first impression that your future manager will have on you. You will talk more technical than with the recruiter, but not focusing on code, and instead, focusing on past projects and future projects at the new company. Expect to talk about broader concepts like churn prediction, classification of images, etc.", "\u2014 your future teammates. You will talk about the tools you used like a Jupyter Notebook or GitHub. It is incredibly important to talk about version control here, key machine learning concepts, like boosting vs bagging, or L1 vs L2 regularization techniques. Here are examples of key concepts listed out:", "\u2014 perhaps the most difficult part of the interview process, and not every interview will actually have this part, and if not, they will commonly have a project that you take home and finish that I will also describe below.", "You will not have to do any extravagant coding here, but expect to know key concepts of Python like lists, arrays, for loops, functions, etc.", "\u2014 I prefer this project over coding because you get to focus on a bigger problem that is more indicative of what you would actually do in your role. But, usually, it is not your choice. You can expect to have a few CSV files or data that will need to perform typical exploratory data analysis, cleaning, model building, and results. The overall deliverable will usually be a Jupyter Notebook as you can save your comments and write more on why you chose a certain model or code snippet. Expect to spend two to four hours on this part.", "\u2014 the part of the process to gauge how you interact with somewhat nontechnical people like you would at work with stakeholders. You will explain your model results a little to them and also focus on the main parts of the business and how you think data science could help them, its products, and processes. It is somewhat of a sales pitch.", "\u2014 will make the final decision. The last part of the process where you will interact with your future boss. They will ask you how the previous interviews went. It is a chance to summarize what you like about the company, role, and team.", "Overall, these interviews might be stretched out over a few weeks, especially with the certain time we are in now, but can also be a remote and back-to-back where the interview lasts around four hours total.", "So you want to be a data scientist?", "Hopefully, you will know by the time you read this article. I have outlined what is commonly required as a data scientist. You can expect several sub facets of data science like business analytics and machine learning. The next part is landing the job.
