The question quickly becomes \u2014 \u201cHow can I determine the right tool for my particular needs?\u201d Today we\u2019ll compare two of the most widely used tools at Fortune 500 companies:", "Let\u2019s get one thing out of the way \u2014 R Shiny is not a reporting/dashboarding tool. Most people use it to make dashboards, so we can consider this comparison fair. As mentioned earlier, R Shiny is a full web framework. With it comes some obvious benefits and some considerations you need to have in mind when comparing it to tools like Tableau.", "We\u2019ll examine the following areas where Tableau and R Shiny compete with one another and declare a winner (or tie) for each:", "Tableau comes with two options with regards to connecting to data. First, you can connect to a local file \u2014 such as CSV, Excel, JSON, PDF, Spatial, etc. Alternatively, you can connect to a remote server. The options there are far too many to list, so here\u2019s a screenshot of the current offerings (late 2020):", "So yeah, there are a lot of options with Tableau. On the other side, R Shiny uses R as the programming language of choice, so Shiny can connect to any source that R can. Just like with its competitor, the options here are endless. A simple Google search will yield either a premade library or an example of API calls for any data source type.", "For domain-specific sources, R Shiny can sometimes have an edge. For instance, with R Shiny you can load and analyze gene expression data or CAD files. These kinds of sources can be problematic for Tableau.", "Winner (Connectivity): Tie, with an edge for R Shiny in domain-specific situations", "Once again, Tableau doesn\u2019t come up short here, with a plethora of visualization options such as bar charts, pie charts, line and area charts, and even more complex options such as geographical plots. Refer to the image below for the full list:", "Still, R Shiny demolishes the competition in terms of optionality for chart types. The most widely used visualization libraries are ggplot2 and Plotly. Here's an overview of the types of visualizations you can make with ggplot2:", "And here are some cool things that you can do with Plotly:", "It\u2019s a no brainer that wins this battle in terms of chart options overall.", "We\u2019ll now see the extent of the trouble you\u2019ll have to go through to create a simple bar chart, both in Tableau and R Shiny. For demonstration purposes, we\u2019ll use the Titanic dataset, so download the CSV file linked here if you\u2019re following along. To be more precise, we\u2019ll create a bar chart containing passenger classes on the x-axis and average age on the y-axis.", "Let\u2019s start with Tableau. After the data imports, it\u2019s relatively easy to create a visualization. Just follow the steps from the image below:", "That was very easy, as Tableau was designed to be intuitive and simple to use for non-technical people. This ease of use comes with a cost called customizability, but more on that later.", "Creating a simple chart is quite a different story with R Shiny. We need to write actual code to get a simple bar chart. First, we need to aggregate the Titanic dataset somehow, so we have the data in a concise, visualizable format. Next, we need to introduce some amount of boilerplate to manage the UI and the server. It\u2019s only a couple of lines of code \u2014 negligible for larger projects, but a real obstacle for someone non-technical to create a simple chart.", "As you can see, there\u2019s no point in using if all you need are simple and straightforward data visualizations without any interactive elements. That\u2019s where Tableau wins by a large margin. If you still want to use R for charts and you\u2019re willing to put the effort in to have something fully customizable, then ggplot2 and Plotly are great options.", "However, even making simple charts with R can be an onerous task for non-technical people. We recommend Tableau for these kinds of tasks.", "Alright, let\u2019s see who will win in The Battle of the Dashboards. We won\u2019t go too complex here, as dashboard development is a highly broad topic with many facets. Here\u2019s an outline of the charts we\u2019ll put into our dashboard:", "Also, all three charts should update when the user changes one of two filters:", "Here\u2019s what the final dashboard looks like in Tableau:", "This entire dashboard required 0 lines of code. We just needed a couple of minutes of clicking in the right places. The dashboard situation is different in R Shiny, as we need to write the actual R code there. However, it\u2019s not too bad of a deal, since R is relatively easy to learn, and the customization possibilities are endless for Shiny dashboards.", "The following code recreates the dashboard we had in Tableau:", "And here\u2019s what the final product looks like:", "As you can see, this dashboard is quite unfinished. That\u2019s what we\u2019ll discuss in the last section of the article. It\u2019s hard to announce a clear winner here, but R Shiny\u2019s dashboard feels more solid to work in. Tableau\u2019sdashboard is way too sensitive to accidental clicks, and the dashboards look pretty similar in a stock-state.", "However, as we saw, you can make a simple dashboard much faster with Tableau than with R Shiny. For this reason, we\u2019ll declare Tableau the winner for simple dashboards, but only for ease of use. As you\u2019ll see, R Shiny is a much better choice if you intend to ratchet up the complexity and visual style of your dashboards.", "Winner (Simple Dashboards): Tableau by a nose", "Here\u2019s where things get especially interesting in our Tableau vs. R Shiny comparison. There\u2019s simply not much you can do with user input in Tableau \u2014 it\u2019s very limited, as it wasn\u2019t designed for such things.", "However, inputs are essential for a well-built and interactive dashboard as they provide a way to, well, interact with the app. Interactivity is where R Shiny seriously outshines Tableau.", "R Shiny provides a wide array of input options. Instead of listing them, it\u2019s better to show some of them:", "Yeah, that\u2019s a lot, and you can certainly do any task with them. One question that might immediately pop into your head as a business user: why is interactivity so important?", "Well, interactivity makes any dataset much easier to analyze. For example, the file input component can enable you to upload your own file to explore within the dashboard, which is then further filtered by date (date range input) and column selectors (var select). This is contrasted with read-only dashboards that don\u2019t allow the user to upload or interact with the data.", "With R Shiny dashboards, you can also build complete interactive forms with password and text field input capabilities. That adds another critical layer of optionality for Shiny end users. Interactivity is a large part of what separates simple dashboards from powerful, enterprise-level business tools.", "Unfortunately, there isn\u2019t much you can do to tweak the visuals in Tableau. It\u2019s designed to look good out-of-the-box, and it\u2019s up to you to change the colors, axes, titles, fonts, and other minor things. The amount of tweakable aspects depends on the type of plot you\u2019re tweaking, but in general, Tableau doesn\u2019t give you as much control as Shiny does.", "Here\u2019s an example of how to change the colors of a histogram:", "R Shiny is a whole other animal. You can customize everything. To start, create a folder www right where your app.R is located. Inside it, create a main.css file. Yes, you\u2019ve got it right \u2013 we can use everything CSS has to offer when it comes to styling R Shiny dashboards.", "To connect the Shiny app to a CSS file, we can put theme=main.css right after the fluidPage in the R file. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s really that simple. Here\u2019s what we managed to do in a couple of minutes with CSS and R Shiny:", "The winner for the visual styling section is once again pretty obvious. R Shiny blows Tableau out of the water when it comes to visual customization, even if Tableau dashboards look fairly decent out of the box.", "Here are the final results, according to our calculations:", "So, is Shiny is a clear winner for all situations? Well, no. It depends on the type of work you need to do. If you need to sketch a single chart or graph quickly, or need to make a dead-simple dashboard every now and then, Shiny may be overkill. Tableau was designed for exactly these sorts of tasks. Further, if you\u2019re a non-technical person and you don\u2019t want to dig too much into the actual code, then Tableau is a great choice for simple charts and dashboards.", "Also, keep in mind that Tableau isn\u2019t free. Tableau licenses go up from a baseline of $70 per month when billed annually, so it\u2019s not an inexpensive piece of software. This isn\u2019t an issue for Fortune 500 companies, but if you are an individual trying to decide on the right tool, Tableau\u2019s price might be a dealbreaker. Alternatively, R Shiny is an open-source solution and is completely free to use (though if you need to host your Shiny app online, you might want to invest in an RStudio Connect license).", "Join my private email list for more helpful insights.", "Loved the article?
