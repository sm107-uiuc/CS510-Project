As we know that a forest is made up of trees and more trees mean more robust forests, in a similar way, random forest algorithm creates decision trees on data samples and then gets the prediction from each of them and finally selects the best solution by means of voting. It is an ensemble method which is better than a single decision tree because it reduces the over-fitting by averaging the result.", "Evaluate our Random Forest Classifier model.", "Decision trees are widely used since they are easy to interpret, handle categorical features, extend to the multiclass classification setting, while not requiring feature scaling and are able to capture non-linearities and feature interactions.", "Logistic regression is the appropriate regression analysis to conduct when the dependent variable is dichotomous (binary).

Logistic regression is used to describe data and to explain the relationship between one dependent binary variable and one or more nominal, ordinal, interval or ratio-level independent variables. Logistic Regression is used when the dependent variable(target) is categorical.", "Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique for regression and classification problems, which produces a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, typically decision trees.", "PySpark is a great language for data scientists to learn because it enables scalable analysis and ML pipelines.
