What if we don\u2019t have a lot of data and procuring more isn\u2019t feasible? Or we lack the expensive hardware that\u2019s imperative for training very deep networks? Both can be solved by using the concept of transfer learning, which we\u2019ll soon find out is something we are unconsciously familiar with.", "Transfer learning is a supervised learning method that aids construction of new models using pre-trained weights of previously constructed and fine-tuned models. Recall those situations in your life wherein you had to take a decision but lacked appropriate domain knowledge for the same. One course of action is to approach your family, professors, friends and peers; listen to their understanding of the problem, apply your own intuitions and finally arrive at an informed decision. This is exactly what happens in transfer learning too. Transfer learning can be applied in several different ways", "What do we achieve by transfer learning?", "In short, you don\u2019t have to start from scratch however it\u2019s highly recommended that you do train some feasibly small networks to understand the basics well before migrating to transfer learning.", "Lack of expensive GPU\u2019s can be compensated by using platforms like Google\u2019s Colaboratory, a Google research project that makes machine learning accessible to all irrespective of hardware requirements, sporting a Jupyter Notebook environment, GPU or TPU support and all of this brought to you via cloud. To get more info on the specs, check out their example notebook linked here https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1_x67fw9y5aBW72a8aGePFLlkPvKLpnBl", "We will apply this technique on a simple binary image classification problem, differentiation between cat and dog images. Our dataset is pretty simple, with total 1,000 images of dogs and cats, encoded with labels 0 and 1 respectively. For image classification, there are lots of established network architectures that we can go through to derive our model from scratch, prior to using pre-trained ones. LeNet-5 is the first one that was employed for handwritten digit classification. With the advent of ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge, AlexNet was born, along with others like VGG-16, VGG-19, ResNet50, Inception, Xception, MobileNet and the ultimate NASNet, which is a neural network model that figures out its own neural network architecture. A simple model based on AlexNet gets a training accuracy of 93% and testing accuracy of 83%. Theoretically, the minimum error that models for such type image classifications can make should be similar to human level error. Humans are adept at classifying dog and cat images so our model should exhibit an accuracy of 95% and more.", "Let\u2019s try out transfer learning using VGG-16", "Among the many pre-trained models available under keras.applications, we choose VGG-16 as it\u2019s architecture is similar to the one we\u2019ve already used. To use the model as a feature extractor, we set include_top=False, so we can add our custom ANN or CNN onto the existing model. Further to make sure that pre-trained weights aren\u2019t adjusted during backpropagation, we set layer.trainable=False. Later on, however, it\u2019s found that accuracy with this setting doesn\u2019t rise above 78% so it will be commented out to perform fine-tuning.", "Next, the custom model, here a simple ANN is added on. Then the final model is constructed. Image data augmentation is applied to compensate for the size of the dataset. After some hyperparameter tuning, training and testing accuracy of 98% and 91% were obtained, for only 37 epochs, whereas we needed 70 epochs to get 83% accuracy on the one made from scratch. The same approach was also applied to ResNet50 which gave 92% and 87% as train and test accuracy. None of these however are perfect, with more tuning, more accuracy will be obtained.", "On a closing note, some things that cropped up during transfer learning", "Here\u2019s my humble attempt at demystifying some of the underlying concepts governing transfer learning and hopefully ease fellow coders\u2019 transition into the land of deep learning. I\u2019m pretty much a beginner myself, dabbling with these as I find it insanely interesting and cool, striving to be a self-taught data scientist. If you are in the same situation too, I hope you soon get the model accuracy that you\u2019re struggling for right now.
