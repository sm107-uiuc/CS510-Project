Either way, you\u2019ve probably seen the headlines claiming that \u2018AI is on the rise,\u2019 perched at a\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://dialogflow.cloud.google.com/", "anchor_text": "Dialogflow", "paragraph_index": 0}, {"url": "https://developers.google.com/assistant", "anchor_text": "Actions on Google.", "paragraph_index": 0}], "all_paragraphs": ["You may have heard about the hype surrounding AI. Maybe you\u2019re a business leader or an aspiring student. Either way, you\u2019ve probably seen the headlines claiming that \u2018AI is on the rise,\u2019 perched at a developmental crest and ready to subsume humans at work. Well, I\u2019ll let you judge that decision for yourself. In this gentle introduction to building an applied chatbot, I show you the basic capabilities that any sensible individual can create, empowered only with tools provided by Dialogflow and Actions on Google.", "So, what exactly *is* Dialogflow? The simple answer is this: to help people interact with technology in a more streamlined way. For example, let\u2019s say that I asked my machine, \u201cWhat coffee shops are open nearby me today?\u201d For more traditional or hard coded systems, if the question wasn\u2019t asked in exactly this manner, then the system would not be able to understand what you were saying. At least in English, there are several ways to convey the same \u201cmeaning\u201d with different words\u2026", "We like Dialogflow because it can handle these different end-user experiences. In order to break down this very fundamental understanding of variance in human speech utterances, I\u2019ll (very) briefly review some basic principles behind Dialogflow that will make the rest of the tutorial more accessible, and should provide you with a useful framework for future chatbot interactions.", "Now within Dialogflow, we also have entities known as agents. These virtual agents that handle conversations with end users. These get trained, like call center agents, to handle expected conversations.", "Agents learn to recognize something known as an intent, which as humans, we naturally understand as something that refers to your motivation, or reason for asking something. Perhaps you\u2019ve listened to somebody ramble and you\u2019re sort of just wondering in the back of your mind \u201cGet to the point!\u201d Well, you\u2019re ultimately able to follow a conversation because you\u2019re constantly assessing a probability of what somebody\u2019s intent is during a conversation. Likewise, an intent is used to help your virtual agent take a phrase and understand what the user, or speaker, wants to get out of the conversation and then inform the agent\u2019s final response.", "So with the cafe example, the intent could be described as a \u201cFind Cafe Intent.\u201d Before you can even order Starbucks, the agent needs to know where to find a cafe, so we ask for your zip code in the first pass. Equipped with this intent, our agent then knows what kind of parameters to listen for, what kind of data that it needs to extract, and what kind of answers or responses the agent should give your end user. Some example responses might be:", "Finally, within each intent, we can define Entities, that identify key pieces of data from a user\u2019s utterance that we should extract. Conceptually, these are like objects that the agent should look for in the conversation \u2014 such as \u201cdate\u201d or \u201clocation.\u201d Perhaps the entity types are even more customized, like a \u201ccoffee\u2019 entity that matches different types of coffee (americano, mocha, iced latte) that may be available for purchase with our caffe agent.", "Before we get into the process, the final component to consider is a Dialogflow Context. Just as how context matters in normal conversations, Dialogflow agents need to understand the context, in order to match the intent. For example, if you just randomly walked up to somebody on a sidewalk and said, \u201cOk let\u2019s order a mocha!\u201d, then you would be likely to receive a bewildered stare and this humble stranger would probably say something along the lines of \u201cUm, who are you?\u201d", "However, if you set the context by first asking the same stranger, \u201cHey, what coffee shops are open nearby me?\u201d, then you set a \u2018Cafe-Shopping Context.\u2019 Therefore, this previously bewildered stranger might respond more normally if you followed up with \u201cCould I order a mocha?\u201d", "The last \u2018foundation\u2019 that you should understand for building Chatbots using Google Assistant is an Action. Just as the name implies, an action can be the first entry point to initiate an interaction with your assistant. This is like when we start a conversation with \u201cHi Dr. Starbucks!\u201d in order to activate our Starbucks chatbot. However, even more broadly defined, an Action enables the fulfillment or execution of some user-defined intent, through some service, app, or logic.", "If you\u2019ve got any more questions, feel free to reach out to me directly or check out the YouTube video. In the meantime, let\u2019s get our hands dirty!", "2. From here, you click on \u201cNew Project\u2019 in order to identify a tentative \u201cproject name.\u201d We\u2019re going to customize it, and you can click on the button that says \u201cConversation.\u201d Remember, I\u2019m doing this on June 30, 2020, so it\u2019s possible that the interface has changed again. But for those of you watching this in a timely manner, I hope this helps pique your interest. Now, scroll down to the bottom and make sure to Define an action in Dialogflow.", "3. Next, click on \u201cDecide how your action is invoked. You\u2019ll then see settings, and a display name. This is the name that we use to trigger our agent and activate him or her. We\u2019re going to call our agent, Agent S for Starbucks. A nice, gender neutral name. Make sure to save it.", "4. You\u2019ll then be able to specify Actions. Click on Get Started. This will open up a series of windows that will ultimately take you to Dialogflow, and the loading process at this step will require You may have to authorize your Gmail to login to Dialogflow.", "5. From here, you should then be brought to the \u201cintents\u201d page in Dialogflow. Now we can start building our Starbuck agent\u2019s intent. Choose a name for the corresponding Dialogflow and confirm your settings before proceeding.", "6. So we\u2019re #blessed because we have access to a default welcome intent conversation. That\u2019s great. And we\u2019re going to throw it all away! Find these training phrases and just kill it all by clicking on the trashcan icon that should appear at the right of the text string.", "7. Now, let\u2019s change up the responses to become customized to our first question that our agent will be asking. We\u2019re going to fill our first \u201cwelcome, hello\u201d intent with a request to geolocate Starbucks near you. Fill out this section with questions like \u201cWhere do you live?\u201d Or \u201cLet\u2019s get you Starbucks. First, what is your zip code?\u201d After you provide enough training phrases, click SAVE. Click the blue button at the top, and you should see at the bottom right of your screen, an \u201cintent saved\u201d notification pop up.", "8. Now, here\u2019s a good practice. Before we make the system any more complicated, let\u2019s test this first component. Does it work? Do you extend pipes if they\u2019re already leaking? Probably not. So, let\u2019s shift gears for just a minute. Let\u2019s go back to the left sidebar in Dialogflow, and click on Integrations. Then, click on Google Assistant, Integration Settings.", "9. From here, you need to click Test. This loads our actions into the Actions console simulator. There\u2019s some cool stuff here, which is courtesy of the amazing Google developers community who put this together, and out of scope in this video.", "10. So naturally, we want to build on our previous conversation, so we\u2019re going to create a new intent. And of course, the training phrases to trigger this intent have to be the responses we anticipated in the previous one. So if I\u2019m asking for a zip code, let\u2019s feed the system some possible zip codes Make sense, right? Let\u2019s go back to dialog-flow. Then we will click on Intent, and HOVER our mouse over Default Welcome Intent. From here, we will then create another intent, and fill out the following fields.", "11. It\u2019s important to remember that we\u2019re using this intent to collect information. Notice how I fill out the data and make it all required, for specifically \u2019size,\u201d \u201cdrink\u201d and \u201ctemp.\u201d If you order from Starbucks, they always ask this. You\u2019re welcome to get creative here, just make sure to create realistic prompts that identify and specify what parameters your agent needs to gather for a good Starbucks order. An example is shown below.", "12. The final step is to have your Starbucks agent indicate the parameters of your order and review it. For example, \u201cDid you order a grande, iced caramel macchiato?\u201d After you have successfully taught your agent how to provide this type of response, we can end the conversation.", "From this point, you\u2019ll now have a chance to test out your own chatbot within the Google Assistant test platform. Of course, this is a very basic, introductory version of an \u201cOrder Starbucks\u201d chatbot that does not actually access any Firebase database, which would be a closer real-world application. If you\u2019re interested in learning how to do this, then let me know! Likewise, if you\u2019ve made it to the end of this article, then I hope that this brief tutorial has made chatbots a little less mysterious. Even better, if I\u2019ve inspired you to begin traveling down the rabbit-hole of artificial intelligence, and build your own chatbot!", "Your home for data science.
