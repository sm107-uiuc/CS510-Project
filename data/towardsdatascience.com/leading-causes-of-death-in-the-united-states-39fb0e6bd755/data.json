Grouped by cause, state, and year, the data is available for the years 1999\u20132016, with the top 10 causes of death listed as follows:", "The full dataset was accessed with an HTTP GET request from the CDC\u2019s website.", "So that demographic and population data can be properly accounted for, the death count will be used instead of the age-adjusted rate. In order to calculate number of deaths per capita, data from the CDC\u2019s Bridged-Race Population reporting tool (WONDER) was incorporated, which groups population counts by year, state, age group, and gender. Joining this data with death count data, the number of deaths per capita can be calculated on a state-by-state, annual basis, and we can start asking some questions.", "Ultimately, the objective is to identify the leading cause of death in the United States since 1999, and then identify the states that should be treated as high risk in 2019. To guide the analysis, there are four specific questions that need to be answered:", "As can be seen below, the leading cause of death in the United States based on 1999\u20132016 is heart disease, accounting for 34% of all deaths among the leading causes. Close behind is cancer, which makes up another 30%.", "One question that did come to mind, however, is whether or not the difference between heart disease and cancer is statistically significant. Said another way: how likely is it that normal variance in annual rates would account for the disparity? A two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test was performed to answer this question, and the resulting p-value of 0.00008 indicates a that the probability of encountering such a result as a matter of chance is less than 1 in 10,000. With this in mind, it is safe to move forward with an analysis of heart disease.", "Trends in this regard were examined at both the state and national level. The minimum and maximum recorded rates across all states and years were used to bound the results and get a sense of relative changes over time. In the time lapse below, green represents the lowest death counts per capita, while red represents the highest. The chart below the map represents the national change in rate over the same time period.", "From this, it can easily be observed that overall rates have been improving, with much of the red and orange turning into green and yellow. This is further supported by the clear downward trend at the national level. This is good news, but it still needs to be determined whether or not this trend will continue into the future.", "To accomplish this, it will be important to research the factors that influence heart disease the most.", "After doing some general research on the topic, it was decided to focus on three general areas:", "To be clear, these areas represent only a subset of possibilities, which may be incorporated into future incarnations of the model.", "The biggest challenge here lays in gathering the of data. While age and gender information was included in the CDC population data, alcohol and smoking data would require a bit more digging. Fortunately, it\u2019s nothing that a little research and web-scraping can\u2019t handle.", "Smoking data is available from the United Health Foundation, with annual data saved in separate CSV files. The smoking rate itself is defined as follows:", "Percentage of adults who are smokers (reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and currently smoke every or some days)", "A quick loop through the relevant years via the site API makes this data easy to access. All that remains is to save each file locally, join the data into a single dataframe, and perform some basic cleanup (remove nationally aggregated rows, check datatypes, and select relevant columns).", "One thing that quickly becomes problematic is the realization that the data source changed in 2014. Further investigation revealed that the methodology for gathering data had actually changed in 2012, with the assertion that the new approach is more accurate. However, this also created an illusion that the nation had a sudden spike in smoking rates during this time. For the purposes of this analysis, the year-over-year changes in smoking rates are more important than the actual rates themselves, so it was decided that the best way to address the discrepancy is to scale data in 2012 and beyond to be more aligned with prior year trends. The results on a national basis can be viewed below.", "With regard to alcohol consumption, data was retrievable from the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Alcohol consumption here is reported as follows:", "Per capita ethanol consumption for States. [Gallons of ethanol, based on population age 14 and older.]", "In addition, ethanol consumption is broken down by type of drink (beer, wine, & spirits). The data is spread across a 16 page table on the organization\u2019s website, so some web scraping with Beautiful Soup was required. The link above points to the first page of data to give a sense of the structure, but a screenshot and sample of the html should also help.", "The top row uses the strong tag to identify the name of the state, which is followed by rows of years with relevant data identified by the datagray and data classes. This particular row will repeat 40 times over for each year, and will then display the next state. However, the entire table is also wrapped and tagged with the strong tag as well, which means that for each new page, there will also be a table name instead of a state name. The following code block was used to parse through all of the html and save the results to a dataframe.", "Now that the hard part is over, the data can be joined with existing smoking, demographic, and CDC data to start the analysis. At this point there are 20 predictor variables: one for each age group, gender, smoking rate, and alcohol consumption rates. Two other predictors were also included as more of a curiosity: diabetes deaths per capita and population density. The significance of these variables proved to be minimal, though the latter did provide at least one relevant insight that will be touched on later.", "All data underwent scaling and log transformations, allowing results to be expressed in balanced percentage terms. The resulting distributions can be found below:", "While certain parameters do exhibit some skewness, it is fairly well-balanced overall, exhibiting no clear causes of concern when feeding data to predictive models later. So, now it is finally possible to feed the data into a regression model and identify the the factors that have the greatest impact on death rates. All possible combinations of 4 predictors were used in multilinear regressions in search of the highest adjusted r-square value. In the end, four variables were found to explain 83.4% of variance in death rates due to heart disease: smoking rate, 75\u201379 age group, wine consumption, and gender. At least one of the results here may surprise you.", "The least surprising items are at the bottom: as greater percentages of the population reach the 75\u201379 age bracket, greater percentages of the population are likely to die from heart disease. From a behavioral standpoint, smoking exhibits the same type of relationship.", "However, less expected was the fact that males seem to be less susceptible heart disease deaths than women. This does not necessarily mean that men get heart disease less, just that they are less likely to die from it. According to the CDC,", "Despite increases in awareness over the past decades, only about half (56%) of women recognize that heart disease is their number 1 killer.", "So, consider this a public service announcement for those of you who were unaware.", "The other thing that was surprising is that alcohol consumption did not seem to have much of an affect on death rates due to heart disease. In fact, the data suggests that increased wine consumption can actually decrease these rates. Now, a word of caution before you run out to buy your favorite bottle of red: increased wine consumption was also observed to be correlated with lower smoking rates. So, it is likely that it\u2019s not necessarily the wine consumption, but the reduced smoking rates among wine drinkers that results in lower death rates to heart disease.", "This is confirmed in the correlation heat map below, where darker blue squares indicate strong, negative correlation, and bright red indicates strong, positive correlation. The squares in the left-most column reaffirm what is already known from the regression model.", "We are almost ready to build some models and make predictions, but there are two problems that needs to be addressed. First, how is high-risk defined? For purposes of this analysis, high risk states will defined as those states where the number of deaths per capita is in the top 33% of all rates across the full range of data. Conversely, low risk states are those where the rates are in the bottom 33%. Additional domain expertise would be required to tune the target variable to reflect industry standards, though it shouldn\u2019t take away from the validity of the models themselves, should they yield promising results.", "The second problem, however, is a bit more challenging: the objective is to make predictions for 2019, but data is only available through 2016. It wouldn\u2019t be very practical to attempt making predictions based on information obtained from the same year. While it can be helpful looking backwards to get a sense of understanding, it\u2019s useless when looking forward. So, what is the solution? Time lags!", "As a matter of practicality, it is assumed that 2016 data comes available in approximately mid-2017, but adjustments can easily be made to account for variance in this regard. If a model can make reliable predictions based on this information, it would give organizations a year and a half to plan for anticipated changes. In addition, the model shouldn\u2019t simply disregard 2015 and 2014 data when making predictions either. So, what needs to be done is to use 3- to 5-year time lags of data, and use those as predictors for death rates in the current year. The result will be 3 times as many predictor variables, going from 22 to 66. To get a sense of scale, the correlation heat map below highlights the nature of the relationship between each variable. At this point, concerns surrounding multi-collinearity are going to be set aside, and this is because a fair amount of autocorrelation is to be expected. However, consistent changes within a 3-year window should be captured as well, and it\u2019s these changes that are of primary concern for model predictions.", "Now, trying to build a model with this many predictor variables is going to be incredibly inefficient, especially on a 13\" laptop. Therefore, a primary component analysis (PCA) was performed to identify the smallest group of features that explain99% of the variance in data. As a result, the 66 dimensions of data were able to be reduced to just 19. The only thing left is to build the models and make predictions with the best one.", "Six different model types were built, trained, and tested, with 20% of the data withheld for testing purposes:", "The remaining 80% was trained using 5-fold cross validation. In addition, a grid search was implemented for each model to find the top performer, resulting in 1,413 different model variations.", "Barring any significant imbalance in class recall or precision scores, the F1-Score was selected as the primary measure of accuracy/performance. In the end, one model clearly outperformed the rest on all fronts: the Support Vector Machine. As can be below, it achieved a 90% accuracy with all cross-sections of test data. However, when making predictions based on test data, which it had never seen before, model was shown to be even more effective, achieving an accuracy rate of almost 92%.", "Another item worth noting is that the model did perform better in terms of precision than recall, and this difference is most prominent in the prediction of high-risk states. Why is this important? When making these types of predictions, it is better to overestimate the risk levels than underestimate them. And the precision and recall scores indicate that this is exactly how the model tends to err.", "With all of this done, it is now possible to use the 2014\u20132016 data to make predictions for 2019, and have a sense of reliability for the predictions. In the map below, red, yellow, and green represent what the actual risk levels would have been in 2016 based on actual death rates. Red represents high-risk and green represents low-risk. The time lapse focuses on the states expected to change risk levels, and show the expected results in 2019.", "The results here are a bit mixed: four states move from the extremes to the center, while two states move from the center to the extremes. Massachusetts and Maryland go from low- to medium-risk levels, while Michigan and Pennsylvania go from high-risk to medium-risk. Illinois and Tennessee move to the extremes in opposite directions, going from medium-risk to low- and high-risk levels respectively. But one state in particular stands out among the rest: Oklahoma.", "Oklahoma was a high-risk state in 2016, so it was quite a surprise to see it predicted to be low risk so quickly. After closer inspection, it became apparent that the reason for this change is that the smoking rate dropped from 25.5% in 2010 to an all-time low of approximately 19% in 2015.", "It is not entirely clear how these results were achieved, though the state\u2019s secretary of Health and Human Services, Terry Cline, has indicated that it can at least be partially attributed to smoking bans on state property, as well as commercial properties for those organizations that have opted to join the Certified Healthy Oklahoma program. It would definitely be worth taking a closer look at what they are doing to see if these results can be replicated elsewhere.", "Zooming back out, it is possible to see the 2019 prediction map for the entire country.", "What is most striking is the regional disparity of predicted risk levels. Of these 9 states, 8 already existed in the high-risk category in 2016, with Tennessee getting added to the list this year. So, what can these states do to reduce the risk levels in their respective communities?", "As demonstrated by Oklahoma, the best thing these states can do is make concentrated efforts to reduce smoking rates. The regional proximity suggests that, if Oklahoma programs can be effective anywhere, it is going to be in these states where there are likely to be fair amounts of cultural overlap.", "In addition, heart disease awareness campaigns that target retirees and women can go a long way. One other observation in the data suggested that women represent greater portions of the population in population-dense regions. So, putting greater emphasis of these campaigns in cities is likely to yield better results.", "Of course, it would also be good to see if these results can be improved further, particularly with the inclusion of race data and dietary habits among populations. The possibilities are nearly endless, but the potential is clear.", "Heart disease is a sickness that has affected most everyone at one point in their lives or another. Maybe you have been afflicted. Maybe a friend or family member is a survivor, still struggling, or has passed away. For me, it was an uncle who passed just two months ago from a heart attack, and he hadn\u2019t even turned 60 yet. According to the CDC:", "If there is only one thing you take away from this, I hope it is to get yourself checked out, and make yourself aware of the factors that may put you at an elevated risk level.", "The Jupyter Notebook and all resources used for this project can be found on Github.", "Your home for data science.
