Along the way we will also visualise turnout by constituency.", "The first step to creating our map is to get some polygons representing the constituency boundaries in the UK. The Ordinance Survey release the boundary-line product twice a year. I found a more convenient copy \u2014 for fetching with the command line \u2014 at mySociety.org", "The archive contains lots of different administrative boundaries and is quite large (hence I added the --progress-bar option).

Turns out these are available separately from the Ordnance Survey Northern Ireland:", "We are going to use a series of Javascript command-line tools that Mike Bostock described in more detail in his tutorial. They can be installed using the following commands if you have not already [You\u2019ll need node and npm installed for this next step to work]:", "Use shp2json to convert the Shapefiles to GeoJSON:", "The Great Britain (GB) boundary file data is already projected onto the British National Grid (EPSG:27700). However the geometry data in the Northern Ireland (NI) boundaries are defined in EPSG:4326 (WSG 84). I tried to find a way to use d3-geo-projection to convert the NI geometry to EPSG:27700 but I have to admit it was beyond me. Instead I fell back to using ogr2ogr to transform the NI shapefile. I\u2019m on MacOS so ogr2ogr can be installed using brew:", "Then I reprojected the Shapefile from EPSG:4326 to EPSG:27700 as follows:", "Then convert this Shapefile to GeoJSON as we with did with the GB boundaries previously:", "We have converted the binary shapefiles to more human readable GeoJSON. But we still have two separate files. It would be much more convenient to have all the boundaries together in one file.", "In part 2 of his tutorial, Mike introduces ndjson-cli, his tool for creating and manipulating ndjson. I figured we could use this tool make our GeoJSON files into newline-delimited json and then simply cat them together. I also need to pull out the constituency identifier and make it common across each file using ndjson-map:", "I tried working from this point forward with ndjson and streaming the geometry into geoprojection but this was not successful. I found it necessary to convert the concatenated boundaries back to a single JSON object using the ndjson-reduce command before continuing with projections:", "Great we have all the boundaries in one JSON file. However, this file is about 120M. Clearly these geometry definitions are more detailed than we need for a web based visualisation. To reduce the file size we can define a bounding box \u2014 in pixels \u2014 for our chart and then simplify the polygons appropriately for this box without noticeable loss of detail.", "Use the geoproject tool with the .fitsize() method of d3.geoIdentity() to map the points to a bounding box of our choosing [I also took the opportunity to flip the polygon definitions vertically as we will eventually render as svg]:", "Now we can reduce the size of our GeoJSON file by switching to TopoJSON and then simplifying, quantising, and compressing the polygon definitions. Please read Part 3 of Mike Bostock\u2019s tutorial for a more detailed explanation of these steps, which I copy below.", "I used geo2topo to convert to TopoJSON and then use the toposimplify and topoquantize tools to reduce file size from 120M to 385K:", "Now let\u2019s have a quick look at our output. To produce an svg at the command line we can use the geo2svg tools.

The tricky part was that some of the constituency names contained commas which needed to be ignored.", "Mike shows how to join data like this with the geometry by first converting to newline-delimited json. Following his example I used csv2json and his ndjson-cli tools to first convert the election results:", "Similarly we prepare our boundary geometry as ndjson:", "Mike\u2019s example is to colour the polygons of the map according to the value of population density in that area. The most similar quantity I have in the election results \u2014 i.e. a continuous quantity \u2014 is turnout. So in order to be able to follow his example I decided to make a Chloropleth using this turnout information before moving on to looking at winners.", "The code below uses ndjson-map to assign each feature (i.e. constituency) in the GeoJson with a property called fill. When we use geo2svg to produce our image it will pick up on this property and use it to colour the polygons appropriately. The value of fill needs to be a string containing the hex code of the colour that we want each polygon to be (e.g. #0087dc).", "It might be worth trying to break this one-liner down a bit to understand what is going on. We use d3 to translate the turnout information (a number between 0 and 1 representing the proportion of the electorate who actually voted in that constituency) into a hex code. The ndjson-map tool lets us step through each constituency and apply some kind of operation. The argument we pass to ndjson-map is three lines of Javascript.", "says that for each feature create a property called fill whose value is the output of a function z . That function z takes the value of turnout \u2014 which we already attached to the feature in our previous join \u2014 and returns a hexcode representing a colour. This z function is defined in the first line of Javascript:", "It uses d3\u2019s colour schemes to transform numbers representing to turnout to an appropriate colour from the Viridis colour scheme.

To do this we rework the last step to use ndjson-map to look for the party with the highest vote share then setting the geometry\u2019s fill property to a colour representing the party.", "The Javascript I pass to ndjson-map feels a little more clunky here as I define an object that holds the lookup for the colour for each party.", "Again, breaking that javascript down a bit, the first line:", "simply defines a lookup from party to colour. The second line:", "Is a destructuring assignment which we use to extract the voteshare numbers from the election results object. Then the final line:", "Finds the key of the party with the largest voteshare and uses this in the lookup object s to write the desired colour into the fill property.", "Taking a look at the result:", "We have our result. You can stop here unless you want to see how the same might be achieved using a Python stack.", "In the first part of this tutorial we\u2019ve made a UK election map using Javascript tools on the command line, following along with Mike Bostock\u2019s Command-Line Cartography tutorial. For data munging I normally gravitate towards a Python environment. So in this second part I go back and look at how the same might be achieved using Pandas and GeoPandas at the Python REPL.", "To stay closer to the \u2018command line\u2019 style I\u2019m going to do this with the Python REPL but of course a Jupyter Notebook/Lab session would be great.", "We are going to use the GeoPandas library as well as Pandas for some general data manipulation:", "First let\u2019s read in the constituency polygon boundaries for Great Britain into a GeoDataFrame:", "If you want to check the geometry more visually we can import matplotlib and then simply call .plot() on the GeoDataFrame:", "I noticed in later plots the Shetlands were missing from the map, I think there\u2019s an error in the CODE field in this data: S1400005 should beS14000051. So let\u2019s quickly change that now.", "Now load in the constituency boundaries for Northern Ireland:", "We want to concatenate the two sets of boundaries together into one DataFrame. To do this, I first need to adjust the column names so that they match:", "Secondly, as we found in the previous tutorial, the GB and NI boundary geometry are provided in different co-ordinate systems. The Great Britain (GB) boundary file data is already projected onto the British National Grid (EPSG:27700). However the geometry data in the Northern Ireland (NI) boundaries are defined in EPSG:4326. Instead of reaching for ogr2ogr we can use GeoPandas to do this conversion:", "And now we should be ready to concatenate the two sets of geometry using pd.concat, which should deliver another GeoDataFrame.", "Now read our election results into a DataFrame:", "I want to filter this DataFrame to only include results from the 2017 election. [I also renamed some columns first to correct trailing whitespace and with an eye on merging with the geometry data later].", "The uk_results DataFrame contains the geometry and election results for each constituency.", "In the Command Line Cartography tutorial we simplified the geometry to make the resulting file smaller. It is possible to use GeoPandas to do this simplification (through Shapely):", "Although it is of course possible to produce an svg using a Python stack, my first goal is to create a GeoJSON output from this merged data. This would allow me to drop back into the javascript world of Command Line Cartography, or ObservableHQ notebooks to produce work on the final presentation.", "For convenience \u2014 I still find data munging in Javascript less intuitive \u2014 I\u2019m going to incorporate fill colours for the geometry into the DataFrame now using Pandas. On one hand I\u2019m slightly uncomfortable that this mixes the presentation and underlying data. On the other hand it doesn\u2019t prevent me, or someone else, ignoring this embedded fill colour and deriving new presentation from the underlying data which will remain embedded in the GeoJSON.", "First I make a small dictionary defining the party colours, taken from here:", "Then we work out who the winner was in each constituency. As before, the winner simply has the highest share of the vote.", "It\u2019s slightly dissatisfactory that the election results data I obtained does not separate out the main nationalist parties in Scotland and Wales and instead groups them into natSW_share. However, because the Scottish National Party does not run candidates in Wales and Plaid Cymru do field candidates in Scotland, we can use the constituency region to determine particular national party in each case and so allocate the appropriate colour.", "This doesn\u2019t resolve the colours for Northern Ireland parties. I\u2019d have to look for a more detailed election result data set that provides that breakdown.", "Now we can write out this DataFrame ad GeoJSON:", "At this point we could switch back to Command-Line Cartography and produce an svg:", "So there we have it. I\u2019ve used Python and Pandas for data manipulation much more frequently than command-line tools such as awk Javascript. So inevitably I found it easier and more intuitive to manipulate the geometry and election results together through this tutorial that in Part 1. Perhaps that\u2019s just my familiarity bias.", "I still prefer Observable notebooks and the data driven document philosophy for presenting results ready for the web. But I\u2019m definitely interested in exploring Altair\u2019s capabilities especially to output Vega descriptions which are simple to embed into webpages. Perhaps in a future post.", "Another day we can debate the merits of showing this data on a geographical map rather than, say, a cartogram that places equal area on the constituencies.", "Thanks to @mbostock for all his tools and writings which are inspirational.", "Your home for data science.
