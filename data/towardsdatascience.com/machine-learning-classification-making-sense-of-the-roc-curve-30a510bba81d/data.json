Without getting into confusing formulas, here\u2019s the simplest possible explanation:", "Notice the parallelism between both! Essentially, the ROC curve is a True Positive vs False Positive curve, with both axes normalized.", "Whenever we see a line graph, we tend to think in terms of a linear progression through time, or some parameter represented on the x-axis. As we increase the parameter on the x-axis, the line graph progresses. The thought process is usually this: \u201cfor a given value on the x-axis, the graph gives me the corresponding value on the y-axis\u201d.", "But the ROC is subtle in that way \u2014 it isn\u2019t a mapping from FPR values (x-axis) to TPR values (y-axis), because you can\u2019t really calculate the TPR as a function of FPR. So what is varying as the ROC curve moves away from the origin? The answer is (drum roll, please): the threshold.", "If we dig deeper into most classification models, we see that they don\u2019t just assign a label to a data point, they assign a score to a data point, and then compare that score against a threshold to decide whether to classify it as positive or negative:", "So, given a threshold, the model will produce a classification for every data point. And for a given set of classifications, you\u2019ll get one value each for TPR and FPR. But, as you vary the threshold, TPR and FPR will both vary between 0 to 1. That is why we say the threshold varies as the ROC curve progresses.", "To visualize this properly, let\u2019s begin by considering the extreme cases; this will give us a better vantage point for understanding how the ROC curve works in the other cases.", "First, consider the case when the threshold is set to a maximum value. Nothing gets scored higher than the threshold, and nothing gets tagged as positive by the model. This is when the ROC curve is at (0,0):", "Now consider the other extreme case \u2014 when the threshold is at its minimum. Everything gets scored higher than the threshold, and everything gets tagged as positive by the model. This is when the ROC curve is at (1,1):", "Running through everything between those two extremes looks like this:", "As the model threshold decreases, the total number of positive predictions will increase. The ROC graph expresses how those positive predictions get divided up between True Positives and False Positives.", "Now that we know what the ROC curve represents, we can start understanding what would make a given ROC curve \u2018good\u2019 or \u2018bad\u2019.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the axes again:", "It\u2019s pretty obvious that we want True Positives and we don\u2019t want False Positives. In terms of the axes, we want to move up the y-axis, but we don\u2019t want to move forward on the x-axis. However, the ROC curve goes all the way from (0,0) to (1,1)\u2026in other words, you\u2019re gonna move all the way across the x-axis, no matter what.", "Therefore, the quality of an ROC curve must have something to do with the shape of the curve. To understand what shape would be considered good, we go back to the threshold picture to try to understand what makes a classification model better. Clearly, a model that scores the data points like this:", "is worse than one that scores its data points like this:", "which is worse than one that scores it data points like this (ideal case):", "If we compare all of these along with their ROC curves, a clear pattern begins to emerge:", "If more white points (actually positive data points) rank higher than black points (actually negative points), the ROC curve rises up the y-axis (TPR) before it moves forward on the x-axis (FPR). And the earlier the TPR rises, the larger the area under the curve is:", "And that\u2019s why you will often see the metric ROC-AUC (ROC-Area Under Curve) or AUROC (Area Under ROC) being used as a measure of the performance of the classification algorithm.", "Essentially, a better ROC curve is one with a larger area under the curve, because that implies that more positive examples are ranked higher than negative examples by the classification model, i.e., the model has a better separation of positive and negative data points (in the right direction).", "Hopefully, these animations and these explanations have given you a more intuitive understanding of what the ROC curve is and why we choose the Area Under the ROC curve as a metric for a classification algorithm\u2019s performance.", "Your home for data science.
