To tackle these several datasets are being released on a regular basis. COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) released on Kaggle is one of the most important datasets consisting of around 47K scholarly articles on these kinds of coronaviruses. A lot of AI researchers all around the world are continuously working on it to extract useful insights from these vast resources and provide the medical community the required information in a brief manner. Let\u2019s look at the problem statement:-", "Before diving in further, let\u2019s discuss the tasks being put up in the CORD-19 challenge for the researchers. There are in total of 10 tasks as a part of this challenge, a glimpse of which is being displayed below:", "What about the dataset? Well, we are provided with a CSV file containing metadata information such as title, abstract, body text of papers, etc of around 29k research papers. Apart from that, we are also given several JSON files containing details of around 13k research papers.", "Currently, there are more than 600 publicly available kernels at Kaggle that various researchers have published. This post aims at discussing some of the best techniques to tackle such an unsupervised ML problem.", "Note: The term \u2018query\u2019 and \u2018question\u2019 are used interchangeably. Also, the term \u2018research paper\u2019 and \u2018research article\u2019 are used interchangeably and refers to the same thing.", "Clustering is the obvious approach that comes into our mind when we enter into the field of unsupervised task. Clustering can be used to create a tool to identify similar articles, given a query article. This notebook uses K-Means to cluster similar research articles. Apart from that, the author has also experimented with various dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA & t-SNE to plot interactive plots to gain a better understanding of different clusters.", "2. Data Pre-processing: Usual text pre-processing such as lowercase conversion and removal of punctuation is carried out and the text body of the article is used to create feature vectors.", "3. Feature Generation: The n-grams (n=2) from the words is generated and the HashingVectorizer is used to create the features vector X.", "4. Dimensionality Reduction with t-SNE: This high dimensional feature vector is reduced to two features to observe whether there lies some pattern in the data and t-SNE is able to keep similar instances together. Although few clusters are observed in the following figure, there are no labels to distinguish between these clusters.", "5. Clustering with K-Means: The initial value of clusters i.e. K is chosen as 10 and K-Means is applied to the original data (feature vector of size 4096). Now, the cluster labels for each data point can be obtained using the predict function of K-Means object. The plot with the cluster labels is shown below. From the plot, it can be seen that articles from the same cluster are near each other. But still, there are overlaps that can be overcome by hyperparameter tuning for K, better feature representation, etc.", "6. Further Improvements: Firstly, tf-idf is being used to come out with better feature representation instead of using HashingVectorizer and then K-Means is being applied to it. Then t-SNE is used to reduce dimensionality to 2 for plotting.", "The clusters are visible more clearly this time, which means tf-idf feature representation proved somewhat better. The author further experimented with PCA plots and increasing K values to 20. Also, an interactive t-SNE plot was shown which was one of the major contributions of this notebook.", "Summary: This notebook experimented with clustering & dimensionality reduction techniques. Given a query, K-Means predict function can be used to assign it a cluster label containing similar articles. The major challenge will be to determine the correct value of K and come out with good feature representations. If some of the advanced techniques such as BERT finetuned on medical domain can be used for feature representation, I guess the results can be improvised. Apart from that, other clustering algorithms such as DBSCAN can be experimented, which does not require us to initialize the number of clusters.", "This notebook discovers a number of topics using LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation). This allows viewing each article as a mixture of these topics. By mapping a specific article into the topic space (a simplex with a topic in each corner), we can then find related articles.", "Topic = Distribution over Words, Article= Mixture of Topics", "2. Data Pre-processing: scispaCy, which is a Python package containing spaCy models for processing biomedical, scientific or clinical text is used for pre-processing.", "3. Feature Generation: CountVectorizer is used to represent each article as a Bag of Words representation.", "4. Latent Dirichlet Allocation: LDA is being used to generate various topics on the vectorized data representation, where the number of topics is initialized as 50. Top 25 words of few topics are displayed below-", "Each article is now represented as a distribution over topics.", "5. Get Nearest Papers (in Topic Space): To get articles similar to a query article, index of the k nearest articles (as by Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence in topic space) is returned. As a similarity measure, 1-Jensen-Shannon distance is used.", "6. Browse Tasks: Now, a task can be mapped into the topic space and related articles can be found out.", "Summary: In this notebook, the authors have used a Topic modeling approach to represent each article into topic space. One of the major challenges is to determine the number of topics. One more thing that can be tried is to add title or abstract information along with the text body. Apart from that, other semantic similarity techniques can be used to recommend similar articles.", "This notebook explores a variety of approaches such as Topic Modeling, Sentence Embeddings(USE), DBSCAN algorithm, Keyword Extraction methods and creating a Knowledge Graph for the respective tasks.", "2. Visualize Topics: The pyLDAvis library is used to visualize the distribution of each word in a given topic.", "3. Finding Similar Papers: Two different approaches to find similar papers have been used here.", "i) Universal Sentence Encoder (USE): Here, each article is represented by a sentence embeddings on passing the title of the article through USE. Then, given a query, it calculates its cosine similarity between every article and returns the k most similar articles.", "ii) DBSCAN: Each article is represented by a sentence embeddings on passing the title of the article through the spacy doc2vec method. DBSCAN is than ran on these article\u2019s vectors to generate various clusters. Then, given a query, it calculates the cluster label and returns the articles present in that cluster.", "4. Keyword Extraction based method: The below-described approach is being used to find related keywords for a given query-", "Keyword extraction is the automated process of extracting the most relevant words and expressions from the text. Keyword extraction (also known as keyword detection or keyword analysis) is a text analysis technique that consists of automatically extracting the most important words and expressions in a text. It helps summarize the content of a text and recognize the main topics which are being discussed.", "Two different keyword extraction methods are being used here: i) using Rake ii) using PytextRank library", "5. Knowledge Graph: A Knowledge Graph is then constructed from the list of abstracts found from a given query. A dataframe that contains subject, relation, and object from these abstracts to plot the knowledge graph is created.", "Question: What is known about transmission, incubation, and environmental stability?", "2. Prepare the abstract and title", "3. Find the subject, object, and relations and plot the KG.", "Summary: This notebook has presented a nice visualization of topic models as well as Knowledge Graph. The author has also used state of the art sentence embeddings techniques like USE and calculated the similarity. Further work into this area includes how to traverse this KG and obtain useful information from it.", "This notebook develops a universal question-answering system to answer (almost) any kind of question-related to coronavirus. The author has also used HTML and CSS to display the result in a better manner.", "Question-Answering (QA) model: In machine learning, a question-answering model is composed of three sources: the question, the context and the answer. The model inputs are the question and the context and the model output is the answer. In most cases, but not all, the answer is contained in the context.", "Using a search engine to produce the context: Since there are more than 40k papers, the size of the context needs to be reduced by selecting all the papers that are most similar to the answer. In the code, a very simple algorithm, Okapi BM25, is used for this purpose.", "Overall idea: Query -> Search Engine -> list of context -> for each context and same query -> QA Model -> span (part of context representing answer)", "2. COVID Search Engine: A BM25Okapi search engine is created on the data combining the abstract and titles of entire research articles. Given a query, it calculates the bm25 scores w.r.t each article and then returns the articles having top k score. These articles will serve as contexts for QA model.", "3. Question-Answering Model: Huggingface transformer library is being used to implement the QA model. A BERT model for Question Answering which is pre-trained on the SQUAD dataset is being used here. The overall approach can be understood from below code snippet.", "4. CORD-19 Kaggle questions: First of all, all the CORD-19 tasks and the respective questions are stored in a dictionary object. Then, iterating over this dictionary, all the questions of a task are passed one by one and the answer is appended for that particular task.", "5.Display questions, context, and answers: The final result is displayed in a well-formatted manner using HTML & CSS.", "Summary: This notebook used the Question Answering model to tackle the respective tasks. It also made use of BM25 search engine to reduce the context size. Another approach over here could be the use of some state of art similarity-based methods to find similar contexts instead of relying on the BM25 search engine. Another thing that could be done is to pre-train the QA model on the medical domain dataset instead of an open domain dataset and then use it for question answering task.", "The previous QA model borrows the idea from this notebook and therefore the approaches are quite similar. This notebook also uses the concepts of Open Domain Question and Answering and Semantic Search Engines to quickly reduce scientific information to just a few records that would be of most interest. However, this notebook presents a method to produce a single \u201cbest\u201d answer, unlike the previous approach where multiple answers depending on the contexts were obtained. Apart from that, here the author has also generated a summarization based on the top results using pre-trained \u201cBART\u201d model for \u201cAbstractive Summarization\u201d.", "Anserini is a search engine that is built on top of Apache Lucene which can go and search the literature and return ranked records. Instead of driving Anserini on Wikipedia, the author used a CORD-19 Lucene database which is already been publicly available.", "Overall idea: Query -> Search Engine -> ranked segments -> for each segment and same query -> QA Model -> set of spans -> spans ranking by Google's USE model similarity matrix -> top score span -> BART Summarization -> abstractive summary", "Note: Along with a given query, a set of keywords needs to be passed to help drive the Anserini search engine towards the most interesting results. This is beneficial because the Anserini portion of the search is not really contextual and cant decipher meaning so the keywords will help drive the search.", "Define All The Questions for the Competition", "Summary: This notebook also used the search engine and QA model to tackle the respective tasks. The author has also designed a model to summarize the results which present the answer in a brief manner. Again, another approach over here could be the use of some state of art similarity-based methods to find similar contexts instead of relying on the search engine. And also, another thing that could be done is to pre-train the QA model on the medical domain dataset, if available and then use it for question answering task", "This project builds an index over the CORD-19 dataset to assist with analysis and data discovery. For each task question, a highlights section is built with a summary of the results along with each matching article and each article\u2019s text matches.", "2. Tagging: The only tag at this time is COVID-19 and articles are tagged with this if the article text contains any of the proposed regular expressions. Only such articles are been considered in this project.", "3. Build Embedding Index: An embeddings index is created with FastText + BM25. The embeddings index takes each COVID-19 tagged, non-labeled (not a question/fragment) section, tokenizes the text, and builds a sentence embedding. A sentence embedding is a BM25 weighted combination of the FastText vectors for each token in the sentence. The embeddings index takes the full corpus of these embeddings and builds a Faiss index to enable similarity searching.", "The author has plotted several plots such as bar plots representing articles by source, articles by publication, articles by study design, etc to analyze the data in a more lucid better. One such plot representing articles by country mentioned is being shown below:", "4. Testing the model: Initially, the model builds embeddings for each sentence in the corpus. For input queries, it compares each sentence against the input query. Faiss enables that similarity search to be fast.", "5. Building task reports: Task reports are an aggregation of each question within a task in the challenge. For each question, a query is run and the top articles are returned. For each article, text matches are shown as bulleted points and these are the best matching sentences within the article. The full list of result sentences is also analyzed and run through a textrank algorithm. Highlights or top sentences within the results are also shown within the report.", "Summary: This notebook has tried to solve the given tasks using a similarity search on the combination of FastText + BM25 embeddings. Also, the sentences in the articles having a maximum similarity score are shown in the highlights section which acts as a summary of the given query. Although the approach seems simpler, the combination of various algorithms have produced quite significant results.", "This model uses the combination of Knowledge graphs with MeSH ontology and BERT embeddings. The graph enabled search helps the user search based on very specific medical terminology. It can also be extended to give inference on how different documents are related to each other (based on author, body, title, etc.)", "1 a. Entity extraction from JSON documents: Entities are extracted from the title, author details, abstract, body, and bibliographical references, for every JSON document. These entities are then used to make triples for knowledge graph creation. 5 kinds of relationships are included in the triples. The entities are mapped to their respective paper ids with these relations:", "1 b. Enhanced Entity Extraction using MeSH Ontology: For every entity in the triple, it\u2019s top 5 corresponding similar entities are extracted from the MeSH ontology. These entities are then also included in the triples, with their corresponding relationships. This is done to increase the reach and power of the knowledge graph, such that it covers not only the terms present in the documents but also related entities that are not present but can be helpful.", "2. BERT Training and Document Extraction:", "3 and 4. Result Extraction using BERT and Knowledge Graph:", "5. Paragraph Extraction for related entities in extracted documents", "Results on Task Query: Using a combination of both BERT and Knowledge Graph covers the aspects of semantic search as well as some keyword-specific search.", "Summary: The greatest contribution of this notebook is that the authors have presented a very comprehensive solution using a variety of ML techniques. The authors have used the SOTA BERT embeddings and combined it with Knowledge Graph, which further enhances its proficiency. This notebook was also the most structured and all the methods were presented in a very systematic order.", "Conclusion: This blog presents some of the great works done by the AI researchers on the CORD-19 dataset. I have tried to gather all the different approaches through which this unsupervised learning task could be tackled and have myself gain a better understanding of this area. Data scientists throughout the world are trying to contribute in whatever way they can and we hope that these works become fruitful for the medical team and we may be free from this pandemic very soon.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
