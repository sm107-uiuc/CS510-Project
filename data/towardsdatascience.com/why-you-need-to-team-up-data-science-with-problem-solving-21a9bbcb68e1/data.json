I wholeheartedly agree with that. It is very important to understand the business context in order to faithfully translate a business problem into a data problem, addressing which, eventually yields an useful result.", "The mechanism by which data scientists are encouraged to acquaint themselves with the business context is by posing questions to the business problem owners. However, as you may recognize, that even the questions that one poses are constrained by what we know or are trying to find out. A data scientist tasked to solve a certain problem, will ask questions on when, how and why the problem occurs and on what data is available to solve it. This is particularly true of data scientists who have limited domain knowledge: they are likely to dive straightaway into details of the problem. Do you recognize this?", "If this is what you see happening in your organization, it may be missing out on some simpler solutions to address business problems. To discover the potential simpler solutions, you need to engage the business owner on the problem, a bit like a management consultant does, and stress test some of the assumptions that even the business owner is making while defining the problem. This collaborative problem-solving process may throw up some novel avenues of addressing the problem, that not even the business owner has thought of.", "Allow me to explain with an example from the process industry. Erecting a process plant needs large capital investment. To utilize this asset productively, it is very common for a process plant to make multiple products or multiple grades of the same products, for example, multiple grades of steel, grades of polymer, different formulations, etc. Changing over production from one grade to another is not without risks and can lead to efficiency and quality issues. A plant manager, responsible for such a plant, may frame this as a process issue and request the data scientist to identify the variables and process conditions that drive the quality issue. A data scientist tasked with this problem, may go ahead and start working on creating a data-driven process model. But this approach will miss out on exploring at least two other avenues of addressing the problem.", "Philosophically speaking, if one wants to address any problem, there are always three avenues to do so \u2014 1. avoiding the problem, 2. reducing the problem, and 3. directly solving or eliminating the problem. The plant manager decided to go down the third route perhaps even unaware that there might be other avenues available. He or she has perhaps never heard of the quote \u201cThe supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting\u201d from the legendary Chinese general and military strategist Sun Tzu. Read enemy in the quote as problem in the present context. How might the alternate avenues work out in our process industry example?", "One might be able to avoid the problem in the first place, if it is possible to figure out, whether, changeover between specific grades is the root cause. For example, out of five grades A, B, C, D, E that are made in the plant, perhaps only the changeover from A to D and B to D is problematic, whereas, all other changeovers are smooth. In this case, one might be able to eliminate the problem by avoiding the problematic changeover sequences. If this is a realistic solution, a data scientist should be addressing a production scheduling problem rather than a process modeling problem.", "A way to reduce the changeover problem could be to decrease the required number of changeovers. Product changeovers are needed because there is limited inventory of products, and customer orders demand more material of a certain type than is available at hand. But what if the inventory management is sub-optimal, and simply by changing the inventory mix, it is possible to meet customer demand without making too many changeovers? If this is a realistic solution, the data scientist should be addressing an inventory optimization problem rather than a process modeling problem.", "As you can see, the problem definition itself changes completely when you open the solution space a bit and go beyond the business owners\u2019 problem definition. A problem that started out as a process issue could end up being solved through better production scheduling or inventory optimization. I think it is possible to arrive at such out-of-the-box and potentially easier solutions only through collaborative problem solving. Granted that such solutions may not always be available, but it would be a lost opportunity if one completely ignores them all the time.", "If you want to improve the effectiveness of your data science efforts, by solving business problems that matter, you may want to team up your data science efforts with problem solving.", "Your home for data science.
