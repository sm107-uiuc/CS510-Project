These, along with thousands of additional packages available on Anaconda cloud from channeling including conda-forge and bioconda, can be installed using conda. Despite this large collection of packages, it is still small compared to the 150,000 packages available on PyPI\u201d. On the other hand, not all packages in PyPI are available as wheels, which is especially problematic for data science libraries which usually require C/C++/Fortran code. Whilst it is possible to install PyPI packages using pip in conda environments, this requires all the sub-dependencies to be pip packages themselves too and can cause headaches so is not recommended. There is usually a delay between packages being available in Anaconda main channel compared to PyPI. For example the delay for pandas seems to be a few weeks.", "I wanted to check if pipenv+PyPI and conda+Anaconda could provision a data scientist\u2019s basic tool set: pandas, scikit-learn, sqlalchemy, jupyter, matplotlib and networkx. I used python3.8 because 3.9 came out just recently.", "Both environments were successfully created in about 3 minutes. Note that I am using Ubuntu WSL1, different platforms might not be as successful in creating the environments.", "To test this criteria I used pandas which has a dependency on numpy.

Pipenv determines that there are conflicts, is unable to create a Pipfile.lock and prints the following useful message:", "Pipenv also has the graph and graph-reverse commands which prints the dependency graph and allows users to trace how package depend on each other and helps resolve conflicts.", "Note that the pip dependency resolver is going through changes.
