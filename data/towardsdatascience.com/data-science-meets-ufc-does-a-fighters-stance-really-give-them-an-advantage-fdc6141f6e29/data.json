It pitched a devastatingly talented left-handed southpaw\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Conor McGregor vs Jose Aldo was one of the fastest knockouts in UFC history, resulting in a win for the Irishman after just 13 seconds. It pitched a devastatingly talented left-handed southpaw (McGregor) against the Brazilian undefeated orthodox that was considered by some to be the greatest MMA featherweight of all time. Seconds after referee Big John McCarthy announced to the men that it was time to fight, Aldo lunges forward and swings for a left hook. Conor takes a step back and counters with a perfectly placed left hook of his own. With Aldo laying on the floor, Conor continues to rain down on him with hammer fists, at which point the referee declares an end to the fight.", "So how much of Conor\u2019s win can be attributed to his unorthodox stance? This article takes a quantitive approach at answering the following question:", "\u201cDoes having an unorthodox stance give a fighter an advantage in the ring (or octagon)?\u201d", "In case any readers aren\u2019t familiar with the various stances in combat sports I\u2019ll save you a google and give a brief description now:", "It is often said that unorthodox fighters have an advantage; this is commonly thought to be because there are fewer of them, meaning that a fighter is less able to anticipate their unorthodox opponent\u2019s actions when they eventually face one. The same advantage is believed to exist in other sports such as tennis, cricket and baseball. To give some numerical context, Dr Florian Loffing of the University of Oldenburg in Germany conducted a study between 2009 and 2014 in which he collected the names and handedness of the top 100 players for badminton, squash, tennis, table tennis, cricket and baseball. His findings were that in male baseball, 30% were left handed and in female tennis this figure was 19%\u00b9. These numbers are far higher than in the general population, approximately 10.3% and 7.7% for males and females respectively\u00b9.", "Does this advantage actually exist in the domain of MMA or is it just a common misconception? If it does exist, is it simply due to fighters being less prepared for unorthodox opponents or is there more to this than meets the eye?", "In the following sections I\u2019ll walk you through my approach at getting to the bottom of these questions, from data collection, cleaning, and feature engineering, to analysis and lastly my interpretation of the results.", "If you would like to follow along with the code then please visit the GitHub repository at the following link:", "Before conducting any comparisons between orthodox and non-orthodox fighters I needed to get my hands on some data. Conveniently, the UFC maintains a website with the details of every fighter in the organisation\u00b2. This is presented in the form of a table as shown below.", "Crucially, contained in this table was information on the fighter\u2019s stance along with their wins, losses and draws. From this it would be possible to gauge the success of each fighter and determine if there is a significant difference between the stances.", "I used the BeautifulSoup and requests libraries to scrape as this provides a simple framework for parsing HTML. As can be seen from the image above, there was a web page for each letter of the alphabet and all of these needed to be scraped if I was to have information on every fighter. The urls for the \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019 pages were as follows:", "so on and so forth for each letter of the alphabet.", "Below is the code snippet showing how the web scrape was completed inside a for loop that iterated over the alphabet, each time updating the url to cycle through each page.", "To see how the data was then organised into a pandas DataFrame, please take a look at the GitHub repository linked before this section. For the sake of brevity this process will not be outlined here. The image below shows the first 5 rows of the DataFrame created.", "The scraping was a success. I now had information on every fighter in the UFC organisation, and even better, it was data provided from the organisation itself, therefore it was bound to be of high quality and ready for analysis.", "As can be seen from the DataFrame above, much of the information was missing. For some fighters, details such as height, reach and stance were absent, despite these being the most basic stats. As the focus of this analysis was on stance, all fighters without an entry in the stance column were omitted. Unfortunately this reduced the number of fighters contained in the dataset from 3405 to 2571. Ouch!", "Then came some feature engineering, which means transforming raw features (wins, losses, draws) into new features that are more useful for the analysis. I needed to create a standardised metric for gauging each fighter\u2019s success rate. Two methods came to mind:", "The issue with the win:loss ratio was that if a fighter was undefeated, the ratio would be infinite as there would be a division by 0. The win:total fight ratio was therefore my metric of choice. However, new fighters posed a problem for this method as well. If a new addition to the UFC family had a 100% win rate after their first fight it would skew the results and reduce the quality of any insights from this analysis. I only wanted fighters that had sufficiently proven themselves to be in the analysis, so I removed all individuals with fewer than 5 fights. This reduced the number of rows in the DataFrame from 2571 to 2421.", "The breakdown of the remaining dataset was as such:", "Data cleaning up to this point had indirectly removed all but one sideways stance fighter and almost all open stance individuals too. Due to the tiny sample size of both of these categories I removed these stances from the analysis.", "The data had been wrestled and wrangled and now it was ready for visualisation. Upon first glance it appeared that orthodox and southpaw fighters have a very similar spread of win ratios. This was surprising as being a southpaw is normally seen as an advantage. It also looked as if switch fighters have more success than both orthodox and southpaw fighters. This came as less of a surprise.", "As a data scientist I couldn\u2019t accept my interpretation of the boxplot as fact, it could just be down to chance that switch fighters have won more often. To determine if a statistically significant difference existed, a one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) test was needed. There are two assumptions that must be met for a one-way ANOVA to be a valid method of analysis for this dataset:", "To check the distribution of residuals I used the statsmodels library to create a Q-Q plot. This plots the theoretical quantiles (normally distributed) against the sample quantiles. The graph is fairly linear, meaning that the distribution is close to normal. The one-way ANOVA test is robust enough to handle a slight violation of the normality condition, therefore I considered the first assumption to be satisfied.", "To test for homoscedasticity I used a Levene test from the scipy library. This returned a P-value greater than the 0.05 threshold I had set, meaning the groups were homoscedastic and the second condition of ANOVA was satisfied.", "The two hypotheses for the ANOVA test were as follows:", "I used the statsmodels library again to conduct the ANOVA. It returned a P-value that was below a predetermined threshold of 0.05, even when considering a Bonferroni correction to reduce the chance of false positives. This meant that I should reject the null hypothesis and that there is indeed a significant difference between the win ratios of the stances. However, the ANOVA test does not tell us between which groups the differences lie.", "To find out exactly which stances perform differently from each other I conducted a Tukey\u2019s HSD test, again from the statsmodels library. The table below shows that the null hypothesis should be rejected for the Orthodox-Switch comparison, and the Southpaw-Switch comparison. For the Orthodox-Southpaw comparison the null hypothesis should be accepted; that is to say that there is no significant difference between the win ratios of orthodox and southpaw fighters.", "Next, the effect size of the significant pair-wise comparisons were calculated using Cohen\u2019s d formula. This yielded the following results:", "An effect size of less than 0.2 is considered small and a value over 0.8 is considered large. The larger the effect size, the stronger relationship is between variables; meaning an effect size of approximately 0.5 suggests that there is a fairly strong relationship between a fighter\u2019s stance and win:total fights ratio when considering switch vs orthodox and southpaw.", "The mean win ratio for each stance were as follows:", "Dr Loffing\u2019s study of left handed athletes found that the representation of left handed people was greater for sports with higher time pressures. He found that baseball, cricket and table tennis were the fastest paced sports and these also had the highest number of left handed athletes. Dr Scott Hardie of the University of Abertay proposed that this \u201cmay be due to the way that left-handers [are] able to deal with fast-paced information\u00b3,\u201d resulting in faster reaction times.", "One Austrian study published by the journal of Neuropsychology in 2006 found that lefties had significantly faster inter-hemispheric transfer times\u2074 (communication between the left and right hemispheres of the brain). So scientific findings say it\u2019s possible that left handed athletes have some cognitive advantage, but it has yet to be proven that this is the main cause for the overrepresentation of lefties in professional sports.", "From the fighters in the dataset that had information on their stance I found that 22% were southpaws. This is over double the representation of left handers in the general population! Is this because of their faster reaction times? Possibly, but if so then we would also expect to see them have a higher win ratio than orthodox fighters, which we don\u2019t. As mentioned at the beginning of the article, another possible reason for this is that at lower levels of competition, fighters are less exposed to unorthodox opponents, thus giving the unorthodox individuals an edge, resulting in a higher representation at an elite level. However, once at this elite level, their success is not higher than other stances because fighters prepare relentlessly in training camp against sparring partners of a similar style to their fight night opponent. This may eliminate any surprise advantage of a southpaw.", "So why do switch fighters have a higher win ratio than the other stances? The reasons are probably as one would expect:", "As you have probably already noticed, the sample size of switch fighters was very small for this analysis. For any statistical analysis, a larger sample size is always preferred as it reduces the role that chance plays in any of your findings. If anyone is interested in conducting a similar analysis of their own I would suggest expanding your data sources to include other MMA organisations such as Bellator and One Championship. In fact the scope of the analysis could be broadened to incorporate other combat sports such as boxing and Muay Thai, as the same principles of fighter stance apply.", "Looking forward, it is a personal goal of mine to create a UFC fight predictor. This would allow a user to input any two fighters from the organisation, and using machine learning algorithms it would output the percentage chance of each fighter winning. If this is of interest to you then stay tuned in the coming months.
