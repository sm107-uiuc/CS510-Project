The more we experiment, the more are the learnings and better are the chances of identifying the true needs of a customer.", "A/B testing (also sometimes referred to as split testing) is the practice of showing two variants of the same web page to different segments of visitors at the same time and comparing which variant drives more conversions.", "Companies have historically been using frequentist/classical methods for testing out different hypotheses (for example finding a winner version of a website from two variants). Based on this approach decisions are being made towards building a successful customer-company relationship.", "So how most people/companies do it?", "The entire process of designing the experiment consists of multiple steps like deciding your test and control groups (i.e. which user will see which variant of your page), the number of days you want to run the experiment, and finally measuring the result. The planning and measuring phases typically require statistical calculations like a priori power analysis, effect size, and sample size calculations. Finally, to evaluate or measure the results, we generally perform tests like t-test, Chi-square test, and z-test for proportions to get a p-value. This is referred to as the frequentist/classical framework.", "I mentioned quite a few statistical keywords above. Don\u2019t worry if you are not aware of these terms. I have explained these here in detail.", "Now let\u2019s see why we should be talking about this fancy Bayesian stuff!", "The success of the experiment/hypothesis conducted also lies in how the decision takers interpret these results. The common challenge that the experimenter deals with is the business translation of statistical results like \u201cSince the p-value is less than 0.05, we can reject the null hypothesis. We believe the evidence we saw was unlikely to appear 95% of the times if the null hypothesis were true.\u201d", "What they actually want to actually hear is \u201cprobability of variant B being better than A is x%.\u201d", "Lucky for us that there exists a way where we can lower the cost of experimentation by making decisions approximately 50% faster than usual, and where an analyst can dare to actually say the following words out loud:", "\u201cBased on the data, the probability of conversion from \u2018B\u2019 being higher than A is 80% (for example)\u201d.", "Not only this, we can continually measure our results in the Bayesian framework, offering more transparency, as opposed to a fixed sample size design.", "This extraordinary way is offered to us by the Bayesian framework. We can use Bayesian estimation and sequential Bayes factor methods to design our experiment and measure our desired outcomes.", "Below are the clear cut advantages that the Bayesian approach holds over Frequentist methods:", "I. The sample size required to reach a decision is ~ 50% that of the frequentist approach (Graph 1) ( White paper )", "II. Interpretability: Simple and intuitive interpretation of the results", "Example of observed results would be like-", "Frequentist\u00a0: \u201cAs we observe a significant p value of 0.02, we can reject the null hypothesis.\u201d", "Bayesian: \u201cThere is 95% probability that version \u2018A\u2019 is better than version \u2018B\u2019 and expected lift in conversion rate is 1.2 percentage points.\u201d", "III. We can comment about the actual probabilities of the conversion rates for both the variants", "IV. Bayesian Framework enables a continuous measurement as compared to frequentist methods where peeking often leads to the p-value hacking, which is a questionable practice", "Perhaps the fundamental difference can be better understood with the help of an example (this section assumes some prior knowledge about hypothesis testing).", "Let\u2019s say we have two groups, one treatment, and another control. In the frequentist approach, we start by stating our null hypothesis.", "Null hypothesis: The two groups behave similarly after some treatment(let\u2019s say metric considered here is mean); i.e the mean of treatment group equals the mean of the control group.", "This hypothesis fixes the belief (parameter) that \u03bc1 \u2014 \u03bc2 =0. Fixing this null hypothesis, we go on to see how well the data justifies this belief in the form of the p-value.", "In the Bayesian approach, we say that there is a certain uncertainty attached to our belief and we try to find the probability distribution of our belief/parameter. So, in the Bayesian world, we try to estimate the probability distribution of this belief (parameter; i.e. \u03bc1\u200a\u2014\u200a\u03bc2) after incorporating information from our prior beliefs (what we think the parameter could be, and it is alright if we don\u2019t have an opinion on the prior belief!) and observed data. Simply put, we don\u2019t look at a single point estimate, we look at the probability distribution of the hypothesis, given the data. This is called the posterior probability.", "The fundamental difference between a p-value and a posterior probability is that a p-value is a statement about the probability of data being observed (assuming our null hypothesis is true), while a posterior probability is a statement about the degree of belief (a probability distribution) of a particular parameter.", "I have read numerous blogs and white papers to understand bayesian methods. When I started, my view of the Bayesian inference was something of a \u201cmagic fix\u201d.
