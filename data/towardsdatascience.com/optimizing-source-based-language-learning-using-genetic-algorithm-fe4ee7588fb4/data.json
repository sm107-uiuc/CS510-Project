Very simple \u2014 it is my way of describing the process of learning a language to literally understand a source (i.e. book, speech, etc.). In the specific case of what I will be sharing, it translates to learning Classical Arabic to be able to read/comprehend the Quran (in its native language, without translation).", "So why all this drama of using a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to learn a language? To understand this, it will require a better sense of the problem statement.", "This project is my attempt at following up on a proposal I have been thinking of recently which can be read in full detail here: Learning Classical Arabic, DIY-Style. The gist of it is that for amateurs like myself, who simply want to learn Classical Arabic to literally understand the Quran (without any scholarly ambitions), existing approaches are just\u2026 too much with too little (immediate) reward \u2014 details for why this is, see the linked blog post. Near the end of the post, what I propose as an alternative is a DIY-style approach that isn\u2019t as structured around grammar rules and rigid processes. Quickly theorizing \u2014 by considering other successful and often-employed DIY applications like learning how to play an instrument \u2014, there are a couple of characteristics that I would desire from such an alternative approach:", "A DIY approach is not a \u2018curriculum\u2019 \u2014 this is exactly what we are trying to escape. It should not tie you down to anything. It should not necessitate a specific structure but allow for one to organically come about from the student. The \u2018lesson plans / tutorials\u2019 should come in bits and stages \u2014 easily consumable in a sitting yet lasting in reflection-able material for a week. Each session should engage the student and prize her with a grain of what she desires most in this adventure: a cashable result. Cashable results being some form of capital, something that is a part to the Big Deal (understanding the entire Quran) but complete in itself as well. For example, some verses should be completely (not partially!) readable even if they are easy verses \u2014 if I hear them in prayer or recite them, a light should come on. If I am around friends and the sentence is said, I should be able to grasp at some social attention by claiming, \u201cah, that means.. [insert english translation here]\u201d.", "Furthermore, these lesson plans should be optimized \u2014 no one likes to follow tutorials that are randomly put together. Students must feel there is meaning \u2014 strong, overpowering causes \u2014 behind proposals. Usually in DIY approaches, this is accomplished by an expert providing the guidance \u2014 the students remain under the impression that if an expert chooses one route, they have actively not-chosen other routes.", "With these principles in place, the rest of the process should be untouched. The student should be left alone, the teacher should not care to see any change. On the surface, it would be an indifferent, uneventful process. But deeper in, I imagine a heavy current of joy and passion interplaying with whim and hunger.", "(Once again, be advised this entire approach would be for amateurs who do not wish to be anything but \u2014 for modest students, without long term ambitions holding them back.)", "Keeping these in mind, let\u2019s try and come up with some methodology to address our problem (and then the need for GA will make sense).", "Terminology to keep in mind:- Corpus = Quran (or a subset of the Quran)*- Root Word** = Lemma of a word (i.e. the \u2018basic\u2019 form of the word),", "* For all the following Statistics and Experiments, I\u2019ve used a subset of the Quran where root words that appear less that 5 times and verses with those root words have been filtered. This is because it significantly reduces computation time and it is highly, highly unlikely those will be selected by the genetic algorithm in our case. I will include a ~~ next to any number effected by this corpus reduction to indicate its approximation.", "**Note that this is different than the trilateral root of Arabic words", "A naive, base methodology that would tackle the criteria of our problem statement would be a simplistically greedy approach: Order the words in the corpus by their frequency of occurrence (highest to lowest) and start learning the top words, hoping to cover as much of the corpus as possible with the least amount of effort. This will keep us tied to the corpus and seems to promise efficient rewards.", "Though the intention here befits the DIY-spirit, the specific methodology lacks ingenuity \u2014 it overlooks a key element of DIY-style learning: greedy-for-reward, not greedy-for-coverage. What is a \u2018reward\u2019 in our case? Is it the understanding of a word of Classical Arabic? False, it is to understand the corpus. What is the \u201cunit of understanding\u201d of the corpus then? Contrary to intuition, it is not the meaning of a word but rather a verse [\u2014 a phrase really, but we will approximate to a verse].", "Compare this to music: learning notes/chords is the work I have to do to get the reward which is to be able to play a sequence\u2026 to play a note itself is practically meaningless. In the best case scenario, learning a set of notes allows me to play the entire song or some complete bars at least.", "Ask yourself a simple question: say you have learned 9/10ths of a sentence in a single sitting so far \u2014 if you had the energy to learn only 1 more word and you had the choice between the following:", "which would you pick? Most would choose option #2 \u2014 because a sentence is closer to what I call a \u2018cashable result\u2019.", "Let\u2019s look at some stats of this naive approach:", "So, though we will have covered ~~64% of the Quran we will only have 91 verses (tangible, cashable rewards) under our belt after learning the 100 different root words. I think we can do better.", "The question becomes: What are 100 root words I can learn such that, it will maximize the amount of complete verses I can understand?", "No problem, let\u2019s try all the combinations, calculate how many verses they complete, and then pick the one that covers the most verses. Even with a reduced set of only 1250 Root words, we have a total of 8.987762e+149 combinations (1250 choose 100).. yes problem. Cue Genetic Algorithm.", "GAs are great for this kind of crazy combinatorial stuff. A more detailed overview of what a GA is and how a GA can be programmed can be found here. For now, I will skip the technical details and give a generic overview of what we are doing.", "Through this process, the GA will favour selecting root words that lead to completed verses.", "What results does a process like this yield? After running for 1.5 hours (though you could leave it running for days even), with a population size of 5000 chromosomes, we get following stats:", "We sacrifice total corpus coverage (which is a superficial metric of reward) for a whooping total of 226 completed verses (cashable reward full of capital) spanning 1262 total words from a mere 100 unique root words \u2014 compare that to 91 verses spanning 520 total words in our naive solution. We\u2019ve already made some headway \u2014 creating a set of 100 beginner RWs to learn to maximize our reward \u2014 but this is still not proper DIY-style self-learning because we\u2019d have to learn 100 words to reap the rewards\u2026 not something that can be done in a single sitting. And in proper fashion, each sitting must give rewards to keep us motivated\u2014 we are impatient, greedy, hungry amateurs after all.", "We can use the above GA approach to create optimized lesson plans \u2014 each lesson gives us some homework (learning RWs) designed to reap the most rewards as possible (# of completed verses). We simply run the GA incrementally, selecting 10 RWs at a time.", "I\u2019ll present a beginner set of 10 Lesson Plans generated from incrementally running the GA for some hours. Each optimized lesson requires you to learn 10 RWs. Ideally, each lesson can be completed in a single sitting (though it will require some time and perhaps review until you move on to the next one).", "Interestingly, incremental runs of the GA does not decrease our performance significantly (total coverage from 55% to 51%, but total # of completed verses from 226 to 228), hinting at well-optimized solutions.", "Root Words to Learn per Lesson", "Clicking the link under the Details column will direct you to corpus.Quran which presents the meaning/context of the root word in order to learn/study it.", "This table displays the verses that should be \u2018accessible\u2019 after the RWs in each lesson have been learned. Note that there are 2 different links that show the verses. Unfortunately, note that links under corpus.Quran, though more detailed and annotated, do not have all the verses up yet and will often fail (redirect to 1:1).", "The GA does what a computer does best, but it is still left to individuals to actually learn whatever it is we want to learn. This could also serve as a resource for teachers to formulate curriculums. Effort is obviously required to follow through. The only reassurance we have after this is that our effort shall not (hopefully) be wasted, misdirected, or lost in an abyss of information. As I mentioned earlier, the lack of a long-term overarching structure is partially what defines this approach.
