I\u2019ve spent the past couple of years taking statistics and linear algebra classes, completing online courses in ML and Deep Learning, and building models in python. But after all this work, I realized that there was a very important skill that I was lacking\u2026 While I felt comfortable working with data and building a model, I had no experience actually deploying that model to production.", "As the field of machine learning continues to grow and mature, companies are starting to demand more tangible results from their data science teams. And, in several cases, this has translated to companies demanding more software engineering skills from their data scientists, specifically in the area of continues integration and deployment of ML models. While these skills may initially seem out of reach, the majority of companies are using cloud technology to accomplish these tasks. And luckily enough for us, these cloud platforms are accessible by anyone with a device and internet connection.", "To showcase the demand for these skills, I put together a script that scraped Indeed.com to see the frequency different terms showed up in job postings for any given search. Using this script, I searched for Data Scientist and Machine Learning jobs in ten of the largest \u201ctech-hubs\u201d of the United States (San Francisco, CA | New York, NY | Seattle, WA | Austin, TX | Boston, MA | Chicago, IL | Washington DC | San Jose, CA | Baltimore, MD | Arlington, VA). The job postings in all of these cities for each of these two searches were compiled and used to create the below graphics. These graphics showcase how often the terms deploy and cloud appeared in the job postings Indeed returned for each of these searches. Furthermore, I dug a bit deeper into the different cloud technologies to compare how often companies asked for candidates with skills in the three largest cloud platforms: Amazone Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure.", "The graphics above depict the need for skillsets in both deploying models and working in a cloud environment. While not a majority, a considerable percentage of job postings are seeking candidates with these abilities. And, given that data scientists have traditionally spent a majority of their time on the model building (versus the model implementation) side of the problem, growing these skills can differentiate yourself from other candidates. Furthermore, if you are looking for roles in machine learning specifically, deploying models and working in cloud environments are in even higher demand.", "Finally, I dug a bit deeper into these job postings to compare the need for these skills at different experience levels. The graphics below show that as you work to move up to higher-level positions, most notably from entry to mid-level positions, deployment and cloud skills becoming more important.", "The graphs above speak to the career opportunities that you can realize by learning to deploy ML models and work effectively on cloud platforms. But even with all of these professional advantages aside, these skills are exciting to learn about and develop. Thus, I have decided to start a blog series on all of the different ways to deploy an ML model into production. In this series of blog posts, I will include a short follow-along activity for each deployment method, along with providing my feedback on the ease of use.", "See below for a list of my current articles on the topic of ML deployment, and reach out with suggestions for any platforms/techniques that you\u2019d like to see covered!", "Note: The data collected in this blog post was collected from Indeed.com on February 12, 2020.", "Your home for data science.
