You have a team or a business unit doing consultancy. Probably a bunch of Consultants helping clients, some Project Managers leading your projects in a nice Agile or whatever way. Everyone fills their timesheets (and you cut their bonuses if they don\u2019t) \u2014 the time is billed to clients, and you have Fixed Fee projects as well. Maybe smaller teams being parts of your organization also \u2014 you can lead ten, a hundred or a thousand people (hey, dude \u2014 you run a unit of 1000 employees? Don\u2019t read this article \u2014 hire someone who did). You probably even have an ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or something and a CFO in a lovely corner office. Do you have an excellent way to estimate how much profit every team member and project brings and ways to predict it with reasonable precision? If you have a decent ERP dashboard which gives you all that \u2014 then you\u2019re lucky, and you don\u2019t need this article either. The chances are that you get a simple calculation end of the year \u2014 like \u201clet\u2019s take all revenue finance recognized on your projects in a year and man day cost at $800 to get your unit profitability\u201d. $800 can seem crazily high or unacceptably low, depending on the business you\u2019re in. So that\u2019s the precision you have to count the money your team brings to the firm? Do we need to remind you that this is one of the reasons why your job exists?", "What else can you get? All the timesheets projects with their budgets, and you can even get to approximate costs (let\u2019s discuss it later) \u2014 a shitload of data for a year, even for a team of 10. What we show is that you don\u2019t need an ERP to do the rest \u2014 the notebook in Jupyter will do. Keep this in mind \u2014 management starts with measurement. How can you supervise your team and projects if you don\u2019t have their data at your fingers?", "Why do you need Data Science here? Well, you can have all data at your fingers. Eventually, you would want to calculate your profit like", "Not only as subtracting two numbers, but also on the level of tables \u2014 so the output of the above statement can be a table with profit per consultant per month, like this:", "Or get a list of 3 people with most billable hours in March via the following statement", "but we created for you a Jupyter Notebook where you can play with the code to get it working in a few paragraphs (and credit to fastpages \u2014 our post and notebook are the same thing). And yes, there is some learning of python required. The huge difference from anything else you\u2019ve been doing yourself (ERP reports, Excel, other tools) is that any analysis stays in the notebook and can be re-applied after your data changes.", "So, let\u2019s get this done. First \u2014 yes, you need to know a bit of python to get the files in. The basic level will do. If you are a manager in 2020 and can\u2019t write a simple script \u2014 hmm, you probably missed something. The objective is not to build an ERP and not even to have an easy-to-use toolkit \u2014 we want to show you how to make a toolkit for yourself (but feel free to reuse our code). What you will see is a straightforward set of examples \u2014 spend an hour or two to load your files into the notebook and then start playing with it \u2014 just make the analysis you want. You can end up checking a few numbers or building your charts and dashboards. It is ok, even if you work for a corporation (that\u2019s where you need it most) \u2014 just install Anaconda and download the notebook. So, we first get and transform our input files (if you want to follow text AND all the code \u2014 read it on colab).", "Let us summarize it here \u2014 most probably if you are a team leader or business unit manager \u2014 you get few dictionaries", "We need to set default values and bring it to format easy to use, which is very easy in python:", "Timesheets for your team / your projects. It is possible that other teams can contribute to your projects and your team might work in outside projects", "EXT users here are outside of our headcount (let\u2019s say we are not getting the real names, but rather some ids from ERP in such case)", "Why not just have things done by ERP? Your ERP probably does not present you anything nicely in terms of parameters you\u2019d want to control on your level (otherwise, you won\u2019t read this anyway). There may be a project running to improve it by 2025 \u2014 maybe one of the Big4 firms is interviewing you for requirements. If you are steering this boat long enough \u2014 you might have ended up with quick and dirty calculation, SQL queries to SAP (with field names still in German), or an Excel file. Why? Your bosses don\u2019t care \u2014 they already hired you, and a better ERP is coming in 2025 anyway. So they want to know how much money your team makes (preferably \u2014 per person, per month, per project, with charts, projections, and comparisons) and to know why it is not so profitable (because it never is).", "To simplify your way forward we are going to create a timeseries out of timesheets which is a bit more involved so you can skip it for now and come back to it later, but the point is that in the end, you will get a lovely monthly pandas DataFrame. It is common in data science to have one big DataFrame (similar to excel tab or SQL table) that you can group and filter easily. It is helpful because it makes things very easy.", "Timesheets and project budgets are simplified this way, and you can manipulate them the way you want in a few simple statements. If you studied excel formulas \u2014 you could do this also. Now, let\u2019s look at profitability in the most straightforward manner possible. As a manager, we suggest you do that to set benchmarks for your team. So, profit is Revenue \u2014 Cost and we intend to keep it simple. You can implement the calculations you like.", "Revenue: Let\u2019s say that for a Time & Material project, you generate as much revenue as you bill (on agreed rate) up to its budget. We are not doing any Fixed Fee recognition formula. Different companies do it differently, and you\u2019ll either need historical data or actual recognized value depending on how you operate.", "We also assume that we are interested only by users in our headcount (so we filter out all EXT users).", "We got revenue per month per person. Not too sophisticated, right?", "Cost: Let\u2019s start with the fact that just using the \u201cdefault cost rate\u201d is not enough \u2014 whenever margins are under pressure, you should do better. You might have people working in different countries and of totally different levels. Talk to your finance team and get some estimates from them (or make it together). We\u2019d say they owe you that much if you were appointed to run a team or business unit. We will assume below that you managed to get a few grades per Country. Costs per individual will be nice to have as well. The beauty of this tool (compared to doing Excel by yourself) is that you can just add it \u2014 it will be a few lines of code. Let\u2019s calculate direct cost per month: here we check the cost of effort posted on timesheets, presuming they are full \u2014 can check per number of working days in a month also and compare. We are not interested in external resources, so we\u2019ll filter them out again.", "Now, we can get to profit per user per month using operations on dataframes. And here it bears some fruit. Profit = revenue \u2014 cost. Indeed, it required some data cleanup first \u2014 but not too much", "That\u2019s what we\u2019ve promised, right? Ok, second one \u2014 people who entered most Billable hours in March", "Now let\u2019s look at how to apply some python and data science techniques (we will get to more details in our next posts) to data you\u2019ve seen above and how to visualize it nicely.", "First, let\u2019s take a PM and visualize revenue on his/her projects per month.", "That was simple. Then, some fun for those who know slightly more advanced python \u2014 you can make an interactive chart in a few lines. Ok, as a Team Leader, you might not do that. Sorry. Let\u2019s get some calculations done. First, let\u2019s identify \u201csuspicious\u201d time entered (e.g., a person who has more than three days in a row same effort on a given project and it is not 8 hours) \u2014 this is a quick check you do yourself, without asking PMO anything and making this official. I can call this suspicious because nature of our work (and yours might be different \u2014 so you look for another pattern) makes it highly unlikely that you do spend the same amount of time on one project a few days in a row (unless you are assigned full time). What you are doing is likely just splitting your working time between your projects in some manner.", "To be clear, we do not recommend sending emails with the subject \u201cThe list of those whose timings are suspicious\u201d based on the above. People will likely change their behaviors, and you might not easily find the next pattern. As a manager, you dig into your data, find insights, and act on them the way you see fit. You do not just tell your teenage kid that now you know where he hides cigarettes, do you?", "Here are some cases where the above can be helpful \u2014 we will look at some of them in our next posts.", "The point is that loading your data (excel, CSV, TSV \u2014 whatever) is simple, and manipulating it is simple \u2014 more straightforward than doing it in many excel files and faster than waiting for PMOs.", "Stay tuned for our next post.", "Originally published at Your Data Blog", "Your home for data science.
