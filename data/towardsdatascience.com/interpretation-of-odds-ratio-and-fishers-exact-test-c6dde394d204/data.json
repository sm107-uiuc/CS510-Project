There aren\u2019t too many statistical methods to deduce the conclusions of what nominal data relay, unlike the numeric data. Methods such as correlations, confidence intervals, mean, median, etc work for numeric data types. Therefore, frequency tables are used to interpret the nominal data. With the help of the frequency table, nominal data can be interpreted by considering the frequency values in that table.", "After creating a frequency table we can have numeric data which we can apply statistical methods on. Chi-Square Goodness of Fit test and Test of Independence are mostly known methods to check whether frequencies are as expected or not according to observed values. These tests provide information about the distribution of nominal data. Besides, there is also one more metric that provides an overall score about the association of two nominal data. It is called the Odds ratio. The odds ratio mostly works on nominal variables that have exactly two levels. The statistical test called Fisher\u2019s Exact for 2x2 tables tests whether the odds ratio is equal to 1 or not. It can also test whether the odds ratio is greater or less than 1.", "In this article, I will explain what the odds ratio is, how to calculate it, and how to test whether it is going to be equal to 1 in population. We will see the following sections;", "Suppose that you\u2019re working on clinical data. You have two basic variables. One of them shows whether patients are above the average weight and the other one shows whether patients have health problems. Your purpose is to find whether there is any difference or association between being above the average weight and having health problems. So let\u2019s assume that we did our experiment on 20 different patients and their results are found like the table below.", "The next thing that we should do is create a frequency table to inspect how many samples show health problems while they are above the average weight. Our frequency table should look like the table below.", "As you can see from the table above;", "According to these values on the frequency table, we can say that there is a relation on a certain ratio between being above average weight and having health problems. So, what is the ratio of relation, or how we can state this relation with a ratio? If we were dealing with numeric variables we could use Pearson\u2019s r-value but we can\u2019t use it for nominal data types. This is exactly where the odds ratio comes into the business. (Please do not think of this odds ratio as a correlation value. We will see what it means in the following section).", "The odds ratio tells us how many times more positive cases can happen than negative cases. The question is what positive cases and negative cases mean? The answer depends on the frequency table. Positives represent the pairs that are the same in both variables and negatives represent the pairs that aren\u2019t the same in both variables. The visualization of positive and negative cases can be seen at the following table.", "The formula for calculating the odds ratio is the formula below.", "Now let\u2019s go back to our example and calculate the odds ratio according to values in the frequency table.", "Okay, we found our odds ratio as 6. What it means, how to interpret this result? As mentioned before, the odds ratio shows how many times more positive cases occur than negative cases. The positive cases in our example are being more than average weight \u2014 having health problems and being less than average weight \u2014 not having health problems. So, this result shows, odds of having health problems while the patient is more than average weight is 6 times more than having health problems while the patient is less than average weight.", "We shouldn\u2019t forget that the odds ratio can also be less than 1 or 1. If the odds ratio is less than 1 it shows negative cases occur more than positive cases. if it is 1 or close to 1 it means that there isn\u2019t any difference between positive and negative cases. Therefore, we can not say there is any relation between cases or variables.", "This was how to calculate the odds ratio but like in every statistical problem, we should test this odds ratio whether it is going to be 1, less than 1, or more than 1 in population. We need what result can be obtained in the population because we did our experiment on only 20 patients. This is where Fisher\u2019s Exact test is involved.", "We will apply Fisher\u2019s Exact Test on Python by using the \u201cscipy\u201d library with only three lines of code. What Fisher\u2019s Exact does is find the probability value of the odds ratio is equal, greater, or less than 1. Let\u2019s apply the codes below and after we can set our hypothesis to consider the odds ratio.", "The result should look like this,", "We applied three Fisher\u2019s Exact Tests with respectively two sides, less and greater. In the result, the first value shows the odds ratio and the second value shows the p-value. It is really important to set hypotheses before interpreting p values.", "1 \u2014 Hypothesis for first Fisher\u2019s Exact Test (Alternative Two Sided):Ho: The odds ratio is equal to 1Ha: The odds ratio is not equal to 1", "2 \u2014 Hypothesis for first Fisher\u2019s Exact Test (Alternative Less):Ho: The odds ratio is equal to or greater than 1Ha: The odds ratio is less than 1", "3 \u2014 Hypothesis for first Fisher\u2019s Exact Test (Alternative Greater):Ho: The odds ratio is equal to or less than 1Ha: The odds ratio is greater than 1", "For the first hypothesis, we obtained a p-value of 0.16. It shows with the probability of (1- 0.16) 84%, the odds ratio will not be equal to 1 and with the probability of 16%, the odds ratio will equal 1. If we set our confidence level at 95% percentage because 0.16 is higher than 0.05 (1- 0.95) We can not reject the null hypothesis. It means there is a considerable probability that the odds ratio might be equal to 1 in the population (other untested patients). We found high probability that indicates odds ratio won\u2019t be equal to 1. Because of that we also need to check whether odds ratio can be less than 1 or not. This is where alternative of less involved.", "For the second hypothesis, we obtained a p-value of 0.99. It shows with the probability of 1%, the odds ratio won\u2019t be less than 1 and with the probability of 99%, the odds ratio will equal or greater than 1. If we set our confidence level at 95% percentage because 0.99 is greater than 0.05. We can\u2019t reject the null hypothesis. It means there is a considerable probability that the odds ratio will be equal or greater than 1 in the population (other untested patients).", "For the third hypothesis, we obtained a p-value of 0.08. It shows with the probability of 82%, the odds ratio will be greater than 1 and with the probability of 8%, the odds ratio will be equal to or less than 1. If we set our confidence level at 95% percentage because 0.08 is greater than 0.05. We can\u2019t reject the null hypothesis. It means there is even a tiny probability that the odds ratio might be equal or less than 1 or in the population (other untested patients).", "Finally, by considering the third hypothesis, we can say with around 85% probability, being more than average weight will affect having health problems in a negative direction.", "Odds ratio can be used for any nominal type problem that we can not measure on numeric scale. It can be used in problems on business, finance, etc. as well as it used in clinical data. After understanding how to interpret the odds ratio you can check other metrics such as Absolute Risk, Risk Difference, Relative Risk.", "Please read my other article to inform about relative risks and odds.", "Your home for data science.
