I\u2019ll explain thoroughly the difference between the two and the exact scenarios where the use of each one is suitable. Read on!", "Correlation is the degree to which two variables are linearly related. This is an important step in bi-variate data analysis. In the broadest sense correlation is actually any statistical relationship, whether causal or not, between two random variables in bivariate data.", "An important rule to remember is that Correlation doesn\u2019t imply causation", "Let\u2019s understand through two examples as to what it actually implies.", "Hence, we can understand that the correlation doesn't ALWAYS imply causation!", "The correlation coefficient is a statistical measure of the strength of the relationship between the relative movements of two variables. The values range between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation of -1.0 shows a perfect negative correlation, while a correlation of 1.0 shows a perfect positive correlation. A correlation of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the movement of the two variables.", "Wikipedia Definition: In statistics, the Pearson correlation coefficient also referred to as Pearson\u2019s r or the bivariate correlation is a statistic that measures the linear correlation between two variables X and Y. It has a value between +1 and \u22121. A value of +1 is a total positive linear correlation, 0 is no linear correlation, and \u22121 is a total negative linear correlation.", "Important Inference to keep in mind: The Pearson correlation can evaluate ONLY a linear relationship between two continuous variables (A relationship is linear only when a change in one variable is associated with a proportional change in the other variable)", "Example use case: We can use the Pearson correlation to evaluate whether an increase in age leads to an increase in blood pressure.", "Below is an example of how the Pearson correlation coefficient (r) varies with the strength and the direction of the relationship between the two variables. Note that when no linear relationship could be established (refer to graphs in the third column), the Pearson coefficient yields a value of zero.", "Wikipedia Definition: In statistics, Spearman\u2019s rank correlation coefficient or Spearman\u2019s \u03c1, named after Charles Spearman is a nonparametric measure of rank correlation (statistical dependence between the rankings of two variables). It assesses how well the relationship between two variables can be described using a monotonic function.", "Important Inference to keep in mind: The Spearman correlation can evaluate a monotonic relationship between two variables \u2014 Continous or Ordinal and it is based on the ranked values for each variable rather than the raw data.", "A monotonic relationship is a relationship that does one of the following:", "(1) as the value of one variable increases, so does the value of the other variable, OR,", "(2) as the value of one variable increases, the other variable value decreases.", "BUT, not exactly at a constant rate whereas in a linear relationship the rate of increase/decrease is constant.", "Example use case: Whether the order in which employees complete a test exercise is related to the number of months they have been employed or correlation between the IQ of a person with the number of hours spent in front of TV per week", "2. One more difference is that Pearson works with raw data values of the variables whereas Spearman works with rank-ordered variables.", "Now, if we feel that a scatterplot is visually indicating a \u201cmight be monotonic, might be linear\u201d relationship, our best bet would be to apply Spearman and not Pearson. No harm would be done by switching to Spearman even if the data turned out to be perfectly linear. But, if it\u2019s not exactly linear and we use Pearson's coefficient then we\u2019ll miss out on the information that Spearman could capture.", "Let\u2019s look at some examples which I found to be informative from this website:", "2. Pearson = +0.851, Spearman = +1 (This is a monotonically increasing relationship, thus Spearman is exactly 1)", "5. Pearson = \u22120.799, Spearman = \u22121 (This is a monotonically decreasing relationship, thus Spearman is exactly 1)", "NOTE: Both of these coefficients cannot capture any other kind of non-linear relationships. Thus, if a scatterplot indicates a relationship that cannot be expressed by a linear or monotonic function, then both of these coefficients must not be used to determine the strength of the relationship between the variables.", "For further reading, you might want to check out the following two posts which explain Rank ordering and PSI, CSI for model validation and monitoring.", "Watch this space for more on Data Science, Machine Learning, and Statistics.", "Your home for data science.
