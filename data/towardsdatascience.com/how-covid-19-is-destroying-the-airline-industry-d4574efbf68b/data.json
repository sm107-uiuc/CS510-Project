For example, during any pandemic, we see a rise in the healthcare industry\u2019s performance and potential as measured through increased stock prices.", "In contrast, the airline industry, or in essence, any transportation industry, is almost always on the opposite spectrum as people are reluctant to mix with others due to the higher chances of infection, and as a result we see a highly leveraged industry be critically squeezed on a financial level that could lead to intense ramifications, such as bankruptcies that need taxpayers to bail them out.", "To give a relative comparison, after one of the worlds most catastrophic events: 9/11, revenues from the airline industry fell by only $23b, nowhere near the coronavirus\u2019s forecasted implications of $63b to $113b.", "As you can see after the events of the SARS epidemic in 2004, the two industries had polar opposite trends in profit margin.", "To relate, the healthcare industry was booming in terms of their sales up until 2007, which was the time most countries were relieved of the backfiring effects of both epidemics, whereas airlines were still going downhill until 2008.", "The stability of an industry acts as a good indicator as to how much risk an investor is exposed to, with the healthcare industry having a consistent flow of profit margin that was only slightly altered by the arrival of any pandemic as seen from the years that SARS, H5N1, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and Ebola were prevalent.", "However, Airlines were on the complete opposite spectrum, and their profits were hit hard during the epidemics, indicating that they had a much higher sensitivity to externalities relative to Healthcare.", "The best way to analyze Asset Turnover for the airline industry is to compare it side by side with oil prices, as we can see there is almost an identical pattern with every rise and fall, which is logical as fuel is a major element of any airline\u2019s financial statement. Whenever there is a fall in oil prices, there is a subsequent fall in airline\u2019s asset turnover, and vice versa.", "In 2020, we saw a historical low-point for oil prices, and analysts are not expecting a global agreement for stability anytime soon, further intensifying the uncertainty revolving around the airline industry.", "While at first this may seem beneficial, it is absolutely not, it is actually more burdensome.", "As a result of the volatility with oil prices, most airlines tend to hedge their requirements for jet fuel in order to avoid sudden price moves, which means that most airlines have already bought millions of dollars worth of fuel, and are now suffering by paying the hedged price and not today\u2019s lower market prices, while still suffering from lower demand.", "Recalling the European Debt Crisis in 2010, we saw a sharp descent in asset turnover and return on net operating assets, showcasing how the leverage of this industry can cause it to collapse at any time.", "\u201cDoes this mean that we are about to see the same pattern in 2020?\u201d", "It\u2019s important to incorporate fixed assets as airlines are heavily invested in them in order to run their business model. Therefore, Net Operating Asset Growth and Return on Net Operating Assets offers an insight as to how well an industry utilizes its assets to generate earnings, with a higher one indicating better utilization of its assets. As you can see, if the airline industry grows its net operating assets, it\u2019s usually to earn a higher return.", "However, we can expect to see a different replication, one similar to the financial crisis, where there was actually a decline in the net operating assets growth and a rise in the return, showcasing how airlines were being forced to squeeze as much earnings as possible, even if it meant through the means of using extremely aggressive pricing tactics to simply stay afloat.", "In contrast, healthcare faces a gradual growth in its asset turnover from 2007 onwards up until 2011 where it sees a sharp decline as a result of the declaration of the end of the H1N1 virus from the World Health Organization.", "However, the industry then faces a new threat, or in this case, a new opportunity to grow: the Cholera and MERS-CoV epidemics.", "Regardless, healthcare is not necessarily a volatile or highly profitable industry relative to the airline industry as the return on net operating assets remains fairly steady relative to any increase or decrease in the net operating assets, with the small exception of 2015, which can be attributed to the industry responding to the worst Ebola epidemic in recorded history.", "The airline industry is very leveraged compared to the healthcare industry as they need every dollar they have, making them a very illiquid industry due to this lack of cash on hand during times of crisis.", "Surprisingly, the airline industry may have higher net borrowing costs in general, but it is much more consistent than that of the healthcare industry in this regard, which sees a few variations.", "With recent years there is a rising trend of leverage with the healthcare industry due to the rise and intertwining with the technology industry, an industry known for its volatility and high expenditure, which means it costs much more money to fund biotechnological healthcare solutions, and debt is the only feasible solution to fund the high research expenditure involved.", "However, the healthcare industry saw a painful run from 2010 to 2014 as they had negative leverage, meaning that their return on investment was less than the interest on the money borrowed.", "As expected, the cyclical influences highly alter the equity valuation of the airline industry, in general, if one has the stomach to handle turbulence and a long time horizon, a recovery is inevitable, making airline stocks extremely attractive as seen on the graph, given they have sufficient liquidity under their current borrowing agreements.", "While it sounds perfect, the problem with the industry is that many players have unprofitable subdivisions, and not all of those subdivisions share the same high ROI & growth potential as biotech. Therefore, the ability of a company to divest its unprofitable subdivisions can determine its true equity growth potential.", "From a profitability perspective for investors, the healthcare industry has been performing extremely poorly in comparison to the airline industry. When observing the ROCE, a measure of how much money shareholders receive compared with how much money they have invested originally, the healthcare industry has been yielding negative growth for most of the timeline. Even at its peak in 2008, it has only grown by 2%. On the other hand, the airline industry has had some ups and downs, especially during to the recession, but has only been growing since 2014, reaching all-time highs of 8% in 2017.", "When looking at the EPS for both industries, we can draw similar conclusions. The EPS measures how many dollars of net income have been earned by each share of common stock. The healthcare industry has been on a down trend since 2005 whereas the aviation industry has been on an uptrend.", "Interestingly, the healthcare industry did not see a positive spike during the H1N1 period. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that the airline industry is much more profitable than the healthcare industry for shareholders since the mean ratio is 0.6 vs. 3.1 respectively.", "There is always a need for healthcare, making this industry highly price inelastic. This industry is seen by many investors as a stable industry that thrives regardless of whether or not there is a general economic downturn or financial crisis.", "In essence, there is always going to be consumer demand, and as a result of how it is labelled as a necessity, it is less subject to the economic fluctuations the airline industry faces, making them less vulnerable stocks to invest in.", "The reason why healthcare stocks are so attractive is because it is renowned for being one of the best performing industries in terms of growth. This is intertwined with the continuous intertwining of healthcare and technology, and as seen with influenza and COVID-19, the constant need to develop pharmaceutical disease treatments.", "Medical establishments are faced with a severe time lag that forces them to wait extended periods of time to receive financial reimbursement from insurance companies or government agencies, making their cash flow ratios vital indicators of their financial survival.", "Moreover, healthcare companies are prone to substantial long-term debt to fund their research, making their leverage a key differentiator during turbulent times. Finally, the profit margin would act as the final indicator to analysts and investors in equity valuation, as to whether or not this company is capable of managing its expenses well enough to grow its potential earnings.", "The airline industry is a highly seasonal industry, which means that its profitability is highly exposed to externalities such as energy prices, economic downturns, or in 2020, health pandemics.", "It also has a capital-intensive nature, and this limits the number of domestic airlines in existence. Moreover, this means that airlines serving foreign regions face tough competition from local carriers and are susceptible to travel bans such as that seen in Canada\u2019s and The States in 2020 over coronavirus. As a result, the industry thrives on forming alliances amongst each other in order to maintain sustainable market shares in case of black swan events.", "Buying stocks in the airline industry is risky, as most equities have high betas and low-price stability scores. Additionally, the industry is heavily leveraged with debt, causing an overall low financial strength and safety ranking relative to other industries.", "Therefore, the best investments would be those that have track records for capacity utilization, and if we had access to more data, we would look at fuel hedging, and whether the airline\u2019s routes are lucrative, and are not at high risk for political interference. Moreover, there is a high likelihood that we will see the biggest taxpayer money bailout for this industry very soon, meaning if we pick undervalued stocks, we could make a lucrative ROI.", "In conclusion, we see how these two industries can act like polar opposites at times, but this doesn\u2019t mean that they aren\u2019t heavily exposed to externalities, they are, but at differing degrees.", "The airline industry is predicted to be bailed out in 2020, as airlines are parking at least 50% of their fleet, and we are expecting the financial ratios in 2020 to mimic those during the financial crisis and health pandemics, but on a much larger scale.", "It is inevitable that the government will pay billions in taxpayer cash to keep the airline industry afloat, however this is something we have never seen before as analysts are predicting that people will still be afraid to fly even if the worst of the pandemic is done, which means that there is no way for us to correctly estimate the level of financial ramifications coronavirus has, even after receiving a $50b infusion.", "Regardless, people will still need a means of transportation across the world, which means recovery is inevitable, but we do not know exactly how long that will take to see this industry grow at the same rate again.", "On the other hand, the healthcare industry is expected to grow by almost $2t from 2015 to 2020, with longterm projects forecasting an increase of more than $9t by 2040. The reason why is because there is an increasing aging trend and the rapid development of medical technology. However, as we saw with the ratios, there are still several financial inefficiencies, operational difficulties, and external factors such as regulatory burdens that act as blockades to the healthcare industry\u2019s growth potential.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
