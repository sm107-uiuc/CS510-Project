Fake news spreads faster and more easily than this virus, and is just as dangerous.\u201d", "The comparison is neither sensationalism or hyperbole \u2014 the spread of social phenomena is so powerful, 2016 research shows that it can literally follow the same models that trace the contagion of epidemics.", "Examples of the interplay of the two -demics include a slew of debunked news articles ranging from miracle cures and prevention methods such as consuming green herbs, boiled ginger or vitamin D, to false claims of vaccines curing hundreds of patients.", "Unlike the Coronavirus that has emerged in the short span of a few months to wreak havoc in the world, the infodemic is deeply seeded in the fabric of the digital economy.", "But like the virus, everyone has a part to play to stop its spread.", "Before we proceed, it is worth deconstructing the concept of \u2018fake news\u2019. The UNESCO Handbook for Journalism Education and Training notes the term is both ambiguous and easily politicised, and proposes a more helpful breakdown of fake news across the dimensions of intent and factual truth, resulting in the following helpful definitions", "Taking the virus situation as context, an example of disinformation would be a herb seller publishing that eating their herbs would prevent contracting COVID-19. In contrast, a witness to someone fainting tweeting that it is a virus-related death before proper fact checking due to being caught up in the moment would be misinformation. And hacking into a politician\u2019s email to destabilise their election campaign would be mal-information.", "All are harmful, especially when amplified by today\u2019s technology. But knowing your enemy is the first step to victory.", "But how did we get here? We investigate this in three parts:", "While findings vary by country and our obsession with screens may seem ubiquitous judging from what we see in public spaces, data shows it was only as recent as 2018 that social media replaced print newspapers as the primary news distribution platform in the US. And that has profound implications to the concentration of content we consume.", "The nature of classic newspaper broadsheets mean that readers buying a newspaper get exposed to relatively even distribution of content \u2014 a mix of local, foreign and world news, opinions and editorials, entertainment and sports sections, and classified ads. If an average newspaper carried 100 stories, a reader might be interested in only 10. But he or she would be exposed to all 100 by virtue of the medium\u2019s design.", "But digital platforms changed the dynamics of distribution, the economics of news, and its methods of aggregation, laying the foundation for today\u2019s infodemic:", "The net result UK telecommunications regulatory body Ofcom\u2019s research into news consumption summarised this in three clear trends for people who access news online:", "These forces fatefully coincided with a pervasive feature that would form the backbone of today\u2019s news experience.", "In 2006, a leading technology engineer Aza Raskin designed infinite scroll, which allows users to continuously move up or down pages without needing to click \u2018refresh\u2019 or \u2018next page\u2019. While initially designed to create a seamless experience, he said it had the unintended side effect of \u201cnot giving your brain time to catch up with your impulses\u201d, thus keeping users looking at their phones far longer than necessary.", "A former Mozilla and Jawbone employee, Aza now regrets his creation, which has since become a central feature of many content platforms and seen as highly habit forming.", "While we may chide those around us to \u2018have more willpower\u2019 to overcome being led into unhelpful patterns of thinking when consuming content, Aza reminds us that this is not a fair fight:", "\u201cBehind every screen on your phone, there are generally like literally a thousand engineers that have worked on this thing to try to make it maximally addicting.\u201d", "Taken together with recommendation engines, the end result is addiction by design, Natasha Schull, author of a book with the same name drew comparisons to how slot machines and other systems are designed to lock users into a cycle of addiction in describing this phenomenon:", "\u201cFacebook, Twitter and other companies use methods similar to the gambling industry to keep users on their sites\u2026 In the online economy, revenue is a function of continuous consumer attention \u2014 which is measured in clicks and time spent.\u201d", "One further ingredient behind the appeal of fake news is the cognitive psychology phenomenon known as confirmation bias. This refers to people\u2019s tendency to accept information that confirms their pre-existing beliefs and to ignore information that challenges them. This biased approach to processing information is largely unintentional and causes people to more readily accept \u2018fake news\u2019 if it conforms to their existing beliefs.", "Cognitive biases are dangerous on their own, but we now have a full picture:", "We gain access to fake news that we would otherwise not have access to through digital news platforms, consume it in the context of UI features that bypass our powerful deliberate thought processes, are repeatedly served more of the same by virtue of recommendation engines, and drive ourselves deeper into our echo chambers by confirmation bias.", "But there is hope. Fake news is addictive by design, and it can be balanced by design. AI optimizing for views makes the infodemic virulent, and AI optimized for truth can stem its spread.", "The infodemic is complex. Multi-faceted problems seldom yield to simple solutions, and there is already an arsenal of initiatives attempting to address the issue. Poynter tables these measures which include promoting news literacy, recommending that people cultivate diverse viewpoints, maintaining quality journalism, and even legal and regulatory action.", "Both education and institutions are necessary, but not sufficient. Education takes time, and we will see below that current measures are struggling to make a dent in the problem. We should also be wary that heavy handed regulation carries a risk of abuse, where legitimate expression and journalism may become subject to censorship by an arbitrary standard of \u2018truth\u2019.", "Besides these measures, we also need to fix the machine.", "Turning our attention to the future \u2014 the lens through which much of the world consumes news today are the technology products and social media platforms that serve news, and the algorithms that power them.", "And in grasping for a solution, our first instinct might be to fight AI with AI \u2014 would NLP and machine learning models serving a checking and policing function be sufficient to stem the spread of fake news?", "Baseline datasets which label journalistic standards, political bias and consumer trust to train such fake news recognition models exist (such as here and here). However these steps carry their own risks. False positives (i.e. flagging genuine news articles by mistake) and biased training data (a whole topic on its own) make these tools acting alone controversial. It is when a human is in the loop that these methods come into their own.", "If news products and platforms are our front lines, then our deployment of AI must be within the context of human-centric product design. Replicating the real-life experience of calling emergency services when we observe a crime, platforms can be designed with features such as feedback loops that curb the infodemic spread and promote credible news.", "Facebook has tested and implemented such measures to combat fake news. The approach was two fold:", "The combination of crowd-sourced content flagging, having credible fact-checking humans in the loop, and the ability to throttle the flow of disputed content and increase the flow of credible content is a powerful positive force.", "A straightforward way of taking back control of our system 2 thinking capabilities is to swap out the infinite scroll on our user interface. But what would we replace it with?", "The team at the Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI) offers a compelling suggestion through project Tanbih. Roughly translated to mean alert or precaution in Arabic, Tanbih is a news aggregator with product demos online. The interface presents multiple stories on the same event which are accessible by swiping left and right, allowing the reader to get varied perspectives on each unfolding event.", "Through reflecting \u2018more sides of the story\u2019 and slowing down consumption, this interface allows readers to engage with the content more deeply and draw their own conclusions.", "The Tanbih approach of reader engagement also makes explicit the stance and bias of the source behind each news piece. Each story comes with a clickable icon of the source (e.g. CNN, The Daily Mirror etc.), with leads to an extensive dashboard estimating the stance of the source in granular detail. A selection of these dashboard elements are shown below:", "The thinking behind this was presented at a seminar provocatively titled \u201cDetecting fake news before it is even written\u201d, by QCRI NLP professor Dr. Preslav Nakov.", "A collaboration between QCRI and MIT\u2019s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab (CSAIL), the effort centers around moving from fact checking to source checking. The logic of this approach is sound:", "\u201cIf a website has published fake news before, there\u2019s a good chance they\u2019ll do it again.\u201d", "From platform to user experience, we now arrive at the consumer. While calls for media literacy abound, how are we really doing? And can we do better?", "Efforts have been underway to include this in our schools, but the gap is large and progress is patchy. A 2018 report from the Commission on Fake News and the Teaching of Critical Literacy Skills in Schools found only 2% of children and young people in the UK have the critical literacy skills they need to tell if a news story is real or fake. Elsewhere, a January 2020 US Media Literacy Policy Report shows only 14 states making meaningful progress in media literacy education laws in K-12 schools.", "And adult literacy \u2014 arguably the more urgent matter \u2014 paints a similarly hazy picture. There are online resources, a positive sign, and full fledged courses are available on reputable platforms like Coursera and edX. But interest is scant, and there seems to be more people looking to implement AI than learn how to consume it wisely. Interest in a popular deep learning course on the same platform outstrips the news course by a factor of twenty five.", "Perhaps a different tack is needed to build up our immunity to infodemics. Throwing online courses at a problem has never been a panacea, and there is mounting evidence that they hurt those who need it the most due to their need for high self-motivation and self-regulation. A more ambitious way of scaling education by the aforementioned Tanbih project is overlaying a propaganda detector on news, with every instance of persuasion techniques (such as loaded language, slogans and bandwagons) highlighted on the article itself. After a reader has used this aid for a time, he or she would then automatically spot these techniques even without the aid.", "Or perhaps we turn to play: Poynter\u2019s roundup of games that teach users how to spot misinformation are involving and educational. They run the gamut of Bad News, where players learn strategies of fake news sites by role-playing a fake news producer, to Fakey that challenge players with real news articles.", "Bringing it all together, there is a beautiful irony in this picture.", "As we peer beneath the hood of the infodemic, we may be initially dazzled by the complex digital trappings of the present-day. But persist with our gaze, and we start to see something familiar.", "Modern platforms may operate in a way unimaginable by the leaders of print a mere generation ago. They are built on frameworks with brutally short life spans, staffed with industry 4.0 roles and leverage state-of-the-art AI. But they have also come full circle: they are finding out what it means to be today\u2019s new gatekeepers. And the fight is ultimately a fight for attention, and a fight for truth.", "And thus our weapons are new but our battles are old. We need educated buyers, responsible vetting, and balanced perspectives. Our platforms should balance commercial value with ethical design. And in thinking of the powerful tool of AI, we need to remember that at their core AI systems are optimization tools, and we need to be mindful of what we are optimizing for.", "All images displayed above are solely for non-commercial illustrative purposes.
