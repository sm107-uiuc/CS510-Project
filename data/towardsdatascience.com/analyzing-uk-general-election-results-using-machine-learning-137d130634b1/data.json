The poll accurately predicted the election outcome by surveying over 20,000 people at 144 constituencies around England, Scotland and Wales. This article uses Machine Learning to demonstrate relationships between election results and socioeconomic conditions in each constituency around England. This was inspired from interest in the geopolitical landscape of the UK and is specifically motivated by the desire to further understand how social and economic factors affect voting direction.", "This article uses 8 different socioeconomic categories to cluster and classify the 533 Westminster Parliamentary Constituencies in England (only English constituencies have been selected, as data for the other nations in the UK is more sparse). Affinity Propagation is used to cluster the data and then Random Forest and AdaBoost techniques are used to classify and predict voting direction.", "The majority of the data used in this report has been taken from the House of Commons website except data regarding the Brexit referendum which are estimations compiled by Hanretty\u00b9 (required as the Brexit referendum results were not counted by constituency).", "The data used in this article and a Juypter Notebook containing the code listing can be downloaded here.", "The plots were created using the Geopandas library in combination with boundary shape data from the UK-GeoJson site.", "Affinity Propagation (AP) is a communication based clustering algorithm, first proposed by Frey and Dueck in 2007\u00b2 . The algorithm describes data points as a node in a network that communicate their clustering preferences by sending signals to each other via edges of the graph. The communications are used to locate the optimal exemplar nodes (the best data points to represent their own cluster) and assign the most suitable data points to that cluster. The main metric used to determine the signal magnitudes is the similarity score which is calculated as the negative euclidean squared distance between two data points\u00b2. Using Affinity Propagation, the smallest and most discrete clusters are identified and labelled first. This explains the dark-to-light colour gradient as you move away from central London, shown in Figure 1.", "Using the Davis Bouldin Index, the optimal number of clusters was determined to be 6. The new clustering of constituencies is shown in Figure 2 (using K-means). Central London forms its own unique cluster, not seen anywhere else in England. This is likely driven by extremely high house prices.", "I used Random Forest and Adaboost techniques to predict the voting direction of each constituency. The classifications produced by a Random Forest are shown below in Figure 3.", "The Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest both consistently achieved an accuracy score of 100% on the training data and between 80\u201390% accuracy on the test data (when trained either the 2017 and 2019 election results). The predictive power of each attribute was extracted from the Random Forest and is shown in Figure 4. A random variable was introduced as a reference. Tenure proved to provide the most information about voting direction. One explanation for this is that in cities there are more renters, and city seats tended to be won by Labour (especially in London).", "AdaBoost performed relatively poorly, often using combinations of illogical attributes to make poor classifications. This is because AdaBoost does not work well with outlying data: it can get stuck in a cycle of trying to classify a rogue data point. Seats belonging to the Speaker of the House, the Green Party and potentially the liberal democrats could have caused issues here.", "Using the Affinity Propagation and K-means clustering algorithms it was possible to break down English constituencies into logical groups which have been plotted for easy visualization. Affinity Propagation provides information about which constituencies are most similar but also which clusters are most discrete; this ultimately produces a colour gradient formed from the central London and moving outwards, based on the order the labels were assigned.", "Using Random Forest it was possible to extract the predictive power of each attribute and demonstrate that they all provide a meaningful contribution to the decision process. Classifications were achieved with an accuracy between 80\u201390%, but no seats other than Labour and Conservative were predicted. Tenure proved to be the dominating factor in both elections, contributing roughly 19% of the predictive power in 2019. You can see an interesting increase in the predictive power of the Brexit stance between 2017 and 2019 which was probably caused by Labour seats which went Tory for the first time in decades out of their desire to see Brexit done.", "Your home for data science.
