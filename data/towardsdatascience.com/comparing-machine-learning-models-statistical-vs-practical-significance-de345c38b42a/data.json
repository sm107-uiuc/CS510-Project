If we\u2019re facing a choice between models A and B, which one is the winner and why? Could the models be combined together so that optimal performance is achieved?", "A very shallow approach would be to compare the overall accuracy on the test set, say, model A\u2019s accuracy is 94% vs. model B\u2019s accuracy is 95%, and blindly conclude that B won the race. In fact, there is so much more than the overall accuracy to investigate and more facts to consider.", "In this blog post, I\u2019d love to share my recent findings on model comparison. I like using simple language when explaining statistics, so this post is a good read for those who are not so strong in statistics, but would love to learn a little more.", "If possible, it\u2019s a really good idea to come up with some plots that can tell you right away what\u2019s actually going on. It seems odd to do any plotting at this point, but plots can provide you with some insights that numbers just can\u2019t.", "In one of my projects, my goal was to compare the accuracy of 2 ML models on the same test set when predicting user\u2019s tax on their documents, so I thought it\u2019d be a good idea to aggregate the data by user\u2019s id and compute the proportion of correctly predicted taxes for each model.", "The data set I had was big (100K+ instances), so I broke down the analysis by region and focused on smaller subsets of data \u2014 the accuracy may differ from subset to subset. This is generally a good idea when dealing with ridiculously large data sets, simply because it is impossible to digest a huge amount of data at once, let alone come up with reliable conclusions (more about the sample size issue later). A huge advantage of a Big Data set is that not only you have an insane amount of information available, but you can also zoom in the data and explore what\u2019s going on on a certain subset of pixels.", "At this point, I was suspicious that one of the models is doing better on some subsets, while they\u2019re doing pretty much the same job on other subsets of data. This is a huge step forward from just comparing the overall accuracy. But this suspicion could be further investigated with hypothesis testing. Hypothesis tests can spot differences better than human eye \u2014 we have a limited amount of data in the test set, and we may be wondering how is the accuracy going to change if we compare the models on a different test set. Sadly, it\u2019s not always possible to come up with a different test set, so knowing some statistics may be helpful to investigate the nature of model accuracies.", "It seems trivial at the first sight, and you\u2019ve probably seen this before:", "In practice, hypothesis testing is a little more complicated and sensitive. Sadly, people use it without much caution and misinterpret the results. Let\u2019s do it together step by step!", "Step 1. We set up H0: the null hypothesis = no statistically significant difference between the 2 models and H1: the alternative hypothesis = there is a statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the 2 models \u2014 up to you: model A != B (two-tailed) or model A < or > model B (one-tailed)", "Step 2. We come up with a test-statistic in such a way as to quantify, within the observed data, behaviours that would distinguish the null from the alternative hypothesis. There are many options, and even the best statisticians could be clueless about an X number of statistical tests \u2014 and that\u2019s totally fine! There are way too many assumptions and facts to consider, so once you know your data, you can pick the right one. The point is to understand how hypothesis testing works, and the actual test-statistic is just a tool that is easy to calculate with a software.", "Beware that there is a bunch of assumptions that need to be met before applying any statistical test. For each test, you can look up the required assumptions; however, the vast majority of real life data is not going to strictly meet all conditions, so feel free to relax them a little bit! But what if your data, for example, seriously deviates from Normal distribution?", "There are 2 big families of statistical tests: parametric and non-parametric tests, and I highly recommend reading a little more about them here. I\u2019ll keep it short: the major difference between the two is the fact that parametric tests require certain assumptions about the population distribution, while non-parametric tests are a bit more robust (no parameters, please!).", "In my analysis, I initially wanted to use the paired samples t-test, but my data was clearly not normally distributed, so I went for the Wilcoxon signed rank test (non-parametric equivalent of the paired samples t-test). It\u2019s up to you to decide which test-statistic you\u2019re going to use in your analysis, but always make sure the assumptions are met.", "Step 3. Now the p-value. The concept of p-value is sort of abstract, and I bet many of you have used p-values before, but let\u2019s clarify what a p-value actually is: a p-value is just a number that measures the evidence against H0: the stronger the evidence against H0, the smaller the p-value is. If your p-value is small enough, you have enough credit to reject H0.", "Luckily, the p-value can be easily found in R/Python so you don\u2019t need to torture yourself and do it manually, and although I\u2019ve been mostly using Python, I prefer doing hypothesis testing in R since there are more options available. Below is a code snippet. We see that on subset 2, we indeed obtained a small p-value, but the confidence interval is useless.", "Step 4. Very straightforward: if p-value < pre-specified alpha (0.05, traditionally), you can reject H0 in favour of H1. Otherwise, there is not enough evidence to reject H0, which does not mean that H0 is true! In fact, it may still be false, but there was simply not enough evidence to reject it, based on the data. If alpha is 0.05 = 5%, that means there is only a 5% risk of concluding a difference exists when it actually doesn\u2019t (aka type 1 error). You may be asking yourself: so why can\u2019t we go for alpha = 1% instead of 5%? It\u2019s because the analysis is going to be more conservative, so it is going to be harder to reject H0 (and we\u2019re aiming to reject it).", "The most commonly used alphas are 5%, 10% and 1%, but you can pick any alpha you\u2019d like! It really depends on how much risk you\u2019re willing to take.", "Can alpha be 0% (i.e. no chance of type 1 error)? Nope :) In reality, there\u2019s always a chance you\u2019ll commit an error, so it doesn\u2019t really make sense to pick 0%. It\u2019s always good to leave some room for errors.", "If you wanna play around and p-hack, you may increase your alpha and reject H0, but then you have to settle for a lower level of confidence (as alpha increases, confidence level goes down \u2014 you can\u2019t have it all :) ).", "If you get a ridiculously small p-value, that certainly means that there is a statistically significant difference between the accuracy of the 2 models. Previously, I indeed got a small p-value, so mathematically speaking, the models differ for sure, but being \u201csignificant\u201d does not imply being important. Does that difference actually mean anything? Is that small difference relevant to the business problem?", "Statistical significance refers to the unlikelihood that mean differences observed in the sample have occurred due to sampling error. Given a large enough sample, despite seemingly insignificant population differences, one might still find statistical significance. On the other side, practical significance looks at whether the difference is large enough to be of value in a practical sense. While statistical significance is strictly defined, practical significance is more intuitive and subjective.", "At this point, you may have realized that p-values are not super powerful as you may think. There\u2019s more to investigate. It\u2019d be great to consider the effect size as well. The effect size measures the magnitude of the difference \u2014 if there is a statistically significant difference, we may be interested in its magnitude. Effect size emphasizes the size of the difference rather than confounding it with sample size.", "What is considered a small, medium, large effect size? The traditional cut-offs are 0.1, 0.3, 0.5 respectively, but again, this really depends on your business problem.", "And what\u2019s the issue with the sample size? Well, if your sample is too small, then your results are not going to be reliable, but that\u2019s trivial. What if your sample size is too large? This seems awesome \u2014 but in that case even the ridiculously small differences could be detected with a hypothesis test. There\u2019s so much data that even the tiny deviations could be perceived as significant. That\u2019s why the effect size becomes useful .", "There\u2019s more to do \u2014 we could try to find the power or the test and the optimal sample size. But we\u2019re good for now.", "Hypothesis testing could be really useful in model comparison if it\u2019s done right. Setting up H0 & H1, calculating the test-statistic and finding the p-value is routine work, but interpreting the results require some intuition, creativity and deeper understanding of the business problem. Remember that if the testing is based on a very large test set, relationships found to be statistically significant may not have much practical significance. Don\u2019t just blindly trust those magical p-values: zooming in the data and conducting a post-hoc analysis is always a good idea! :)", "Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn, I\u2019m always up for a chat about Data Science!", "Your home for data science.
