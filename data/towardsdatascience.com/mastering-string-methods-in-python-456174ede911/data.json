The purpose of the article is to serve as a cheat-sheet for built-in methods of one of the basic Python data types: strings. A string is a data type in Python programming language that's used to represent a piece of text. They are super flexible and necessary to appropriately represent text inputs in code. As a result, learning how to make the most out of them is a must.", "Once the basic syntax of these data types is learnt, you can start growing your Python knowledge which will let you to more and more interesting operations with string handling. Always remember that the main goal of the learning process is to write clean and efficient code to automate routinary tasks, without memorizing any method, as you\u2019ll completely understand them once you put them into practice.", "1. Introduction to Strings (3 min read).", "3. Transforming Strings (2 min read).", "A string is a Python data type that\u2019s used to represent a piece of text. It\u2019s written between quotes, either double quotes or single quotes and can be as short as zero characters, or empty string, or as long as you wish.", "Strings can be concatenated to build longer strings using the plus sign and also they can be multiplied by a number, which results in the continuous repetition of the string as many times as the number indicates. Also, if we want to find out the length of the string, we simply have to use the len() function as shown in the example below:", "There are tons of things we could do with strings in our scripts. For example, we can check if files are named a certain way by looking at the filename and seeing if they match our criteria, or we can create a list of emails by checking out the users of our system and concatenating our domain:", "In addition, we can access just a specific character or a slice of characters of a string. We might want to do this, for example, if we have a text that\u2019s too long to display and we want to show just a portion of it. Or if we want to make an acronym by taking the first letter of each word in a phrase. We can do that through an operation called string indexing. This operation lets us access the character in a given position or index using square brackets and the number of the position we want, as the example below shows:", "What if you want to print the last character of a string but you don\u2019t know how long it is? You can do that using negative indexes. In the example above, we don\u2019t know the length of the string, but we know that the word \u2018text\u2019 plus the exclamation sign take five indices, so we call negative five to access them.", "Remember that Python starts counting indexes from 0 not 1. Just like it does with the range function, it considers the range of values between the first and one less than last number.", "Apart from trying to access certain characters inside a string, we might want to change them in case they\u2019re incorrect and we want to fix it, or in case we want to communicate a different thing.", "Slicing won\u2019t be useful for this, as strings are immutable data types, in terms of Python, which means that they can\u2019t be modified. What we can do is create a new string based on the old one:", "We\u2019re not changing the underlying string that was assigned to it before. We\u2019re assigning a whole new string with different content. In this case, it was pretty easy to find the index to change as there are few characters in the string. How are we supposed to know which character to change if the string is larger?", "To achieve our goal, we\u2019ll use the index method which is a function associated with a specific class and serves for a certain function when attached to a variable following a dot.", "The index method in particular, returns the index of the given substring, inside the string.The substring that we pass, can be as long or as short as we want. And what happens if the string doesn\u2019t have the substring we\u2019re looking for? The index method can\u2019t return a number because the substring isn\u2019t there, so we get a value error instead:", "In order to avoid this Traceback Error, we can use the keyword in to check if a substring is contained in a string. This keyword is also used for for loops, as I explain in this previous article of Loops in Python.", "In the case of Loops, it was used for iteration, whereas in this case it\u2019s a conditional that can be either true or false. It\u2019ll be true if the substring is part of the string, and false if it\u2019s not.", "There are a bunch of fun methods for transforming our string text. Among those that are more important to understand to make real-world applications we can find the lower(), upper(), strip(), count() and join() methods.", "The strip() method is useful when dealing with user input as it gets rid of surrounding spaces in the string. This means it doesn\u2019t just remove spaces, it also removes tabs and new line characters, which are all characters we don\u2019t usually want in user-provided strings.", "There are two more versions of this method, lstrip and rstrip, which eliminate white space characters to the left or to the right of the string respectively, instead of both sides.", "Other methods give you information about the string itself. The method count returns how many times a given substring appears within a string. The method endswith returns whether the string ends with a certain substring, whereas the method startswith returns whether the string started with a substring:", "Another form of concatenation is with the application of the join method. To use the join method, we have to call it on the string that\u2019ll be used for joining. In this case, we\u2019re using a string with a space in it. The method receives a list of strings and returns one string with each of the strings joined by the initial string. Let\u2019s check its functionality with one simple example:", "Lastly, an important application of strings is the split method, which returns a list of all the words in the initial string and it automatically splits by any white space. It can optionally take a parameter and split the strings by another character, like a comma or a dot:", "String objects have a built-in functionality to make format changes, which also include an additional way of concatenating strings. Let\u2019s take a look at it:", "In the example above, I generated a new string based on the input values of two already-created variables by using the curly brackets placeholder to show where the variables should be written. Then, I passed the variables as a parameter to the format method.", "On the other hand, we might want to format the numerical output of a float variable. For example, in the case a product with taxes:", "In this case between the curly brackets we\u2019re writing a formatting expression. These expressions are needed when we want to tell Python to format our values in a way that\u2019s different from the default. The expression starts with a colon to separate it from the field name that we saw before. After the colon, we write \u201c.2f\u201d. This means we\u2019re going to format a float number and that there should be two digits after the decimal dot. So no matter what the price is, our function always prints two decimals.", "You can also specify text alignment using the greater than operator: >. For example, the expression {:>3.2f} would align the text three spaces to the right, as well as specify a float number with two decimal places.", "In this article, I included an extensive guide of string data types with some of its methods and real applications with the corresponding theoretical explanation. Of course, they are a lot of additional methods! But there\u2019s no need to memorize them as you\u2019ll completely understand them once you put the concepts into practice.", "In future series, I\u2019ll dive deeper into more important methods for other Python data types. If you liked the information included in this article don\u2019t hesitate to contact me to share your thoughts. It motivates me to keep on sharing!", "Thanks for taking the time to read my article!
