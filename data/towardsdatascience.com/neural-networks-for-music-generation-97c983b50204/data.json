Can we reproduce artists\u2019 creativity through AI? Can a Deep Learning model be an inspiration or a productivity tool for musicians? Those questions bring us to the definition of creativity and the usefulness of such tools beyond their own research interest.", "The first goal of researches in this area is to artificially generate human sounding music or a more specific artist sounding music, such as Mozart. One challenge here is to produce original compositions that still respects the rules and classic patterns you expect to hear.", "Could AI be used to enhance artists\u2019 creativity, though inspiration, but also by providing a tool to efficiently develop their ideas? We have already seen how the rise of powerful softwares to compose music, such as Ableton, have shaped the current musical space, more diverse than ever. Now, to what extent will AI expand this trend?", "\u201cMusic is the shorthand of emotions\u201d Leo Tolstoy", "The artificial generation of music raises numerous challenges. We first need to decide how to encode different musical features. Then, we should make sure that our compositions respect the major musical rules about structure and dynamics.", "\u201cMusic has multiple dimensions along which relative differences arguably matter more than their absolute values; the two most prominent are timing and pitch.\u201d [1]", "The volume of the sound produced by an instrument. It is usually encoded using the annotations made by the composers, from pianissimo ppp to fortissimo fff.", "Probably the most important yet most difficult music feature to encode.", "\u201cThat attribute of auditory sensation which enables a listener to judge that two nonidentical sounds, similarly presented and having the same loudness and pitch, are dissimilar\u201d Wikipedia", "If a piano plays a note, and then a guitar plays the same note, for the same length of time, at the same loudness, you can still easily distinguish between the two sounds, as the two instruments sound different. This difference is in the timbre of the sounds. This result from the fact that each note from an instrument is a complex wave that contains several frequencies.", "What is the time discretization? The two strategies commonly used are either setting time as a relative duration based on the smallest unit: a sixteen note; or fixing an absolute duration to the note played: ex 30 milliseconds. This last strategy also enables to capture expressiveness in the interpretation of a music sheet and makes the composition more human sounding.", "Other music features that have to be represented include duration, rest, timing and pitch.", "Here I present several pieces of research done in the area, it is not exhaustive but presents some interesting approaches to the problem.", "This project developed by Google Brain aims at creating a new tool for artists to use when working and developing new songs. They have developed several models to generate music.", "At the end of 2016, they published an LSTM model tuned with Reinforcement Learning. The interesting idea was to use Reinforcement Learning to teach the model to follow certain rules, while still allowing it to retain information learned from data. [2]", "For that, a couple of metrics are defined: First, those that we want to be low, that are associated with penalties:", "Then, the metrics that we want to be high, associated with rewards:", "Those metrics define a kind of music theory rule. The degree of improvement of these metrics is determined by the extent of the reward given to the particular behavior. This way, we can give more emphasis on some metrics that are considered more important. For instance, here, a strong penalty is given each time a note is excessively repeated (-100), while a much smaller reward is given at the end of the composition for a unique extrema note (+3). The choice of the metrics, as well as the weights, define the shape of the music we want to create.", "More recently, the Magenta team has used GAN and Transformers to generate music with improved long-term structure.", "In the Transformers\u2019 model, relative self-attention is used. It modulates attention, according to how far apart tokens are. This architecture helps capture the various levels at which self-referential phenomena exist in music.", "Those models are then leveraged to create creativity tools that can be used by artists during their compositions. This is the concept of the Magenta Studio added as a plugin to Ableton Live.", "\u201cMagenta Studio is a collection of music creativity tools built on Magenta\u2019s open source models, available both as standalone applications and as plugins for Ableton Live. They use cutting-edge machine learning techniques for music generation.\u201d [3]", "In this project, to cope with the grouping of notes, bars are used instead of notes as the basic compositional unit. Therefore, music is generated one bar after another using CNN, which are good for finding local, translation invariant patterns. [4]", "An interesting approach in this paper is the evaluation metrics used. Five main characteristics we want our music to have are defined and used to train the network. Then, we evaluate each of them and assess how well the prediction is doing:", "This is an example of a project using continuous encoding instead of discrete encoding. The model generates raw audio waveforms. Therefore, it is able to generate any kind of sound, like human voices. [5]", "The model is a CNN, where the convolutional layers have multiple dilatation factors and predictions only depend on previous timesteps. Applications include the generation of piano pieces and speech generation.", "This is OpenAI music generation model. It leverages state of the art NLP architecture \u2014 large-scale transformer model \u2014 to predict the next token in a sequence. It can combine styles from different famous composers as well as different music genres. [6]", "Maia is a research project I developed at UC Berkeley, along with Edward T. and Louis R., to give one possible solution to this broad challenge.", "We started out with the intention of creating an AI that could complete Mozart\u2019s unfinished composition Lacrimosa \u2014 the eighth sequence of the Requiem \u2014 which was written only till the eighth bar at the time of his passing.", "We approached this problem by framing music generation as a language modeling problem. The idea is to encode midi files into a vocabulary of tokens and have the neural network predict the next token in a sequence from thousands of midi-files.", "We adopted the \u2018Notewise\u2019 method [7] proposed by Christine Payne\u2019s \u2014 a technical staff at OpenAI\u2019 \u2014 to encode each composition\u2019s duration, pitch, and dynamics into a text sequence \u2014 resulting in a vocabulary size of 150 words.", "Additionally, to augment our dataset, we used modulations to duplicate every piece by twelve times \u2014 each, one note lower than the next.", "We explored added special tokens to each piece so that the sequence would contain information about the composer, when the music starts and when it ends.", "We also explored ngram tokenization, which treats a string of n consecutive \u201cwords\u201d as a single token. The motivation was to see if we can better capture the semantics of compound \u201cwords\u201d, that represent common chords or melody patterns. Eventually, we still stuck with unigram tokens for our final model, as any higher order of ngram increases the vocabulary size substantially compared to our dataset.", "Next, the encoded text data were batched into sequences of 512 tokens for training. Instead of just chopping them up into mutually exclusive sequences, we overlapped the sequences, i.e. every subsequent sequence share 50% overlap with the previous sequence. This way, we wouldn\u2019t lose any information of continuity at the points which split the sequences.", "The first version was built using a recurrent neural network architecture. In particular, we used LSTM because its additional forget gate and cell state was able to carry information about longer-term structures in music compared to RNN and GRUs \u2014 allowing us to predict longer sequences of up to 1 minute that still sounded coherent. Our baseline model is a 2-layers stacked LSTM with 512 hidden units in each LSTM cell. We used an embedding layer to transform each token into a vector.", "To ensure that our generated sequences are diverse, instead of always selected the most likely next token in the prediction, the model would randomly sample from the top k most likely next tokens based on their corresponding probability, where k is between 1 and 5.", "There were hyperparameters that we had to tune, such as deciding the sequence length per sample. Too short and you will not learn enough to produce a string of music that sounds coherent to humans. Too long a sequence and training will take too long without learning more information.", "Optimizing our batch size will also allow us to trade off learning iterations vs leveraging on GPU\u2019s concurrent computation. We used a grid search to find the best combination of sequence length and batch size.", "GPT is an architecture based on Transformers decoders stacked together [8]. The Transformer is a sequence model that leverage self-attention and that already had impressive results for generation tasks involving long-range dependencies. It is essentially the vanilla Transformer model with its encoder block and cross-attention mechanism stripped away \u2014 so that it can perform more efficiently on unsupervised tasks. This makes it well suited for music representation.", "We used a 6-layers GPT model that included one embedding layer, 6 decoder blocks and 1 linear softmax layer that will return us the logits for the next predicted token. Each decoder block has 8 self-attention heads with 256-dimensional states and 1024 dimensional inner states for the feed-forward layers.", "Using data from all composers, the training loss converged after about 5000 iterations. However, we decided to push the training to 200k iterations (30 epoch) \u2014 which took approximately 60 hours \u2014 to see if we could get higher quality generated samples.", "Our initial results were not particularly coherent, so we tightened the training to a single composer.", "Overall, our attempts to model longer sequences were hampered by the memory of the GPU we were using. It can only support up to 512 tokens in each sequence.", "To improve the long term retention of our models we explored more recent NLP models such as GPT-2 and Sparse Transformers.", "Regarding the GPT-2 model, we had to make a choice between using the pre-trained model or build it from scratch. The first solution would allow us to take advantage of the large dataset the model was trained on, but because it was trained on texts and not music, it may not generalize well with our dataset. The second solution would make more sense as the model would only learn from music data, but the size of the dataset would reduce the amount of total training and thus the overall performance. We decided to go for the second choice; however, the binary encoding part of the GPT-2 does not fit our tokenizing and sequencing, which prevents the model from performing well.", "A quantitative metric that can be recursively, quickly and accurately applied to our models is the BLEU score. BLEU evaluates the number of ngrams used in the generated sequences that were also present in some reference sequences. It is widely used to evaluate translation models and assumes that good sequences look similar to real sequences at a micro level. This is a reasonable assumption as we expect our generated pieces to contain similar patterns of harmony, rhythms, and style.", "Yet, our problem here is quite different from a translation one. We are not comparing one given translation with only a limited number of ways to express it. We are generating completely new sequences of music based on a couple of notes, involving other components as creativity and consistency.", "This has several consequences. First, small ngrams are less informative. Indeed, as we are using a large set of compositions in our reference document, we expect the 1-gram value to be one (we are not going to use a new note in our composition) and 2-grams and 3-grams quite close to one too. As a result, the information about those ngrams is low. In addition, we would love our generated compositions to have some sort of originality. We do not want to recreate or regurgitate existing sequences from the training data, but really creating something new and unique that was inspired by existing music \u2014 just as an artist would do. Consequently, high n-grams should also be less valued and very high n-grams not considered.", "Based on all of those considerations, we constructed a customized BLEU score. The chosen weights are:", "We used the BLEU score to compare our LSTM baseline model with some real compositions of Mozart. The results \u2014 averaged on a dozen of sequences \u2014 are 0.25 for the LSTM and 0.14 for the real data. This means that our generated samples are good on our customized metrics. The higher score that LSTM compositions yield over real compositions underlines the presence of overfitting where the generated music contains substantial repetitions from the original data.", "For GPT, we faced a different challenge. Our version of the GPT struggled to learn long term patterns and, as a result, scores very low on high ngrams (6 and more). This highlights that our new compositions are probably more originals, but also less faithful to the music rules and therefore show less structure and less general harmony.", "Consequently, to compare our GPT with the baseline model and real data, we visualized the cumulated ngrams (from two to five). Overall, the GPT scored lower for every cumulated ngrams, strengthening the patterns previously observed.", "The encoding chosen determines the scope and limitations of the model you are creating. Choosing a discrete representation with MIDI file leads to an inevitable loss of information from the original continuous audio file.", "The alternative is to work with sound files directly. This would also enable a better analysis of timber. Recent researches have developed Deep Learning models that transfer the timbre of a training set to an input \ufb01le, while preserving its pitch. [9]", "In addition, to tackle challenges of patterns that repeat themselves through time, but in an extended or compressed version, it is necessary to look at music sheets horizontally as well as vertically \u2014 to better account for repeated patterns and structure of the music sheet.", "See how those Machine Learning models can be used to create a new experience for artists with the Fruit Genie project developed by the Magenta team and The Flaming Lips:", "[1] Cheng-Zhi, Anna Huang, Ashish Vaswani, Jakob Uszkoreit, Noam Shazeer, Ian Simon, Curtis Hawthorne, Andrew M.Dai, Matthew D.Hoffman, Monica Dinculescu, Douglas Eck.
