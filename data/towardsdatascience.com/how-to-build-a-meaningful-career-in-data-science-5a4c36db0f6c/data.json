Perhaps you were drawn toward the career because you love math, programming, and everything technical. But I\u2019m willing to bet many of you were also interested in using data to make a real impact.", "At the end of a long day of tweaking data and building machine learning models, you\u2019re the ones who want to say, \u201cToday I created something that will positively influence somebody\u2019s life.\u201d In other words, you want to see your work unfolding in the real world.", "At Omdena, we provide a collaborative learning environment where junior talent and experienced mentors work together on real-world AI challenges. Our mission is to bridge theoretical education with hands-on practice that enables individuals around the world to work on some of the grandest challenges facing the human race.", "Here are three inspiring stories from our Post-Traumatic-Stress-Disorder (PTSD) challenge", "Albert, Kulsoom, and Anam all received two months of free access to all DataCamp courses due to their exemplary performance and community spirit. For two months they collaborated with 32 AI enthusiasts in our PTSD AI challenge to build an intelligent chatbot to help diagnose PTSD for individuals in low-resource settings who faced horrendous situations, e.g. in war and refugee zones.", "At 17, Albert is our youngest collaborator, but his enthusiasm and eagerness to do good with data was an inspiration to the other 32 collaborators in our AI challenge. In his own words, here\u2019s what he thought of the experience.", "My definition of a meaningful career in DS is using one\u2019s knowledge and skillset to change the world for the better. Data science is an extremely powerful tool and using it for good is incredibly important. Like anything, it can be wielded for either benevolent or malicious purposes.", "Utilizing DS to solve problems like fighting climate change, improving agriculture yields, and detecting DeepFakes is what it really means to make a meaningful impact.", "Before joining the Omdena PTSD challenge, learning AI felt like just taking a bunch of courses, watching videos, reading papers, and programming models. Once the challenge began, I realized that I was missing one important aspect: the community. Being in a community of data science practitioners is so important for getting help, being motivated, and learning the skills of teamwork and collaboration!", "This challenge really taught me how to work well in a team. In the past, I mostly worked on my machine learning projects individually. In this PTSD challenge, being able to collaborate with my teammates around the world was crucial to align the different tasks. I can carry this experience into my future career.", "Kulsoom Abdullah became the first female weightlifter representing Pakistan when she competed at the 2011 World Championships.", "I would say the lesson I learned is, I underestimated what I am capable of. Most likely we all underestimate what we are capable of.", "The imposter syndrome \u2014 feeling like a failure and that I don\u2019t deserve my success!", "In college, I had to learn and realize that it was not my fault but due to my environment. I also identified and dealt with microaggressions and blatant behaviors. I overcame it by seeking positive spaces such as trusted family, friends, mentors, and by taking care of myself. \u201cFake it till you make it\u201d by taking risks, embracing my fears.", "\u201cI have nothing to lose\u201d helped me with presenting my case to the media about my weightlifting competition challenges and academics/work.", "It is still a work in progress. I hope I can continue to progress and help others not deal with what I had to.", "Fear and doubts are temporary, just keep going and enjoy the journey.", "When Anam joined our PTSD AI challenge, she had little AI experience but a long personal history of struggling with PTSD. She joined our AI Challenge and progressed to the role of junior machine learning engineer.", "Knowing what it is like to live with PTSD first hand made this the perfect challenge for me. Being a part of it was bigger than one\u2019s own gains like learning ML or increasing their experience in it. It meant helping people out there who face many obstacles in their life due to PTSD. If it meant that I\u2019d be able to play even a small part in such a big cause, I was more than ready to be a part of this challenge.", "Usually, as students at a university, we are given problems with defined solutions and a set scope. Working on this challenge with Omdena was completely different. It helped me understand how our knowledge can be used to solve real-world issues and make a difference. It also taught me that problems of such a large scale and real impact requires a different approach compared to what we\u2019re used to. An amazing experience!", "Your home for data science.
