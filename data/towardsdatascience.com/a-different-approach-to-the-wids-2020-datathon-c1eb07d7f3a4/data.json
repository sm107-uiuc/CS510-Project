Stemming from an EMT course I took a few years ago, I wondered if, rather than just declaring if a patient will survive or not, we could use the probability of survival to triage patients in the ICU accordingly.", "The first step in the problem was to identify triage levels and determine metrics for assigning tags. For this, I leveraged the triage hierarchy presented on medicinenet and determined the following schema.", "In order to determine the chance of survival, I the probability of predicting the class \u2018survived\u2019 in a classification model. Although the Kaggle competition evaluated models based on AUC score, I deviated again here, choosing instead to optimize towards recall. When flagging patients in the ICU, I felt it was most important to capture all potential high-risk patients and I was comfortable sacrificing some precision. That said, I did ensure that AUC did not significantly drop as I tuned. Once I was satisfied with the model, I assigned triage tags using a threshold adjustment that identified patients with probabilities of surviving that mirror the schema above.", "With the goal of creating a simple model so that it could be efficiently deployed in a fast-paced hospital setting, I engineered the model from the bottom up. As shown below, using the data dictionary, I split the larger dataset into multiple tables based on the category that the columns fell into.", "From there, I assessed which features had significant variations between the group that survived and the group that did not survive and where there was opportunity to amplify signal through feature engineering. As I selected features from each category, I tested adding them to two different models, logistic regression and random forest and observed the impact.", "With a complete feature set, I tuned both models towards recall. With fivefold cross-validation, I that the random forest outperformed both the logistic regression and the variation of ensembles I tested. The final code can be found here.", "To demonstrate the power of asking the data how we can triage patients rather than predicting survival, I created a simple Tableau dashboard that shows doctors and hospital administrators where the high-risk patients are in the ICU so they can plan and resource accordingly. Below is a brief demonstration of the tool.", "Unfortunately, the best feature set for this model included many variables that require overhead for the physician and patient. Not only do these features require time, money, and physical endurance to generate for each patient but the manual process of inputting the results would hinder this tool\u2019s ability to provide real-time benefits. As this is just a demonstration of the concept, the real goal would be to build a model that automatically pulls in data from medical tests as they are conducted and assists the physician in the triage process in real time.", "I hope you enjoyed this different take on WiDS Datathon challenge.
