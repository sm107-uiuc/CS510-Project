A classifier with high accuracy tells you the overall performance of a model, but less so on a more localized level of the individual class it predicts.", "What does that even mean? Or rather why accuracy alone is inadequate to evaluate the performance of a classifier? What other classification metrics out there can you use? In this article, we will explain how accuracy measures the classification results and what other metrics you can use to better gauge the performance of a classifier. Explanations will be accompanied by some snippets in Python for practical use.", "Accuracy is the number of correctly predicted data points out of all the data points. More formally, it is defined as the number of true positives and true negatives divided by the number of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. [1]", "In a typical classification model, there might be a class that is of more interest than the other. For example, in a binomial classification problem, the positive class (the customer who will buy a product) normally weighs more than the negative class (the customer who will not buy a product), because you wanna make sure your marketing campaign reach the former group of customers so that they will indeed buy in the end. In this scenario, the real-world data collected to train and test the model is very often imbalanced, that means the class of interest constitutes just a small portion of the entire dataset (persons who actually buy are normally less than those who do not buy).", "Accuracy measures the entire dataset with no direct regard to the imbalanced distribution and can create an \u201cover-optimistic\u201d interpretation of the classification results. For example, in a two-class problem with a class distribution of 90:10, the accuracy on majority-class examples will count nine times as much as the performance on minority-class examples. In other words, even if the classifier correctly predicts all the majority-class but wrongly for all the minority-class, you will still get a 90% accuracy!", "A confusion matrix is a specific table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm, with two dimensions (\u201cactual\u201d and \u201cpredicted\u201d), and identical sets of \u201cclasses\u201d in both dimensions. [2]", "A true positive is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the positive class. Similarly, a true negative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class. [3]", "Naturally, we would like a classifier to maximize its ability to correctly predict test data that would fall into these two quadrants (green zones) in a confusion matrix, i.e. when the model can correctly predict both the positive and negative classes.", "Now let\u2019s visualize accuracy again with a confusion matrix, and you will quickly realise why accuracy is not the best evaluation metrics in binary classification, more so when the data are imbalanced.", "As illustrated, the classifier did not correctly predict any of the positive class but still has an 80% accuracy!", "As seen in a confusion matrix, each component represents a different scenario and can be interpreted differently to derive metrics other than accuracy. The most common ones are Precision, Recall, and F1-score. You probably know the literal meaning of these terms but how are they different in evaluating classification performance?", "Precision \u2014 is used to measure the positive patterns that are correctly predicted from the total predicted patterns in a positive class.[4]", "Recall \u2014also known as Sensitivity, is used to measure the fraction of positive patterns that are correctly classified. [4 ] For negative class, it is known as Specificity.", "F1-score \u2014 this metric represents the harmonic mean between Recall and Precision values, sometimes also known as F-measure. [4]", "Thus, as seen in the definition, these metrics give us more specifics and information than Accuracy. Precision checks how precise the predictions are; Recall checks how many patterns in a given class are correctly identified; F1-score computes the harmonic average between these two values.", "By using the components in a confusion matrix, the formulae for these metrics are defined as in the following illustration.", "Luckily the well-known Machine Learning imbalanced-learn package has a Metrics module which is equipped with methods for confusion matrix, so we just need to apply this method to our classification results.", "For demonstration purposes, the dataset used in this tutorial is randomly generated using make_classification. The data is split into 70:30 ratio for training and test set while the classifier used is Random Forest. The complete Python codes written in Colaboratory are hosted on the Github repository.", "Below is a \u201cone-pager\u201d snapshot of the codes:", "The overall accuracy for this classifier is 83%, which is a pretty good value. Well, that\u2019s only half of the picture. If we look at the minority positive class 1 in the classification report, the precision rate is 72% (12% less than the majority negative class 0) and the recall rate is only 29% (while 97% for the majority negative class 0)! That means the classifier performs relatively well for class 0 but not for class 1. This is understandable as the data are imbalanced (as in many real-life applications), thus the classifier gets to train more on samples found in the majority-class but less so on the minority-class.", "Accuracy is pretty much still the de facto metric many people would use to get the first impression of a classifier performance. Again, the emphasis here is on the \u201cfirst impression\u201d without in-depth knowledge of the data distribution as well as the classifier use case. Putting imbalanced data aside, accuracy can be a good indicator if both (or more) predicted classes are equally or similarly important. For example, a classifier that is built for image recognition. If the possible class is either dog or cat, you would like the classifier to correctly identify both dogs and cats given a set of images. Unlike other common applications in marketing (to predict potential customers) or stock market (to predict bull or bear markets), the accuracy for the positive class is more preferred. In this case, accuracy should be interpreted cautiously. As demonstrated, precision, recall and F1-score can be used as alternatives to better understand the classifier performance beyond accuracy.", "Graphical metrics like Precision-Recall and ROC Curves are other advanced metrics derived using precision and recall rate. Lift curve is also another popular visualisation used to evaluate a classifier using cumulative gains of the positive class correctly captured. We will explore these graph-based metrics in the following article.", "*Disclaimer: Due to the stochastic nature of the random data generation and train-test split, you might not get the exact output as shown.", "[1] Accuracy in Machine Learning, DeepAI", "[4] A Review On Evaluation Metrics For Data Classification Evaluations, International Journal of Data Mining & Knowledge Management Process", "Your home for data science.
