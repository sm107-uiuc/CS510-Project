Check out my video on the topic:", "We\u2019ll use Oracle Cloud for this article. It\u2019s free, so please register and create an instance of the OLTP database (Version 19c, has 0.2TB of storage). Once done, establish a connection through the SQL Developer Web \u2014 or any other tool.", "As for the dataset, we\u2019ll use a Telco industry churn dataset, available for download here. I\u2019ve chosen this dataset because it has many features and doesn\u2019t require any manual preparation.", "The article is structured as follows:", "Feature importance is a technique that assigns a score to the input features (attributes) based on how useful they are for prediction (for predicting the target variable).", "The concept is essential for predictive modeling because you want to keep only the important features and discard others. By doing so, you reduce both the dimensionality and the noise. It can also lead you to a better understanding of your data, for obvious reasons.", "Further, calculating feature importance can provide insights into the workings of a predictive model. By knowing the importance scores, you can immediately tell what the model thinks is the most important, and why it makes predictions the way it does.", "Additionally, it\u2019s always good to have a quantitative confirmation, and not work on pure assumptions.", "If you are following along, you should have the dataset downloaded. You\u2019ll have to load it into the database with a tool of your choice \u2014 I\u2019m using the SQL Developer Web, but you can use pretty much anything.", "The loading process is straightforward \u2014 click on the Upload button, choose the dataset, and click Next a couple of times:", "Mine is stored in the churn table. Let\u2019s take a look at what\u2019s inside by executing a SELECT * FROM churn statement:", "You can now proceed with the feature importance calculation.", "As promised, this will take only a couple of lines of code. The feature importance is obtained through the EXPLAIN procedure of the DBMS_PREDICTIVE_ANALYTICS package. It expects three parameters:", "Here\u2019s how to implement it in code:", "And that\u2019s it! You can now take a look at importances with a simple SELECT statement. The one below orders the features, so the most important ones are displayed first:", "From the previous image, you can immediately tell what is and what isn\u2019t important. The next step would be to use this information for a predictive model. That\u2019s a bit out of this article\u2019s scope, but you\u2019d want to proceed with the classification modeling.", "As it turns out, this can also be performed only with SQL! Here\u2019s how.", "I think you didn\u2019t expect that feature importance calculation with SQL was this easy. But it is, just like the rest of in-database machine learning. SQL still isn\u2019t a language for machine learning, but we can say that the future looks promising with these recent advancements.", "Don\u2019t miss out on the rest of machine learning with SQL series:", "Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comment section below.", "Loved the article?
