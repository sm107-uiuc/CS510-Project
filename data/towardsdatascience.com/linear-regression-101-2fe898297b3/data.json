You see that the children in the school have all come with their parents and are seated in a huge hall.", "As the children get up along with their parents you notice something peculiar. The heights of the children are directly related to that of their parents.i.e. if the parent of the child is tall, the child is tall and if the parent is short then the child is short as well.", "You decide to dig deeper into this and start by collecting some data regarding the heights of the father and the child.", "You now start to think about what would be the best way to visualize this data in a graph.", "You start by plotting a scatter plot to understand the relationship between these two sets of heights with the child\u2019s height on the Y-axis and fathers height on the X-axis", "After plotting this you can visually see that there is a definite relationship between the father\u2019s height and that of the child.", "As the father\u2019s height increases so does the child\u2019s.", "Next, we \u2018ll try and fit a line through the scatter plot so that distance between the points and the line is minimized. This distance between the line and each point is known as the error.", "You now think of how to express this line in the form of an equation. We can write an equation like so.", "Child\u2019s height = constant + slope of the line * (Father\u2019s height) + error term", "This above equation is known as the simple linear regression equation.", "We can get the value of the constant by extending the line and see where it intersects the Y-axis.", "The constant term and the slope of the line are also known as the parameters of this equation and are referred to as \u03b20 and \u03b21.", "So we can write the above equation as", "where y is the child\u2019s height, x is the father\u2019s height, \u03b20 is the constant, \u03b21 is the slope and e is the error term.", "Using this if you have enough data regarding father\u2019s height and child\u2019s height (training data), we can create a simple linear model that can be used to predict the height of the child if we know the father\u2019s height.", "An important part of any modeling activity is how you interpret the model parameters.", "We can interpret this model as follows.", "\u03b21 \u2014 This parameter tells us how much the child\u2019s height will increase if we increase the father\u2019s height by 1 unit and vice versa.", "\u03b20 \u2014 This can be interpreted as the height of the child when the father\u2019s height is zero which can not happen in a real-world scenario as the father\u2019s height will never be zero.", "Simple Linear regression though a very naive model, as it assumes only linear relationship, is still very important as it helps us understand the relationship between the dependent variable and the independent variable.", "We can now also build upon this model by adding more features such as the mother\u2019s height, the gender of the child, etc.", "This model with multiple independent features added is known as multiple linear regression which I will discuss in a future post.", "Your home for data science.
