Farmers play an obviously important role in feeding the country. Helping such farmers improve their methods (through precision agriculture, farmer helplines, chatbots, etc) has been an aim of development projects and an important part of the fight against global hunger.

The ideal scenario would be to have corpora and tools available in as good quality as they are for English to support work in these areas.", "By the way, AI (natural language processing) is increasingly being used for creative tasks like storytelling. There are already AI story generators which generate convincing storylines in English.
