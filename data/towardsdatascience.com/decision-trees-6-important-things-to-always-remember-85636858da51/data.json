Decision Trees are also the fundamental components of Random Forest, which are among the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today.", "Below you will find a basic implementation of a decision tree(how to train the model and visualize its splits) this is done using the famous IRIS dataset.", "Scikit-Learn uses CART (Classification and Regression Tree) to train the decision tree, the latter produces only binary trees: non-leaf nodes always have two children.", "The idea is that the Decision tree splits the training set in two subsets using a single feature k and a threshold tk (e.g X[0]<5.45).", "How does it select k and tk?", "it does it by looking for the best pair of(k,tk) that produces the purest subset(weighted by their size).", "The cost function that the CART algorithm tries to minimize is:", "However other algorithms such as ID3 can produce decision trees with nodes that have more than two children (Quinlan 1986)", "\u201cBefore gong forward a quick story to cool off the air, it is quite getting math-heavy. I was taught about this famous algorithm (ID3) from a professor who had been taught by the person who discovered the algorithm itself , it was fascionating for me\ud83d\ude0a\u201d", "Predictions are very fast, even when dealing with larger training sets, this is because decision tree requires traversing the whole tree from the root to a leaf, since they are generally balanced, traversing them requires going through approximately:", "Considering one of the many qualities of decision trees and its families, they require very little data preparation, they don\u2019t require feature scaling at all.", "However is quite important to note the difference.", "Most of the times it does not make a big difference, they often lead to similar trees. However, the main differences are:", "By default in Scikit-learn, the model is set with Gini impurity.", "A few assumptions are made about the training data: it assumes the data is non-linear. In most of the cases, if the decision tree is left unconstrained, the tree structure will fit very closely to the dataset, overfitting the data, not being able to generalize well to the test data.", "Being a non-parametric model, it does have a lot of parameters though. But because the numbers of parameters are not determined prior to the training, the model is free to stick to the training data. To avoid overfitting the training data, we need to restrict the decision tree degree\u2019s of freedom during the training process (regularization).", "This can be done restricting the number of the maximum depth of the Decision Tree, specifically in Scikit-learn is done by setting the max_depth hyperparameter(the default is set to none: Unlimited) reducing the latter will regularize the model and reduce the risk of overfitting", "As we can see in the above picture, having a max_depth of 5, produces a model with high variance, while limiting the max depth of the decision tree plays a key role in reducing the overfitting of the model. certainly reducing it to two has a huge impact on better regularizing the model.", "Moreover, Decision Trees love making orthogonal boundaries(all split are perpendicular to an axis)as shown in the figure above, this makes them very sensitive to small variations in the training data as well as making the model very unstable. One way to prevent this is to adopt Random forest, the latter can limit this instability by averaging over many trees, This model will be analysed in a future post in detail.", "Hope this brief ML story was informative!
