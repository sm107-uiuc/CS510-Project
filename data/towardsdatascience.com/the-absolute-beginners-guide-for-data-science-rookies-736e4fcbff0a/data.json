After some investigation you end up seeing flamboyant quotes like \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d or \u201cAI is the new electricity\u201d, and start to understand why Data Science is so sexy, right now learning about it seems like the only reasonable choice.", "Luckily for you, there\u2019s no need of a fancy degree to become a data scientist, you can learn anything from the comfort of your home. Furthermore the 21st century has established online learning as a reliable way to acquire expertise in a wide variety of topics. Finally, Data Science is so trending right now that there are infinite and ever-growing sources to learn it, which flips the tortilla the other way round. Having all this possibilities, which one should I choose? Well my friend I hope my experience in the last couple of months can help you clear your doubts. Let\u2019s start, shall we?", "A data scientist is the player that can start the play from its own goal, dribble a couple of defenders, make a precise cross to the penalty mark and head the ball inside the net for a gorgeous goal. Sorry for the football reference, can\u2019t help it, just wanted to picture how you\u2019ll master a diverse set of skills that\u2019ll make you very useful in almost any data-related problem.", "Now, I\u2019ll divide this requirements under 2 approaches. First, from a technical point of view we\u2019ll review the foundations, that means the fields of science data science relies on from one way or another. Second, from a more practical point of view I\u2019ll show you which programming libraries you should focus in order to put your hands on real data projects.", "As you\u2019ll discover after some time coding on your own, every programming language counts with a series of packages or libraries that provide different functions and methods to perform diverse tasks with more ease.", "Here you\u2019ll find a table with the most popular and useful libraries for Data Science in Python with some brief guidelines below. In case you\u2019ve gone the R way, don\u2019t worry, I\u2019ll also leave you a very good article with a similar table for R libraries here.", "The Starter Kit is all you need to start doing data science, Numpy provides the base for working with data but you\u2019ll handle it more easily with Pandas. Scipy provides some fancy functions and methods to perform advanced calculations on top of the Numpy framework, and Matplotlib will allow you to plot your findings visually. Finally Scikit-learn is the starting point for machine learning, it contains everything you need to apply all classical regression, classification and clustering methods.", "On the other hand, Deep Learning frameworks will help you build artificial neural networks to perform more complex machine learning tasks like image recognition. Then there are other Data Visualization alternatives which allow to create more stylized and interactive plots even on web applications. Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a very popular field within data science which for example allows Alexa or Siri understand what you\u2019re saying. When looking for data to do your analysis the Internet is an unlimited source for that purpose, so Web Scraping tools will come in handy to collect and retrieve this data on a frequent basis. Last but not least, Statsmodels (statistical analysis) and XGBoost (gradient boosting) will help you in some more specific tasks.", "So far we\u2019ve talked about working with data, but what type of data? Well it can range from very pretty, clean and structured csv files to gigantic datasets with millions of examples of very unstructured data, yes buddy, we\u2019re not in Kansas anymore.", "Depending on where you end up working, your company might handle data on different ways but most certainly they\u2019ll handle very large data sets, so this two tools coming up next are a definitive must for every data scientist.", "Bootcamps are the easiest pick when it comes to learn Data Science, they are an all-in-one bundle of several modules that give you knowledge in almost everything you should know to do data analysis. People may argue the depth with which these topics are covered, but truth be told they excel at giving a good introduction and intermediate level of expertise in data-related subjects, more advanced levels will for sure come when yous start doing your own projects or working, so don\u2019t worry.", "Now, there seem to be many options, but the two most popular and really online bootcamps are Dataquest and Datacamp, which have created a strong debate upon which one is better, I personally don\u2019t think it\u2019s that easy, but I\u2019ll try to show at what they\u2019re better or worse and their main differences so you can make your choice easier. Also you can check this interesting Reddit thread.", "To summarize. Datacamp maybe is more established than DQ and has a wider offer of courses, allowing you to deepen in other subjects besides the core knowledge for Data Science. Dataquest on the other hand is more focused on building some strong data science foundations based on practicing with very demanding exercises and projects.", "As I said at the beginning, online learning is at its peak, with more students enrolling to expand their knowledge, with more than 100 million students worldwide and about 11.4k courses available, MOOCs are kings. Now, where\u2019s the magic? They offer self paced courses, normally free to audit, in an extensive list of topics and subjects. If you want to learn you can dedicate 1\u20132 hours daily and advance whenever you can, never education was so within reach for everyone.", "Below you\u2019ll find a very brief comparison graph of the top 4 (imo) MOOC platforms for Data Science. If you want to dig deeper on the differences, pros and cons of each one of them, I\u2019d recommend you to read this post where they perform a very detailed analysis comparing them in terms of several factors. Later I also explain in more detail which platform fits you better depending on what you\u2019re looking for.", "Of course these are my personal choices, although most people will agree with almost all of them I encourage you to have other opinions and research more, this post from Class Central is a very good start.", "The good old books! Though they actually never get old they can be a very valuable resource to support your learning if you pick wisely. In terms of Data Science books they normally come in 2 \u201cformats\u201d: plain theory or code-oriented, though you\u2019ll also find a mix of both sometimes. Also, at this point you should know already what programming language suits you better because the authors of books have already made up their minds, and books will be written using only one language.", "We\u2019ve come a long way already, learning what and where to learn everything you need to become a data scientist, but what do you do now? I\u2019ll show you how to put your skills in practice the right way so you\u2019re tuned with the data science community.", "I strongly believe a good professional is always learning, in a world as dynamic as ours you can become obsolete in no time, and that\u2019s where the power of learning resides, being able to keep up to date and reinvent yourself will not only help you grow as a pro but also as a person.", "Finally, learning is a very personal process, there isn\u2019t (yet) a magic formula that works for all and even though throughout this post I\u2019ve tried to present multiple choices in the form of suggestions, the final call is up to you, just make sure you enjoy the ride \ud83c\udfc4", "Your home for data science.
