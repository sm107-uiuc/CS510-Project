While there aren\u2019t any videos yet, I\u2019ll be sharing lots of amazing content like this but in video form. Thanks for your support :)", "In my previous article, I explained what regression was and showed how it could be used in application. This week, I\u2019m going to go over the majority of common machine learning models used in practice, so that I can spend more time building and improving models rather than explaining the theory behind it. Let\u2019s dive into it.", "All machine learning models are categorized as either supervised or unsupervised. If the model is a supervised model, it\u2019s then sub-categorized as either a regression or classification model. We\u2019ll go over what these terms mean and the corresponding models that fall into each category below.", "Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs [1].", "For example, if I had a dataset with two variables, age (input) and height (output), I could implement a supervised learning model to predict the height of a person based on their age.", "To re-iterate, within supervised learning, there are two sub-categories: regression and classification.", "In regression models, the output is continuous. Below are some of the most common types of regression models.", "The idea of linear regression is simply finding a line that best fits the data. Extensions of linear regression include multiple linear regression (eg. finding a plane of best fit) and polynomial regression (eg. finding a curve of best fit). You can learn more about linear regression in my previous article.", "Decision trees are a popular model, used in operations research, strategic planning, and machine learning. Each square above is called a node, and the more nodes you have, the more accurate your decision tree will be (generally). The last nodes of the decision tree, where a decision is made, are called the leaves of the tree. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to build but fall short when it comes to accuracy.", "Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. What\u2019s the point of this? By relying on a \u201cmajority wins\u201d model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.", "For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests.", "StatQuest does an amazing job walking through this in greater detail. See here.", "A neural network is a multi-layered model inspired by the human brain. Like the neurons in our brain, the circles above represent a node. The blue circles represent the input layer, the black circles represent the hidden layers, and the green circles represent the output layer. Each node in the hidden layers represents a function that the inputs go through, ultimately leading to an output in the green circles.", "Neural networks are actually very complex and very mathematical, so I won\u2019t get into the details of it but\u2026", "Tony Yiu\u2019s article gives an intuitive explanation of the process behind neural networks (see here).", "If you want to take it a step further and understand the math behind neural networks, check out this free online book here.", "If you\u2019re a visual/audio learner, 3Blue1Brown has an amazing series on neural networks and deep learning on YouTube here.", "In classification models, the output is discrete. Below are some of the most common types of classification models.", "Logistic regression is similar to linear regression but is used to model the probability of a finite number of outcomes, typically two. There are a number of reasons why logistic regression is used over linear regression when modeling probabilities of outcomes (see here). In essence, a logistic equation is created in such a way that the output values can only be between 0 and 1 (see below).", "A Support Vector Machine is a supervised classification technique that can actually get pretty complicated but is pretty intuitive at the most fundamental level.", "Let\u2019s assume that there are two classes of data. A support vector machine will find a hyperplane or a boundary between the two classes of data that maximizes the margin between the two classes (see below). There are many planes that can separate the two classes, but only one plane can maximize the margin or distance between the classes.", "If you want to get into greater detail, Savan wrote a great article on Support Vector Machines here.", "Naive Bayes is another popular classifier used in Data Science. The idea behind it is driven by Bayes Theorem:", "While there are a number of unrealistic assumptions made in regards to Naive Bayes (hence why it\u2019s called \u2018Naive\u2019), it has proven to perform quite most of the time and it is also relatively fast to build.", "See here if you want to learn more about them.", "These models follow the same logic as previously explained. The only difference is that that output is discrete rather than continuous.", "Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes. Two main methods used in unsupervised learning include clustering and dimensionality reduction.", "Clustering is an unsupervised technique that involves the grouping, or clustering, of data points. It\u2019s frequently used for customer segmentation, fraud detection, and document classification.", "Common clustering techniques include k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, mean shift clustering, and density-based clustering. While each technique has a different method in finding clusters, they all aim to achieve the same thing.", "Dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables [2]. In simpler terms, its the process of reducing the dimension of your feature set (in even simpler terms, reducing the number of features). Most dimensionality reduction techniques can be categorized as either feature elimination or feature extraction.", "A popular method of dimensionality reduction is called principal component analysis.", "In the simplest sense, PCA involves project higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions). This results in a lower dimension of data, (2 dimensions instead of 3 dimensions) while keeping all original variables in the model.", "There is quite a bit of math involved with this. If you want to learn more about it\u2026", "Check out this awesome article on PCA here.", "If you\u2019d rather watch a video, StatQuest explains PCA in 5 minutes here.", "Obviously, there is a ton of complexity if you dive into any particular model, but this should give you a fundamental understanding of how each machine learning algorithm works!", "Check out this link if you want to learn all basic statistics for data science.", "Check out this link if you want to learn a step by step process for exploratory data analysis (EDA).", "[1] Stuart J.
