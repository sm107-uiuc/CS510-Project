However, the possibilities offered by AI are not reserved only for the largest companies and biggest economies.", "Estonia is looking for ways how to attract international talent and investments; and on the other hand, its small size with limited resources requires the public administration and government to work efficiently. No wonder that in Estonia, both government and companies have noticed the potential of AI technologies to solve these current demographic and economic challenges, as the impact of AI on GDP in the Nordics alone is expected to be considerable: 9.9% of GDP (1.8 trillion).", "Where does Estonia stand today in terms of AI readiness?", "There is a large spread of AI readiness in Europe, but even the most advanced countries are lagging behind the US AI frontier. Yet, Europe\u2019s ability to capture the full potential of AI varies significantly among countries. According to the mapping of Europe\u2019s AI ecosystem four countries stand out as dominant players in driving Europe\u2019s AI ecosystem \u2014 UK, France, Germany and Spain \u2014 and are known to have most vibrant and mature AI landscapes in Europe.", "According to study by Roland Berger and France Digitale, Estonia has excellent prerequisites for benefiting from the application of artificial intelligence and is becoming influential AI player in Europe.", "Whereas EU leaders of AI application are home to 67% of AI startups, Estonia with other Nordic and Baltic countries shows density dynamism i.e high number of startups per population size.", "Compared to dominant players and other governments working on their AI strategies, Estonia sees its strength as an AI implementation leader for startups and AI applications.", "For example by 2020 Estonian government has launched 50 different AI applications in public services and the country\u2019s most well-known scaleups (Taxify, TransferWise, Pipedrive) as well as early stage AI-powered startups (Sixfold, AlphaBlues, Feelingstream) have turned to data and machine learning to maximise their product delivery.", "At the same time Estonia doesn\u2019t let the AI frenzy and need to speedy implementation of AI compromise data privacy and safety. Estonia plans to keep AI applications safe for its people and for the protection of private data. Estonia wishes to be the place where AI applications are developed in accordance with privacy and safety requirements.", "In his book AI Superpowers technologist Kai-Fu Lee argues that \u201cMuch of the difficult but abstract work of AI research has been done, and it\u2019s now time for entrepreneurs to roll up their sleeves and get down to the dirty work of turning algorithms into sustainable businesses.\u201d", "Which Estonian companies are riding on the implementation wave right now?", "But first you might ask, what makes a startup into an \u201cAI startup\u201d.

There are over 3200 different document types issued in the world, which makes automation of a product a real challenge.", "A verification\u2019s journey goes through several steps. Each step in this journey needs to be done automatically for the best customer experience and lowest cost, though without sacrificing quality. The Machine Learning team at Veriff does just that: makes decisions automatically when they can be, and delegates to human eyes when a more thorough examination is needed.", "Estonian Norris Koppel launched neo-banking company Monese, one of the most popular and trusted banking services in the UK and Europe, as Britain\u2019s first mobile-only bank in 2015. Rather than targeting millennials or early adopters, as Monzo and Starling Bank later would, Monese did things differently. Monese lets migrants (or anyone) open a UK bank account in a matter of moments without needing a UK address, something no major high street bank would do at the time.", "The main focus of AI in Monese is safety. As a responsible company, Monese wants to protect their customers against financial fraud and minimize the risk of illegal transactions. In order to do that accurately, they\u2019ve built intelligent computer systems that analyze customers\u2019 profile data, transaction sequences, and social connections. Using AI to detect fraudulent transactions has had a great positive impact to their business.", "Besides safety Monese also uses AI to automatically analyze document scans during customer on-boarding process. First, the quality of the scan is evaluated, then the original image is enhanced, and lastly, the important text fields are read from the scanned document. In the future, we plan to develop our own algorithms for matching document pictures with video selfie images in order to detect fake ID-s and fight identity theft.", "Pipedrive is a sales CRM tool that began as a tiny start-up in a garage in Estonia in 2010. Now, the company has expanded globally with over 75,000 customers in over 170 countries.", "Pipedrive uses AI both for its business needs and for the purposes of helping customers to forecast their sales success. Pipedrive established a dedicated AI team for these purposes. For example, they know how likely their potential trial customers will convert to paying customers based on the activities they performed in Pipedrive. Additionally, they have built a churn model that predicts if a customer is about to stop using Pipedrive software. Both models produce actionable insights for sales and marketing teams, allowing them to engage better with customers. For customers Pipedrive is implementing AI based solutions to forecast their sales success and revenue. Since sales is largely based on communication they are working now on utilising AI methods to extract insights and boost the efficiency.", "Lingvist was designed by Estonian nuclear physicist to drastically reduce the amount of time it takes to learn a language.
