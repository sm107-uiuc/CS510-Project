The mathematical derivations might not be as rigorously shown and some equations are stated without proofs. This is done intentionally to keep the document short yet comprehensive enough. For deeper analysis, please refer to Bronstein et al. (2017), Gong (2018), Kipf et al. (2017), Hammond et al. (2011), Shuman et al. (2011) and http://geometricdeeplearning.com/. This is a living document, so please let me know if you find any errors or inconsistency, I will fix them as soon as possible. I am by no means an expert in this field as this note is merely written for my own learning purpose.", "We first start by reviewing the concept of a Laplacian matrix in a graph and its\u2019 eigenvalue decomposition. Next, we define convolution operation in the graph and show that it is equivalent to applying a filter in the spectral domain of the graph, where spectrum here refers to the eigenvalues of the laplacian. We show that spectral convolution, by construction, is similar to applying Laplacian operator to function. Lastly, we show how to approximate the Laplacian filter with the sum of Chebyshev polynomials to reduce the algorithm complexity (as performing the complete eigenvalue decomposition is O(n\u00b2) where n is the number of vertices in the graph.", "Assume we have an undirected, connected and weighted graph G = (V, E, W) where V is a set of |V| = n vertices, E is a set of edges and W is a set of weights W\u1d62\u2c7c for each edge i~j. Define D as the degree matrix where D = diag(\u03a3\u2c7c W\u1d62\u2c7c). The normalized graph laplacian \u0394 can be defined as the following.", "We can perform eigenvalue decomposition to the laplacian matrix \u0394 as the following.", "Motivated by the convolution operation in Fourier Transform, we define graph convolution as applying a filter to the laplacian spectral components. In a nutshell, the idea is to project the input function f to its\u2019 \u201cFourier\u201d basis, or here laplacian eigenvectors by means of \u03a6\u1d40 f. Multiply the basis with filtered eigenvalues \u0125(\u039b), resulting in \u0125(\u039b) \u03a6\u1d40 f. Lastly, apply an \u201cinverse Fourier transform\u201d by dot product with \u03a6, resulting in \u03a6 \u0125(\u039b) \u03a6\u1d40 f.", "After applying some rearrangements, we can see that the right hand side of the equation can be converted to a function of the normalized laplacian matrix \u0394 = \u03a6 \u039b \u03a6\u1d40 from equation 5.", "Now, similar to a convolutional neural network, we would like to apply more than 1 convolutional filters and also add a nonlinear output transformation. Suppose we use p filters with \u03be nonlinear transformation, the spectral convolution network is defined as the following.", "The main problem with equation 12 is that we need to calculate all eigenvectors which is O(|V|\u00b2) in complexity. This is not scalable when we deal with a very large graph with |V|>>. The main idea in ChebNets is to approximate the \u03a6 \u0125(\u039b) \u03a6\u1d40 with a sum of orthonormal Chebyshev polynomials that can be calculated iteratively using the following formula.", "We first approximate the eigenvalue filter with a weighted sum of r Chebyshev polynomials that takes in the transformed eigenvalue matrix \u039b^. This transformation is needed because Chebyshev polynomials form an orthogonal basis only when the input domain interval is in [-1, 1]. Meanwhile, the eigenvalues range from [0, \u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093]. Hence to transform the latter to the former, we can apply 2x/\u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093 -1 such that for x = 0, (2(0)/\u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093-1 = -1) and for x = \u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093, (2\u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093/\u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093 -1 = 1).", "We can now take equation 12 and substitute the filter with its\u2019 Chebyshev polynomials. Note that \u039b^ = 2 \u039b / \u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093 - I and similarly, \u0394^ = 2 \u0394/ \u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093 - I. By means of rearrangement, we can transform the right hand side into a sum of Chebyshev polynomials applied on the normalized laplacian \u0394^.", "GraphConvNets is a special case of ChebNets where we only take 2 Chebyshev polynomial terms r = 2. Since the normalized laplacian \u0394 is used, it has been proven that \u03bb\u2098\u2090\u2093 = 2. We can take equation 21 and substitute the given assumptions.", "We now have a graph convolution network that is defined purely using degree matrix D and weight matrix W. To further simplify, we assume \u03b1\u2080 = -\u03b1\u2081 = \u03b1.", "Although in practice, since the eigenvalues are in range [0, 2], repeated application of this multiplication could result in numerical instabilities. Hence we apply further normalization by letting \u0174 = W + I and D\u0302 = diag(\u03a3{j \u2260i} \u0175\u1d62\u2c7c). As written in Kipf and Welling (2017), this is equivalent to setting the following renormalization trick: I + D^(-1/2) W D^(-1/2) = D\u0302^(-1/2) W D\u0302^(-1/2)", "Using these assumptions, GraphConvNets bypasses the need for explicit calculation of Chebyshev polynomials and results in the pure application of weighted sum operation on each vertex\u2019s neighbors.", "Gong, S.
