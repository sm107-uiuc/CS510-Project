Often I heard from my colleagues: \u201cWe have Big Data, we need to analyze, integrate it and run Machine Learning on it\u201d. By Big Data my colleagues usually mean terabytes and petabytes of disk space occupied by various Omics data: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics etc.", "Indeed, as human genome sequencing becomes relatively cheap (~1000 USD per genome), more and more labs at academic universities across the world can afford acquiring whole-genome information from hundreds and thousands of individuals for answering their research questions. Such public resources as 1000 Genomes Project (~2 500 human genomes), ExAC (~60 000 human exomes), UK10K (~3 500 human genomes so far) and most recent HGDP (900+ rare human genomes) provide massive amount of genetic data which currently far exceeds the Moore\u2019s law.", "Precision Medicine greatly benefits from huge genomics efforts such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (11 000 human tumors across 33 different cancer types) and UK Biobank (~500 000 human individuals).", "So what kind of question is that \u201cDo we have Big Data in Life Sciences?\u201d. There is a temptation to say \u201cYes, certainly, look at the huge genomics efforts. Now we should be able to use the knowledge learnt from genomics data across human populations in order to take a random human DNA and predict whether this person is predisposed to certain deceases, so we should be able to predict the future of this individual and prescribe a treatment adjusted to this particular individual. Isn\u2019t it what Precision Medicine is supposed to do?\u201d.", "However, it turns out that to bring these genomics efforts to the Clinics is not straightforward. Prof. Mark McCarthy from the University of Oxford, one of the world leading experts in genetics of Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), gave a few talks last year with the title", "Now we have found over 400 genetic signals influencing Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), what on earth are we going to do with them?", "This doesn\u2019t sound too optimistic, does it? It basically says that we have a lot of data, we use these data for identifying genes related to common diseases such as T2D, however we are not close to bringing these genes to Clinical Diagnostics for early prediction and prevention of those diseases.", "So what is the problem, why can\u2019t we use these huge genomics efforts in the Clinics? Well, the short answer is it does not work as expected. More specifically, genetic and genomic data do not predict common diseases well enough. A recent evidence of the poor predictive power of genomics data for Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA) was demonstrated by the group of Mike Snyder from Stanford University:", "The ROC curves above compare the power of Genomics vs. Electronic Health Records (EHR) for predicting AAA. EHR represents quite a trivial clinical information such as height, weight, body temperature, blood pressure etc. It turns out that this trivial information is more predictive than the genetic variation on the DNA level, which is very frustrating taking into account the large genetic component in the AAA phenotype implying that DNA information should be predictive, however it is not. This is a typical situation for common diseases such as T2D, schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease etc. which is sometimes referred to as the problem of the Missing Heritability and simply means that genomics Big Data can not predict common diseases.", "There are certainly multiple explanations why genomics has a poor predictive power. One of them is the curse of dimensionality that I already mentioned in my previous post. The curse of dimensionality is the inability to perform meaningful mathematics when the number of features, p, is much greater than the number of samples, n, i.e. in the limit p>>n. Human genome typically contains p ~ 30 - 90 million genetic mutations (single nucleotide polymorphisms), while sequencing more than n~1000 - 10 000 individuals is not feasible economically for majority of academic institutions. Thus genomics research operates in ultra-high-dimensional space, p>>n. To demonstrate that the math indeed blows up in high dimensions, let us consider a simple linear model Y~X, where Y is the phenotype of interest (disease) and X is the matrix of genotypes (genetic variation). The solution of the linear model can be expressed in closed form via the inverse variance-covariance matrix of genotypes as follows:", "Next, the inverse of variance-covariance matrix of genotypes is reciprocal to determinant of the matrix. If we now increase the dimensionality of our space up to the limit p>>n, features (mutations in our case) become correlated (redundant) since we have a limited number of observations, n, and can not resolve their differences in high-dimensions any more. From Linear Algebra we know that determinant of a matrix with correlated rows or columns approaches zero which leads to divergence (singularity) of the inverse variance-covariance matrix of genotypes. The frustrating thing is that you never know how well your features are correlated in high dimensions and therefore how close to singularity you are. In the best case your R or Python libraries will throw a \u201csingularity\u201d error, in the worst case you will get a result/answer which looks real but in fact is completely inflated due to the curse of dimensionality.", "Therefore when my colleagues talk about Big Data in genomics I think about how much statistical power we can extract from this data rather than how much disk space it occupies. Ironically enough, we can generate petabytes of Gaussian noise which is absolutely meaningless to analyze. So I usually argue that with the current setup, p>>n, it is not straightforward to run robust Machine Learning in genomics as amount of data is still a bottleneck.", "Now we finally came to the question in the title of the post: \u201cDo we have Big Data in Life Sciences?\u201d. My answer is yes, but it is not genomics in the current setup concentrated on genetic variation, i.e. with mutations as features and genomes as statistical observations (samples). However, I see three areas in Life Sciences where we do have Big Data and therefore can and should run Machine/Deep Learning, these areas are:", "In my previous post I explained why Single Cell biology is ideally suited for Machine/Deep Learning. Briefly, it is because of large scale data sets (millions of cells) currently being produced in this field. Here, the situation is opposite compared to genomics, we have p~20 000 genes and n~1 000 000 cells, therefore n>>p. Microscopy Imaging does not need to be justified as a Big Data, indeed, automated microscopy drowns in tones of image data. Finally, Genomics can still be seen as a Big Data with one very important note: not individual genomes but short sequences (reads or k-mers) have to be considered as statistical observations. In this way, treating nucleotides as features and short sequences along the genome (aka sliding window approach) as statistical observations we come to the limit n>>p which is perfect for Machine/Deep Learning. To see how it works in practice, please check one of my posts where I demonstrate how to use Deep Learning on Ancient DNA, which is also genomics data, just ancient genomics.", "In this post we have learnt that Genomics data make a lot of promises for Life Sciences, Precision Medicine and Health Care. However, current ways of analyzing Genomics suffer from the curse of dimensionality. This can be avoided via reconsidering what we define as features and samples in Genomics. Single Cell Omics and Microscopy Imaging are two other Big Data directions in Life Sciences which are ready for and should be analyzed by Machine/Deep Learning.", "In the comments below let me know which analytical methods in Life Sciences seem particularly mysterious to you and I will try to address them in this column.
