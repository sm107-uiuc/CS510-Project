Detailed report, code and results can be found on Github and are linked towards the end of the post.", "Picking a city, when it comes to London and Paris is always a hard decision as both these cities are truly global, multicultural, and cosmopolitan cities found at the heart of two European nations. Along with being two of Europe\u2019s most important diplomatic centres, they are major centres for finance, commerce, sciences, fashion, arts, culture and gastronomy. Both London (capital of the United Kingdom) and Paris (capital of France) have a rich history and are two of the most visited and sought-after cities in Europe. London is the largest city within the UK and stands on River Thames in South East England. Paris, on the other hand, is located in the north-central part of the nation. Similar to London, the city also stands along a river, commonly known as the Seine River.", "Our goal is to perform a comparison of the two cities to see how similar or dissimilar they are. Such techniques allow users to identify similar neighbourhoods among cities based on amenities or services being offered locally, and thus can help in understanding the local area activities, what are the hubs of different activities, how citizens are experiencing the city, and how they are utilising its resources.", "What kind of clientele would benefit from such an analysis?", "To solve the problem at hand, data extraction was done as follows:", "Web scraping: City data was extracted from the respective Wikipedia pages [1][2] using the Requests and BeautifulSoup libraries.", "Further data cleaning was performed on the extracted data in order to store relevant information about its neighbourhoods, their corresponding coordinates, area and population, and the corresponding borough numbers.", "After the necessary data cleaning, we get the following data frames for our study:", "Foursquare location data: Foursquare is a social location service that allows users to explore the world around them. Foursquare API provides location based experiences with diverse information about venues, users, photos, and check-ins. We took advantage of Foursquare data to extract venue based information for all of the neighbourhoods under study. The call to the API returns a JSON file and we need to turn that into a data-frame. The location data was then used to find the top and unique venues in each of the neighbourhoods. I decided to pick 100 most popular spots in each neighbourhood within a radius of 1 km.", "Wikipedia data provided us with information about the coordinates, area, and population of each borough in the respective cities. One can use this information to visualise a map of the city marking each Borough according to its population density. \u2018Geocoder\u2019 and the \u2018folium map\u2019 libraries were used for data visualisation on leaflet maps, where boroughs were marked according to its population density. The higher the density, the bigger the radius of the marker.", "Foursquare location data gave information about the list of venues within a 1 km radius of each borough. This is a reasonable distance to understand the characteristics of the neighbourhood.", "In total, there were around 219 unique venue categories in London and 180 in Paris. I used this information to visualise the most common venues in some of the central London and central Paris boroughs on a bar chart.", "While the most common venues in central London varied between cafes/coffee shops, pubs, juice bars or hotels, the most common venues in Boroughs in the central or major areas of Paris were mostly French or Italian restaurants along with hotels.", "In order to explore the venue data in a more comprehensive way and further use it for analysis, foursquare venue data was arranged into pandas data frame as follows:", "The information providing the most common venue data per borough was then used to categorise the neighbourhoods into clusters using \u2018k-means\u2019.", "I performed a clustering analysis using the \u2018k-means\u2019 algorithm in order to categorise similar neighbourhoods into clusters based on the similarities provided by the venue categories. To gain some understanding, I decided to do some investigation into the number of clusters (k) to be used as follows:", "Elbow method: I tried to determine the effective number of clusters (k) using the elbow method for London clustering analysis and saw a small kink around k = 6 (although not clear and sharp). The elbow method uses Within-Cluster-Sum of Squared Errors (WSS) for different values of k and one can choose the value of k for which WSS starts to diminish and can be seen as an elbow in the WSS-versus-k plot. However for Paris data, no kink was explicitly seen so I tried to look into the Silhouette score for clustering for each value of k. The silhouette value measures how similar a point is to its own cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). A value of around k = 2 gave the global maximum for the silhouette score. Although one can see from these studies that we do not have clearly clustered data, I decided to categorise London neighbourhoods into 6 set of clusters and Paris neighbourhoods into 2 set of clusters for the purpose of our analysis. It might be useful to look into a more detailed analysis to optimise k in the future for such studies.", "In order to solve the business problem at hand, we considered the 33 boroughs of inner and outer London and 16 districts of inner Paris. Although each of these neighbourhoods might be unique, some of them might be more similar in terms of the kind of amenities they offer. A clustering analysis was performed to find those similar neighbourhoods. One thing to note is that the data extracted from the London Wiki gave information about boroughs in inner and outer London and thus taking the suburban area into account. While the data provided by the Paris Wiki, only gave information about the districts inside inner Paris and not including much information about the large suburbs surrounding Paris where a decent fraction of the population is spread. Thus, the analysis performed in this study would need more information to compare the cities on an equal footing.", "Some of the inferences which were drawn from the explanatory analysis are:", "Further, machine learning analysis of the venue based data revealed most of the boroughs of London can be grouped together into one cluster. The most common venues in such boroughs were always coffee shops, cafes, pubs, hotels or restaurants followed by some kind of clothing, convenience stores or pharmacies. Paris was categorised into two separate clusters in total. Although the most common venue in both the clusters was always a French restaurant, it was followed by a high number of Italian restaurants, hotels, and cafes in the first cluster and variations of other cuisine restaurants, bars, bistros, clothing stores or supermarkets in the second cluster.", "The most common type of venues in either of the cities are mostly restaurants, cafes, hotels, pubs/bars, clothing stores or parks. This in a way highlights that how similar the cities of London and Paris are in terms of services being offered.", "One can further use the venue data to compare the cities is a more comprehensive way where one can also explore different levels of spatial aggregation, namely grids, neighbourhoods, and the city as a whole. The level of spatial aggregation can be an important factor when characterising a city in terms of its venues.", "Some of the questions one can answer with different levels of spatial aggregation could be:", "To summarise, analysing cities using venue based data from Foursquare lead to an overall understanding of the type of venues in each neighbourhood and presented some of the key features of the cities but the level of data is not adequate to provide a comprehensive analysis for a city-to-city comparison. For a potential interested person (job-seeker or person deciding to move to either of the cities) or a bigger clientele like a business corporation or city planners, one would need to do a more detailed analysis adding features such as rents, salaries, transportation, cost of living, growth rate, economy, etc.", "The capstone project provided a medium to understand in depth about how real life data science projects work and what all steps go in building a data science methodology. All steps from understanding the business problem, data understanding to data preparation, and model building were discussed in detail here. Many drawbacks of the current analysis and further ways to improve the analysis were also mentioned. This was an initial attempt to understand and solve the business problem at hand. However, there still exists a huge potential to extend this project in real life scenarios.", "I am a Physicist and have been analysing particle physics data for several years now. I have moved for work between Karlsruhe, Geneva, Sao Paulo, and Chicago in the last few years and currently am residing in Paris. Although such a data analysis would be a stepping stone to design a methodology to compare any of the cities, comparing London and Paris was driven by a personal choice of love for those cities. \u2764", "You can find more about me on Linkedin.", "Links to the project summary and code.", "Your home for data science.
