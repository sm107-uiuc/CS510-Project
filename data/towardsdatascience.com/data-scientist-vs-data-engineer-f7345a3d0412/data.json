When mined correctly, companies enjoy exponential success rates in terms of profit, but also for other things such as risk management, compliance and social services.", "Data Engineers focus on making data available and structured. This involves working with IT on ingesting the data into a data warehouse. Moreover, good data engineers will transform the data into a form that is usable for humans. Therefore, ELTL (Extract-Load-Transform-Load) is the new process pattern in comparison to the traditional ETL.", "Data Scientists focus on applying statistical algorithms to the data. While they have good knowledge to connect to different data warehouses (cloud and on-premise), they are not well versed in upstream data ingestion process. Data scientists are capable when the data is fit for human understanding. Moreover, they are statistics/applied mathematics expert with excellent commercial acumen in making AI models relevant to the business.", "Think of a soccer game. We have famous strikers such as Cristiano Ronaldo or Luis Suarez. However, they cannot win the game without their defenders who defend and pass the ball forward. Think of great names such as Thiago Silva or Sergio Ramos. The strikers need them for support and enablement.", "In my roles, I encounter many data engineers that aspire to be a data scientist. Typically there are 2 categories:", "With regards to the first category, it is a combination of practical experiences and good mentorship. With regards to the second category, I encouraged them to re-evaluate their motive and their talents.", "Data engineers have extremely valuable skillsets and operate within high growth area. I have a good friend who is proud to be a data engineer, working in cloud data enablement, end-to-end data solutions delivery and data ingestion automation. Recent developments in the cloud such as Google Cloud Platform and Cloud data warehouse (e.g. Snowflake) are within the data engineering realm. Moreover, recent developments in the data science enablement such as AWS SageMaker or Azure ML are driven by data engineers to meet the needs of data scientists.", "Gratitude and humility are the solution to so many insecurities that rise up in the heart.", "Everyone will be accountable for how they used the gifts/roles they were given\u2026Not how they imagined they would use others gifts/roles\u201d \u2014 Paul J.

Not everyone needs to be a data scientist because it appears \u201ccool\u201d. Data scientists have their share of mundane work issues, similar to data engineers and all other professions.", "But, if we strive to be ourselves, what we are born, excellent and passionate to be, it will transform the mundane to innovative ideas. In reality, data engineers also enjoy their fair share of corporate success, high salary and recognition within the analytics/technology industry. Would you take that the challenge and be a pioneer as a data scientist or as a data engineer?", "In summary, data scientist and data engineers are complementary to each other.", "Both are required to deliver the promise of big data. Both are required to innovate the AI and machine learning frontier continuously. Both are required to change the world into a better place.", "If you like this article and would like to see more content, please consider joining Medium membership to support me and other fellow writers using the link below:", "About the author: Albert Suryadi is a proven leader in enabling advanced analytics and data science capability in blue chip organisations.
