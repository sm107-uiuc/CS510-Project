What should I do to make it more interactive and fun while also applying my NLP knowledge on it?", "Recently, I just developed an AI-powered portfolio, which aims to level-up my static web portfolio. I embedded a personal AI assistant that can answer your queries about me, naturally, with the right response!", "Whether you are a recruiter, a colleague, or anyone on the internet, if you ask \u201chim\u201d the right question, you will know me better! (PS: \u201cHe\u201d knows almost anything about me).", "Feel free to interact with my personal AI assistant here. In this article, I will give a step-by-step tutorial on how to develop your own personal AI assistant. All you need are only HTML, JavaScript, and CSS!", "Before jump into the tutorial, let me introduce you to the engines used in this AI-powered portfolio: Semantic Reactor and USE-lite Tensorflow-JS for QnA.", "The first engine, Semantic Reactor, is the experimentation engine. Basically, it\u2019s an add-on from Google which can be added into your Google Sheets. What it\u2019s used for?", "To show how easy it can be to use NLU, we\u2019ve created a tool called the Semantic Reactor that uses pre-trained language models, offers different ranking methods, and has a few advanced features. \u2014 Google AI", "In other words, this add-on provides you with pre-trained models that are ready to be exploited for your experiments! You can use those models for Question/Answering task or measuring the semantic similarity.", "There are even some innovative games that used this tool as their experimentation engine!", "You can read more about Semantic Reactor here and here.", "The second is the main engine used in the deployment phase. Before I explain more about this main engine, I\u2019ll tell you a bit about the USE and USE-Lite model first.", "Universal Sentence Encoder(USE) is a model that transforms any given sentences into a 512-dimensional sentence embedding. Those converted embedding then can be exploited as the input to many NLP tasks such as text classification, textual similarity analysis, Question/Answering, and many more.", "As stated in its name, USE-Lite is simply a lightweight version of the original USE model.", "This lite version is good for use cases when your computation resource is limited. For example, on-device inference. It\u2019s small and still gives good performance on various natural language understanding tasks. \u2014 Tensorflow Hub Documentation", "Finally, USE-Lite Tensorflow-JS for Question/Answering is a lightweight model that encodes question and answer texts into 100-dimensional embedding.", "As described in the USE paper, there are 2 variants of USE model. The first one used Deep Average Network, while the second one used Transformer architecture. Here, USE-Lite Tensorflow-JS for Question/Answering used Transformer as its base architecture.", "There are 6 steps you have to do to build your own personal AI assistant and I\u2019ll guide you for each of the steps!", "You can simply install the add-on from here. Make sure you are using the same Google account with your Google Sheets account to install the add-on.", "After you installed the Semantic Reactor add-on, you can open your google sheets and then list all of the possible responses.", "One hacky trick I can suggest you is to generate several lists of responses based on the topic.", "In my case, I generated six different kinds of responses list, where one of them is a general responses list, and each of the rest of the five is specific for responses related to my professional working experiences (Traveloka, Tokopedia, Do-It, Qlue Smart City, The World Bank).", "Once you have listed all of the possible responses, you can start the Semantic Reactor add-on.", "As explained before, there are several pre-trained models provided by the Add-on. Here, we will choose the \u2018Local\u2019 model since it\u2019s the same model with the one we will use in the deployment phase.", "We have to choose the \u2018Input/Response\u2019 rank method because we will use this add-on for a QnA task.", "Most likely, your first set of possible responses is not able to support the pre-trained model to return a suitable answer for a given query. We actually can try to do the transfer learning from the pre-trained model in our dataset.", "But for this case, I think it\u2019s wiser to refine our possible responses rather than spending our time and hardware resource to do the transfer learning. Just like as Albert Einstein said:", "\u201cMake everything as simple as possible, but not simpler. \u201c", "So, you can keep refining all of the possible responses until you see the result is good enough.", "Once you are confident with your list of possible responses, you can use that list in the deployment. The \u2018local\u2019 model in the Semantic Reactor is a Universal Sentence Encoder-Lite model, which is the engine we will use in the deployment.", "The first thing to do is to load the TensorFlow-JS and USE module from CDN.", "Then you can define functions to select the best response from the responses list, given a query.", "Finally, we have to choose which function we want to use or which list of responses we want to use based on the given query. I used the keyword matching method here to choose which lists of responses we should use.", "All of the main codes I used to build this personal AI assistant is based on these 3 sources:", "Congratulations for keeping up to this point! Hopefully, I can see many new AI-powered portfolios developed after this article is published.", "If you love my content, please kindly follow my Medium account to get the notifications for my other future posts. In the next 3 months, I\u2019ll also make an article series about Reinforcement Learning. You can check the first article here.", "Louis Owen is a Data Science enthusiast who always hungry for new knowledge. He pursued a Mathematics major at one of the top university in Indonesia, Institut Teknologi Bandung, under the full final-year scholarship. Recently, in July 2020, he was just graduated from his study with honours.", "Louis has experienced as an analytics/machine learning intern in various field of industry, including OTA (Traveloka), e-Commerce (Tokopedia), FinTech (Do-it), Smart City App (Qlue Smart City) and currently as a Data Science Consultant at The World Bank.", "Check out Louis\u2019 website to know more about him! Lastly, if you have any queries or any topics to be discussed, please reach out to Louis via LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
