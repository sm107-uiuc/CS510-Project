I was initially an IT project associate. I had spent my days gathering system requirements, developing test cases, working with service providers to have the right tools to support a business. With just a little exposure to one reporting tool that covered data queries and visualization, I was stunned to realize how interesting this field is.", "There is a bunch of data available out there, and with the right mixture, data can help people make faster, more impactful actions and decisions.", "My first six months were full of adaptation. New field of work, new company, new culture of work (from a multinational corporation to a local start-up!), and the other new things that follow a career shift. On the negative side \u2014 I didn\u2019t do a lot of research on this new analytical field. I experienced a little part of it, I liked it, then I went (that wasn\u2019t a very thoughtful decision, was it?).", "I don\u2019t regret this decision, and in fact, I\u2019m grateful that I did it! But looking back, there are still things that I wish had known and considered before making this shift. Especially for my old self as a non-mathematics/statistics/actuary background.", "As mentioned above, my data analysis exposure before my career shift was very limited. I spent 3 months creating reports and dashboards that helped stakeholders make various business decisions. The stakeholders were happy and I received an internal award for it. I looked at a Business Intelligence Analyst role in a start-up that I knew would allow me to do it, and there I went.", "A few months in the role, I figured out that it is part of a bigger field called analytics and it is so much more than only creating reports. However, there is no industry-wide standard of competencies or certifications on analytics. The department doing this also has various names across organizations \u2014 from Business Intelligence, Data Analytics, Big Data, even Data Science.", "In general, analytics covers the following :", "Make sure you know what kind of analytics you would like to do, and match it with the scope of work of the analytical organization that you\u2019re exploring.", "As an implication, your scope of work as an analyst will differ depending on how the organization defines analytics. But regardless of what the analytics department is like there, make sure you have enough support from the product/data engineering team to ensure you have good data foundations for analysis. Without a good data foundation, you will find yourself spending more time preparing the data sets, instead of actually manipulating, interrogating, or even presenting it. And I tell you \u2014 it is such an inefficient process.", "Having problem-solving skills is good, but it\u2019s not enough. Coming from IS/IT background, I know about enterprises and processes but very limited statistics. Correlation, clustering, or regression was not something that I am familiar with. This condition limits my data analysis so that it tends to be very exploratory \u2014 with very little definitive or scientific insight. While in some cases that might not be a bad thing, in others this acts like a boomerang, as insights are again subjectively-driven and not scalable.", "If you come from a non-statistical/mathematical background as I do, I would recommend to first get familiar with descriptive analytics and some predictive analytics concepts. Descriptive analytics includes summarizing and describing data sets, looking at their frequency, central tendency, dispersion, relationship with other data sets, etc. Predictive analytics are techniques used to use historical data to predict potential outcomes. On doing these analyses, especially on large data sets, certain data manipulation tools are needed. There are a lot of tools out there, but my personal favorites are Python (yes it comes from my IT background :P) and R.", "Several contents can help you get started :", "Traditionally, data was used as a retrospective measure of certain business performance, and justification of the next decision. Us as an analyst, and the decision-makers usually already have some preemptive hypothesis on what insights are going to be generated from the data. And we like to be right about it.", "Once the analysis has been started, we work on the data, perform several descriptive exploratories and then work on statistical testing. From there, we got some insights that might cause our hypothesis to be rejected or might even contradict our assumption. There are cases when we or the stakeholders become anxious and curious about this result, causing us to again manipulate the data in such a way that we need to retest and prove the initial assumption.", "While rechecking, and further slicing/dicing data across groups is good to validate our analysis, we should also be in a neutral position and embrace the fact told by the data.", "Especially when we are sure that we already followed the right analytical process and there is less poor-quality data.", "This might cause us ended up in a circle of rechecking, re-slicing-and-dicing the data sets, spending hours but still not getting any additional insights or getting results that shifted from our initial objectives. On handling this, we can :", "Check out this interesting article from HBR for guidance on using data as the baseline of decision making in the organization.", "The work on the analysis or data modeling doesn\u2019t stop when the insights are presented or the model is deployed. From each analysis, there will still be follow-up questions to solve, new data sets to be worked on, and additional questions from the outside. In a tech start-up with high growth, things change very fast. It\u2019s important for you as an analyst to pivot your way of work for this.", "You might find the things that you work on now might be obsolete in the next 12 or even 6 months. And that\u2019s the beauty of it. What we need to ensure is basically whether we\u2019re still producing analyses that are aligned with the organization\u2019s focus.", "The above things might help you make a more informed decision about shifting your career towards analytics and the preparations/requirements that follow. I recommend chatting with people from the industry to get a better idea of what the world is like out there.", "On top of everything, making a career shift will still require determination, adaptation, and dedication to the work. With all the buzz on big data, analytics, data science, and machine learning, the opportunity in this field is endless and still evolving.", "Shifting your career towards this area is interesting in multiple ways, but be sure that you know what you\u2019re signing up for and make sure you are set up for success :)", "Your home for data science.
