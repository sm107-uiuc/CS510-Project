As a part of the admission process, candidates are asked 8 questions out of a bank of 12. Reducing the number of questions they ask may get more people to apply and enroll, raise revenue and keep graduation rates high."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://explained.ai/rf-importance/index.html", "anchor_text": "permutation importance", "paragraph_index": 13}, {"url": "https://www.fast.ai/", "anchor_text": "fast.ai", "paragraph_index": 13}, {"url": "https://xoelop.github.io/bootcamp-questions/", "anchor_text": "here", "paragraph_index": 22}], "all_paragraphs": ["Recently I worked on a project for a US bootcamp from Denver that has been teaching people how to code for the past 5 years. As a part of the admission process, candidates are asked 8 questions out of a bank of 12 questions to test their logical thinking. The school wanted to know if and how, using some data science analysis, this quiz could be reduced in time.", "Now, it takes about 1 hour to complete, and ~50% of the people that sign up never start the quiz. Ideally, the school would be able to ask fewer questions, while keeping the ones that give good information on whether a candidate is good or not. Potentially, a shorter quiz could get more people to take it and eventually join the school if they pass, which would also make the company\u2019s revenue to go up.", "They had data for ~2700 students. For each one, they knew the questions they got and whether they got them right or wrong, and for about 700 of them, they knew the time they took to complete each one of the questions.", "65% of people are getting more 6 or more questions right. That probably means that fewer questions could be asked and the people that passed before would pass now after too. We\u2019ll see later if that\u2019s true.", "To pass the quiz, one must get 6 or more questions right, and the people that get 5 right need to go through an extra logical thinking interview. That\u2019s why some people got 5 right and still didn\u2019t pass.", "Depending on how the data looks like, the decisions the school could make would look different. Essentially, there are two groups of people that we could try to focus on:", "It looks like most of the people answer all of the 8 questions they receive, and very few people start the quiz and leave it halfway through.", "Also, the people that answer few questions are the ones with the lowest percentage of right answers, so they probably wouldn\u2019t have passed anyway.", "Therefore, it doesn\u2019t make sense to try to get these people to finish, and the goal should be to focus on the other group, the ones that never get to start. We\u2019ll try to shorten the quiz, and if being too long was the reason people didn\u2019t start, more of them would start after shortening it.", "To decide which questions to take out, we need to get some metrics for each one of the questions. Like\u2026", "Some questions take way longer than other ones, like huge_depth, 10 mins!. We probably will want to get rid of that one", "Most of the people are getting questions like long_road or red_dad right. That probably means that those are the easiest questions and don\u2019t give us much information to know whether a student will pass or not.", "This is the best of the 3 metrics we will have for each question. What it will tell us is how predictive is each question to tell if a candidate will pass the test.", "The actual technical term is permutation importance. I had learned about it first in one of the fast.ai courses and this was a good time to use it. Basically, how it works is:", "(*) Actually we don\u2019t take columns out, we just shuffle them, one at a time. Shuffling a column has a similar effect as taking it out, but with the advantage that we don\u2019t have to retrain the model. In simple models like the random forest I used this doesn\u2019t have much of an effect, but if a model takes a long time to train, this way we just have to train it once instead of N times.", "Red_dad and long_road are, indeed, the least important ones, as we had guessed before. Also, the longest question to answer, huge_depth, turned out to be not so important, so taking it out won\u2019t be as if we took hurt_tea or left_bread out.", "Now, we can visualize the metrics for all the questions", "This is the last part of this project \ud83c\udf89 I took out 1, 2, 3\u2026 up to 11 questions. I always removed from huge_depth because it was the longest one, and then removed questions starting from the least to the most important ones. This brought answers to questions like\u2026", "This is some of what I found out.", "If we removed the 10 least important questions from the bank of questions and only 1 out of the 2 most important ones was asked, these would be the results:", "And, still, ~92% of the people that passed before would pass if they get it right now, and ~76% of the people that didn\u2019t pass before wouldn\u2019t pass now.", "In this case, we see that the best threshold would be required to have 2 out of 3 questions right. That would give us only ~15% of false positives (people that would get accepted but shouldn\u2019t) and about 5% of false negatives (people that wouldn\u2019t get accepted but should). And the quiz would take in this case ~17 minutes.", "I don\u2019t want to make this post too long, but there are many more possibilities. If you\u2019re curious and would like to examine them all (and see some things that didn\u2019t work also), you can check the full report here.", "There you can also see that the importance that was calculated seems to work, as when we remove fewer questions and we ask, for example, 3 out of 6 instead of 3 out of 4, the threshold of how many questions someone should get right to pass gets less clear.", "We found out which are the most important questions and which ones don\u2019t tell us so much. We also found out that the quiz can be shorter and that asking the important questions we still have enough information to tell if a student is good or not.", "Now, what should be the decision to make? Ask only 1 question? Ask 5 out of 8?", "That depends more on the costs of the business and is more of a decision the stakeholders now would have to make, given the data they have.", "If interviewing more people is very cheap, my advice would be to ask fewer questions and don\u2019t require to get a lot of them right. This way, all the students that would have passed before would pass now, but there would be many more students that shouldn\u2019t pass and will have to be interviewed in the next stage to find out.", "Ideally, being able to announce that \u201cnow the test only takes 5/10/15 minutes\u201d would get many more people to take it, and maybe the threshold could even be increased so that the workload of the interviews team didn\u2019t increase but more people would become students.", "Whether this would happen or not is beyond this post and has to be tested empirically. Hopefully, that happens and I can add a couple of lines to this.", "I\u2019m actively looking for contract work to tackle interesting data problems like this.", "So if you have a specific problem at your business and would like to solve it in a more data-driven way, I\u2019ll be happy to chat and see how I can help.", "Your home for data science.
