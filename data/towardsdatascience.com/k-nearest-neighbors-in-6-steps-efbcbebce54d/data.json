The most popular use-case of KNN is in classification. Interestingly though, it is applicable to KNN regressions as well.", "Beginning with the foundations of KNN classifier models. KNN classifier models work in 3 broad steps to predict labels for unprecedented feature values (which are not in the training data).", "Circling back to KNN regressions: the difference is that KNN regression models works to predict new values from a continuous distribution for unprecedented feature values. Conceptually, how it arrives at a the predicted values is similar to KNN classification models, except that it will take the average value of it\u2019s K-nearest neighbors.", "Let\u2019s first import the required packages:", "The data set has 59 rows and 7 columns, with the first 10 rows shown below. To keep things simple, we\u2019ll not use all the features; our aim is to use mass and width to predict the label, fruit_label.", "Discarding unneeded features and labels. The extent of feature engineering you would perform on a dataset is largely dependent on the business context that you are operating in.", "Now we\u2019ll split the 59 entries with a 75/25 train-test split, where 75% of the data is used to train the KNN classification model and the remaining 25% is \u2018hidden\u2019 from the model and used to validate the results. A 75/25 split is the default split performed by train_test_split.", "Looking at the mass and width features, we notice that they\u2019re both on different scales: mass values range into the double and triple digits, while width values typically range in the single digits. If values range too widely, the objective functions may not work properly, as some features may inadvertently exude higher influence on prediction.", "Min-Max Scaling is a relatively simple method and is similar to apply Z-score normalization on distributions. Values are rescaled relative to the feature minimum and maximum values into a range between -1 and 1.", "We can create the an \u2018empty\u2019 KNN classifier model with the first line. Further, the n_neighbours argument allows control over our \u2018K\u2019 value. Next, the model is then fit against the scaled X features and their corresponding Y labels from the training dataset.", "Similar to how the R Squared metric is used to asses the goodness of fit of a simple linear model, we can use the F-Score to assess the KNN Classifier. The F-Score measures the accuracy of the model in predicting labels correctly. We can observe that the model is correct at predicting labels 95% of the time of the training data and 100% of the time on the held-out test dataset.", "Finally, we would want to use the model to make predictions. Given a fruit with mass, width, height and color_score of 5.5, 2.2, 10 and 0.70 respectively, what fruit is this? After the approproate Min-Max scaling, the model predicts that it is a mandarin.", "Lets look at visualizing the data using the matplotlib library. We can also further examine how the dataset behaves for varying values of K. Below I have plotted K = 1 , 5, 11.", "Generally, we can observe that a lower value of K results in more overfitting of the training data. The model attempts to predict every point more accurately with lower K values. As a result we can observe that the boundaries between classification regions are jagged and change drastically with local changes.", "Looking at the KNN with K = 11, we can see that the border between classification regions is relatively smoother. This KNN model has become relatively better at capturing the global trend, and would allow it to be more generalisable to a held out test set.", "I was able to learn this through the MOOC \u201cApplied Machine Learning in Python\u201d by the University of Michigan, hosted by Coursera.", "Do feel free to reach out to me on LinkedIn if you have questions or would like to discuss post Covid-19 world!", "I hope that I was able to help you in learning about data science methods in one way or another!", "Here\u2019s another data science article for you!", "Your home for data science.
