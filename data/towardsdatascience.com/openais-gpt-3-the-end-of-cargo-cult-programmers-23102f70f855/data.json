It has made huge strides in the past few years by bridging the gap between AI and general human intelligence and is commercial today.", "Unless you\u2019re living under a rock, you\u2019d probably have heard about the OpenAI\u2019s latest GPT iteration. It has engulfed the social media by storm.", "The reason behind GPT-3\u2019s enormous hype right now is due to its mighty model size. Today, it's one of the largest and most powerful machine learning models for natural language processing in the world.", "Trained on over a trillion words and based on a transformer neural network architecture, the Generative Pre-training model is capable of doing almost any natural language task be it writing prompts, QAs for chatbots or even generating language-specific code.", "The GPT-3 model uses 175 billion parameters. That\u2019s billion with a B. And its more than 100 times the number of parameters on which GPT-2 was trained.", "The huge number of parameters and enormous data that are used for training this model has pretty much thrown away any need for fine-tuning \u2014 something which BERT and GPT-2 had to fall back on for specific tasks.", "Essentially, you just need to tell the GPT-3 model what needs to be done as the input in English and it\u2019ll compute the output for you based on the next word prediction. For instance, you\u2019d type \u201cIf Trump was a programmer\u201d in the input box, and it\u2019ll automatically complete the story for you(until a certain limit of course).", "While currently, OpenAI has been released GPT-3 in private beta only, the early testers have already shared their findings which have went viral on Twitter. One of them showcased how to create a basic web app by simply typing your requirements in plain English and it generates the language code and app for you.", "Though there\u2019s a lot to discuss about the intricacies of GPT-3, I\u2019d skip onto what it means for developers and their jobs. If you\u2019re inclined to explore GPT-3 in-depth, I\u2019d recommend this article a read. Or simply Google it.", "Since the start of 2020, there has been a pretty common notion that the future of coding is no-code. In fact, there\u2019s a big looming fear that AI would take over humans and their jobs someday.", "That, along with the current rapid emergence of GPT-3 has caused a stir in the developer\u2019s community \u2014 with some thinking that the no-code era of programming has finally arrived.", "While AI could take over most of the programming jobs in a decade from today, the current OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 model despite its maganamity is still far from general human intelligence.", "Programming is a mix of art and science and problem-solving requires some deeper thinking than merely generating code in a visual layout. Moreover, comprehending complex requirements to write production-level code isn\u2019t something AI is ready to do yet in a foolproof way.", "We already have a lot of no-code visual tools like CreateML for building simple models based on transfer learning. GPT-3 would be nothing but a great addition to that suite to help programmers speed up their workflow.", "If at all anything, it\u2019ll make the programmer's job more productive as they\u2019d have specific roles devoid of elementary tasks.", "GPT-3 would never kill jobs skilled developers. Instead its a wake-up call for cargo coders and developers. It\u2019ll urge them to buckle up and upskill to ensure they\u2019re up for solving complex computer programming problems.", "OpenAI\u2019s GPT-3 would help raise the bar of entry-level developers who till now were complacent and happily doing monkey tasks such as copy-pasting code snippets from Google.", "Perhaps, GPT-3 could decimate the developer\u2019s dependence on Google.", "Also, another positive thing that might emerge from this breakthrough is that it\u2019ll encourage more non-developers to build simple websites and apps themselves whilst gaining programming expertise.", "Remember, the GPT-3 model, despite its size, is still miles away from human brain intelligence. It\u2019s just a new abstraction layer on programming.", "Of course, developers who were bound to doing simple no-brainer logic stuff in HTML, CSS, and SwiftUI, might become obsolete as GPT-3 goes commercial in the coming year. But in no way, would it kill the programming or data science jobs.", "As it is popularly said, the day AI takes over programming, it\u2019ll literally take over all jobs.", "Elon Musk whose at the helm of OpenAI is actually looking to mitigate AI\u2019s threat to humanity. His vision is to blend Artificial Intelligence with us in such a way that we have the ultimate control over it and not the other way round. GPT-3 might not be close to general artificial intelligence yet, but its perhaps the first stepping stone where AI meets the common man.", "Your home for data science.
