TDS is widely used to measure coffee extraction as a more objective measurement of the quality of a coffee. This small study examined using a centrifuge for sample filtration as compared to a syringe filter. They compared centrifuge, syringe filter, and unfiltered samples across 20 shots split between two coffee beans over the span of a few weeks. They were meticulous about making sure the samples were good.", "However, I disagree with their findings, and I think they missed an opportunity because of the way they plotted the data. On the bright side, they seemed to have uncovered something interesting: there is a direct correlation and transformation between filtered samples and unfiltered samples. This means that even when measuring TDS without a filter, you can estimate the filtered TDS with good accuracy. In essence, using a costly centrifuge or costly syringe filters is unnecessary for measuring TDS at home or in cafe settings; the unfiltered measurement is reliable.", "Previous data from Socratic Coffee suggests filtering results only improves precision. I took previously found filtering not to be useful enough to justify the cost. Ultimately, a centrifuge or syringe filters are quite expensive for a hobby that\u2019s already very expensive.", "This study took 20 samples across multiple days, multiple shots, split between two coffees. They then computed probability distributions to show the unfiltered samples were problematic. They showed the data in a table, but they didn\u2019t plot the data as a scatter plot.", "I was curious about the data, so I pulled it to take a look. If their data proved filtration was necessary, I would be more inclined to filter all of my results. However, there is a major cost hurdle to filtering samples which is syringe filters are expensive, and even if a centrifuge wasn\u2019t expensive, it takes more time.", "They made the raw data available, and I started with some scatter plots.", "A simple best fit linear line reveals an R^2 value of 0.68, which is quite high. So let\u2019s cut the data again to the two separate roasts to see how that changes these trends.", "Now the linear fits for each coffee is much stronger, which indicates a transformation will get you from filtered samples to unfiltered samples. Let\u2019s line up samples and sort them but split by coffee:", "Again, they trend with each other, so we should calculate correlation. Correlation is a metric to help understand how closely two metrics trend with each other:", "For the Sump Ethiopia Roba, the correlation coefficient is too high to ignore. Even the Sump Alma Negra correlation coefficient in the high 80\u2019s is telling that this link between unfiltered and filtered is just an transformation.", "Applying the transformation to each data group, we can compute the percent error (|x \u2014 x_GroundTruth|/x_GroundTruth) for the regular measurement and then corrected based on the best fit line transformation.", "Assuming the centrifuged samples are ground truth, the actual percent error after correction isn\u2019t much to be concerned about.", "While the author of the study did very well controlling variables and collecting the data, their analysis did not reveal the real findings which is the evidence that filtration of coffee samples for TDS measurement might be unnecessary. The uncertainty is the possibility that every bean has a different correction curve, and if you were quite concerned, a larger study across multiple beans would help confirm this theory.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
