Jupyter is fantastic for this, yet somehow after some time coding in notebooks almost exclusively, I found my coding abilities starting to slip. After a while, I found myself picking up bad habits.", "Often times I\u2019d find myself copying and pasting large code blocks that I could easily reuse or tossing random imports wherever I needed them. This is fine if you\u2019re just hacking something together, but when it comes time to present your code or assemble into a full demo or solution, you\u2019re left scrambling to assemble your fragments into something resembling a sophisticated predictive model developed by a so-called machine learning \u201cexpert\u201d.", "What happens to the result if you change X to Y and run it?", "We\u2019ve all heard it. You\u2019re giving a live demonstration after proudly stating you can run your model on the fly and generate results right before their eyes! Never mind that you just spent the previous 6 hours polishing your plots, tables, and other visualizations to effectively communicate your results. Since you\u2019ve designed your model in a notebook, the code may very well be fragmented and not well generalized to handle the question. Sometimes this is unavoidable, but I\u2019ve found that I\u2019ve been in this situation more than once, and come out with less credibility as a result. We\u2019ve all been there (\u2026right?)", "It\u2019s not notebooks that I have a problem with, not by a long shot. Notebooks rock. I think back to why I started using notebooks in the first place. Bear with me here, there\u2019s a point to all of this.", "I was working on a machine that acted as a gateway to my team\u2019s YARN cluster and a farm of other virtual machines that I developed on. For my early career I had used many different IDEs and text editors to develop my code and models. Now I was working within an environment where doing this was challenging. I quickly became fast friends with vim. Vim is everywhere and it\u2019s much more powerful than most people realize.", "This was an entirely different issue. I quickly began to become a vim power user and found myself more productive than I had been before! My coding abilities improved and soon I found myself churning out new algorithms all the time, being able to jump from system to system without having to reconfigure my development environment at every turn. I was unstoppable\u2026", "\u2026or so I thought. Even though I could write a lot of scripts and code to produce visualizations, tables, or write to out database, without the embarrassment of being asked to code in the middle of a demo. Even then, I was forced to think before I coded \u2014 to design my model before I wrote it. This left with with a TON of reusable design patterns I could use to build effective models. This grew my power exponentially and I assembled this code into libraries that I could call on a whim. Now my scripts were a mere pocketful of lines, yet lending insight that had taken me hundreds in the past. Mastering vim had made me lazy \u2014 in a good way! I had reached data science nirvana, but I was still missing something.", "Somehow everything felt too rigid. Furthermore, I was working only on remote machines. It got really annoying copying exported images from matplotlib visualizations back to my root computer to view results, finicky X-forwarding, or relying on the larger infrastructure and it limitations. No, I wanted freedom again. I wanted my code to feel like I was working on a single machine once again, where I could just pop up a plot window and close it when I was done or wanted to continue program execution. Furthermore, I wanted to expose some of the data wrangling and algorithm capabilities I had codified into my precious libraries to our end users, some of which were data scientists themselves.", "Enter Jupyter. Wow, as soon as I got my first Jupyter environment set up and running through a proxy I was hooked. I could access it from any gateway machine. Now I could even log directly into my environment from any machine and run interactive code. I could even do this right on a stakeholder\u2019s machine and show them what I was doing with their data. It felt amazing. Soon my team had gotten Jupyter hub running within our environment. I could still develop my structured code and libraries on our virtual machines by using my old friend vim, but could rapidly prototype new algorithms using Jupyter. What could go wrong?", "Well, as happens to most of us at some point, I changed jobs. I was working on new machines now. My old code? Inaccessible, in the hands of my former colleagues and completely out of sight for me. Oh well, on to bigger and better things!", "I had learned a lot from my previous job, and I wanted to move forward with my acquired knowledge. I immediately went into developing a new model, this time I started in Jupyter notebooks. Quickly I found myself with messy code, fragmented notebooks. Don\u2019t even get me started on scope issues! Then people started asking me to share my work with them. Uh oh, people will all see my gross code! Quickly I found myself cutting corners and taking shortcuts to get things running and simple, but at least I was productive again. My notebooks were self sufficient and able to be run top to bottom to fully explain my process and model.", "Why do you keep scrolling through so much code? I just want to see the results.", "Chances are, if you have demoed from a notebook before you\u2019ve heard this, or at least something similar. And they\u2019re right \u2014 most people don\u2019t care about your code, so while showing it is nice for data scientists, it\u2019s not so great for customers, you know, the guys that help you get paid?", "Enter reveal.js. This changed the way I wrote notebooks! I could click a little tab and hide my code from the presentation. Want to show my code? It\u2019s pretty simple to toggle on and off.", "I still found myself falling back on lousy coding habits. I couldn\u2019t find a balance between good coding practices and writing for re-usability and the agility that Jupyter provides. Essentially, because I wasn\u2019t forced to think it through, I didn\u2019t. I had become a lazy coder. Sure, I was effective, but I was still embarrassed by my code. Sometimes ugly code is important \u2014 we data scientists sometimes need to churn out a model, the beauty of the code be damned. If only there was a way to let notebooks be for quick prototyping, yet somehow hide my code when sharing my notebooks. I wanted to have demo-able notebooks, without having to twiddle a bunch of knobs and hide code to make it presentable. I needed something else. I needed\u2026", "\u2026JupyterLab! JupyterLab was like a gift from the gods for me. Not only could I quickly hack together notebooks, I could copy and paste my classes and functions directly into text files in the very same web based environment. This got me planning again. Somehow just having text files editable alongside made notebooks made everything different. Not only editors though; lab gives you access to terminals. But wait, there\u2019s more!", "I got my vim back. Well, partly. It at least has the same key bindings that became muscle memory over the years. Of course, I had it all along, but now I have it alongside my beloved notebooks. Something still is missing though. I hate light themes. Notebooks is light by default, and only by installing a third-party extension can you switch to a dark them. There\u2019s nothing wrong with that, unless you don\u2019t have access to your Jupyter notebooks server that you\u2019re using. JupyterLab has multiple dark themes for the text editor and a dark theme for lab as a whole.", "Beautiful. What I have settled on (for now!) is a workflow where I rapidly iterate. If I find myself writing something that has no place in a demonstration, I stash it elsewhere and reference the file or library from my notebook. This now feels so much nicer than what I was doing before, and I\u2019m just scratching the surface here. If you love notebooks, but find yourself falling into similar traps as me, give JupyterLab shot \u2014 I bet you\u2019ll love it.", "*The opinions expressed in this article are my own, and not necessarily the same as my employer.", "Your home for data science.
