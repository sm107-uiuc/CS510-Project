Someone unknown to you is connected from outside by telephone. After a few seconds of the conversation, a replica of his face appears on a screen \u2014 generated based on the caller\u2019s voice.", "This is not science fiction, but an invention that researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the USA successfully developed. They created a neural network, an artificial intelligence, and fed it with millions of video sequences from YouTube, for example. This enabled the network to learn all kinds of information about the relationship between faces and language.", "The researchers then tried to find out how much information about the faces of the speakers artificial intelligence can now reconstruct based on the voice alone. They used the neural network to decipher a voice and its facial features with a voice encoder and create a suitable portrait with a face decoder.", "Six-second voice recordings were sufficient for the artificial intelligence to create images that were often amazingly similar to the original recordings. In particular, age and gender, but also the ethnic background or information about the shape of the face could often be recognized.", "At the same time, the researchers created a portrait based on the original photographs to portray the depicted person with a neutral facial expression and looking into the camera. The comparison with the image based on the voice is astonishing.", "Of course, the results are not yet perfect. Moreover, from time to time, artificial intelligence also makes mistakes: for example, there may be difficulties when an Asian person speaks English. But not only the ethnicity but also gender and age were mistaken.", "However, MIT scientists are not the first to deal with this topic. Previous research has also used artificial intelligence to decipher voices. However, they have always searched for pre-defined information \u2014 for example, the age or gender of the speaker.", "They wondered what information about faces could generally be obtained from language. According to their statements, they are the first to have succeeded in identifying a face directly from the voice.The researchers already have an idea as to how this development could be used: for example, personalized cartoons can be created based on portraits created from the voice. The function could also be useful for assigning a similar appearance to machine-generated voices \u2014 for example, from virtual assistants.", "Your home for data science.
