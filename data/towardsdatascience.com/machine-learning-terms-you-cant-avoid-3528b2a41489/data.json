They are involved in neural network implementation, training, improvement, and evaluation.", "The learning rate is an integral component of a neural network as it\u2019s a value factor that determines the level of updates that are to be made to the values of the weights of the network.", "In a visualization exercise, where the function to be solved can be depicted as a hyperbole curve in n-dimensional parameter space, the learning rate is a component that affects the step size the current parameter values take towards a local/global minima. Hence, the learning rate directly affects the rate of convergence of a network during training.", "If the learning rate is too low the network might take several iterations and epochs to converge, on the opposite side of things, if the learning rate is too high, there is a risk of overshooting the minimum, and as a result of this our training doesn\u2019t converge.", "Selecting the appropriate learning rate can be a lengthy exercise, although there are techniques to optimize the process.", "A constant learning rate can be utilized during the training of a neural network, but this can increase the amount of training that has to take place to arrive at optimal neural network performance.", "By utilizing the learning rate schedule, we introduce a timely reduction or increase of the learning rate during training to arrive at an optimal training outcome of the neural network.", "Learning rate decay reduces the oscillations of steps taken towards a local minimum during gradient descent.", "By lowering the learning rate to a smaller value compared to the learning rate value utilized at the start of the training, we can steer the network towards a solution that oscillates in smaller ranges around a minimum.", "Vanishing gradient problem is a limiting factor in the performance and accuracy of a neural network. It is a product of instability of gradient values during backpropagation and affects the earlier layers within a neural network.", "The vanishing gradient is more specifically present within the training of deep neural networks (networks with several layers). So this is a problem that is common in most deep learning solutions.", "During backpropagation, an optimization algorithm derives the gradient by taking into account the accumulated product of gradients from later layers in the network. Specifically, to the problem of vanishing gradients, the gradients from the later layers of the network have values between 0 and 1. Therefore a product of the gradient creates an even smaller amount.", "These small values are used to update the weights of the earlier layers in the network, which in effect, has little to no change to the current weight value.", "Minimal changes in the neural network\u2019s weights within the earlier layers limits how much the network can learn. Also, the training of the network can take longer due to the network taking an extended time to converge and reaching an optimal solution.", "Similar to the vanishing gradient problem, the exploding gradient problem is a result of the instability of the gradients within a neural network during backpropagation.", "In the case of the exploding gradient, if the individual gradient component of later layers in the network is greater than 1, then the product of later layers which is used during backpropagation to calculate the earlier layer\u2019s gradient will be huge.", "This causes the updates made to the weights in the earlier layers to be of higher value; therefore, the neural network overshoots an optimal solution, and training doesn\u2019t converge.", "Traditional normalization is a process of placing feature input values on the same set of equivalent scales. So for images input values that are fed forwarded through a network, the pixel values are normalized to have values within the range of 0 to 1.", "The technique batch normalization was presented in 2015 by Christian Szegedy and Sergey Ioffe in this published paper. Batch normalization was performed as a solution to speed up the training phase of deep neural networks through the introduction of internal normalization of the inputs values within the neural network layer.", "Batch normalization can be applied to a neural network layer\u2019s input before or after the activation function. In either case, the output of a layer is normalized.", "The batch normalization process occurs in two stages, standardization and normalization. Here are the steps of operations that occur to the input values:", "Through batch normalization, the process of normalization data is no longer restricted to the input layer of the network and is now an integral internal component of the neural network. It\u2019s parameters values that represent the offset and the scale within batch normalization operation are also learnable during training.", "Through the learnable batch normalization parameters, each layer input values are optimally normalized.", "It\u2019s called \u2018batch\u2019 normalization as the operation performed is based on each batch of input values that are fed through the network.", "Gradient clipping is a technique that is utilized to regulate the instability of gradient values within a neural network. This is achieved by enforcing a threshold on the values that the gradients can take.", "The threshold values are usually specified between a selected minimum and maximum. And the gradient values during backpropagation take on values within the defined minimum and maximum.", "Gradient clipping is primarily leveraged to prevent exploding gradients when training a deep neural network. It regulates the step size derived from the gradient descent optimization algorithm from taking on large values. This ensures that we do not overshoot a global minimum", "We have been through seven standard machine learning terms and dived into surface-level details of each term.", "Moving forward, I would suggest exploring how each of the mentioned terms is implemented in popular deep learning libraries such as Keras, Pytorch, and TensorFlow.", "Below are a few articles that you can read to gain more knowledge within machine learning.", "Your home for data science.
