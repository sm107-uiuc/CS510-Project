Their main objective is to support the interpretation of data through descriptive analytics. While two-dimensional charts can be used as the basis for more complex representations, multidimensional data can be shown through extensions of these charts.", "Graphical representations of data allow better understanding of a given process. They are helpful during the early stages of analysis when engineers need to make conjectures, figure out relationships, and plan further research. Hence, choosing an appropriate type of chart represents a crucial task for communicating advances and proposals effectively; poor charts may ruin significant good work performed during a project.", "Throughout this article, some of the most significant charts for data analysis in Six Sigma projects will be explained and illustrated using a simple case study. For more information about additional tools used throughout Six Sigma and Quality Assurance projects, please refer to 7 Basic Tools of Quality.", "Bar charts are the simplest type of chart to interpret. Each bar represents a factor where the variable under study is being measured. The height of the bars represent the frequencies of a given quantity or measure (e.g. defects, items, products). Bar charts are the best graphical representations for counts.", "For this and the following examples, the ss.data.pc data set (a data set for a printer cartridge example available with the SixSigma package) will be used to generate a particular chart.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the R code to generate a bar plot!", "Run charts are bidimensional charts where the x-axis represents a time line and where on the y-axis a variable that is being monitored is plotted. Usually a centered line is plotted in run charts, which may represent a target value, the data mean, or any other value.", "These charts are also known as time-series charts when there is a time scale on the x-axis. Run charts are useful for detecting patterns that can be indicative of changes in a process (i.e. variability). The finding of cycles, trends or shifts should trigger a process review to take further actions to improve quality.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the R code to generate a run chart!", "Tier charts are used when there is more than one observation per run. They help visualize short-term variation and long-term variation jointly in a single chart. Short-term variation is represented by the variation within each subgroup, whereas long-term variation is represented by the variation between all the groups.", "To create a tier chart, vertical lines are plotted at the position of each run from the higher to the lower value. Then, the single values are plotted as a point or as a horizontal segment.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the R code to generate a tier chart!", "Also known as the box plot, the box-whisker chart is used to graphically summarize the distribution of a continuous variable. The sides of the box are the first and third quartiles (25th and 75th percentile, respectively). 50% percent of the data is located inside the box. The line that crosses the box corresponds to the median and the extreme whisker values can be the maximum and minimum of the data or other limits beyond which the data are considered outliers. The limits are usually taken as:", "where Q1 and Q3 are the first and the third quartiles, respectively, and IQR is the interquartile range (Q3 \u2014 Q1).", "The box plot helps visualizing if the distribution is centered or biased (i.e. the position of the median with respect to the rest of the data), if there are outliers (i.e. points outside the whiskers), or if the data are close to the center values (i.e. small whiskers or boxes). This chart is highly useful for when comparing groups and for when checking if there are differences between them.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the R code to generate a box-whiskers chart!", "Group charts are mainly used to show graphically the group multiple points belong to. In a Six Sigma context, they are useful for when the measured characteristic is generated by different process streams or for when it is measured in different locations. The maximum and minimum values of each group are typically connected by lines.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the R code to generate a group chart!", "Multivariate charts are mainly used to identify graphically the factors that affect a specific outcome (i.e. Critical To Quality (CTQ) characteristics). Once the factors have been identified, changes can be proposed and executed to achieve the desirable target or goal.", "For the following example, an extended version of the ss.data.pc.big data set will be used to generate the multivariate chart. The data set contains 72 observations corresponding to all the possible combinations of 4 distinct factors: color (2), operator (3), filler (3) and batch (4). Let\u2019s take a look at the R code to generate a multivariate chart!", "Process improvement, quality assurance and six sigma engineers must be capable of using the concepts explained throughout this article to build the most appropriate charts to represent data. In the same way, developing and sharpening graphical analytical skills will lead to better interpretations (i.e. identification of cycles, shifts or trends easier) that will help generate more effective action plans to improve the quality on the business deliverables.", "A correct selection of a chart will simplify the results communication and understanding of the message conveyed. This article does not intend to convince the readers to strictly use R for when developing these charts, but instead to introduce how to develop them in free and open-source software with just a few lines of code.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
