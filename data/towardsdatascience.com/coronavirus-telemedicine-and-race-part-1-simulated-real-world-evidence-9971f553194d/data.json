This confounding factor drove down both ice cream sales and the number of homicides; hence the spurious correlation.", "In this two-part tutorial, we\u2019ll investigate a synthetic dataset inspired by a recent healthcare example involving racial disparities in COVID-19 cases (Garg et al, 2020; Aubrey, 2020).

We must go one critical step further in order to estimate an intervention\u2019s true effect size and direction.

Put differently, the estimated odds of infection for Whites were 0.121 (95% CI_EDA: 0.115, 0.127) times that of African Americans. This finding is plausible due to structural inequality: African Americans tend to have worse access to care, lower socioeconomic status (SES), and more underlying health conditions.", "Importantly, it looks like race was strongly associated with app usage.", "This finding is plausible also due to structural inequality. For example, suppose our app was only available on iPhone. African Americans are less likely than Whites to own iPhones (e.g., page 7 of Smith, 2013), which would have limited their access to the app. African Americans may also have worse access to telemedicine options in general.", "What do these findings imply about how we should approach estimating the ATE? Could race affect both app usage and infection risk? If so, race would be a confounder \u2014 meaning our marginal RD estimate earlier will not suffice as an estimate of the ATE.

Still, we note that an automated search for important predictors ranked by coefficient size would have ranked race higher than app. We wonder how such a procedure could potentially have excluded true causes with smaller coefficients from other analyses we've done \u2014 causes that were important for recommending courses of action.", "Importantly, note that the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) is not particularly large even though there exists a true ATE of app usage on infection risk by design.

After all, we\u2019d accounted for race as a confounder. Are either of our race-specific estimated RDs an estimate of the true ATE of -0.031? Unfortunately, no: The ATE is a risk difference averaged over all other variables. (It is a marginal \u2014 not conditional \u2014 quantity.)", "So then, can we estimate the ATE as a weighted average of these estimated RDs? Fortunately, yes: The g-formula does exactly this, which we\u2019ll learn about in Part 2.
