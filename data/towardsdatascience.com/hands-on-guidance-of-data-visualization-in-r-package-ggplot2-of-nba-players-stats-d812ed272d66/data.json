I am going to share my exploration step by step in this article and I hope \u201cggplot2\u201d in R can be another useful instrument in your data-science tool case.", "I should clarify that the following materials are driven by exploring the functions in ggplot2 instead of understanding the data.", "R in Data Science describes the equation to generate a plot in ggplot2 as shown below:", "where DATA is your data frame, GEOM_FUNCTION is the type of plot you want to use (eg. barplot), MAPPINGS is the variables to plot (eg. x and y), STAT is the equation applied to the raw data in your data frame (eg. calculate the count of observation), COORDINATE_FUNCTION is to adjust how to place the generated plot, and FACET_FUNCTION is used to place multiple plots in an organized order.", "The dataset has already been cleaned by removing \u201cNA\u201ds and correcting stats of players traded during the season.", "The complex figures generated by ggplot2 usually include multiple layers, which are basically the overlapping of plots generated by a sequence of GEOM_FUNCTIONs. Therefore, if no GEOM_FUNCTION specified, the plot will be empty.", "Let\u2019s start by putting one layer on the plot, which is a scatter plot with x as the minutes played (MP) and y as the points made (PTS).", "Here, I put MAPPINGS in the ggplot() function instead of geom_point() function to set it as a global variable, which will be used by all the following layers. However, it can also be put into geom_point(), which will serve as a local variable instead.", "It seems that there is a positive correlation between the players\u2019 playing time and points made per game, however, it is not strictly linear, which suggests that average players cannot get that many points as the superstars even given the same amount of playing time.", "Yeah, you can add color or shape by specifying the corresponding column names in the data.", "Here, I used variable Pos in the dataset to separate the players into five groups and highlighted the points by different colors and shapes.", "The color can also be assigned to a continuous variable instead of a categorical one, which is shown in the following example.", "The amazing part of ggplot2 is that you can even specify a condition in the arguments. For example, we want to separate LA Lakers from the other teams.", "Here, Tm stands for Team in the dataset and \u201cLAL\u201d is the Lakers.", "Actually, the scatter plots are very messy with everything overlapping with each other, which is hard to draw any conclusion with.", "Let\u2019s next try splitting the data into different groups based on the categorical variables in the dataset.", "For example, I want to split the data by the teams. I would use the same ggplot equation as before but adjust the output in the facets using FACET_FUNCTION.", "You can also do it with multiple categorical variables in the facet function by replacing facet_wrap() by facet_grid().", "Pretty messy, right? This is one of the visualizations we need to avoid.", "Next, I am going to add another layer to the plot.", "The plot now has another layer of line chart generated by geom_smooth(). Since we specified the argument \u2018color\u2019 in the global variable in ggplot(), both the scatter plot and the line chart split the players by positions with the same color setting.", "To make the plot look less messy, I decided to add the facet function to better organize them.", "Seems the trend is similar for all five positions. However, I did observe a slightly smaller variation at the high MP region for SG and SF comparing to the other three positions. These results remind me of the common positions of those superstars.", "Barplot is another popular plot type in data visualization. However, it\u2019s a little special in ggplot2, because its default function is not plotting the raw values in the data.", "The reason is related to the STAT function in ggplot2. The default STAT function of a barplot (geom_bar) is stat_count(), which calculated the number of observations in each category defined by argument x.", "This plot shows the number of players in each category on the Y-axis, which is the default behavior of geom_bar() function in ggplot2.", "In addition, the color of the bars needs to be defined via \u2018fill\u2019 instead of \u2018color\u2019, which is another difference with the scatter plot.", "However, most of the time a barplot of the raw values in the dataset is more important than that of the count, so \u2018stat= \u201cidentity\u201d\u2019 is one argument to be used instead.", "The y-axis now in the plot above is changed from count to the sum of points.", "The last part of the code is to show you can present the generated figure in a different coordinate type. My favorite one is called the Coxcomb chart as shown below.", "We can interpret from the data that the shooting guards contribute the most in total points per game in the season. However, this may result from the largest number of players in this position.", "Even though NBA suspends season after player tested positive for the coronavirus, I hope all the players, fans and people in the world stay healthy and win the war against the virus.", "I hope ggplot2 will be one of your visualization weapons as a data scientist.", "Your home for data science.
