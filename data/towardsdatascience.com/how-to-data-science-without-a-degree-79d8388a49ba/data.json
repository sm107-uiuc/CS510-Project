Ironically, I do have a degree \u2014 one that was even made for Data Science (Master\u2019s in Analytics from Northwestern). But to give you a little background, I used to be an accountant at Deloitte. Isn\u2019t that crazy? I was far from data science or anything technical. I had to learn a lot of things online on my own after work and even during my Master\u2019s program to catch up to my peers\u2019 level as I came from a non-technical background. Having gone through the experience myself, I can tell you that degree is very helpful, but not necessary. Because I have been on both sides of getting a degree and learning things online, I think I can give you a unique perspective. Getting a Master\u2019s in data science is a sure and fast way to get into the field, but luckily you don\u2019t have to if you don\u2019t want to spend $60\u201390k on tuition. It will require a lot of your self-discipline though.", "If a friend asks me how to get into data science, this post would be for them. I hope you find my advice valuable and relevant as I have gone through the process myself and found these resources useful. Before we get into the details, let\u2019s find out what data science is about.", "Skip this section if you already know this.", "Well, from my experience working as a data scientist at a few companies like GoDaddy, HERE, and GoGo, data scientists solve problems by applying machine learning on big data. Some examples are: predicting customers\u2019 probability to cancel subscription, identifying data anomalies, computing ad-hoc analysis on gigabytes or terabytes of data, clustering customers into meaningful groups, text analytics to find topics in customer chat transcripts, calculating revenue projection, and the list does not end.", "As a data scientist, you get thrown a lot of different types of problems. To be competent, you need to have a strong foundation in math, statistics, and programming. You need to know when to use certain techniques and algorithms depending on the problem and the data. At the end, you often need to present the results and techniques to the executives and less-technical audience.", "Also, as a data scientist, you need to continue to learn and adapt. Because the field is changing rapidly, it is important to stay up-to-date and learn new techniques. Even today, I spend a lot of time studying.", "Does data scientist work sound exciting to you? Great. This is a good time to be alive to learn for free. I tried to focus on free or cheap options because who doesn\u2019t like free things? It just takes your commitment and perseverance. I will describe this process in three phases.", "Keep in mind that there are other great resources other than what is mentioned below. But these happen to be the ones I took and found them useful.", "In order to be good at data science, you need to have good fundamentals in programming, statistics, and math. At minimum, I recommend you learn the following:", "Good news is that they do not have to be taken at a university. To learn the skills I mentioned above online, I recommend these:", "To see examples of what data science can do, check out Kaggle.com where people learn and compete data science projects. Also, check out DataCamp.com which provides hands on tutorials on various data science topics in both R and Python.", "By the end of phase 1, you should be comfortable with performing simple machine learning techniques like logistic/linear regression and decision trees on either R or Python. On a side note, I recommend learning both R and Python. Even though I mostly use Python lately, it is useful to know both depending on the problem you are trying to solve.", "Now you should have better idea of data science and statistical methods. In Phase 2, you want to go deeper and focus on machine learning. I found that online resources like Coursera do not usually cover as deep as a university-level course. Thankfully, Stanford\u2019s AI Lab provides amazing courses online for free. So you can watch world-class lectures, lecture notes, and many other course materials for free. So I recommend you take Coursera course and watch Stanford lectures at the same period if it\u2019s available. For example, DeepLearning.ai on Coursera gives you a very good and practical side of deep learning where as Stanford\u2019s CS231n Computer Vision course delves much deeper.", "In this phase, take the following:", "Again, there are other resources like DataCamp, Udacity, edX, and fast.ai that you can check out to learn various topics.", "During this phase, you should prepare for interviews and continue to learn new and deeper topics. If you have mastered the materials until phase 2, I think you should have enough knowledge to apply for an entry-level job. However, there are a few more things that are critical for you to pass the interview process.", "First, personal projects. If you are in a data science program, most classes make you complete machine learning projects, which are very good to practice your skills and to show the employers what you have done. So I really suggest you to try some personal projects, easiest one being Kaggle. Also, even though it is not necessary, I suggest you to have some example codes and projects you have completed on Github to show them to future employers.", "Second, you will most likely be interviewed SQL. When I started working at GoDaddy, I did not know too much SQL. When I was interviewing, I just learned a little bit on W3Schools.com, CodeAcademy, and by googling SQL interview questions. Even though it depends on companies, SQL is not as important as your machine learning and programming skills. It is relatively easy to learn on the job. Check out Leetcode.com to practice your SQL and programming skills.", "Finally, by this stage, you should have enough knowledge to explore different machine learning topics and learn deeper. It is up to you to focus on whatever topic that sounds interesting to you, whether it be RNN, CNN, NLP, or etc. As for me, I am trying to learn reinforcement learning these days.", "This was my very first Medium post and I really hope you found it useful. I tried to focus on specific classes you should take instead of specific tools or Python/R packages you need to learn because the classes will teach those things.", "If you want to see example codes of machine learning, check out my Github repository which I constantly update with new things I learn. I plan on sharing more different projects I am working on or any other random thoughts on Medium! If you have any questions or want me to cover anything specific in the future, ask away in the comment below.", "You check out my other articles and projects!", "Your home for data science.
