For those familiar with Microsoft Power Apps, Honeycode is very similar. The focus of the service is setting up tools for team collaboration. I did not see an option to share the app external to the tool. For an app to share with friends, take a look at AppSheet. I\u2019ve used that for non-profit activities to distribute holiday gives to hundreds of children. It worked well for that purpose.", "I decided to do a demo to create a simple AWS re: Invent 2020 session scheduler. This year\u2019s conference is three weeks long (and free and virtual). To plan for the sessions I don\u2019t want to miss; I need to get organized!", "The Honeycode interface is still in beta mode. I wasn\u2019t asked for any payment information to set up this demo. You can add up to 20 members or up to 2500 data rows for free. Not bad.", "This is NOT your AWS account, to make it interesting. I imagine this tool will be integrated into the AWS Console at some point.", "I don\u2019t yet have the conference schedule, so I created some topics of interest.", "I also set up a blank table to land the schedule data. I added some extra fields where I could reflect on the good and the bad. Conference sessions tend to get hazy after a couple of days.", "Amazon Honeycode includes basic templates to get you up and running. You can always start with the basic template, and then personalize and spice it up from there.", "I used the custom build rather than use any wizards or templates. There is some element of trial and error. If you have used Power Apps before, it is very similar.", "My app will have two screens. The home screen is my personalized schedule. I want to display what is on my schedule. The second screen will list all of the sessions that I can review and add to my schedule.", "I added two buttons with actions. One to delete a session off my schedule. One to add a session to my schedule. Pretty straight-forward.", "Well, it\u2019s not going to win any Design Awards. Considering I only spent about a distracted hour creating an account and this app, it\u2019s decent enough.", "I was able to download the app and access it on my phone.", "If you need to build a team collaboration app and don\u2019t want to mess around with code, it is compatible with Microsoft PowerApps.
