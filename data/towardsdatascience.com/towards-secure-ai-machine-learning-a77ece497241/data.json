But recent headlines of high-profile data breaches have shown that there are valid, real, and serious cybersecurity concerns that need to be addressed.", "This is a particularly poignant issue for AI/ML. After all, AI/ML practitioners rely on huge volumes of data, much of it sensitive and/or proprietary, to train their models. To make matters even more complex, the data used by data scientists must largely remain un-obfuscated (or, \u201cclear text\u201d) which could magnify both the opportunity for a data breach, and perhaps also its impact.", "Hence, it is probably not surprising that enterprises are looking at AI/ML\u2019s migration to the cloud with a degree of trepidation and caution. In fact, a recent survey by Deloitte, an international consulting firm, has shown that senior technology and security executives and professionals across all industries believe \u201ccybersecurity vulnerabilities can slow or even stop AI initiatives.\u201d", "Today, it appears that addressing cybersecurity concerns may have become a prerequisite for migrating AI/ML workload the cloud for many enterprises.", "This article will discuss the major security issues facing enterprises as they migrate AI/ML workload to the cloud and then identify several approaches to secure an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy to support AI/ML activities.", "In the past, enterprise security was primarily based upon securing a network perimeter around the enterprise data center under the premise that all systems, data, and resources within the perimeter were secure and could be trusted. At the time this made sense since most useful applications and assets existed in a data center within the network perimeter.", "Today, almost every enterprise uses the internet to interact with customers, partake in commerce with business partners, and communicate with far-flung organizations within the corporate umbrella. And cloud usage is also skyrocketing as enterprises take advantage of flexible, scalable, and inexpensive cloud computing resources.", "But very nature of using the cloud to process AI/ML workload introduces and exacerbates cybersecurity concerns. There are two unique characteristics that are worth highlighting: (a) AI/ML requires access to vast amounts of sensitive data, and, (b) AI/ML requires this data to be un-masked (\u201cin the clear\u201d) to facilitate data scientist model exploration, training, and verification activities.", "So, it is clear that enterprise communication patterns as well as cloud consumption patterns have evolved rather dramatically. And it is also clear that data visibility and accessibility requirements have evolved due to AI/ML.", "Unfortunately, is not necessarily evident that enterprise security practices from the past have evolved to keep pace. At least, recent headlines regarding Capital One\u2019s data breach suggest this to be the case.", "But why haven\u2019t enterprise security practices kept up? For several reasons: First, the very nature of the cloud creates a security issue in that many resources are, by default, accessible via the internet upon their creation. The implication of this is quite profound: establishing a network security perimeter is insufficient to protect assets on the cloud in the same way that they did for the data center.", "Second, enemies today are smarter and are acquiring better tools causing network perimeters to seemingly become more become porous. Uber\u2019s recent data breach on the cloud certainly demonstrated this to be the case.", "Third, with vast amounts of sensitive data required by AI/ML available to employees, enterprises need to introduce controls to avoid intentional leaks. The Globe and Mail reported that a data breach at Desjardins Group impacted 2.9 million customer was caused by an errant employee who allegedly stole and exposed sensitive data included personal information such as names, birth dates, social insurance numbers (similar to the US Social Security Number) and e-mail, telephone and home addresses.", "Lastly, security configurations inevitably drift over time: they are executed by multiple groups, and likely with a somewhat decentralized governance mechanism. Over time, a change collides with a previous change, or is unintentionally executed at cross-purposes to another, and eventually, this causes a previously secure environment to drift which, ultimately, creates security vulnerabilities. Perhaps Capital One\u2019s recent experience on the cloud is the most poignant example of this occurrence.", "There are several modern techniques (see Figure 1) which address the aforementioned security threats and are the foundation for a secure enterprise cloud tenancy.", "First, an \u201cidentity-based\u201d security approach dictates that only valid identity credentials provide the authentication and authorization to permit access to resources within an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy.", "An identity-based security (\u201c1\u201d in Figure 1) approach ensures that sensitive data would only be accessible by data scientists that have verified credentials. And the corollary to this: Malicious or unauthorized agents would not have the necessary credentials required to access sensitive data.", "The implementation of identity-based security approach should minimally consider the following:", "Second, a \u201czero-trust\u201d security approach (\u201c4\u201d in Figure 1) dictates resources are created with no access rights \u2014 nothing is accessible within an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy unless explicit authentication and authorization is provided. Zero Trust architectures use identity credentials and device claims/information (for example, IP address) to authenticate users and verify the authorizations necessary to gain access to data and applications in an enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy. In this way, identity-based security provides the foundational capability required to implement a Zero Trust policy.", "Third, \u201czero leakage\u201d policy dictates that data cannot be transported in any fashion outside of the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy. This policy would stop both employees that have access to sensitive data, or malicious agents that gain access to sensitive data, from letting data leave, or leak from, the enterprise cloud tenancy. In my experience, Zero Leakage can be implemented using a \u201csecure portal\u201d (\u201c5\u201d in Figure 1) which acts as a viewport used by data scientists to access the cloud tenancy. The portal permits relatively full featured access to the cloud but has specific capabilities disabled (typically the ability to \u201ccut-paste\u201d and download) that would permit data movement. Citrix has a number of products that support this, as do Microsoft (Remote Desktop), and VMWare (Horizon View).", "Lastly, establishing a policy for continuous \u201cconfiguration drift monitoring\u201d (\u201c6\u201d in Figure 1) is critical. Management of numerous cloud components is complex \u2014 managing their security is even harder. And, like it nor not, entropy will eventually cause your cloud configuration to change \u2014 or drift \u2014 in unexpected ways. Monitoring the enterprise\u2019s cloud tenancy and flagging any unexpected configuration changes made by your team \u2014 or those introduced by the cloud vendor \u2014 ensures that any cybersecurity vulnerabilities are caught and rectified before they cause significant damage.", "Coming back to my original proposition: the enterprise migration of AI/ML workload to the cloud is inevitable. But it must be acknowledged that this introduces new and serious security concerns that have caused enterprise to approach this migration with caution.", "But enterprises are not standing still. They are responding by:", "It would appear AI/ML has become a prerequisite for changing enterprises\u2019 traditionally cautious security posture. And, interestingly, while addressing these security concerns will accelerate AI/ML workload migration to the cloud, there are numerous other non-AI/ML cloud projects that are encumbered by \u2014 and now will be released from \u2014 identical security constraints.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
