Compared to other applications, video games provide designers a huge canvas to work with. At Zynga, we\u2019re constantly thinking of innovative ways to maximize our user\u2019s experience while playing our games.", "In this multi-part series, Zynga\u2019s ML Engineering Team will discuss how deep reinforcement learning (RL) is used in production to personalize many aspects of Zynga\u2019s games. The use of deep reinforcement learning has proven to be successful at increasing key metrics such as user retention and user engagement. These articles are an extension of our presentations at the Toronto Machine Learning Summit 2019 and Spark Summit 2020.", "In this first article, we will:", "The rest of the series will cover the following:", "Zynga is one of the leading developers of mobile games in the world. Its portfolio has some of the world\u2019s most popular mobile games, like Words with Friends, Empires and Puzzles, Toon Blast, CSR2, Poker, and many more. Zynga\u2019s mission is to connect people from everywhere in the world through games.", "Building successful applications for a wide range of users is challenging. How difficult should the daily challenge be? What game mode should we recommend? Each user is different, which makes it difficult to build an application that fits everyone\u2019s needs. The difference can be due to the player\u2019s demographics, location, or even their style of play. As a result, building personalized user experiences has the potential to increase user engagement and retention.", "While there are many knobs and levers to control during a user\u2019s session, personalization can be boiled down to a common pattern: given a user\u2019s state, select an action in order to maximize a long term reward.", "These are examples of typical state, actions, and rewards in our personalization problems at Zynga:", "Zynga has a long history of using personalization to enhance the game experience. One simple method that has been used with a lot of success is rule-based optimization. This approach splits players into segments (or groups) based on the player\u2019s attributes and delivers a custom experience for each of those segments.", "Segmentation works well for broad groups but becomes less effective for fine-grained personalization. The process is also very manual and requires a human in the loop to make any adjustments. This leads to a few issues:", "The rise of deep learning and its combination with reinforcement learning (RL) in recent years offers a new solution to personalization.", "Deep learning is a type of machine learning that uses artificial neural networks to learn complex relationships in data. Given a large set of data and expected output, the neural network is trained to learn the pattern that transforms the input data to the expected output.", "The layered architecture of these networks, in addition to the use of activation functions, allows these models to learn both lower and higher-level concepts in data, which is not possible using classical machine learning models.", "Deep learning experienced a high number of breakthroughs in recent years which led to a phenomenal number of successes in the fields, such as image and speech recognition and deep reinforcement learning.", "Reinforcement learning, on the other hand, is a classical machine learning technique. It focuses on training agents to make sequences of decisions that maximize the total reward over the long term. The long term aspect is key; agents do not select actions to optimize for the short term. Agents are able to incur a loss in the short term to receive a larger gain at a later point in time.", "A reinforcement learning agent interacts with an environment in a cycle and learns by trial and error. At each cycle, it:", "Deep reinforcement learning is the marriage of both techniques. The use of deep neural networks as a function approximation allowed agents to tackle problems that were not possible using classical reinforcement learning. It allowed agents to:", "Agents trained using deep reinforcement learning not only learn optimal strategies to solve complex problems, but also adapt to changes in the environment over time.", "Deep learning and deep reinforcement learning unlocked the power to solve problems that were not possible before, such as planning in a complex environment and learning patterns in high dimensional space. At Zynga, we believe that the use of deep reinforcement learning will continue to enable us to personalize our games to every user no matter their skill level, location, or demographic.", "In the next articles, we will share with you more information about the different use cases deep reinforcement learning agents are used in order to personalize our users\u2019 experience. We will also provide insights into our machine learning infrastructure and the deep reinforcement learning framework that we built and open-sourced called rl-bakery. Finally, we will share some of the main challenges and learnings we made during this process.", "Your home for data science.
