From a beginner through a tech lead, I coded in the unsinkable Cobol language. I worked the DB2 database, and then its shiny fast appliance, IDAA. Today I work full-time as a data scientist. Yes, it is possible. The skills I gained on the IT side were directly transferable to my current role. If you are considering making a similar transition, don\u2019t disregard your prior experience.", "Throughout those years, I focused on the data. Whether it was writing code, designing databases, or running analytics, data was always first. If I came across an issue that I was unfamiliar with, the first thing I would do would be to run a script to pull all of the surrounding data. I specialized in an are that recorded both batch and customer transactions. I would piece the data together to tell a story of what was happening. I imagined myself as that customer, winding my way through the system, leaving this trail of data exhaust.", "About six-plus years ago, I became interested in data science. I don\u2019t recall how or why, it\u2019s lost in a haze of midnight on-call pages (yes, pagers) and adding two children to the family. I started out with an Intro to DS course online, python, machine learning. Andrew Ng was my guide during this period of learning.", "As I began to use my new skills, I became inspired to look around at my work processes. What could benefit from machine learning? I once considered creating a prediction model for our incident ticket queue. Out of the hundreds of tickets in the backlog, were any silent bombs waiting to go off? At that time, most large non-tech companies did not have the tools in place for developers to dabble in this space. They weren\u2019t ready for me. I had to explore my data science interests on the side as a consultant.", "In the meantime, I took on a massive multi-year data analytics program at my job. I had the opportunity to help define what data we wanted to gather and how to store it. With future machine learning in mind, we created a robust historical database already explicitly formatted for analytics. It was an incredible amount of work with pretty aspirational goals, so I needed to get creative with getting enough coders on the project. We had to pull together data from hundreds of tables in multiple repositories (Db2, IDAA, Oracle, SQLServer, and Hive). We held internal hackathons to bring in folks to code up all of those data points. The hours were long, but a great cross-functional team pulled it out. The final code officially turned on, and we celebrated until the Ubers took people home. It was worth the work. The program continues to be a success, and the historical datastore is rich (and timestamped) for some exciting machine learning.", "As I was beginning to rotate off that project, I assessed. Will I be doing interesting things? Not really. It was time to jump in and marry my machine learning skills with my subject matter expertise in this program. I created some visioning proposals for the analysis department head on the business side that owned this program. How can we improve this process with machine learning? I made a successful business case and found myself invited to the business side to \u2018make it happen.\u2019", "Besides my specific data science training and consulting experience, there are many of my \u2018mainframe\u2019 skills that directly contribute to my success in my current role. I\u2019ve listed just a few below. These may sound quite familiar to you if you have come from an IT data role.", "One, if you are considering a transition from mainframe to data science, you can make it happen. You have many of the skills already.", "Two, if you are a new data scientist, there can be much learned from your \u2018dinosaur\u2019 mainframe co-workers.", "Your home for data science.
