Machine Learning and AI are completely revolutionizing the way modern problems are solved. One of the cool ways to apply Machine Learning is by using financial data. Finance data is a playground for Machine Learning.", "In this project, I analyze Tesla closing stock prices using Support Vector Regression with sci-kit-learn and an LSTM using Keras. This is my second Machine Learning project and I have continued to learn massive amounts of information about Machine Learning and Data Science. If you enjoy this check out my other project where I created a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize images of Nicolas Cage.", "When analyzing financial data with techniques like LSTM\u2019s and other algorithms, it\u2019s important to keep in mind that these are not guaranteed results. The stock market is incredibly unpredictable and rapidly changing. This was just a fun project to learn the some of the basic techniques that go into stock analysis using neural networks. This is not an article claiming that this technology will make you millions because it absolutely won\u2019t.", "LSTMs are a type of RNN with gates inside of each LSTM cell. I like to think of LSTM cells as a cell with its own tiny neural network inside of each one. These gates inside LSTM cells help the LSTM decide what data is important to be remembered and what data can be forgotten even on long series of data. The type of gates are the forget gate, the input gate, and the output gate. Below is an amazing visualization of what these LSTM cells look like from this video. This section is heavily influenced by this video and this article because of how awesome the explanations are:", "So LSTMs are sequential just like RNNs. The previous cell output is passed forward as input to the next cell. Let\u2019s break down what each gate inside of an LSTM cell is doing:", "Gates contain sigmoid activation functions. The sigmoid activation function can be thought of as a \u201csquishification\u201d function. It takes in numerical input and squishes the numbers into a range of 0 to 1. This is important as it allows us to avoid numbers in our network from getting massive and causing errors in learning.", "The forget gate takes the previous hidden state from the previous LSTM cell and the current input and multiples them. Values closer to 0 means forget the data, and values closer to 1 means keep this data.", "This gate updates the cell state with the new data we want to store in the cell state. The input gate takes the previous hidden state multiplied by the input and passes it through a sigmoid. Values closer to 0 are not important and values closer to 1 are important. Then the previous hidden state is multiplied by the input and passed into a tan activation function which squishes the values into a range of -1 to 1. Then, the sigmoid output is multiplied by the tan output. The sigmoid output decides what information is important to keep from the tan output.", "Memory of the network. This can be thought of as an \u201cinformation highway\u201d that carries the memories from previous cells onto future cells. The gates make changes to to the cell state and then pass that information to the next cell. Once the forget gate and input gate have been calculated we can calculate the value of the cell state.", "The output gate decides what the next hidden state should be. We take the previous hidden state multiply it by the input and pass into a sigmoid activation function. Then we pass the cell state value into a tan activation function. We then multiply the tan output by the sigmoid output to decide what data the hidden state should carry on to the next LSTM cell.", "Your home for data science.
