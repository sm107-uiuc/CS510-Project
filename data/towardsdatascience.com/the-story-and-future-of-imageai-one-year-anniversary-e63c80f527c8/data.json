It\u2019s been been a year and 2 months since We announced ImageAI, a computer vision library we built to enable developers of any level of expertise to access and integrate state-of-the-art computer vision functionalities powered by deep learning. Today, ImageAI is being used by over 65,000 developers, engineers, college students, research institutes, businesses and emerging startups around the world to build incredible ideas and innovations.", "In this post, I will be addressing 3 points on the project which are the", "- Prominent applications and case studies", "- Timeline and features for the Next Version", "When we published the ImageAI library coupled with it\u2019s documentation in English language and various tutorials highlighting the implementations of its functionalities, we had no idea the extent at which the project whose source code originated from our computer systems will be used across various countries and various industries around the world. Since the past one year and two months, ImageAI", "Over the past 1 year, I have received over 1000 emails from various developers, engineers, students and researchers based in various parts of the world on how they have been applying ImageAI to power incredible innovations and projects they are working on. Interestingly, some of these individuals and groups have no prior knowledge of computer programming when they started using the ImageAI library. With the simple, well documented but yet powerful recognition, detection and analysis features ImageAI provides, the 3 case studies listed below were made possible. Soon I will be publishing comprehensive articles detailing each case study.", "Professor Sandy Wilkinson is an historian working on preserving millions of historical ornamentation and illustrations printed in Europe before the year 1800. His department has digital copies of these illustrations but had been having problems manually sorting them due to the enormous manual task involved. Professor Sandy was able to train a custom recognition model in just 5 lines of code using ImageAI which automated the sorting of millions of the digital copies, saving him thousands of hours of manual work. In his words, he said", "\u201c As an historian, I found your github software fantastically helpful! I have trained a test RESNET50 model following your detailed and very helpful instructions. It produces astonishingly accurate results.\u201d", "My joy knew no bounds on the weekend of March 2, 2019 when I heard the story of 14-year old Omshreshti, a brilliant and one of the most talented teenagers in India. Omshreshti participated in a Raspberry Pi Anniversary IoT Science Fair in India and until the final moments of the event, he had not been able to figure out how to deploy state-of-the-art computer vision in his project. A brilliant data scientist by the name Soma Bhadra then suggested that Omshreshti implements ImageAI detection functionalities into his projects.", "Within minutes, the young teen Omshreshti had his project running one of the most advanced object detection algorithms on his project . The most beautiful part was that his project became the most popular at the IoT Science Fair and his friends hoisted him on their shoulders & cheered him apparently! In his words, Omshreshti said", "\u201c Thank You so much! Your ImageAI library helped me submit & be the most popular too. Hope more people benefit from it & contribute to it too. I hope I learn enough to contribute also.\u201d", "With the limitless possibilities that deep learning and computer vision have, Andrew Scott Meyers, a Masters Student at UC Berkeley, USA used ImageAI to build a waste scanner project which they showcased at the the just concluded UC Berkeley Design Innovation Showcase. This passionate team of researchers were able to leverage state-of-the-art recognition and detection algorithms to identify waste and manage waste disposal in solving global environmental issues; all possible using the easy to use functionalities of ImageAI. In his words, Andrew said", "\u201c There was plenty of interest in this project at the showcase and most were impressed with the ease of implementing our idea using the ImageAI library. We are immensely thankful for ImageAI, and are excited to point others to your work.\u201d", "We have been inspired by the stories, use cases, videos, tutorials, contents and research work that has been generated with ImageAI . It has been 10 months since the last update was made to ImageAI (v2.0.2) . We have reviewed all the comments, suggestions and feedback from the community of developers using and supporting this project. We will also like to use this opportunity to thank them for their patience in the past months waiting for the next version. Our team had been working on various projects including ImageAI. The next version will be released latest by June 15, 2019 and will provide the following functionalities:", "In preparation for this release, we have launched the ImageAI forum to ensure we an connect with the community of developers using ImageAI, discuss on bugs, feature request, classes and functions clarifications, tutorials, documentations, sample applications and use case stories.", "As always, the new release will be fully documented, sample codes for all new features will be provided and extensive number of tutorials will be be published. If you will like to reach out to us and discuss on the project, feel free to join the ImageAI forum linked above.", "ImageAI is developed and maintained by the DeepQuest AI team.", "\u201cAt DeepQuest AI, our mission which we chose to accept is to advance and democratize Artificial Intelligence and make it accessible to every individual and organization on the planet.\u201d", "If you desire to contact us directly on your team or individual project, you can always reach to me via my email and social profiles below.", "Your home for data science.
