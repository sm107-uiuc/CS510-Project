Until recently (through the end of 2018), LendingClub published a public dataset of all loans issued since the company\u2019s launch in 2007. I\u2019m accessing the dataset via Kaggle.", "With 2,260,701 loans to look at and 151 potential variables, my goal is to create a neural network model with TensorFlow and Keras to predict the fraction of an expected loan return that a prospective borrower will pay back. This will require a lot of data cleaning given the state of the dataset, and I\u2019ll walk through that entire process here. After building and training the network, I\u2019ll create a public API to serve that model.", "Also, as you may have guessed from the preceding code block, this post is adapted from a Jupyter Notebook. If you\u2019d like to follow along in your own notebook, go ahead and fork mine on Kaggle or GitHub.", "I\u2019ll first look at the data dictionary (downloaded directly from LendingClub\u2019s website) to get an idea of how to create the desired output variable and which remaining features are available at the point of loan application (to avoid data leakage).", "For the output variable (the fraction of expected return that was recovered), I\u2019ll calculated the expected return by multiplying the monthly payment amount (installment) by the number of payments on the loan (term), and I\u2019ll calculate the amount actually received by summing the total principle, interest, late fees, and post-chargeoff gross recovery received (total_rec_prncp, total_rec_int, total_rec_late_fee, recoveries) and subtracting any collection fee (collection_recovery_fee).", "Several other columns contain either irrelevant demographic data or data not created until after a loan is accepted, so those will need to be removed. I\u2019ll hold onto issue_d (the month and year the loan was funded) for now, though, in case I want to compare variables to the date of the loan.", "emp_title (the applicant\u2019s job title) does seem relevant in the context of a loan, but it may have too many unique values to be useful.", "Too many unique values indeed. In a future version of this model, I could perhaps try to generate a feature from this column by aggregating job titles into categories, but that effort may have a low return on investment, since there are already columns for annual income and length of employment.", "Two other interesting columns that I\u2019ll also remove are title and desc (\u201cdescription\u201d), which are both freeform text entries written by the borrower. These could be fascinating subjects for natural language processing, but that\u2019s outside the scope of the current project. Perhaps in the future, I could generate additional features from these fields using measures like syntactic complexity, word count, or keyword inclusion. (I ended up exploring this line of thinking in a later post using document vectors.)", "Before creating the output variable, however, I must take a closer look at loan_status, to see if any loans in the dataset are still open.", "For practical purposes, I\u2019ll consider loans with statuses that don\u2019t contain \u201cFully Paid\u201d or \u201cCharged Off\u201d to still be open, so I\u2019ll remove those from the dataset. I\u2019ll also merge the \u201ccredit policy\u201d columns with their matching status.", "Now to create the output variable. I\u2019ll start by checking the null counts of the variables involved.", "Every remaining row has each of these seven variables, but term\u2019s data type is object, so that needs to be fixed first.", "Ah, so term is a categorical feature with two options. I\u2019ll treat it as such when I use it as an input to the model, but to calculate the output variable I\u2019ll create a numerical column from it.", "Also, I need to trim the whitespace from the beginning of those values \u2014 that\u2019s no good.", "Now I can create the output variable.", "There is at least one odd outlier on the right in both categories. But also, many of the \u201cfully paid\u201d loans do not quite reach 1. One potential explanation is that when the last payment comes in, the system just flips loan_status to \u201cFully Paid\u201d without adding the payment amount to the system itself, or perhaps simply multiplying installation by the term number leaves off a few cents in the actual total. If I were performing this analysis for Lending Club themselves, I\u2019d ask them, but this is just a personal project. I\u2019ll consider every loan marked \u201cFully Paid\u201d to have fully recovered the expected return.", "For that matter, I\u2019ll cap my fraction_recovered values for charged off loans at 1.0 as well, since at least one value is above that for some reason.", "For the sake of curiosity, I\u2019ll plot the distribution of fraction recovered for charged-off loans.", "Now that the output is formatted, it\u2019s time to clean up the inputs. I\u2019ll check the null counts of each variable.", "Remaining columns with lots of null values seem to fall into three categories:", "I\u2019ll first look at those more confusing columns to find out whether or not they\u2019re a newer set of metrics. That\u2019ll require converting issue_d to date format first.", "It appears that these are indeed newer metrics, their use only beginning in December 2015, but even after that point usage is spotty. I\u2019m curious to see if these additional metrics would make a model more accurate, though, so once I\u2019m done cleaning the data I\u2019ll copy the rows with these new metrics into a new dataset and create another model using the new metrics.", "As for the derogatory/delinquency metrics, taking a cue from Michael Wurm, I\u2019m going to take the inverse of all the \u201cmonths since recent/last\u201d fields, which will turn each into a proxy for the frequency of the event and also let me set all the null values (when an event has never happened) to 0. For the \u201cmonths since oldest\u201d fields, I\u2019ll just set the null values to 0 and leave the rest untouched.", "Now to look closer at joint loans.", "It seems there may be a case of newer metrics for joint applications as well. I\u2019ll investigate.", "Newer than the previous set of new metrics, even \u2014 these didn\u2019t start getting used till March 2017. Now I wonder when joint loans were first introduced.", "2015. I think I\u2019ll save the newer joint metrics for perhaps a third model, but I believe I can include annual_inc_joint, dti_joint, and verification_status_joint in the main model\u2014I\u2019ll just binary-encode application_type, and for individual applications I\u2019ll set annual_inc_joint, dti_joint, and verification_status_joint equal to their non-joint counterparts.", "Now the only remaining steps should be removing rows with null values (in columns that aren\u2019t new metrics) and encoding categorical features.", "I\u2019m removing rows with null values in those columns because that should still leave the vast majority of rows intact, over 1 million, which is still plenty of data. But I guess I should make sure before I overwrite loans.", "Then actually I\u2019ll tackle earliest_cr_line and its joint counterpart first before looking at the categorical features.", "I should convert that to the age of the credit line at the time of application (or the time of loan issuing, more precisely).", "Now a look at those categorical features.", "First, in researching income verification, I learned that LendingClub only tries to verify income on a subset of loan applications based on the content of the application, so this feature is a source of target leakage. I\u2019ll remove the two offending columns (and a couple more I don\u2019t need anymore).", "Once I create my pipeline, I\u2019ll binary encode term, one-hot encode home_ownership and purpose, and since emp_length is an ordinal variable, I\u2019ll convert it to the integers 0\u201310.", "That should cover all the cleaning necessary for the first model\u2019s data. I\u2019ll save the columns that\u2019ll be used in the first model to a new DataFrame, and while I\u2019m at it, I\u2019ll start formatting the DataFrames for the two additional models adding the two sets of new metrics.", "Before I drop a bunch of rows with nulls from loans_2, I\u2019m concerned about il_util, as it\u2019s missing values in about 50,000 more rows than the rest of the new metric columns. Why would that be?", "Peeking back up to the data dictionary, il_util is the \u201cratio of total current balance to high credit/credit limit on all install acct\u201d. The relevant balance (total_bal_il) and credit limit (total_il_high_credit_limit) metrics appear to already be in the data, so perhaps this utilization metric doesn\u2019t contain any new information. I\u2019ll compare il_util (where it\u2019s present) to the ratio of the other two variables.", "That\u2019s weird. il_util is equal to the computed ratio three-quarters of the time, but when it\u2019s off, the median difference is 10 points off. Perhaps there\u2019s new information there sometimes after all. Maybe whatever credit bureau is reporting the utilization rate uses a different formula than just a simple ratio? Again, something I could ask if I were performing this analysis for a client, but that\u2019s not the case. I\u2019ll assume that this variable is still valuable, and where il_util is null I\u2019ll impute the value to make it equal to the ratio of total_bal_il to total_il_high_credit_limit (or 0 if the limit is 0). And I\u2019ll add one more boolean field to mark the imputed entries.", "Also, that 1,108 is a doozy of an outlier, but I think I\u2019ll just leave it be, as it appears that outliers aren\u2019t too big a deal if the neural network architecture is sufficiently deep.", "Good. Ready to drop rows with nulls in loans_2 and move on to the DataFrame for the model that adds the new metrics for joint applications.", "Phew, the data\u2019s all clean now! Time for the fun part.", "After a good deal of trial and error, I found that a network architecture with three hidden layers, each followed by a dropout layer of rate 0.3, was as good as I could find. I used ReLU activation in those hidden layers, and adam optimization and a loss metric of mean squared error in the model as a whole. I also settled on a mean squared logarithmic error loss function, since it performed better than mean absolute error, mean squared error, and mean absolute percentage error.", "The dataset being so large, I had great results increasing the batch size for the first couple models.", "The first model performed best, settling around a mean squared logarithmic error of 0.0231 (though it seems even after setting random_state inside train_test_split and seed inside the dropout layers, there\u2019s still a bit of entropy left in the training of the model, so if you run this notebook yourself, the course of your training may look a little different). Apparently the additional records in the first dataset did more to aid in training than the additional metrics in the subsequent sets. And the dropout layers didn\u2019t stop the third model from overfitting anyway.", "First I need to create the final model, training model_1\u2019s architecture on the full dataset. Then I\u2019ll save the model to disk with its save function and save the data transformer using joblib so I can use it in the API.", "I first tried building this API and its demonstrational front end on Glitch, which, officially, only supports Node.js back ends, but unofficially you can get a Python server running there (which I\u2019ve done before using Flask). When I was almost finished, though, I tried importing TensorFlow to load my model, and it was then that I discovered that unlike Node.js dependencies, Python dependencies get installed to your project\u2019s disk space on Glitch, and not even their pro plan provides enough space to contain the entire TensorFlow library. Which totally makes sense \u2014 I certainly wasn\u2019t using the platform as intended.", "Then I discovered PythonAnywhere! They have plenty of common Python libraries already installed out-of-the-box, including TensorFlow, so I got everything working perfectly there.", "So head on over if you\u2019d like to check it out; the front end includes a form where you can fill in all the parameters for the API request, and there are a couple of buttons that let you fill the form with typical examples from the dataset (since there are a lot of fields to fill in). Or you can send a GET request to https://tywmick.pythonanywhere.com/api/predict if you really want to include every parameter in your query string. In either case, you\u2019re also more than welcome to take a look at its source on GitHub.", "One of the best/worst things about machine learning is that your models always have room for improvement. I mentioned a couple of ideas along the way above for how I could improve the model in the future, but what\u2019s the first thing you would tweak? Leave a response\u2014I\u2019d love to hear!", "Your home for data science.
