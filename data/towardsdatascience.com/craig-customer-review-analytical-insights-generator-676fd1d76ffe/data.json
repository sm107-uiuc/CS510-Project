Hope everyone is staying safe and healthy amid the outbreak.", "Today I thought I\u2019d share a fun project that my team at Gesture has worked on. A quick shoutout to Christopher Riggio and Meghna Muralidharan for being awesome team members.", "The CRAIG dashboard is not your everyday, go-to dashboard for the executives when it comes to measuring company performance, or evaluating metrics for company\u2019s bottom line, but rather an innovative yet practical application of data to drive behavioral analytics. The project is an attempt to better understand customer experience by analyzing reviews of our company\u2019s products, and identify aspects of a product that may be indicative of trend or insight.", "Needless to say, reviews are an essential way for businesses to gauge product and service performance. Through them, we can identify the things that drive good and bad customer experience and allow company room for improvement. By analyzing a vast sea of customer reviews that exist across online business platforms such as Yelp and Google Places, companies are able to align their products and services to better meet the needs and wants of customers, thereby increasing retention and positive brand awareness.", "Here at Gesture, an on-demand gift delivery app, we leverage the technology in natural language processing and data wrangling to gain insights into product reviews using CRAIG, Customer Review Analytical Insights Generator. With CRAIG, we can gain a deeper understanding of individual customer experience at both granular and aggregated level. By distilling and analyzing product reviews from Yelp, CRAIG has built in practical applications to assist efforts across departments, such as:", "So, what are the functionalities in CRAIG?", "To provide a visual breakdown, here is what CRAIG looks like.", "We gathered over 20,000 reviews from florist shops and cupcake shops across three states, California, Illinois and New York from Yelp. The script to gather data is triggered on a scheduled basis via the Google Cloud Function, where data is scraped, cleaned and safely loaded onto our Google Cloud Platform.", "The Positive Keywords chart is a visual representation of the most positive keywords by count frequency. It displays keywords (mix of bigrams and trigrams) that increase average ratings of reviews. The color of each bar indicates sentiment- the darker the color is toward blue, more positive the review containing the keyword is, and the darker color is toward red, more negatively associated the reviews containing the keywords are.", "The findings validate our intuition that customer service is absolutely critical to a healthy and well-performing business, and businesses with positive ratings are highly likely to get recommended to others. Last minute delivery is also important, which is where Gesture strives to be an on-demand, delivery service that delivers gifts to your door within an hour.", "In case you\u2019re wondering how data is cleaned, the reviews take a number of preprocessing step, including lowercase of words, removal of punctuations and stop words, tokenization and lemmatization of reviews. The ngrams are generated by using TextBlob package and filtering based on location (state) and date.", "The negative keywords graph follows the same structure to that of positive keywords, but shows negative keywords that drive negative ratings. The colors on the graph are on a lighter scale of blue, signifying less positive sentiment than those observed in positive reviews.", "We see that delivery is a common issue among bad reviews, in cases where customers have to call back due to unsatisfactory service of not having products delivered on time or delivered at all. Yellow roses don\u2019t seem to be a popular product of choice, either.", "The Keywords By Sentiment and Ratings graph is a visual report that allows the user to discover keywords by sentiment and rating. The two parameters have a positive correlation, where the higher the rating value is for a particular review, the more positive things the customer will say about his or her experience. The color of each circle remains consistent across all grids of CRAIG, and size of each circle corresponds to count. The bigger the circle, more often the keyword has been mentioned across the entire corpus of reviews.", "The final grid is a database of all reviews, vendors, and authors where a user can search for any review by entering keywords in the search box. It also has the option of navigating to each user profile, located in the first column.", "That completes CRAIG. CRAIG has been built to centralize all customer reviews into one dashboard, extract data coming from social channels, and allow business to better engage with customers. Thank you for reading and have a great day!", "Your home for data science.
