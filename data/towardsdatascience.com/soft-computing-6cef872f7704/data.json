The approach of SC techniques to solve problems imitate the remarkable power of human to think logically and learn from mistakes in an imprecise scenario. SC solves tremendous number of complex real world problems in different sections such as stock market predictions in business, computer aided diagnosis in medical, handwriting recognition in fraud detection , image retrieval, biometric application in image processing etc. and the list go on.", "The conventional algorithms, also termed as Hard Computing algorithms, follow mathematical methodologies strictly which make it inefficient to solve real world problems by taking more computation time. The conventional algorithms require exact input data, use a precise methodology and generate a precise output which make it a crisp system. It fails when the input is not exact. Examples of conventional algorithms are merge sort, quick sort, binary search, greedy algorithm, dynamic programming etc which are deterministic.", "Soft Computing consists of numerous techniques that study the biological processes such as reasoning, genetic evolution, survival of the creatures and human nervous system. SC is an umbrella term that thoroughly study the simulation of reasoning, human nervous system and evolution in different fields:", "Fuzzy Logic is a technique that understands the vagueness of a solution and presents the solution with a degree of vagueness which is practical to human decision. It is widely applied in several applications of Artificial Intelligence for reasoning.", "Neural Network is a network of artificial neurons, inspired by biological network of neurons, that uses mathematical models as information processing units to discover patterns in data which is too complex to notice by human.", "Evolutionary Computation is a family of optimization algorithms that are inspired by biological evolution such as Genetic Algorithm, survival of creatures such as Particle Swarm Intelligence, Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony optimization etc. or any biological processes.", "I hope I cleared some differences between Soft Computing and Hard Computing, and the basic reason of the existence of Soft Computing techniques. Sometimes, we forget to understand the basic meaning and go forward to learn higher knowledge. If you are interested to study the area, you may refer the book \u201cPrinciples of Soft Computing\u201d by S.N. Sivanandam and S.N. Deepa , Wiley Publicaction.
