While the brain has baffled us for many centuries, we are now finally beginning to understand how it works, but more importantly, how we can fundamentally extract signals and find patterns to fix neurodegenerative anomalies and enable advanced physiological capabilities. Now, with advances in machine intelligence, deep learning, and electrode hardware, we can isolate and analyze brain signals, allowing scientists and researchers to understand thoughts and perceptions at the base level which opens up the possibility of neuromodulation using computers.", "This series is an attempt to allow a person with no expertise in the brain-computer interface (BCI) area to understand what they are and how we can use machine learning to analyze brainwaves in unique ways. The project explored in this series is in collaboration with Dr. Chris Crawford of the Human Technology Interaction Lab (HTIL) at the University of Alabama. This also goes to demonstrate that amateur scientists can use basic electroencephalogram (EEG) devices to extract and analyze brainwaves, and in turn can deploy large-scale open source platforms so the general public can experiment with their own brain data.", "This series aims to provide a comprehensive guide to brain computer interfaces through the project described below. There will be four parts to this series: the first is an introduction to Muse and data storage, the second establishes the machine learning necessary for experimentation, the third talks about sophisticated machine learning algorithms used to increase accuracy, and the fourth is a general assessment of the field with commentary on the future of BCI.", "The project developed at HTIL is an EEG analysis platform that uses a Muse consumer-grade EEG headset and a web-based application to run simple and fast motor imagery and emotional classification experiments. It contains real-time data streaming, powerful integrated machine learning algorithms that provide high accuracy classifications, and interactive visualizations in a user-friendly interface.", "Here, we will cover the basics behind the project and this series starting with:", "In order to implement the section of the project described in this article, you will need the following:", "Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI) are devices that interface directly with brain-activity, measured by a device capable of reading brain activity known as an electroencephalogram (EEG). EEG devices record electrical activity through invasive or noninvasive electrode placement. Invasive BCI usually requires surgery which comes with the risk of infection or brain damage; however, the signals collected are much stronger. Noninvasive BCI are less intrusive and allow for a wider range of brain activity, but the signals collected are noisy and patterns aren\u2019t as easy to find. While intrusive BCI devices are the subject of many interesting research papers and groundbreaking technologies, the focus of this series will be on noninvasive BCI devices, since its much more practical for amateur researchers and the public to experiment with.", "As mentioned earlier, electrode placement is important in getting uninterrupted, clean signals from certain regions in the brain. Lots of research has been conducted internationally to determine a universal system of electrode placement, which ultimately resulted in the International 10\u201320 system. The 10\u201320 system is an internationally recognized scalp electrode placement system used in the context of EEG data collection.", "The \u201c10\u201d and \u201c20\u201d refer to the actual distances between adjacent electrodes, which are either 10% or 20% of the longitudinal and latitudinal skull distance relative to the nasion and inion (the front and back of the head respectively). Many noninvasive BCI devices employ this electrode placement system to collect streams of brain data. For example, the Muse, designed by the InteraXon company in 2014, is a consumer-grade wearable EEG headband designed to collect brainwave data for meditation purposes. Researchers have looked into re-purposing the Muse device for other use cases as findings have shown that the placement of its electrodes provides motor imagery and emotional classification capabilities. For example, Munawar Riyadi et al. developed a motor imagery classification model using Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms with the Muse device that reached a 86.6% training accuracy and a 100% test accuracy in identifying motor states. Furthermore, Zhen Li, Jianjun Xu, and Tingshao Zhu et al. developed a motor imagery classification model using Common spatial pattern (CSP) and SVM algorithms with the Muse device that reached a 95.1% accuracy. These kinds of advances allow researchers to use brainwave data from the Muse in motor imagery without direct or invasive motor cortex interaction.", "While BCI devices use electrodes to collect data, exactly what type of data is being collected? When people perform any cognitive functions, physical or mental, the brain produces electrical signals (data) which are detected by electrodes. Brainwaves are not the source or cause of these brain states, rather they are observable reflections of these complex processes. Brainwaves are classified based on their amplitude and frequency. For example, low activity brainwaves have a low frequency and high amplitude whereas high activity brainwaves have a high frequency and low amplitude. Within these two, researchers have identified five different frequency ranges of these electrical signals based on their specific cognitive correlation: delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma as shown below.", "Cognitive functions related to motor imagery and emotional classification are detected through alpha and beta waves, and are best expressed through a phenomena known as event-related desynchronization (ERD) and synchronization (ERS). We can use devices such as the Muse to detect such sensorimotor activity.", "When you first use a Muse device, you notice that the company has already developed a built-in connection system for iOS platforms that allow users to stream data from their Muse to their respective Muse mobile app. While working on a project at HTIL, I noticed that the Muse offers no web interface solution for streaming data, but my lab had developed a way to extract data from Muse in a Chrome browser. Before we get into the specifics of how a Bluetooth connection with the Muse is established, it is important to understand Chrome\u2019s Web Bluetooth API.", "The above figure shows the basic interface for Chrome\u2019s Web Bluetooth API, that allows users to connect Bluetooth devices in native apps and web browsers as well. It takes advantage of the Chrome Remote Interface to bridge the Muse Bluetooth system with Chrome\u2019s Bluetooth system.", "HTIL has developed a solution to this problem, but the code is proprietary information and must be used along with its source if your application is deployed publicly. Contact me for further information for access to those files.", "When running a web app with that bridge, the Bluetooth system in Chrome will look for Muse devices ready to pair, and the host will show the devices it recognizes. This Bluetooth bridge system has a lot going on under the hood, but the main takeaway is that you can now pair your Muse EEG with a web browser and start streaming data using a web app.", "Now that our Bluetooth system is in place, let\u2019s take a look at the overall architecture of the application. In Figure 5, the first section of the diagram shows the connection between the Muse and Chrome\u2019s Bluetooth system. Before the results are visualized in the React web app, multiple steps occur: the data is streamed from the Muse device directly to the app where it is stored in a React Context, the data is pre-processed through a data bandpass filter, BCI.js is used to enable machine-learning based analysis and classification, and the results are visualized through web components in the web app experiment dashboard. This all seems like a lot, and this article only focuses on data storage and Bluetooth, but in future articles we will cover each step of the process thoroughly. Feel free to use this architecture diagram as a guide through this series and through your own projects.", "Once your Muse EEG is connected to Chrome\u2019s Bluetooth system, the device automatically starts streaming data from the four electrodes directly to your React web app. However, without the proper storage system, the data points that represent signals coming from those electrodes are dumped. To establish a jargon for electrode management, I will refer to the electrodes by their names on the International 10\u201320 system: AF7, AF8, TP9, and TP10. The MuseClient system established in BCIDevice.build.js already has a connection and data extraction system for only AF7, but it can be easily extrapolated to cover all four. The code below shows the startMuse function, which takes advantage of a map datatype for all four electrodes.", "You see in Figure 6 that we set a sampleRate of 256 which is the number of data points collected per second, and a buffer size of 2000, which is the maximum number of data points stored at any one time in an array containing brain data. We set a limit for the number of data points stored at any one time so that our machine learning models don\u2019t need more than a few seconds to train, which allows for a more real-time experience. The function goes through each electrode in the electrodeMap and runs the processUpdate function on it which contains two parameters, the electrode from the electrodeMap and the data payload itself; this function is extremely key for storage as it manages the data streams to allow the machine learning models to train and test properly.", "Before we jump into what the processUpdate function actually does, React states must be covered. There are two types of plain JavaScript objects that React uses to communicate between and within components: props and state. Prop, short for properties, are passed to the component (from parent component to child), while state contains private information available to edit and use only by the component that initialized it. Essentially, states are global variables used by the component class in all subsequent functions and renders. Since we don\u2019t need communication across multiple components, states is ideal for storage in this component. There are two capabilities that we want to be controlled by states: isRunning and a counter.", "isRunning is a boolean that tells us if the Muse is streaming important data for a training or testing set, and the counter is to let us know which phase of the experiment we are in. For example, in the switch statement in Figure 7, if isRunning is true and the counter is 1 then the first training session is being conducted. More of this will be covered in the next article on the machine learning that goes into this web app. The processUpdate function checks if the Muse is streaming data to an important dataset, and if it is, it determines which trial it should be allocated to, and if not the data is moved to a storage array which is dumped. The function then uses the FIFO (first in first out) storage technique to keep the maximum size of the array to 2000 data points; machine learning models don\u2019t work well with datasets that have varying amounts of data between them, so the simultaneous update feature for each electrode keeps the number of data points standardized across all electrode arrays. To summarize, this function checks which experiment is being conducted and puts the data points into the proper dataset. The feature to start and stop experiments, which calls the processUpdate function, is on a toggle that will be further explored in the experiment flow section of the next article. The system of states coupled with the use of electrode maps and the data management system in processUpdate allows for an end-to-end storage system, which can be duplicated across multiple experiments using React Contexts.", "Earlier, we covered the difference between props and states; if we want the component tree to have access to certain variables, each component would have to pass down props to the subsequent component. However, React has a built in API called Contexts that provides a way to pass data through the component tree without manually passing props through each component. The last section established the system for storing individual session data for the AF7, AF8, TP9, and TP10 electrodes, but Contexts will be used to manage multiple sessions and datasets to serve as training and testing data for the machine learning models.", "React Context documentation provides an easy way to set up Contexts, but there are two main capabilities we need to add: set functions and component return values (shown in Figure 8). For our experiment flow, two training sets and one testing set are needed for proper classification; therefore, we must set up our Context with storage for all three datasets. Contexts themselves contains state as well, but they allow us to pass that state between different components via the Context Provider. In the code, you can see that the state contains arrays for training1, training2, and testing datasets. The next step is to establish our set functions, which are functions that set the state to the property defined in the parameters. For example, if we have an array with the first training set data, we could use a set function to store the first training set data in a specific Context location. In the Context for this project there are three set functions for the training and test datasets; these functions now need to be available across all components. That\u2019s where the Context Provider comes in. In the render section, there is a wrapper called a Provider that \u201cprovides\u201d the values and functions to components; in this, we pass the state and set functions to the children components. The Context architecture seems simple, but it is extremely powerful for cross component storage in the way React has implemented it.", "Now that the Context is established, how can we access that data across components? There are two simple steps: Context establishment in child components and usage of set functions. In order to use the Context data in the component, you must use the command shown below, which allows the component access to use and change the data in the Context. Further in the component, there is an updateData function which uses the set function to store the training or testing set to the appropriate location in the Context, allowing the machine learning components to access it. For example, for case 3 in the updateData function, the command shown below sets the array (with data from four electrodes during that period) to the specific spot for training set 2 in the Context (shown in Figure 9). This data is then used in the machine learning components and visuals are created in the plot components. The full system, from storing individual electrode arrays using state to creating a Context for multiple trials, allows for end-to-end experimentation with motor and emotional classification.", "In this article, we have covered the basics of brain computer interfaces, how to connect the Muse EEG to Chrome\u2019s Web Bluetooth system, and how to manage data from different electrodes as well as multiple trials. You can now implement the solution stated above to start extracting and storing brain data across multiple participants. Below are some helpful tips:", "In Part 2 of the series, a machine learning foundation will be established to allow developers to extract patterns from brainwaves as we continue on our journey to develop this platform.", "As stated earlier, the code developed by HTIL is proprietary lab information and can only be used with acknowledgement of the source.
