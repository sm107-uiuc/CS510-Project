For example, data science projects focus on exploration and discovery, whereas software development typically focuses on implementing a solution to a well-defined problem. The ambiguities rarely occur in defining the requirements of a software product, understanding the customer needs, while even the scope may be changed for a data-driven solution.", "You can find many other differences between data science and software development, however engineers in both fields need to work on a consistent and well-structured project layout. Afterall data science projects include source code like any other software system to build a software product which is the model itself. Structuring the source code and the data associated with the project has many advantages. The main benefits of structuring your data science work include:", "Although to succeed in having reproducibility for your data science projects has many other dependencies, for example, if you don\u2019t override your raw data used for model building, in the following section, I will share some of the tools that can help you develop a consistent project structure, which facilitates reproducibility for data science projects.", "Cookiecutter is a command-line utility that creates projects from project templates. You can create your own project template, or use an existing one. What makes this tool so powerful is the way you can easily import a template and use only the parts that work for you the best.", "In this post, I am going to talk more about cookiecutter data science template. Installation is easy and straightforward. To install, run the following:", "To work on a template, you just fetch it using command-line:", "The tool asks for a number of configuration options and then you are good to go.", "The project structure looks like the following:", "The generated project template structure lets you to organize your source code, data, files and reports for your data science flow. This structure easies the process of tracking changes made to the project. There are five folders that I will explain in more detail:", "I modified one of the earlier projects I worked on for illustration purposes of how to utilize this tool. The repository is not optimized for a machine learning flow, though you can easily grasp the idea of organizing your data science projects following the link.", "GNU make is a tool that controls the generation of executables and non-source files of a program. It utilizes makefiles which lists all non-source files to be built in order to produce an expected outcome of a program. Makefiles help data scientists to set up their workflow immensely. Most of the time after a data science project is delivered, developers have a hard time remembering the steps taken to build the end product. Makefiles help data scientists to document the pipeline to reproduce the models built. This tool, therefore, should be in the toolbox of a data scientist.", "Makefile not only provides reproducibility but also it easies the collaboration in a data science team.

It provides a simple way to keep track of tools, libraries, authors involved in a project. For large projects, using tools like watermark would be a very simple and inefficient method to keep track of changes made.", "To install and use watermark, run the following command:", "Here is a demonstration of how it can be used to print out library versions. You can find more information in their documentation:", "I can tell by experience that data science projects generally do not have a standardized structure.
