I actually started off my career in technology consulting as my first job out of college. While it was a good first job, I didn\u2019t feel like it was a good long term fit for me. So outside of work, I got interested in trying to learn things really quickly, and I was experimenting with a lot of different skills, and one of my bigger projects was trying to earn a living playing poker.", "My goal at the time was to get good enough at poker to be able to fund my lifestyle. However there was one instance when I was playing poker where I ended up losing all my money. And for me, if I was going to invest a lot of money or an emotional energy into a skill, I might as well invest it into a skill that creates value for other people rather than to take value from somebody else as in poker. So I wanted to keep going with that probability and statistics route. As a result, I ended up moving into data science from there. Three years later, I am now a Data Scientist at DoorDash.", "How did you transition from your days at poker to data science at DoorDash?", "Initially, I was self-taught quite a bit. I did a lot of coding on my own. I took a couple of statistics classes in college, so I did have some understanding of linear regression, decision trees, and random forest. I probably spent about six to nine months just pure studying.", "Then I transitioned into my first job at a startup called Dataquest, which is an AdTech company. I was building out courses and doing analysis for our marketing teams. But I wanted to really develop my machine learning skills, and I think that depending on the company you go into, there will be a need for machine learning or experimental analysis. DoorDash had a specific machine learning team, and I ended up joining the team.", "What projects do you take on at DoorDash?", "For context, at DoorDash, we have three different teams related to data science. We have analytics data scientists where they are focused on experiment analysis, as well as focused on building dashboards and doing analysis that supports specific businesses.", "We then have the machine learning engineers who are building more of the infrastructure, doing a lot of the modeling, and a lot of the productionization of the models. My team, which is the data science machine learning team, we sit right in the middle of the spectrum between those two endpoints. So we are building a lot of models that are focused on business impact. We are also helping on experiment analysis, and doing some in data engineering and business analysis as well.", "For me specifically, I\u2019ve been working on projects such as a recommendation system, adding new features to show you the most relevant restaurants, and building out pipelines to get recommendations into our emails, and marketing attribution and marketing segmentation. We\u2019re also building out a model that predicts sales as well.", "Do the three data teams work cross-collaboratively?", "For the most part, it really depends on the project that you\u2019re working on. When my projects are much more engineering-focused like building up pipelines to making things faster, there isn\u2019t as much of a need to incorporate somebody on the business side. That\u2019s mainly me and engineering teams as an engineering-focused project.", "However there are projects like experiment analysis for new features where we need to understand its impact. This will require us to more closely collaborate with engineering because they are going to help execute the experiment, as well as the business side because they want to understand how how this new feature impacts our business.", "So it seems like DoorDash applicants should be pretty clear on these different roles and how they can take advantage of their own strength.", "I would say it\u2019s a combination of taking advantage of what you think you\u2019re good at and what experience that you have. I would still say that if you are somebody who is very experienced on experiment analysis side and you want to get more into the modeling side, definitely still keep that in mind. I think in general in tech companies, if you can articulate what you want and create value with what you want, you can then pretty much get into any role.", "One example would be where you\u2019re very good at statistics and analyzing experiments, but you want to do more machine learning. The best way to go about that is, you can find business problems within the company where machine learning is the best way to solve this problem. And if you can show your manager that this solution will have a significant impact on the business, your manager will most likely allow you to do it.", "How is the application process like in general at DoorDash?", "So the application process isn\u2019t something that\u2019s too different compared to most tech companies. If you go to our careers website, you can see the specific step by step process. We will have an initial call with a recruiter. Next, you\u2019ll have a take home assignment, where you\u2019ll be graded on your ability to build a machine learning model and go through the end-to-end process. If that looks good, we\u2019ll have a review call, and we\u2019ll ask you a couple of questions about your technique and understand your thought process on why you made certain decisions. If that looks good, you\u2019ll come to the onsite, where we will test you on your business, machine learning, coding, and values.", "Have you also an opportunity to be part of this recruitment process yourself at DoorDash?", "Yes I\u2019ve done a good amount of reviewing take homes and reviewing calls. From my experience from grading take homes, the biggest pitfall or the biggest weakness I\u2019ve seen in most Data Scientists on the market is being able to connect the machine learning model to the business impact. So a lot of very very smart people build this very complicated five layer neural network that makes great prediction that scores very highly. But then when we dig into the business impact of the specific model, they usually have a little bit of trouble answering that. And ultimately, we need machine learning to be impactful for the business. That is very important.", "So how can applications prepare for those kinds of questions when they are related to the business impact?", "I think the first step would be just the act of thinking about the business aspect. Ask yourself: \u201cSo I built this model. Now how is this actually impactful for the business?\u201d That will make you to think, \u201cWell, businesses likely have certain metrics to gauge the health of the business\u201d. That can be revenue, profitability, cost, etc. If you\u2019re not too familiar with these business terms, I\u2019d recommend reading up on key business metrics that companies measure.", "I\u2019d also advocate to take a step deeper for whatever you\u2019re interviewing for. Let\u2019s say it\u2019s marketing analytics position. You\u2019re like, \u201cOkay. What is a marketing analyst? What does a marketing person care about when they are doing their day to day work? Well, marketing cares about getting more users, they care about retaining their users, and they care about spending less on ads by being able to get more users with less money\u201d.", "So you say, \u201cOkay, I know what they care about. So if I build this model, how does this actually effect the things they care about?\u201d If it\u2019s hard to think through that gap, then it might be a signal to research more about how this could be more valuable or this might not be valuable for this specific side of the business.", "Lastly, I would generally remind Data Scientists to be empathetic towards those on the business side make sure you understand things from their perspective because they don\u2019t know what ensembling, parameter tuning, or AUC of 95% means. So trying to understand things from their perspective in being able to convert that model to the things that they care about is very useful.", "What are the strategies you used to find success in getting into DoorDash as a Data Scientist?", "I use three main strategies that hit on different parts of the pipeline for general data science recruiting. 1) I sent a cold email to the recruiter and the hiring manager. 2) I used something that Ramit Sethi called the briefcase technique. And 3) I utilized data analytics that I created to optimize how I should spend my time for different parts of the job application.", "For detailed and nuanced look into the three documents that Jeff created and strategically deployed for his application success, please watch the video. The section below will only cover the importance of the three documents.", "What is the importance of this document?", "For context, while I was going through the job hunting process, one of the biggest challenges I had was: how to best spend my time (interviews, application, practicing code, responding to questions, etc.)? And I didn\u2019t know how to best spend my time. So what I wanted to do was use analytics / data science to solve this problem for finding a job in data science. And since I\u2019ve gone through the job hunt process multiple times, I had enough data points to map out and be able to pull some insights.", "This spreadsheet is something I put together to map out the funnel of my job interview process. The first half maps out each part of the interview process. The last part maps out the different type of channels I used to get more interviews.", "What\u2019s the advantage of leveraging this analytics spreadsheet during the application process?", "Like a lot of data science problems, this is also like an optimization problem; optimizing finite number of resources to maximize our gain. If you\u2019re interested in that topic, I\u2019d recommend looking into linear programming. I didn\u2019t use any machine learning models for this one because the data points are very small, and given you have to acquire enough data to get these insights.", "But I think it\u2019s very good for maximizing the efficiency of your time. In data science, you can be studying statistics, machine learning, coding, and you can be spending time doing your take home, but the problem is: how do I know which is maximally valuable for me? This spreadsheet definitely solves this problem.", "For instance, let\u2019s say I have three hours to study for interviews or to prepare for my job hunt. How can I effectively allocate that time so that I can maximize the chance of getting the job offer? You can address this concern with the spreadsheet.", "What are the strategic points behind this letter?", "This letter delves into more skills on understanding human psychology and understanding general writing to hook recipients into the letter.", "1st paragraph: The idea is to first really respect somebody\u2019s time and mention that (even on my end, I get quite a lot of messages and emails asking me for something). Then establish the source of how you found them and why you\u2019re emailing them.", "2nd paragraph: Build out your credential; why you are a good fit for this role. Highlight different parts of your skillset that makes you different from everybody else.", "3rd paragraph: Show who you are as a person outside of work. That way, someone who is reading this document, the reader can understand that the applicant has technical skills and communication skills and is very committed to being a better person. Everyone has a differentiating factor. For those who want to use this template, think deeply about what differentiates you.", "4th paragraph: Use the Golden Line. Using the golden line actually gets the reader to respond faster to your email. It shows consideration of their priorities and you can understand things from their perspective.", "What is the briefcase document and how can applicants best use it?", "The idea is that when you\u2019re going through the interview process and having a good conversation, what you do at the end of interview is say, \u201cWait one second. I took some time to think about some of your problems. And I prepared something for you\u201d. And then you whip out your briefcase in a very dramatic fashion and you show the hiring manager that you\u2019ve understood their pain points and you\u2019ve detailed solutions to solving those specific pain points.", "From the hiring manager\u2019s perspective, they are salivating, because they are thinking: \u201cIf I hire this applicant, this person will come in with those problems in mind and they will solve my problems\u201d.", "So the briefcase technique is a document that outlines the pain points the company has and ideas and projects that you propose to solve those specific pain points. The projects are at a great level of detail, such as resources you are going to use, the amount of time you think this is going to require, and the outline of the project you think you are going to work on. So at a level of detail that\u2019s very easy to implement these ideas.", "I should mention that whenever I presented this document on the level of onsite, I\u2019d gotten the job offer every time.", "Switching gears, what\u2019s the TinderBot article you wrote for TowardsDataScience.com?", "I wanted to learn about how Convolutional Neural Network and deep learning worked. The way I approached learning was to find problems that I wanted to solve with the skillset that I have.", "In this scenario, I felt like dating apps took up too much time. I thought it was easier to build CNN that would actually classify profiles that I would and would not like for me. And through this process, I learned how Neural Networks work, what the differences are between different DNNs and other challenges like tuning.", "Has this article had any impact on the recruiting process?", "The impact was more indirect. It gave me a great selling point for when I was pitching to recruiters in that email. It was very important for nontechnical hiring managers and recruiters to understand what I did and my thought process for building out that project.", "Final question: do you have any words of advice for the TDS audience on the recruiting process as a whole?", "When I was playing poker, there was one concept where you can make the right moves in poker but you might still lose money. This concept applies to everything in life. There is always random chance in our day-to-day. Sometimes we might do the right thing but it might not be a positive outcome for us. This directly applies to recruiting. In recruiting, there are so many variables, so much random chance involved, it\u2019s hard to control for those kinds of things.", "So I would say with recruiting, just focus on things you can do that are in your control and focus on making the right moves. They might be sending 3 cold emails per day. Always sending a thank you email. Doing this briefcase technique. These are the things that are in your control. But remember that sometimes there are a lot of random luck involved and things might not go your way.", "If you have any more questions, don\u2019t hesitate to check out my website here: http://www.jefflichronicles.com/.", "If you\u2019re interested in applying to DoorDash, click here: https://www.doordash.com/careers/", "Your home for data science.
