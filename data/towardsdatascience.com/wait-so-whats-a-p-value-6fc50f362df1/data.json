Suppose we have two basketball teams\u2026", "Team B \u2014 High School All-Stars", "For the sake of this example, let\u2019s assume Team A is full of NBA players and Team B are high school all-stars. Given this talent imbalance, we\u2019ve assumed the probability of Team A winning each game is 99%.", "So what if the teams were to play each other 100 times? What would be the probability that Team A wins 99 out of 100 games?", "Unfortunately, it\u2019s quite a bit lower. The probability Team A wins 99 out of 100 games is roughly 37%. This may seem unintuitive but forget about the number for a second and think about the amount of games Team A can win.", "Team A does have a high probability of winning 99 games, but it also has a high probability to win 100 or 98 games. We must factor in Team A winning every game or less than 99 games. The table to left are the probabilities for 90+ games won. Winning 99 games is the most likely outcome but winning 100 or 98 games is also likely.", "So now you can ask yourself, what is the probability that Team A wins 96 games? Well, a measly 1.49% chance of this happening.", "Note, we won\u2019t dive into the calculation but I\u2019ve listed the formulas at the end of the article and a reference here.", "Let\u2019s say you vacation to a remote island for a week with no connection to the outside world. When you come back, Team A and Team B played the 100 games and your friend asks \u201cHey, what if I told you they only won 93 games?\u201d \u201cHA, I\u2019d say the probability of that happening is less than 1% and you\u2019re no longer my friend.\u201d", "Although tongue-in-cheek, when you hear a new drug\u2019s success is statistically significant they are assessing the probability of a successful result (think number of games played). This result is deemed successful if the probability of success is less than a certain threshold \u2014 industry standard is typically 5%. Even though there is a random chance of this result happening, it\u2019s unlikely enough to conclude our results are successful.", "On a high level, next time you hear a new drug showed statistical significance, think\u2026", "For all the tests the company ran, the probability of their drug not helping the trial patients was less than 5%.", "Thanks for reading!
