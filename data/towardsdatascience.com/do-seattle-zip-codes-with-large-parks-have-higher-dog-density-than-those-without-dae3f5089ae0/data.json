This is the null hypothesis.", "H0: There is no increase in dog density in Seattle zip codes with large parks as compared to those without large parks.", "Alternative Hypothesis \u2014 There is a difference between our two populations. The alternative to our null hypothesis.", "H1: There is an increase in dog density in Seattle zip codes with large parks as compared to those without large parks.", "There are several options for test statistics, including:", "Since we have only 14 or 15 zip codes in each population, the T-test is more appropriate for this analysis, as it works best for samples sizes under 30.", "Along with the test statistic, if you are using a z-test or t-test, you need to determine whether you are doing a one-tailed or two-tailed test. Two-tailed tests are testing for differences in populations \u2014 either greater or less than (eg. Do boys have a different height than girls?). One-tailed tests are used to determine a single-direction difference (eg. Are boys taller than girls?).", "In our case, our null hypothesis states that zip codes with large parks do not have a higher dog density than those without parks. So we will use a one-tailed t-test, as our hypothesis is only asking if there is a single-directional shift when comparing neighborhoods with different sized parks.", "Note: a one-tailed t-test with the same significance level as a two-tailed t-test will reject the null hypothesis less than a one-tailed t-test, as it \u201csplits\u201d the uncertainty between the \u201chigher than\u201d and \u201clower than\u201d possibilities, which you can visualize in the charts below. Notice how the one-tailed t-test critical t-value is smaller than the upper critical t-value on the two-tailed test.", "The significance level is the probability that there is no difference between the populations based on the provided samples. A significance level (alpha) of 5% or 1% corresponds to a 95% or 99% confidence interval for your alternative hypothesis. Remember that with a significance level of 5%, 1 in 20 repeated experiments are expected to get the wrong result.", "In this case, I\u2019ve decided that a significance level of 5% / confidence interval of 95% is suitable for my purposes. A particular significance level is typically standard for your industry, company, etc, so make sure to use that, and not just pick one randomly. Note: it is NOT a good practice to adjust your significance level and confidence interval to fit your results (eg. we found this difference to be significant with an 87% confidence interval).", "Once you have your hypotheses, test statistic, and significance level, you are ready to make a data collection plan. Based on the magnitude of difference you expect between your two populations and your significance level, you can determine how large of samples you will need in order to reject the null hypothesis, should it be false. See here, for more info.", "First, follow the plan, and collect all the data. Again, it is NOT a good practice to continually calculate your test statistic while collecting data, waiting to reach your significance threshold, and then cancelling the rest of the data collection. We are not just trying to reject the null hypothesis, but actually trying to get at the truth. Avoid temptation by following your plan, collecting the required amount of data, and then calculating.", "For my investigation, here is a histogram of Seattle dog density by zip code:", "Seeing that the mean dog density for zip codes without large parks is larger than the mean dog density for zip codes with large parks, I could/should stop my investigation here. The dog density is not higher in zip codes with large parks, statistically speaking, or in any way of speaking. I do wonder if this would change with per-capita values\u2026 next investigation! For the sake of the primer/reminder, we\u2019ll continue with the process:", "Next, calculate your p-value. Check out scipy.stats docs for \u201cStatistical Tests\u201d to find the right one for your situation. In this case, I am doing a T-test of two independent populations, so I\u2019ll use ttest_ind. Looking at the docs, note that it is expecting equal sample sizes between the two populations, so I will randomly sample my larger population in order to trim it to the size of the smaller population. Since we do not know that the variances are equal, we will set the equal_var parameter to False, to perform a Welch\u2019s T-test which does not require equal variances, as compared to a Student\u2019s T-test which does assume equal variances between the two populations.", "This provides the p-value of a two-sided test. To get the one-sided p-value I need to use the t-statistic and compare it to my .05 significance level t-statistic critical value.", "To get the t-statistic critical value in python, use scipy\u2018s percent point function (the percentile)", "To see the p-value, you can use the cumulative distribution function to find the area under the curve up to the t-statistic, and subtract that from 1 to get the probability that the null hypothesis is true, and zip codes with large parks do not have a higher density of dogs than zip codes without large parks. Note: if you were doing a one-tailed test on the other side (eg. lesser dog density), you would not need to subtract from one.", "Here we see that the t-statistic is much lower than the critical value (when we are looking for a greater-than alternative hypothesis), and the p-value is much higher than our significance level. Therefore we fail to reject the null hypothesis that Seattle zip codes with large parks do not have a greater dog density than those without large parks. There is not a statistically significant difference between these two populations at a significance level of .05.", "Had the t-statistic fallen outside of the critical t-value (or -values for a two-tailed test), and the p-value been less than our chosen significance level, we would reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Note that the p-value and t-statistic tests will always indicate the same conclusion. You do not need to check both.", "What I conclude from this is that Seattleites love their pets, regardless of how close they are to a large park. While my pup, Beckham, certainly appreciates his proximity to Green Lake, there are plenty of ways to keep your pet active and fit, regardless of how close you are to a major park.", "On to locating the 38 registered miniature goats\u2026", "I would not have guessed Ravenna/Wedgewood/Maple Leaf/etc. to be a hotspot for miniature goats, but fascinating!", "As always, you can check out my GitHub repo for more details/code.", "Your home for data science.
