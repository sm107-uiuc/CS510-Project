The purpose of Business Intelligence is to support better business decision making to improve the productivity and performance of any business organization.", "BI relies heavily on a core set of analytics tools: Balanced Scorecards, Dashboards, and Key Performance Indicators.", "The Balanced Scorecard (BS) is a management tool that allows the integration of short-term operational control with the long-term vision and strategy of the company under study. To this purpose, the BS formulates, implements, controls, and manages the organization\u2019s strategy, efficiently linking strategic planning, operational management, and evaluation of group and individual performances.", "Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are the most important metrics that any organization needs to measure, monitor, and perform against in order to reach its strategic plan.", "A Business Intelligence Dashboard is a tech-driven approach that uses data visualization tools to display KPIs in order to track the main factors that contribute to the operation and success of the business. It is a graphic representation of the main metrics involved in the pursuit of the objectives set by the company.", "Business owners and corporate executives always want simple solutions. In that sense, data analysts must make dashboards easy to look at, navigate and understand. Two traditional graphics used to display KPIs on dashboards are Gauge Charts and Bullet Charts.", "AKA: Speedometer charts, Dial charts, Angular Gauge charts", "WHY: widely used in Business Intelligence (BI) visualizations, particularly in dashboards, to indicate whether a data or measurement is within, below, or above a certain range of values. They are very simple graphics that manage to capture the attention of the audience very quickly, even the non-specialized one. They provide information about a single quantitative measurement, comparing its present value to a goal and to a series of ranges indicated by bands of different colors. The following figure indicates that the current sales value (420) is within a satisfactory range but 30 units below the predetermined goal.", "HOW: Although there are different formats, the most common corresponds to the speedometer of a vehicle: a radial numerical scale separated into sectors, each identified by a particular color; a pointer or a needle moving over the radial scale; a minimum or lower limit value, a maximum or upper limit value and a target value. The number of ranges or sectors is variable, but usually there are three sectors, identified by a red color the sector that is below the lower threshold, a yellow color between thresholds, and a green one the sector that is above the upper threshold. It is not recommended to display more than five ranges or sectors.", "The following are some of the possible qualitative values associated with the different colors: poor, satisfactory, and good; green for satisfactory, yellow for caution, and red for alarm; poor, average, and excellent; red for low performance, yellow for normal performance, and green for high performance. These ranges of qualitative values are widely used in a BI presentation or on a dashboard to show the business performance of a given company. The target value can be an objective to be achieved, a benchmark or a previous value to be exceeded.", "Do not confuse gauges charts with donut graphs (Doughnut charts). While the former only reports a quantitative measurement, donut charts are related to a whole that can be divided into individual parts and how each part is related -in a relative or absolute way- with the total amount (Part of a whole analysis).", "Gauge charts have several virtues when telling a story with data:", "\u00b7 They are very simple, easy to understand, and quickly capture the attention of the audience;", "\u00b7 Audiences are familiar with them: car speedometers, indicators in computer games, temperature indication in ovens or stoves, etc. Unlike more complex graphics, there is no need to \u201cwaste time\u201d in explaining them;", "\u00b7 The sequence of colors, from red to green, is intuitive and immediate to understand;", "\u00b7 Most business and corporate executives prefer them because they transmit key data simply, clearly, and immediately;", "But they are also riddled with disadvantages, which must be taken into account at the moment of the storytelling:", "\u00b7 Their simplicity does not allow them to portray the context;", "\u00b7 They often mislead the audience by omitting key information, resulting in poor storytelling.", "\u00b7 Humans have difficulty comparing numerical values by means of angles; we always prefer to make comparisons by means of lengths starting from a common baseline (bullet charts);", "\u00b7 They take up a lot of physical space and their format can be distracting to the audience. Dashboards and Scorecards are often cluttered with indicators, which makes the storytelling process much more complicated;", "\u00b7 Remember that color blindness (color vision deficiency) affects approximately one in twelve men and one in two hundred women. The most common and problematic form of color deficiency is called \u201cred-green color blindness,\u201d precisely two of the colors commonly used in gauges. For these reasons, the actual trend is to encode the sectors as a single hue with distinct intensities ranging from dark to light. Darker colors intensities are used for low or poor values, while lighter colors intensities indicate satisfactory or excellent values (Fig. 2);", "The last warning comes from Robert Kosara (#1): \u201cIn data visualization, gauges simply solve the wrong problem. Business decisions cannot be made only on the current value of some measure, but need history and context. Values also typically do not change as fast, nor are as directly coupled, as the amount of pressure on the accelerator and the car\u2019s speed.\u201d", "The Matplotlib library does not have a function that allows us to draw a gauge chart directly. A very ingenious solution to the problem can be found on the following website: https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2018/06/04/creating-shaded-dial-plots-in-python/. A simpler solution is based on the Plotly graphic library which has an Indicator function: https://plotly.com/python/gauge-charts/.", "WHY: Renowned data visualization expert Stephen Few developed an alternative to gauges that he named Bullet Chart (#3). The key idea was to enrich the information by adding complementary measures to portray the context, using less physical space, and without decorations that distract the attention of the audience. Bullet charts provide information about a single quantitative measurement, comparing its present value against a target and to a series of ranges indicated by bands of different colors.", "HOW: they are similar to standard bar charts (they code information by length or height) but differ from them in that they include a central narrow bar that indicates the present (current) value of the numerical variable being reported. They also have a perpendicular line that shows the target or objective, and different ranges or sectors (usually three) that are indicated with bands of different colors or with varying intensities of a single hue. Unlike gauge charts, different categories can be compared in a single diagram.", "The standard bullet chart has five components (#3):", "\u00b7 a text label indicating the measured variable and the corresponding units of measurement;", "\u00b7 a quantitative scale along a linear axis with its ticks and numbers identifying equi-spaced measurement intervals;", "\u00b7 a primary or featured measure encoded with a clearly visible bar and which may have a baseline other than zero;", "\u00b7 comparison measures in the form of thin lines drawn perpendicular to the chart orientation (vertical lines if the bar representing the primary measure is horizontal, horizontal lines if the bar representing the primary measure is vertical);", "\u00b7 two to five qualitative ranges of performance that indicate the qualitative status of the primary measure. The ranges are differentiated by distinct colors or varying intensities of a single hue.", "Bullet charts are presented in an either vertical or horizontal orientation. A horizontal bullet chart allows different categories to be displayed on a vertical axis while the numerical values are indicated by a quantitative scale on the horizontal axis. Reciprocally, a vertical bullet chart allows different categories to be displayed on a horizontal axis while the numerical values are shown by a quantitative scale on the vertical axis. The quantitative scale allows you to display the value of the variable measured on a linear axis, easier to read than the angular axis of the gauges.", "Similar to gauge charts, the most usual qualitative values of the ranges or sectors are: poor, satisfactory, and good; green for satisfactory, yellow for caution, and red for alarm (Fig. 4); poor, average, and excellent; below performance, average performance, and over performance.", "The numerical variables usually indicated by bullet charts on dashboards and other BI visualizations are Sales, Income, Profit, Expenses, Number of Customers, and related.", "Do not confuse bullet charts with progress bar charts. The latter is a graphical control element used to visualize the progress of a certain operation such as downloading a file, transferring files, or installing software. Some visualization tools suggest the use of progress bars as business indicators as shown in the figure below:", "As with the gauge chart, Matplotlib does not have a function that allows you to draw a bullet chart immediately. Similarly, I found a very ingenious solution based on Matplotlib and Seaborn: https://pbpython.com/bullet-graph.html. I also found a better solution based on Plotly: https://plotly.com/python/bullet-charts/", "A scientific study conducted at a Chinese university compared the emotional differences of 40 college students when confronted with horizontal bullet charts, vertical bullet charts, and angular gauge charts (#4). The cognitive load demanded by each one of the graphic alternatives, the level of satisfaction perceived by the students, and the aesthetic effect of each one of the visualization alternatives were used as subjective metrics. The study concluded that vertically oriented bullet charts generated the highest satisfaction and lowest cognitive load. In contrast, angular gauge charts resulted in the lowest satisfaction, highest cognitive load, although they were the most aesthetically pleasing.", "I recommend you to use these results for your next business presentation.", "In the context of the digital transformation of many companies, Business Intelligence and Data Visualization techniques are becoming increasingly relevant. The spectrum of visualization and chart customization possibilities is overwhelming: there are dozens of different graphs that provide great flexibility when visualizing data, but sometimes only simple, easy-to-understand diagrams that quickly capture the attention of the audience are required. Gauges and bullet charts provide that simplicity and familiarity, which is much appreciated by audiences.", "Particularly, we suggest the use of bullet charts for their ability to encode more information in smaller spaces.", "If you find this article of interest, please read my previous:", "\u201cHistograms, Why & How, Storytelling, Tips & Extensions\u201d", "\u201cParallel Coordinates Plots, Why & How, Storytelling with Parallels\u201d", "Your home for data science.
