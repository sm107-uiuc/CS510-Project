As I prepare for more data science interviews, I thought it would be a good exercise to make sure that I am communicating my thoughts clearly and concisely during an interview. Let me know in the comments, if I am not doing a good job in explaining any of the concepts.", "NOTE: This article is not aimed for teaching a concept to beginners. It assumes that the reader has sufficient background in data science concepts. If you are just getting started with ML, I highly recommend you to check out StatQuest on Youtube, it\u2019s one of my favorites.", "Cross validation is a model evaluation technique, where we divide a given data set into different folds let\u2019s say 5 and then iteratively use 4 folds for training and 1 for validation. The purpose of using this technique is to check the robustness of a model to different combinations of training and test sets. It is also used to compare two models and see which one performs better overall.", "Yes we can use cross-validation for tuning model parameters. There is N-fold cross validation which is more commonly used, leave one out cross-validation, which takes one sample as test set and the remaining as training set.", "A confusion matrix is another model evaluation technique which we use for classification problems. In this technique we make a NxN matrix, where N is the number of distinct classes to be predicted, so for a binary classification problem N=2. We have actual values on the X-axis and Predicted values on the Y-axis. Model evaluation is done based on some metrics that can be generated from this, like specificity, sensitivity, precision and recall.", "Sensitivity, recall, power or true positive rate is the ratio of True positives to total number of positives. For a given classification problem, it tells us the proportion of positives that are correctly classified from all the positives.", "Specificity or true negative rate is the ratio of true negatives to total negatives. It tells us the proportion of correctly classified negatives from all negatives.", "Precision is the proportion of True Positives to all cases Predicted as Positives", "F score is a measure to test accuracy of a binary classification. It is the harmonic mean of precision and recall. The F-score takes on a value between 0 and 1 and higher the F-score, better the power of the classification model.", "The ROC curve plots the True Positive Rate (Sensitivity) vs. False Positive Rate (1-Specificity). ROC curves are used for parameter tuning. Let\u2019s say we have a logistic regression model and we don\u2019t know what threshold to use for classifying True Positives and True Negatives, then in this case generating a confusion matrix for each threshold can be a cumbersome process to decide which threshold to use. So we make the ROC curve to decide which threshold to use based on the true positive and false positive rate that works best for us. We use AUC to decide which model is better. The model that has the maximum Area Under Curve is the best model.", "Before understanding the bias-variance trade off, let\u2019s try to understand what we mean by bias and variance:", "Bias refers the error that is introduced by approximating a real-life problem, which may be extremely complicated, by a much simpler model [1]", "Variance, on the other hand, is the amount by which the predicted value y-hat would change if we estimated it using a different training set [2]", "The bias variance trade-off helps us decide how well a model fits the training and test set. A model that fits the training set perfectly but performs very poorly on the test set is said to have a high amount of variance, whereas a model that fits the test set well but not the training set is said to have a high bias.", "Odds are the ratio of something happening to that something not happening, whereas probability is the ratio of something happening to the total number of possibilities.", "The probability in logistic regression is modeled as", "Now if we transform this equation to make it linear in X, we get something like", "where the left side represents the log(odds)", "Logistic regression is a machine learning technique that models the probability that the response Y belongs to a particular category depending on a set of observed X variables. The probability is modeled by the logistic function, which is written as", "Linear regression is used to predict continuous response, where as logistic regression is used for categorical classification.", "The equation for simple linear regression can be written as Y = b0 + b1*X in which b1 represents the average increase in Y for a 1 unit increase in X and b0 is the Y-intercept.", "The equation for logistic regression can be written as", "This equation represents a S-shaped curve and in order to visualize this equation into a straight line, we can do some amount of manipulation to the logistic function to get", "The function on the left represents the log(odds) and the equation on the right is now linear in terms of X. So, increasing x by 1 unit, in case of logistic regression, is associated with an increase in the log(odds) by \u03b21 or equivalently it multiplies the odds by e^\u03b21.", "However in both cases, linear and logistic regression, a positive value of \u03b21 is associated with increase in Y, in case of linear regression and log(odds), in case of logistic regression.", "It is a technique used to estimate unknown parameter/s to a distribution that best describes the given data. The equation for likelihood is", "Where theta is the unknown parameter and x1, x2, \u2026. , xn are data point", "The logistic function is a nonlinear function, which is represented by an S-shaped curve. Now, in order to calculate the least squares, we need to fit a line that minimizes the sum of squared distances from each data point to this line. So because, calculating residuals for an S-shaped curve is trickier the method of likelihood, which is a parameter estimation technique, is best suited.", "Probability and Likelihood although often used interchangeably differ in certain scenarios. They represent the same thing in the discrete case, but they mean totally different in context of a continuous distribution.", "In the continuous scenario, probability is (data | distribution), read as data given distribution, whereas likelihood is (distribution | data), read as distribution given data.", "Let\u2019s start with probability, whenever we are asked probability in context of a continuous distribution, it is the area under the curve. In short, we are given a distribution and the area under the curve helps us find the probability of observing a value in a certain range i.e P(data | distribution). The figure below shows a normal distribution that represents the heights of basketball players with mean = 6.583 and standard deviation = 0.3. The area under the curve gives us P(height between 6.7 & 6.9 | mean = 6.583 & std dev = 0.3)", "Whereas, in the case of likelihood, we are given a data set and our job is to find parameters to a distribution that best describes the given dataset i.e. L(distribution | data). We do this by taking a derivative of the likelihood function with respect to each parameters (mean, standard deviation), until we find parameters that maximize the likelihood function. In the following figure, the x\u2019s at the bottom of the orange distribution represent the given sample set for which we want to estimate mean and standard deviation. So we start by assuming values for mean and standard dev and continue the process till we find a distribution, in this case the orange distribution, that maximizes the likelihood function L(mean, standard deviation) or best describes the data.", "Regularization techniques are used to reduce model overfitting.There are two commonly used regularization methods, L1 regularization or Lasso and L2 or Ridge regression. We do this by introducing a small amount of bias (or a penalty term) that makes the model less sensitive to the training data, thus avoiding overfitting and reducing variance on testing data. The objective of regularization techniques is to minimize the following equation for Ridge", "Lambda decides the penalty on the slope, epsilon terms are residuals and beta terms are slopes. Higher the lambda higher the penalty.", "The big difference between Lasso and Ridge is that, Ridge regression can asymptotically shrink the slope close to 0 while Lasso Regression can shrink the slope all the way to 0. Lasso is useful when there are a lot of useless variables whereas Ridge is useful when most of the variables are useful.", "Lambda can take any value from 0 to infinity. If lambda = 0 we have the least square line. We can select a value for lambda by using cross validation. The larger the lambda larger is the change in model coefficients.", "n should always be at least equal to p, where n is the sample size and p is the number of variables. Let\u2019s say n = 1 and p = 2, not to fit any line we need at least 2 data points, with one data point we can have an infinite number of lines passing through that one point.", "There are many ways to handle this situation.", "Naive Bayes\u2019 is a classification algorithm that uses Bayes\u2019 theorem to categorize instance to a specific class. It assumes independence between the predictors which is a major assumption given that it\u2019s almost impossible that a set of predictors are completely independent. It works well when the predictors are categorical.", "This should be a good place to stop.
