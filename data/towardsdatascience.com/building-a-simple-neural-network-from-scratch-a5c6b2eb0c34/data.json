This type of problem is known as a \u201cBinary Classification Problem\u201d. It consists of classifying the input into two classes, in our case, \u2018Cat\u2019 or \u2018Not cat\u2019.", "A single neuron in the neural network works as a straight line which has the following equation:", "This is the fundamental equation around which the whole concept of neural networks is based on. Let us break down this equation:", "y: Dependent variable (Output of the neural network)", "In terms of neural networks, we specify the slope as Weights, intercept as Bias and the output(y) as z. So the equation becomes:", "Here we have only one feature which we are giving to the model. To input multiple features, we\u2019ll have to scale up the equation.", "The above equation can be scaled to \u2019n\u2019 number of features which can be written as:", "Here we have \u2019n\u2019 input features fed to our model. Corresponding to each input feature, we have a weight which specifies how important the feature is to our model to predict the output. The bias term helps in shifting our line on the axis to better fit the training data or else the line will always go through the origin (0, 0).", "We can make use of matrices to multiply all the weights with the inputs and adding biases to them. This can be done as follows:", "Here, each row represents a single training example (image, in our case) and each column represents an array of pixels.", "In python, we will use Vectorization to implement the above concept.", "Note: In the above equation, we have used \u201cX.w+b\u201d because our input matrix is of the shape (mXn) where \u2018m\u2019 is the number of samples and \u2019n\u2019 is the number of features.", "The goal of training the neural network is to update the weights and biases to get as accurate predictions as we can.", "A neuron is a single unit in the neural network. It mimics the neuron in our brain having \u2018Dendrites\u2019 as inputs, \u2018Nucleus\u2019 as body and \u2018Axon\u2019 as output. Each neuron takes some input, processes it and gives an output based on an activation function.", "If you are unable to grasp any of these concepts, bear with me, it\u2019ll all make sense once we\u2019ll start to put things together.", "From the creation phase to getting the predictions, the whole process is defined in the following parts:", "The input that we have is the collection of images of \u2018Cats\u2019 and \u2018Not Cats\u2019. Each input image is a coloured image of 64x64 px dimension. We have a total of 209 images in our train dataset and 50 images in our test dataset. To feed these images into our neural network, these must be reshaped into a vector of pixels. So each image will be arranged in a row-wise order into a 1-dimensional vector.", "Our images are in 8-bit so each pixel in our image is having a value in the range [0, 255] i.e. a range of total 256 values (2\u2078=256). Therefore, we have to normalize our images by dividing each pixel by the maximum value i.e. 255.", "Neural networks are very sensitive to the input scale. We don\u2019t want our inputs to vary too much or else larger inputs might dominate the smaller ones. So it\u2019s always a good practice to normalize our inputs if they are in a large range.", "We will have to initialize weights and biases to some small value to be able to start the process of training.", "Here, we have multiplied the weights with 0.01 so that they will not explode (get very large) in the whole training process.", "Note: In the code, \u2018b\u2019 is only a \u2018float\u2019 number because of the broadcasting in python. It will automatically convert this \u2018float\u2019 number to the required vector shape.", "So now that we got our weights and biases initialized, let\u2019s move forward to the next step.", "Here, we will calculate the output \u2018z\u2019 using the equation that we established above and then using an activation function on the output.", "We will use the sigmoid activation function in case of binary classification because sigmoid function gives output by transforming the input to [0, 1] interval. So, we can easily find the target class by making values greater than 0.5 to 1 and less than 0.5 to 0.", "Let us look at the code to implement these two steps:", "So now that we got the output from the neuron, we can calculate loss and see how good/bad our model is performing.", "In binary classification, the loss function used is Binary Cross Entropy / Log Loss. It is given by the formula:", "m: Total number of samples in the dataset", "y\u1d62: True label for i\u1d57\u02b0 sample", "a\u1d62: Predicted value for i\u1d57\u02b0 sample", "This can be implemented in python as:", "This loss will tell us how far are we from predicting the correct output. If the loss is 0, then we have a perfect model. But practically, if the loss is 0, then our model might be overfitting to the data.", "This is the part where all the magic happens. In every iteration, based on the model output and the expected output, we calculate the gradients. The gradient is how much weights and biases we need to change in order to reduce the loss.", "To calculate the gradient, we use the following formulas:", "In python, the above equations can be implemented as:", "Now, the \u2018dw\u2019 and \u2018db\u2019 contains the gradients that we need to adjust in our weights and biases respectively.", "We now need to adjust the weights and biases with the gradient that we just calculated. For this, the following equations are used:", "where \u2018\u03b1\u2019 (alpha) is the learning rate which defines how big/small our update should be.", "The code for updating the parameters is:", "Now we just have to repeat these steps for multiple times to train the neural network.", "In order to train the neural network, we must run the above steps for some epochs (number of times to repeat these process).", "Now that our neural network is trained, we can predict the output for new input.", "To get predictions from our neural network, we have to convert the output \u2018a\u2019 of the neural network such that the output value less than 0.5 becomes 0, otherwise 1.", "Although we only have one neuron, we are still getting 96% accuracy on the training data and 76% accuracy on the test data which is not bad.", "Congratulations! We have just made our first neural network from scratch. In the next article, I will tell you how to develop a shallow neural network which will have one hidden layer containing multiple neurons.", "You can find the complete code on Github:", "So, this was the whole process of creating and training a neural network from scratch.
