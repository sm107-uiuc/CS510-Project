I want to play around with the data and see what we can learn from that.", "More specifically I want to answer the question: \"How did voters change their mind since last elections\".", "By looking at the total result, it is impossible to answer this question. Note that this is true, even when only two parties take part in the elections.", "As an example, let's imagine that in two consecutive elections, both parties got half of the votes. Then it is still impossible to derive whether none of the voters changed their mind, all of the voters changed their mind, or anything in between.", "Everything that is fun starts with a dataset. So I set out to find myself a dataset containing data on the election results.", "I came across this website which has data on the voting results for both 2019 and 2014 (the previous elections) per district. The districts that I am talking about are called \"Kantons\" in Belgium and there are a bit more than 200 of them.", "Whether I manually copy-pasted all results from this website or I took the less-legal approach of writing a Python script to automatically screen scrape the results is anyone's guess. I can only say that I can highly recommend the \u201cBeautifulSoup\u201d library for screen scraping.", "I ended up with a dataset that provided the number of votes for each party in each of the 200+ districts in both 2019 and 2014.", "For the sake of correctness I have to mention that Belgium is split in three autonomous regions: Flanders, Wallonia and Brussels-Capital and not all political parties are represented in all parts. In the results section of this post I will focus on the largest part (Flanders) but the methodology was tested for the other parts as well.", "To understand which voters changed their mind I built a very simple model.I simplify elections to an N party system, by dropping all parties that got less than 150k votes both in 2014 and 2019.", "Then I make the assumption that all people that voted similarly in 2014, will change their mind in the same way in 2019. More specifically, people that voted for party P\u1d62 in 2014, have the same probability of voting for party P\u1d63 in 2019. (I call this probability X\u1d62\u1d63).", "Our goal is to find the best values for the probabilities X\u1d62\u1d63. In other words: \"Which values for X\u1d62\u1d63, explain the 2019 results best based on the 2014 results\".", "In order to \"explain\" or \"predict\" the number of votes V\u1d63\u00b2\u2070\u00b9\u2079 for party P\u1d63 in 2019, based on the 2014 results I can use the probabilities X\u1d62\u1d63 as follows:", "That looks familiar doesn\u2019t it? It is a simple linear regression. So I set out and implemented the model in Python.", "It should be remarked that even though we are talking about predicting the 2019 results we don\u2019t care about predicting the 2019 elections since they are already in the past. We are only trying to create a prediction model to afterwards look into the \u201cinternals of this model\u201d (the probabilities X\u1d62\u1d63).", "I will present the results from this linear regression in a heat map. Each of the cells in the heat map contains one of the probabilities X\u1d62\u1d63.", "This heat map should be read in the following way: Each cell lies at the intersection of a row and a column. The row represents the people that voted for a certain party in 2014, the column represents the party that they voted for in 2019. The value in the cell represents the ratio of people that voted for the first party in 2014 that are voting for the second party in 2019.", "As an example: If all people would vote in exactly the same way in 2014 and in 2019, the heat map would have value 1 on the diagonal and zero everywhere else.", "My first results are represented in the heat map below.", "A graph says more than a thousand words, but this time it is screaming only one thing : \u201cThe model is wrong!\u201d.", "This model gave nonsensical results, because this problem is of course no traditional linear regression problem for two reasons.", "First of all, in my interpretation of the model the parameters X\u1d62\u1d63 can not take any arbitrary value. Since they represent a probability of voters that change to another party, it needs to be a number between 0 and 1. It simply would not make sense for a voter of a certain group to have -59% probability of voting for a certain party in 2019.", "Secondly, the probabilities X\u1d62\u1d63 are not independent of one another. All the voters need to cast a new vote in 2019, or risk becoming an outlaw since voting is mandatory in Belgium.", "As a result the sum X\u1d62\u1d63 for each party needs to be \u201capproximately\u201d 100% (because between 2014 and 2019 people might have died, migrated or reached minimum age to be allowed to vote).I could go the extra mile and add the information on how the population within each district changed between 2014 and 2019, but to simplify matters, I assumed it to be approximately constant.", "Therefore I adapted the model to take these constraints into account.", "The model was adapted in two ways:", "It is interesting to note that the \u201cperformance\u201d (which is discussed towards the end of this post) of the model will only go down by taking these constraints into account. But given that we are more interested in the interpretation of the model than in the prediction capabilities we are happy to take this performance hit.", "The hyperparameter mentioned above defines the relative importance of this constraint versus the importance of \u201ccorrect prediction\u201d.", "I tuned the value for this parameter by inspecting the graph of the performance as a function of the hyperparameter. I selected a point somewhere in the plateau, before the errors go through the roof.", "To convince myself that the results were not too dependent on the hyperparameter, I quickly checked how the results differed between models with different values for the hyperparameter. The results were not that different which is reassuring.", "In the heatmap below, you can see the results from the improved model.", "The model definitely shows some interesting results. Some are very much in line with expectations and \u201ccommon wisdom\u201d.", "The model indicates that people change their mind between parties that are \u201clike minded\u201d. Some examples of this:", "Some of the observations are unexpected:", "In order to compare models, (or even to train models), I need to select a \u201cperformance measure\u201d.A good one to use is \u201cnumber of wrongly predicted votes\u201d across all districts.", "If I use this metric on the following models:", "Some observations from these performance scores:", "The current model has only limited information available to base its decision on. The only datapoint that it uses is : \"For which party did a person vote in 2014?\".", "Therefore it has to consider all people that voted for the same party in 2014 as being equal. This is of course a very crude simplification. One could imagine that people that voted for a certain party in 2014, had different backgrounds and reasons to do so. These different reasons could result in different behaviour in the 2019 elections.", "If we want the model to be able to make predictions along the lines of \u201cParty Y lost a lot of its wealthy voters to Party X, while regaining a lot of older voters\u201d, we need to improve upon the model. Adding information about wealth distribution, urbanisation or age distribution per district for the model to use could unlock this potential.", "Another way of boosting the performance of the model that is fairly easy to achieve is improving the training data. After running the analysis, I found out that election results are also available on a more fine grained level (called 'Gemeente'). Rerunning the same analysis on this more rich dataset should result in more accurate results. This would also allow me to incorporate more political parties instead of only the largest ones.", "It is definitely possible to get some interesting insights about the election results using fairly simple machine learning techniques. It explains the 2019 results better than a poll (sample size of 3400 people) conducted by a consortium of political scientist.", "There are ample opportunities to improve the model or perform different analysis on this dataset.", "But most importantly: Next time when you are in doubt, whether your vote will make a difference, know that you will at the very least be part of a linear regression ;-)", "Your home for data science.
