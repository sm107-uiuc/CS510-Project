If you search for data science courses on platforms such as Edx, Coursera, they cover a wide variety of skills for every level of expertise, ranging from data wrangling to exploratory data analysis, to model building and machine learning. However, as a beginner who went through that journey myself, I found it very important to build up some fundamental computer science and programming knowledge before diving straight into data analysis, machine learning and more advanced data science fields.", "We frequently hear people say that to be a data science you don\u2019t have a be an expert in computer science, understanding advanced programming, cyber security, etc. It is true that you don\u2019t have to be a hardcore programmer to a successful data scientist, but I found that as I make more progress, I start to bump into technical computer science terms and knowledge that I am not familiar with. Some of them are very crucial for machine learning and data science, such as dynamic programming, recursion, constructors. This is when I realized that there is a gap in computer science that I need to fill before I proceed with more advanced topics in data science.", "I do advice all beginners data scientists to be mindful of the importance of fundamental computer science knowledge that could be crucial for your data science journey. This course from MIT open courseware provides a clean and easy introduction for you to start building it up from the bottom ground, it took me 3 days to complete all the lecture videos and carefully go through the lecture codes/ notes provided, as well as coming up with my own notes. It is a short course but it is very content intensive and you could really learn a lot in a short time. At the end of this article I will also provide you with a link to share my handwritten notes ( scanned) , the notes are based on the lecture slides but with key points highlighted and my personal insights annotated.", "\u201c 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python is intended for students with little or no programming experience. It aims to provide students with an understanding of the role computation can play in solving problems and to help students, regardless of their major, feel justifiably confident of their ability to write small programs that allow them to accomplish useful goals. The class uses the Python 3.5 programming language.\u201d", "( In order of lectures )", "3. String Manipulation, Guess and Check, Approximations, Bisection", "5. Tuples, Lists, Aliasing, Mutability, Cloning", "6. Recursion, Dictionaries ( clearly explains one of the most confusing topic for beginners! Pay Attention!)", "From the course outline, you can see that some of the topics are very trivial and fundamental, it teaches you the concepts as well as the codes. For beginners, the way that the course is structured seamlessly lead you from zero experience in computer science to being able to understand that you need for many advanced algorithms. However, one could always decide on which lecture to start from depending on their own backgrounds and knowledge base.", "overall rating: (On scale of 1\u201310) ( ratings are only my personal views and serve as a reference)", "Beginner friendly (ease to follow) : 9.5", "practice questions & assignments: 7 (assignments are not provided with solutions, only provided test sets)", "Your home for data science.
