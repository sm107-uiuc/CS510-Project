Heck, you\u2019ve probably even used it yourself. Unfortunately, in my experience, many people only know Bayes\u2019 Law in a technical, academic context, and don\u2019t actually understand it in a way that\u2019s useful in daily life. And that\u2019s a shame, because Bayes\u2019 Law is a beautiful, powerful, rational way of organizing your beliefs. Here\u2019s the thing, though: you already use it in daily life, you just might not know it. In this article I\u2019m going to show you how to consciously use Bayes\u2019 Law with a topical and non-technical example: the (potential) discovery of life on Venus.", "If you somehow missed the news, a recent paper by Dr. Jane S. Greaves et al. has sparked a lot of interest in the possibility of life on Venus. Unfortunately, with COVID travel bans in effect, Dr. Greaves wasn\u2019t able to take her team to the balmy planet for a field trip, so instead they used telescopes. In very short, the research team found evidence of phosphine gas in Venus\u2019 atmosphere.", "Bayes\u2019 Law is is a tool for updating your existing beliefs given new information, rather than outright discarding your old beliefs. Brace yourself, because I\u2019m about to show you an equation:", "What does this have to do with beliefs and information? Well, it looks a little complex but it\u2019s really quite simple. Let\u2019s break it down:", "Therefore, the left side of the equation is pronounced \u201c[what\u2019s] the probability that there is life on Venus given that there is phosphine on Venus?\u201d, which is exactly the question you should be asking yourself when you read a news headline like \u201cphosphine gas discovered on Venus.\u201d", "Now that we can actually pronounce Bayes\u2019 Law, let\u2019s break it down into chunks:", "P(A|B): This is called the posterior and means \u201cwhat is the probability of the claim [life on Venus] given the evidence [phosphine on Venus]\u201d. It\u2019s the quantity that we care about. And speaking of posteriors, you can hardly imagine my disappointment that the phosphine wasn\u2019t discovered on Uranus.", "P(B|A): This is called the likelihood and is the inverse of the posterior. It means \u201cwhat is the probability that we would see the evidence [phosphine on Venus] given the claim [life on Venus]\u201d. To figure out this value, we assume there\u2019s life on Venus and calculate the probability that we\u2019d observe phosphine gas on Venus if our assumption were true. We know that organisms on Earth produce phosphine gas, so this value is relatively high.", "P(A): This is called the prior, and means \u201cwhat is the probability of the claim being true without any new evidence\u201d. In our case, this is your prior belief that there\u2019s life on Venus, before you read the news headline. Considering the planet is a caustic hellscape that will boil, crush, and corrode you before you could even reach the surface, this value is quite low.", "P(B): This value is called the marginal, and means \u201cwhat is the probability that we would see the evidence given any claim\u201d. In our case, that means \u201cwhat is the probability that something would produce phosphine gas on Venus\u201d. The paper goes into a lot of detail describing other methods that could produce phosphine, including volcanic activity, lightning, and meteoric delivery, and concludes that it is very unlikely that any of these methods would produce as much phosphine as was observed.", "With that all in mind, how would a statistician react to reading the headline Phosphine Gas Found on Venus?", "Did you catch that last bit? That\u2019s where the magic happens; once you apply Bayes\u2019 Law, the posterior becomes your new prior for the next time you get new evidence. If another researcher were to publish a study tomorrow describing another biosignature on Venus, this statistician would use their new prior of 10% instead of their old prior of 0.01%.", "Once you\u2019re comfortable with the technique, you can apply it anywhere:", "Obviously we can\u2019t pin down the exact probabilities in daily life, but you get the idea. Much of this should be intuitive (like I said, I bet you\u2019re already using it), but formally understanding how and why it works makes it much more useful.", "Bayes\u2019 Law changes the way you see the world. Beliefs are no longer binary (true or false) but instead form a spectrum of confidences that increase or decrease as new evidence becomes available. Embrace the ambiguity of \u201cI\u2019m 90% sure of my beliefs\u201d, because, according to Bayes\u2019 Law, it\u2019s impossible to change your mind if you have 100% or 0% prior confidence in a belief. Why\u2019s that? Look at the equation:", "If P(A) is 0, then so is P(A|B) because anything times zero is zero. That means no amount of evidence will ever change your mind. Think of a flat earther who is certain the Earth is flat (0% sure it\u2019s round). No matter what evidence you show them, P(A|B) is stuck at zero. The same is true on the other side; if you\u2019re 100% certain of A (i.e. P(A)=100%), then it doesn\u2019t matter what evidence B you\u2019re given, you already believe in A despite B so P(A|B) is also going to be 100%, no matter how damning the new evidence is.", "But what happens if you have no prior? Where do you get one? One answer is to use an \u201cuninformed prior\u201d, where you say \u201cah I don\u2019t know, let\u2019s say it\u2019s 50/50\u201d (or one-in-three if there are three outcomes, etc.). Another option is to use simple statistics: in the firing example above, the employee could say \u201c10% of staff tend to get fired every year, so I\u2019ll say the prior that I\u2019ll be keeping my job is 90%\u201d. Prior selection can be a bit hand-wavy, and some call it unscientific, but I usually just refer them to this comic. (Didn\u2019t get the joke? The Bayesian statistician has a very strong prior that the sun hasn\u2019t exploded because, well, it never has before).", "So there you have it. Despite what college statistics classes might teach, Bayes\u2019 Law has applications outside of breast cancer diagnosis. Make sure you tell all your friends in your next racquetball class.", "Your home for data science.
