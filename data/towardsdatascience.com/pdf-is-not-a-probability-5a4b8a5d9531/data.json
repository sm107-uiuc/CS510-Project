Let\u2019s take an example of the easiest PDF \u2014 the uniform distribution defined on the domain [0, 0.5]. The PDF of the uniform distribution is 1/(b-a), which is constantly 2 throughout.", "The total probability is the total area under the graph f(x), which is 2 * 0.5 = 1.", "As you can see, even if a PDF is greater than 1, because it integrates over the domain that is less than 1, it can add up to 1.", "Isn\u2019t the PDF f(x) a probability?", "No. Because f(x) can be greater than 1.

However, a PDF is not the same thing as a PMF, and it shouldn\u2019t be interpreted in the same way as a PMF, because discrete random variables and continuous random variables are not defined the same way.", "For discrete random variables, we look up the value of a PMF at a single point to find its probability P(\ud835\udc17=\ud835\udc99) (e.g. Remember how we plugged \ud835\udc99 into the Poisson PMF?)For continuous random variables, we take an integral of a PDF over a certain interval to find its probability that X will fall in that interval.", "Sure, all good. However, you might wonder\u2026", "Why do we have to *integrate* a PDF?", "Can we just sum up PDF values, just like we do with PMF values?", "No. Because, for continuous random variables, the probability that \ud835\udc17 takes on any particular value \ud835\udc99 is 0.", "Let's look at the previous example \u2014 the Uniform Distribution in [0, 0.5].", "The probability density at x=1 is two.But why is the probability at x=1 zero?", "To answer the above question, we need to answer the following question first: How many total real numbers do we have in [0, 0.5]?", "Therefore, a continuous random variable has an infinite # of possible values that it can take, even if the domain is small and fixed. And let's say, the probability density for each value in [0, 0.5] takes an extremely small value, e.g. 000000001. Still, the sum of infinitely (uncountably) many values will reach infinity, no matter how small their values are.", "Then, in order to make the sum of probabilities 1, the probability at a single point should be 1/\u221e, which is 0.", "Well, this doesn\u2019t really make sense, either. If you add the infinite number of zeros, you will still get zero. The total probability should add up to one, not to zero.", "The thing is, we can\u2019t use the notion of discrete PMF (one value has one matching probability) for continuous variables. We can\u2019t define the probability of continuous variables as we did for discrete variables.", "If d\ud835\udc99 is infinitesimally small, this approximation will be good enough for P(\ud835\udc17=\ud835\udc99).", "1. If you take a look at the definition of both a PDF and a PMF, it\u2019s actually simply changing the summations in the discrete case (PMF) to integrals in the continuous case (PDF).", "2. Why do we use the terms \u201cDensity\u201d and \u201cMass\u201d?", "This is analogous to mass density in physics \u2014 integrating the density to get the mass. If you think of a mass as a probability, we are integrating a probability density to get a probability (mass).", "3. What does a probability density at point \ud835\udc99 mean?", "It means how much probability is concentrated per unit length (d\ud835\udc99) near \ud835\udc99, or how dense the probability is near \ud835\udc99.", "4.
