But the measures within the dashboard never made much sense. In fact, it was usually just bizarre."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["While preparing for a recent presentation, I was trying to find some dashboards that illustrated some of my ideas. I didn\u2019t want to show only the dashboards I created. These are universal principles; everyone follows these same guidelines? Right?", "If you search Google Images, you can see many dashboard examples at once. With a few quick clicks, you can explore the sites to get some understanding of the topic. I\u2019ll admit I did not do this exercise for all 500+ images, but I did have some takeaways.", "Most of these dashboards are flaunting product features over useable design. It\u2019s the only conclusion I can reach for seeing such an odd variety of data objects placed on the same page.", "A bubble chart next to a 3D pie chart next to a map? Someone\u2019s picture with a dozen gauges? A mind map with traffic lighting? Sorry folks that is just plain bizarro.", "Most dashboards I reviewed had a generic topic such as sales, customer service, or healthcare. But the measures within the dashboard never made much sense. Usually, you don\u2019t put measures like team ratings, yearly sales performance, and product defect counts together. I\u2019m exaggerating, but it\u2019s not too far from the truth. I suppose the designer was saying \u2014 look you can put all of your information together. But should you \u2014 I ask?", "I worry that an inexperienced designer might use these misguided dashboards as examples. I wonder how that person would have any success in their organization. Either that tool or the person will be blamed for the menacing idea.", "A closer review of the dashboards reveals poor style choices and an overall lack of data visualization knowledge. The biggest offender is the misuse of a dashboard gauge.", "While many dashboard designers object to gauges, they can be used successfully. There are guidelines for their use \u2014 but many of these dashboards didn\u2019t follow even the simple guidelines.", "Many of the basic data visualization principles were also ignored.", "Maybe a designer was so enamored with the car dashboard idea that making the data understood was forgotten. What organization has 20 KPIs on the same page?", "Many of the dashboards feature bright palettes with odd background color choices.", "One thing I know about dashboards is this: if the user does not need the data presented \u2014 your dashboard is judged solely on how aesthetically pleasing it is.", "If the user needs the information to complete a work assignment, the dashboard can be dreadful and still be popular.", "But don\u2019t you want a nice looking dashboard? Isn\u2019t it horrible to think some poor slob was suffering through your despicable design choices? Or others scoffing at a disagreeable dashboard design. There is a discipline to data visualization and web design. It can be learned.", "Some designers used MS Excel to create a dashboard. This technique was just a misuse of the tool. A dashboard is an organizational tool and should be available in a central location. How would you share an Excel spreadsheet with an organization? Through email? How do you keep it updated and how do you control changes? I won\u2019t belabor the point, but stop doing that.", "To my mind, a performance dashboard is a particular tool used in an organization. It allows the organization to set objectives and track those measures through a period. It is an investment. As organizations grow, a dashboard assists the organization with growth. It focuses on the use of data, which shows the real value of the data.", "With many of these designs above, you have to wonder if the dashboard is valid or even useable. To this end, dashboards can be boring to an outsider. The dashboard is custom to the organization and contains what they want to focus on. One organization may need to focus on training while another needs to focus on being more effective with fewer resources. These issues would have different KPIs and use different supporting information.", "When a dashboard is attractive and useful, it\u2019s perfection. Many times it is trusty ole bar charts, line charts, and maybe a few gauges that are the right answer. A clean, simple design that allows the user to focus on the measures are ultimately what will make the organization effective.", "I suppose those principles don\u2019t sell many dashboard building tools just showing those things. After all, there is an art to the sales and marketing process as well.", "Your home for data science.
