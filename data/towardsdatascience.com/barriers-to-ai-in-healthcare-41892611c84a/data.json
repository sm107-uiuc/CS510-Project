It\u2019s so ubiquitous that most of us go about our daily routines without comprehending its role in our lives. But it hasn\u2019t yet altered the face of the healthcare industry in the same ways it\u2019s revolutionized our shopping. Why is that?", "There\u2019s more than one answer. As I see it there are at least three good reasons that you don\u2019t see widespread AI utilization in healthcare now. Given enough time, though, I believe we will overcome all these barriers.", "To be clear, the type of AI I am discussing in this article is the kind which acts in place of a healthcare professional. Passive Artificial Intelligence, which simply helps support providers in their decision-making process, is already being heavily researched and changing the way we approach healthcare.", "One of the largest hurdles that AI has to overcome to be relevant in the healthcare space is the multitude of federal regulations designed to protect consumers. While there are many governing bodies unique to different countries, I will narrow the scope of this topic to the U.S. FDA. According to the official FDA guidelines, there are several different classes of medical devices [1, 2].", "Class I\u2014This category of device is defined as minimal risk, which is to say, the designer of the product can easily demonstrate to the FDA that the device in question either poses no threat of harm to consumers or very closely resembles one that has already been approved by the FDA. Approximately 47% of medical devices are in this category.", "Class II\u2014This category of device is defined as moderate risk. About 43% of medical devices are in this category. You can think of this category as medical devices which resemble pre-existing products but have some unique feature to them that could potentially hurt the consumer. One example of this would be a powered wheelchair, as it closely resembles prior art (i.e. non-powered wheelchairs) but has electronic components which, if they malfunction, could harm the user.", "Class III\u2014This is reserved for the remaining 10% of medical devices that pose a high risk to consumers. These kinds of devices can kill people if they malfunction (e.g. pacemakers).", "Autonomous Artificial Intelligence applications in healthcare mostly reside within Class III. A device that a nurse can use to identify melanoma without needing to consult an expert? An algorithm that automatically detects breast cancer? A neural network that prioritizes patients for doctors? All Class III.", "While it could be argued that each of these examples might be used to assist medical personnel instead of replacing experts, it\u2019s impossible to say whether these devices might override the judgment of healthcare professionals. Sure, the radiologist could manually look over patient imaging like she is supposed to, but when the tool seems to be right most of the time, she may become complacent in exercising her judgment\u2014and that can cost lives.", "But that leads me to the next hurdle: even if the FDA approves these medical devices, will healthcare providers and their patients trust them?", "Let\u2019s start by walking through an example of a bad implementation of AI in healthcare. Imagine you are a doctor. Like the rest of your colleagues, you spent over a decade taking challenging university classes, struggling through your residencies, and otherwise working your fingers to the bone to succeed in your profession. After years of toil, you finally made it. You\u2019re a respected healthcare professional at a reputable hospital, you frequently read up on the latest innovations in your field, and you know how to prioritize the needs of your patients.", "Suddenly, Artificial Intelligence, which you are familiar with from the many scholarly journals you read, starts being used in your hospital. In this particular case, maybe it predicts the length of a patient\u2019s stay so you can better plan for clinical trials. You notice that, from time to time, it is just dead wrong in its predictions. You even start to suspect the algorithm may have suffered one of the many issues which plague AI, such as model drift. You don\u2019t trust it and begin to override its judgment in favor of your own \u2014 you\u2019re the doctor, after all, and this is what you\u2019ve studied for! It\u2019s your job to give excellent care to your patients, and ultimately, you feel the algorithm doesn\u2019t allow you to do that.", "What happens when Artificial Intelligence tries to do more of your job for you? Will you trust it?", "The heart of the problem in the above scenario is the opaqueness of the model described. In that situation, the developer behind the algorithm didn\u2019t consider that both doctors and patients want to know the why as well as the what. Even if the Artificial Intelligence implementation described above actually gave very accurate assessments of a patient\u2019s length of stay, it never tried to back up the reasoning behind its prediction.", "A more ideal model would incorporate something like SHAP values, which you can read more about in this excellent article by Dr. Dataman. Essentially, they allow the model to provide what\u2019s called local feature importance, which in plain English means an estimation of why this particular case has the predicted outcome that it does [3]. Even though it doesn\u2019t change the algorithm itself in any way, it gives both the provider and the patient insight into its judgment, and in an evidence-based industry like healthcare, that is invaluable.", "When Artificial Intelligence explains its decision-making process, it is easier for patients and providers to trust it.", "Indeed, AI has vast capabilities to aid in clinical decision-making. It\u2019s capable of picking up on complex patterns that only become apparent when patient data is viewed in aggregate\u2014things that would be impossible for us to reasonably expect a human doctor to detect. And while they can\u2019t take the place of a personal healthcare provider, they can provide decision support and help health workers see trends they wouldn\u2019t have noticed otherwise. But this decision support is only possible when the algorithm explains itself.", "Artificial Intelligence is a complex topic, not just in its implementation but also in the ethical dilemmas it poses to us. In 2015, Google\u2019s machine learning-driven photo tagger sparked controversy when it incorrectly labeled a black woman as a gorilla [4]. The social media backlash was justifiably enormous. A single misclassification was enough to draw the eyes of the world to the state of artificial intelligence. Who is responsible when things like this happen? How are we supposed to respond?", "Unfortunately, issues like this are not uncommon even 5 years later. Just within the past month, MIT has had to take down the widely-used Tiny Images data set because of racist and offensive content that was discovered inside of it [5]. How many algorithms that are in use now learned from this data?", "These issues may, on their face, seem irrelevant to AI in healthcare, but I bring them up for a couple reasons:", "Can we confidently say that this will not also happen in the healthcare space? I don\u2019t believe we can. As researchers, there is more work to be done to filter out inherent biases in our data, in our pre-processing techniques, in our models, and in ourselves. The biggest barrier to AI in healthcare is the lack of a guarantee on any given model\u2019s equitability, safety, and effectiveness in all potential use cases.", "There are already great efforts to improve this situation. Libraries like Aequitas are making it easier than ever for developers to test the biases of their models and their data [6]. Along with this, researchers and developers alike are becoming more aware of the effects of model bias, which will lead to further development of tools, techniques, and best practices for detecting and handling model biases. AI may not be ready for prime time in healthcare today, but I, along with many others, will be working hard to get it there. Given the proper care and attention, I believe that AI has the power to change the face of healthcare as we know it.", "My name is Josh Cardosi, and I am a Master\u2019s student studying Artificial Intelligence applications in healthcare. You can read more about how I got here in this article. While the issues I talked about above are very real and will need to be addressed, I strongly believe that we will overcome them and, in doing so, change the state of healthcare for the better. I believe it will lead to better health service utilization, decreased patient mortality, and higher patient and provider confidence in treatment plans.", "Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn.
