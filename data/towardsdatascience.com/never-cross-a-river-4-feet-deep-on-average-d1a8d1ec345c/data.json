It would take an average person about 33 hours to read the entire book, and some scholars have spent their entire life dissecting the masterpiece. How would you briefly explain the book to someone who has never read it?", "The shortest \u201csummary\u201d could be something like: \u201cWar and Peace broadly focuses on Napoleon\u2019s invasion of Russia in 1812\u201d", "A slightly more elaborate\u201csummary that gives you a bit more flavor that the book has some romance as well could be \u201c The book follows three of the most well-known characters in literature: Pierre Bezukhov, the illegitimate son of a count who is fighting for his inheritance and yearning for spiritual fulfillment; Prince Andrei Bolkonsky, who leaves his family behind to fight in the war against Napoleon; and Natasha Rostov, the beautiful young daughter of a nobleman who intrigues both men As Napoleon\u2019s army invades, Tolstoy brilliantly follows characters from diverse backgrounds \u2014 peasants and nobility, civilians and soldiers \u2014 as they struggle with the problems unique to their era, their history, and their culture. And as the novel progresses, these characters transcend their specificity, becoming some of the most moving \u2014 and human \u2014 figures in world literature.1\u201d", "These summaries are at best \u201cbetter than nothing\u201d, but none of them does any justice to Tolstoy\u2019s masterpiece. In fact, the only real advice to your friend would be to read the entire book slowly and meticulously, making note of every single character in a notebook so they don\u2019t get confused with the intertwining plots.", "And yet, it\u2019s on similar very imperfect summaries of data that many business decisions are made: shops are closed because their quarterly results are below expectations, salespeople are promoted or fired because of encouraging or disappointing yearly performances, product lines are discontinued because they are not as profitable overall as other product lines\u2026", "Let me show with a quick example how summaries can be misleading\u2026 A few years ago, I co-founded a catering business where we hired dozens of refugee and immigrant chefs and served their delicious meals for team lunches or corporate events.", "Delivery of the food to the end customers is performed by our own employees. On-time delivery is a key metric for customer satisfaction, and as such, I would like to reward it with a special prize for the employee with the highest on-time delivery percentage. For simplicity, let\u2019s imagine we have 2 delivery people only: Farid and Fatima", "Who should win the prize? Farid clearly right\u2026?", "What if I told you that for January and February combined it was Fatima, not Farid, who had the highest on-time delivery %?", "Impossible you may think \u2014 how can Farid be better in January and in February but Fatima be better overall? Very simply. In fact, if you look at the table below:", "From a mathematical point of view the reasoning is simple: if A1/C1 > B1/D1 and A2/C2 > B2/D2 we cannot necessarily assume that (A1+B1)/(C1+D1) > (A2+B2) / (C2+D2)! This is a basic rule of ratios. Said differently there is a clear difference between the arithmetic average of the 2 months (85% for Farid and 83% for Fatima) and the weighted average represented above.", "And yet from a logical point of view, the conclusion can still be profoundly counter-intuitive and disturbing! In my case, the question still remains: who should receive the prize? The answer, of course, depends on how we ask the question (should the prize be monthly or for the period)? You can easily see how the same reasoning can be applied to other areas (e.g. Product A has higher profit margins than Product B every week of the month \u2014 but Product B has higher profit margins for the month \u2026)", "The implication, on the other hand, is clear: simply relying on the \u201csummary\u201d is not enough\u2026", "Imagine indeed that you want to make sense of a data set that is roughly as sizable as war and peace(say ~500,000 data points). What\u2019s the best way to understand it, describe it, draw insights and act on it? With the War and Peace novel parallel in mind, you should probably spend a few months looking at the entire data set, observing and making sense of every little data point and how it connects with the others. This, of course, would be impractical: Not only would it take a very long time to observe all the data, but more importantly, our human mind does not have the capacity to assimilate or make sense of thousands of disparate data points. When reading a novel, for instance, our brain has an innate ability and has been trained since childhood to build a coherent narrative connecting concepts together, even if you when reading these concepts weeks or months apart. However, our brain has a much more limited capacity to build a coherent image from disparate data. To some extent, understanding the 500,000 data points in the same way we understand the 500,000 words of War and Peace will, for now, remain a distant dream.", "As a workaround, we analyze and summarize data using statistical descriptors such as averages, medians, standard deviations and we use tools such as correlations, clustering and pattern analysis\u2026 We use of course technology tools, and increasingly artificial intelligence to dramatically increase the speed at which we can analyze and summarize the data. These are approaches designed to build a \u201cbridge\u201d between the complexity of the data and the limited understanding of our human minds by simplifying the message, but without the proper usage, they can create as well an incomplete, and even erroneous picture.", "Hypothetically, if there were a super-human mind that could make sense of raw data in the form of millions of data rows, that would be a way to actually achieve a perfect understanding of every single data point. (You may argue that Artificial Intelligence is some version of this \u2014 I think there are opportunities indeed for A.I to enhance this understanding but this should be the topic of a separate article) This super-human mind would of course view any attempt to \u201csummarize\u201d the data as a downgrade from their perfect understanding. And that\u2019s how we should view statistical descriptors of data \u2014 in particular averages and variances \u2014 as convenient but imperfect ways to look at the data. Quite often they carry inherent biases and can lead outright to the wrong conclusions. They are perfect examples where a \u201chalf-understanding\u201d can actually be worse than \u201cno understanding at all\u201d.", "In the following series, I will illustrate some of the judgment errors and biases we make when we \u201cjump to the conclusion\u201d using these summaries with a few practical examples, and explain why the \u201cobvious answer\u201d is not as obvious as it seems.", "This series is helpful for both data authors (people preparing and presenting the data, like consultants) and data readers(recipients of the data, or people being lectured by consultants).", "For data authors, the goal is NOT to provide advanced data analysis techniques. These are covered today in a large variety of books. In fact, the key challenge for data authors today is what I call the \u201cFerrari illusion\u201d: It\u2019s the illusion that you are a better pilot because you\u2019re driving a Ferrari, when in fact, if you want to drive a Ferrari, you have to learn yo become a better pilot. Otherwise, all you are doing is increasing the chances of crashing when you step on that gas pedal. It can take less than a minute to create a pivot table in excel with averages by category, and I am still amazed by how fast and easy tools like Tableau can summarize and create beautiful visuals of hundreds of thousands of data points with simple drag and drops. Drag left, drag right and magically you have the fancy chart with he averages that you need. The tools are becoming increasingly powerful, fast and fancy, but for the data author, it can be tempting to confuse fanciness and power with accuracy. My goal is this context is actually to provide a reminder of some of the basic principles that even advanced data scientists sometimes seem to forget, just like experienced climbers often stumble on the easiest paths when they\u2019re not paying attention. And of course, the tools can then become extremely handy with the right focus in mind.", "For \u201cdata readers\u201d /people being presented the data, the goal is to help ask the right questions, and not fall into the traps set out for them, often intentionally, by the data authors. These \u201ctricks\u201d can be used deliberately, especially by expensive consultants, in order to substantiate the erroneous conclusions their senior partner already gave the client before they had the faintest clue what the data will say. They still get to sleep well at night because sometimes \u201cthe end can justify the means\u201d", "The examples below will serve to illustrate that we need to be skeptical and ask the right questions, especially when being lectured by consultants projecting immaculate slides. My general rule of thumb is: the more immaculate the formatting, the more polished the presenter and the glossier the slide is, the more you should be suspicious and ask more questions.", "In the following chapter, I will illustrate the concepts above for the most popular of the \u201csummary\u201d statistics: the average. I will show with concrete examples several situations where averages can be misleading:", "Let\u2019s go back to my catering company. The company chefs have developed dozens of dishes that come from their culinary heritage \u2014 while all exceptional in my mind, their cuisine can be more or less successful with the typical American Palate. In our continuous effort to provide the best to our customers, we wanted to understand who our best chefs are, we sent a survey where customers can rate every chef\u2019s cooking. At each event we cater, each one of the chefs typically prepares one dish.", "The average of the results for every chef are represented below", "Simple, right? Not so fast. It turns out that all of these conclusions were wrong or at least misleading: Our survey did indeed ask each customer to rate the chef, and we know that each chef prepared a different dish for each event. What if, instead of averaging just the results for the chef, we averaged the results for the corresponding dish? The results are below:", "As we can clearly see, the most popular dish is Egyptian Moussaka, and it is the creation of\u2026 chef Faven! By relying on our average per chef only, we were about to fire the person responsible for our most popular dish! Chef Faven has 2 other dishes that were bringing her average down, and those are manifestly not so popular with New Yorkers and should be eliminated. But she clearly has some talent and we should try to encourage her to create some new dishes.", "And here\u2019s another illustration of the same concept. Our customer service representative Alex had the foresight to ask each survey respondents whether they were vegetarian or not. When we average the responses introducing that dimension, the results are as follows:", "The second wrong conclusion here is that Kosala\u2019s cuisine is actually the most popular with Vegetarian people! So once again, the average per chef only was ranking Kosala as quite average and was missing this critical insight (especially that many of our customers are Vegetarians)", "In our example above, thinking about rating dishes instead of chefs, or about introducing the types of customers can seem obvious \u2014 and it serves essentially to illustrate the point. But you can see how this can become misleading in the following similar example:", "\u201cA company wants to shut down underperforming stores, and it looks at the average revenue per store\u201d. But imagine that the store with the lowest average revenue is the one that happens to sell most of the product with the highest margin for the company or one that has the most potential for growth? This is a very similar example to the chefs example, and I am sure many of you have encountered many times in one shape or another.", "Let\u2019s now have a look at the number of reviews each chef/dish received.", "A noticeable fact from the table above is that Fatima got significantly fewer reviews than her peers, actually about 100 times less! It turns out Fatima is our newest chef: while other chefs have catered typically >40 events each, she has only catered one event on 9/12/18!", "Let\u2019s now zoom-in on that event that Fatima catered and look at the specific ratings:", "Hmmm, the people at that event were particularly generous with their ratings, not just with Fatima, but with everyone! So what say we now? Still, certain Fatima is the best chef ever? Not so sure huh? If you already promoted Fatima, why don\u2019t you call her back and say \u201cHey, I\u2019m really sorry but this promotion was a bit rash! Your cooking is promising, but we really don\u2019t know yet if you\u2019re a good chef, you still have many mountains to climb before we can say anything for sure. Keep up the good work for now and let\u2019s reconvene in a few months\u201d", "It\u2019s not just the number of observations\u2026", "You could call this \u201cstatistical significance\u201d but it goes beyond just the number of observations. In this particular example, there was yet another dimension to the data (the event) which made the data points not independent (i.e not only Fatima had very few data points, but they also were not independent since all relating to a single event)", "Ok \u2014 but how about Farid, Batsa and Azar? They seem to be quite similar: similar average ratings overall, similar average ratings per individual dish, and all have had a significant number of data points. The averages, in that case, must have given a fair representation right? Let\u2019s have a look at the individual ratings and see if we missed something. The chart below shows the # of ratings in a particular bin (e.g. 70 to 80 would be classified in the 80 bucket) for each dish.", "Batsa\u2019s ratings look different, don\u2019t they? They are all in the 70s and 80s bucket whereas Farid, Azar and Kosala all have more extremes (either lower or higher). Said differently, pretty much everyone thinks Batsa\u2019s dishes are very good \u2014 nobody thinks they\u2019re average nor exceptional, whereas, for the other chefs, we have some customers who think their cuisine is exceptional or average! Here\u2019s another opportunity to slice again across all the dimensions of the data (per event, per type of customer \u2026) to understand more. I will spare you the details, but essentially it turns out that Farid and Azar\u2019s dishes can get exceptional ratings with people who label themselves \u201cadventurous eaters\u201d and like to try different and quite exotic things while getting sometimes low ratings for people who prefer to play it safe \u2014 you know who I\u2019m talking about: those who would only order a Pad Thai in a Thai restaurant and will never try anything else\u2026 Batsa\u2019s dishes, in contrast, are the \u201cvanilla\u201d flavor of ice cream: everyone likes it but nobody is crazy about it! This turns out to be very valuable information as it will help us tag our dishes: \u201cAdventurous\u201d or \u201cCrowd pleaser\u201d.", "More technically this is measured by the variance or standard deviation across each dimension (smaller standard deviation indicating less variance), however, I find that visual representations like the above chart are more compelling than just using standard deviation measures.", "One of my favorite authors Nicholas Taleb put it nicely when he said \u201cNever cross a river that is on average 4 feet deep\u201d. Essentially he is saying that data variability can make the averages useless and often lead to mistakes as we have illustrated above.", "But does that mean we should always discard the conclusions that averages give us? Let\u2019s not be that radical shall we? Averages can be helpful when one is aware of the context. For example, if I told you that the average selling price of a Honda Odyssey 2018 EX in NY is $29,978 whereas the average selling price of the Honda Pilot 2018 EX is $39,760, that is actually a useful information to conclude it will be cheaper to buy the Odyssey and give you an idea of what you will spend. The context of this data is:", "But let\u2019s take another example where average prices will not be helpful. Suppose you have to advise your crazy rich Asian friend on how much to bid for a Picasso painting and a Van Gogh painting going on auction at Sotheby's. You pull-out average data saying that Picasso on average sold for ~$7M at auctions and Van Gogh at ~$13M. This, as you have guessed, is almost useless information for your friend because:", "Another everyday example that I personally find very interesting is the restaurant 5-star rating system on Yelp or Google. With this system, every restaurant is essentially reduced to a single grad (i.e. 2.5, 3, or 4.5 on a 5-star scale). This is the perfect example of averages over-simplifying the message and erasing the idiosyncrasies of each restaurant. With this rating \u201ccrowd-pleasers\u201d naturally rise to the top, a bit like \u201cVanilla\u201d ice cream being more popular than green tea ice cream. But if like my wife you are a big fan of the green tea ice cream, then you may be missing out by simply relying on the star system. The \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d is sometimes the \u201ctyranny of the masses\u201d, and in many ways, the old-fashioned restaurant reviews (when written by an unbiased professional) can give a much more colored and flavorful review of restaurants.", "That\u2019s not to say that star ratings and crowd wisdom should be neglected, but it is more appropriate for things that are homogeneous in nature: for example business hotels where the rating of hygiene and comfort, which are critical to the ratings, are quite universal and don\u2019t depend that much on \u201ctastes\u201d like restaurant food does.", "As a side note, I should highlight that I have come across one notable exception where the average is actually more informative than the collection of data points: the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d. If you ask people to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar, you will notice that the average of their answers is the best approximation (there will be \u201cexperts\u201d that will do better than the average, but they will not be as \u201cconsistent\u201d as the average \u2014 i.e. if you repeat the experiment many times, the average will be the winner over all the experts. This is the \u201cwisdom of the crowd\u201d effect, a fascinating phenomenon that deserves its own separate chapter.", "Overall you need to adopt a skeptical attitude and get the right context. Data is tricky, so remember that any synthesis is imperfect. That can be ok and necessary of course, however, awareness of this can help immensely:", "Continuous improvement executive, entrepreneur, husband, father and Tango dancer.
