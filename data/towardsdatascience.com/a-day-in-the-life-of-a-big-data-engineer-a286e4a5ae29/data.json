Scrolling through tech newsfeeds, I enable email notifications. You should not open emails before start working, but everything can happen to our data at any\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Facts: I work with approximately 200 PB of data", "1 PB is equal to 20 million four-drawer filing cabinets filled with texts or roughly 13 years of HD-TV videos.", "50 PB is the entire written works of mankind from the beginning of recorded history in all languages", "I wake up at 7 A.M.", "I make myself the first cup of coffee. Scrolling through tech newsfeeds, I enable email notifications. You should not open emails before start working, but everything can happen to our data at any time, and we must stay informed.", "I arrive at the office around 8:30 A.M.", "Nobody\u2019s here yet as I\u2019m one of the earliest birds in the open space. After settling down, I take a look at our data monitoring tools: resource consumption graph, storage bar charts, anomaly alerts. If something is strange with the data, I\u2019ll have to check it out. Some data can go missing or have unusual values. Sometimes the data transactions crash and we end up with no data. In case one of those bad things happens, I\u2019ll need a second cup of coffee.", "Next, I check on our data schedulers. We ingest hundreds of terabytes a day. We cannot handle by hand all those data from one pipeline to another. We need data schedulers with which we can execute queries, copy data between databases, and of utmost importance, set a timer to those commands. A scheduler is a vital part of a data pipeline where the amount of data exceeds the capacity of human manipulation. All our data schedulers are in-house because we engineers love crafting.", "I have my daily meeting with my teammates at 10:30 every morning. We tell each other what we did the day before, what we are going to do that day, and whether anything blocks us. We try to speak concisely to save everybody\u2019s time because we hate long meetings. I find these compact reunions helpful seeing it maintains a minimum interaction of every team member.", "I come back to my daily tasks by doing some code reviews. Your programming needs to go through your peers\u2019 judgment before merging into production. They can either approve, reject, or adjust some of your work. I realize it hard to assess somebody\u2019s code without talking to them in person. I mostly choose to come to their desk and make sure we\u2019re on the same page. You don\u2019t want to become an \u201capproval slut\u201d \u2014 an engineer who always endorses his teammates\u2019 work without examining them. Appraise their code the same way you want yours to be evaluated.", "At noon, my team has lunch together at the company\u2019s cafeteria. We chat about life, jobs, technology issues. Everyone can discuss everything without pretense on the table. Our lunch break lasts not for long, and we soon gather in the kitchen for another coffee \u2014 my third one.", "Around 2 P.M. I resume my workday on some software developments. We data engineers still work with data-related pieces of software. I read SQL queries, run tests in the Hadoop ecosystem, verify whether the modification won\u2019t put too much pressure on the storage, and finally commit the change. The development could get stuck for any kind of reason: the code won\u2019t compile, the production and test environments don\u2019t match, typos in the queries. I refill my cup of coffee. I lost count of them.", "Later in the afternoon, I typically get a demand to perform a production release. We wish to update tables, refresh the queries, or kick off a brand new pipeline. Working at an engineering-focused company, I am happy to see we automate every software procedures. I merely have to press some buttons, and let the scripts handle the whole thing. If things go well, we\u2019ll have a new version of the data system up and running.", "6 P.M., time to wrap up. I make sure the data schedulers still run as expected, no warning in the monitoring dashboard, no one complaints about data being missing or incorrect. We collaborate with co-workers all around the world, so I am not surprised by receiving error messages in the middle of the night. For now, all seems fine, so I grab my computer and say goodbye to my colleagues.", "After turning off all work-related notifications, I enjoy the last moment of the day by reading a non-technical book, thus conclude a typical day in the life of a Big Data engineer.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Engineer by day, writer by night. Write a draft like no one is watching.
