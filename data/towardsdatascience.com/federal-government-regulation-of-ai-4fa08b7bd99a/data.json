(NOTE: This draft is available for public comments until March 13, so there is still an opportunity to exercise your democratic voice!)", "For those not familiar with the process, the federal government is often required to post for public review and comment new rules which will apply to individuals and entities in the U.S. This is all because of a law called the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). I\u2019ve previously written more about the APA and its potential effect on data science rules here.", "Once this draft is finalized, it will formally be sent to all federal government agencies which will be required to follow it until it is rescinded or modified.", "Let\u2019s back up a little bit to understand the current context of AI regulation in the U.S. On February 11, 2019, the White House issued an Executive Order (E.O.) (which has the force of law) titled, \u201cAccelerating America\u2019s Leadership in Artificial Intelligence\u201d.", "This E.O. laid out the direction of AI policy for the federal government. Of note, the five requirements firmly establish the U.S. policy of encouraging AI development and innovation in the United States and also called for standards to be drafted and used for international engagement. It is clear that the U.S. government believes that AI innovation is imperative part of the growth of the economy, and this should be supported and nurtured.", "\u201cthe policy of the United States Government [is] to sustain and enhance the scientific, technological, and economic leadership position of the United States in AI.\u201d", "The current draft rules for U.S. regulations of AI are required under the E.O. along with government plans on increasing the AI workforce, international engagement on AI standards, and direct government investment in AI research and capacity.", "If you\u2019re not used to reading through government rules and regulations, it can be a bit difficult to follow. For example, it\u2019s important to note that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) is proposing and issuing these rules to all federal agencies. OMB has oversight authority on the other federal agencies and is in the position to dictate agency actions on many aspects.", "Therefore this OMB rule will instruct the agencies of the federal government how to consider, draft, and issue (or abstain from) all regulations concerning the use or oversight of AI in the United States.", "Let me illustrate this with some possible examples. Before the Department of Transportation can regulate autonomous vehicles in the U.S., they must first consider these OMB rules. If the Department of Justice were to issue guidance or regulations concerning how courts should use Machine Learning models in criminal sentencing, they also must first consider these rules. Or say that the Department of Commerce was going to issue rules governing how Amazon could use your data in advertising, they also must be in compliance with these rules.", "First, it is important to note that this applies to how government agencies will regulate AI in the private sector, this does not control how the government will internally use and apply AI (this second piece may be coming soon).", "Second, the draft is very clear that the government\u2019s position will be one of minimal regulation and maximum encouragement of AI growth and innovation. Therefore, the federal government will look to remove potential roadblocks to AI growth and will not introduce regulation on AI unless absolutely necessary (we\u2019ll talk more about what this means below). This comes down to: When in doubt, the government should not regulate AI.", "This might go as far as the federal government using its power to remove state and local laws that prohibit AI growth \u2014 this could be interesting as several States are passing laws regulating the use of data and AI in the private sector.", "Let\u2019s look at what the draft says for government regulation of AI. What are they proposing to be the most important considerations of AI rules?", "Since the draft rules will prohibit regulating AI unless specifically needed. In the absence of an overriding need for AI regulations, agencies should consider non-regulatory approaches.", "These include sector specific guidelines or best practices. Typically this will be the encouragement and promulgation of private sector best practices within specific sectors, such as transportation, advertising, or banking.", "Exemptions from regulations will also be permitted for Pilot programs and experiments to allow for innovation and exploration in controlled environments instead of having to comply with government rules which may preclude innovation.", "And finally, the government should rely on private sector organization to voluntarily comply with internal standards and controls unless otherwise necessitating regulations.", "And lastly, the draft OMB rules dictate that agencies must further support the innovation of AI in the private sector by ensuring their compliance with several laws and rules which require federal agencies to make public \u2014 as much as practical \u2014 government data sets and models. The continued rise of publicly available government data (most available through data.gov and agency websites) is intended to return administrative data to the public for all uses. The data is anonymized and structured, but has vast potential in many sectors.", "These draft rules are just the latest iteration of the U.S. federal government approach to AI in the united states and international community. Of note, several states seem to be seeking more progressive regulation of AI technologies and methods, and these rules will likely set the federal government on an collision course with state and local government rules.", "Federal regulation is often slow, and particularly reactionary in the United States. It is clear that the current goals and strategy will focus on mitigating specific threats and harm, but taking a very hands-off approach to the AI sectors.", "It's not clear how this will affect any current rules, or whether this approach will result in an uptick of AI innovation and research in the United States. We should keep a close eye on this space \u2014 as well as international AI rules and laws \u2014 as the technology becomes more ubiquitous and as average citizens become more aware of the potential benefits as well as harms.", "Your home for data science.
