Sling your arrows this way if these recommendations don\u2019t work out for you.", "Python has quickly grown into the lingua franca of machine learning. It\u2019s outpaced R and offers abundant packages for scientific computing. A data scientist must be an adept Python programmer.", "In addition to having good coding chops, it\u2019s reasonable to expect a data scientist to possess some core analytics skills, including data visualization. I offer some tips on a popular third-party tool, Tableau, for drag-and-drop analytics. A data scientist should be comfortable communicating their insights, sometimes using visualizations.", "Finally, to be truly full-stack, a data scientists should be comfortable with all the steps from prototyping to productionizing a model.

The platform\u2019s simple interface helps you practice coding until getting the computer to do what you want is no longer the hard part \u2014 this frees up brainspace to focus on the challenges associated with actual data science.
