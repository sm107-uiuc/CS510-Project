After checking the writing tone, these posts imply or say out loud that:", "Correlation is not as good as causality!", "The tendency of \u2018bias towards\u2019 causation in the data world is understandable, as it takes years of professional training to grasp the causal gist. In contrast, the correlational study has a low entrance bar.", "On the application side, many business scenarios require causal insights, including pinpointing the target audience, iterating future products, and generating actionable insights into customers\u2019 behaviors.", "However, these should not be the reasons why we reject correlational study and treat it with less appreciation. Each type of work has a wide range of applications.", "In its simplest form, Events A and B happen together but without causal claims. In other words, we don\u2019t know if A causes B or the other way around.", "For example, an online booking agency (e.g., booking.com) just spent 1 million and came up with a new web design on November 10th, and there was a surge of website traffic one week later. Event A (new web design) and Event B (the surge of traffic) are correlated, but we don\u2019t know if there is a causal relationship.", "UX Designers are waiting impatiently and want to claim the credits.", "On top of being associated, causality adds two additional layers of requirements: a time sequence and no alternatives. In the above case, a causal claim suggests Event A causes Event B for two reasons. First, A happens before B. Second, there should be no alternative explanation for the website traffic spike, which needs to be verified.", "Working with the Product team, Data Scientists have come up with three additional possible explanations for the traffic spike:", "Hypothesis 1: Increased spending in digital marketing from the last three quarters finally pays off.", "Hypothesis 2: Improved macro-economic conditions boost customers\u2019 willingness to travel.", "Hypothesis 3: It\u2019s about the time of the year for travel. Customers start planning for family trips for Christmas.", "Here comes the different focus of these two approaches: the school of correlation only tells us how strongly these events are related but can\u2019t decide if there is a causal relationship nor the direction of causation; the school of causation needs to address these puzzles.", "To rule out the alternatives, Data Scientists choose one of these three paths: experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational designs.", "For the hardcore causal \u201cinferencer,\u201d the Gold Standard of causal inference is a Randomized Controlled Trial, which randomly assigns research subjects to the experimental condition to eliminate biases and attribute the difference to the treatment.", "In the above web traffic case, we can run an A/B test and randomly assign customers from different localities to receive the new design or the old version.", "However, the devils are in the details.", "Technically speaking, the random assignment should eliminate covariate bias and create balanced data distribution. However, it\u2019s easy to have a spillover effect considering social media\u2019s penetration into people\u2019s lives. We all post pictures of what we eat, what we dress, and what we do online, which may dilute or even invalidate the causal effect.", "However, Data Scientists should duly note the downsides of experiments, including:", "For the reasons listed above, it is impossible to adopt an RCT every time, and we can settle for a Quasi-Experimental Design. For this type of design, researchers do not have full control over the random assignment, and we may have to deal with imbalanced covariate distribution.", "In a sequence of blog posts, I\u2019ve introduced multiple quasi-experimental methods to identify causation.", "All of the quasi-methods (e.g., DID, RDD, ITS, etc.) share the same design idea: take any prior differences between the treatment and control groups into consideration and find a way to rule them out. We can seek help from time (i.e., comparing today to yesterday, panel data) and space dimensions (i.e., comparing to other similar cases, cross-sectional data).", "We have to check available resources and constraints before choosing the most appropriate method. If applied correctly, these quasi methods derive causal inferences as close as an RCT.", "The observational approach offers the last resort. Researchers have no idea of the Data Generation Process and no control over the intervention assignment. That\u2019s why the observational method often generates imprecise and biased estimates.", "For example, the Facebook Data Science team compares the performances of experimental and non-experimental approaches. They find the observational method performs poorly in estimating the advertisement measurement (the original paper).", "Running experiments is expensive, and the observational approach is not reliable.", "As always, I\u2019d recommend the following iteration steps:", "Always go back to our business questions/hypotheses to validate our models.", "Always keep iterating over the workflow.", "We can have immediately usable findings to help the product team get started and do minor calibrations if needed.", "Big tech companies have incorporated experimental thinking into their business strategy and product development pipelines (check out these incredible work: Facebook, Netflix, and Airbnb).", "Causal inference brings benefits for today and tomorrow.", "Causality research shows how users engage with our products and quantify the engagements, producing actionable insights for today.", "Human beings change their behaviors over time, and the business to adapt side-by-side. Longitudinal causal work helps us track such changes, predicting the future trend for tomorrow.", "Correlational research has a broader market with more business scenarios. It is so because correlational study requires less \u201cpicky\u201d statistical assumptions.", "For example, big retail companies arrange store layouts and put similar products together.", "As far as I know, Target, Walmart, and Costco rearrange store layout following associational analysis.", "You may have heard of the Diaper-Beer Syndrome: new dads grab a cold one after shopping for diapers for their newborns on the way out of the store. So, businesses put Pampers and Bud Light nearby to bundle the sale.", "Honestly, shopping is way too heavy-duty for men.", "The D-B Syndrome is a business scenario that we care about WHAT products sell together and less so about WHY.", "Some items may be correlated for good reasons but more often for no reason. They simply do, and it\u2019s OK for not knowing the why. So, a strong correlation is good enough.", "Things are related for a reason.", "Things are related for no reason at all.", "Instead of asking which one is more important, the real questions we should be asking are:", "1. What are the pros and cons of each school?", "2. What available information do we have? What constraints are we facing?", "3. How and when to adopt each one?", "Medium recently evolved its Writer Partner Program, which supports ordinary writers like myself.
