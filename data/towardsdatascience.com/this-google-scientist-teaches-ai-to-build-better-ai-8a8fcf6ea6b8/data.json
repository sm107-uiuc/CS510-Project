One of the \u201c35 innovators/visionaries under 35\u201d by MIT Review.", "This interview took place at Toronto Machine Learning Summit (TMLS) on November 2019.", "For more TDS-only interview, please check out here:", "I got my Masters and Ph.D in electrical and computer engineering at Rice University. I was working on algorithmic, hardware/software code design for large-scale data analytics model and Machine Learning. Towards the end of my Ph.D when Deep Learning took off, I switched my focus to Deep Learning.", "Afterwards, I saw a flyer for Google Brain Residency Program. The goal was for people with backgrounds other than Deep/Machine Learning to become researchers in the field. I\u2019ve been there 3.5 years now.", "On a slight tangent, something I notice in Machine Learning community that is very common is that a lot of people are very excited about research in computer vision, NLP, robotics, Machine Learning, and games.", "So I was very excited about doing ML for systems and computer design because these are the biggest enablers of Machine Learning. A lot of success on Deep Learning is due to better hardware and systems we have right now that we didn\u2019t have 10 years ago.", "Of course, these are like Tensorflow and Pytorch that\u2019s powerful, and people can easily get into for training their own DL models. The other important aspects are the chips and the hardware, like GPUs and TPUs.", "TPUs or Tensor Processing Units are also very powerful hardwares for running ML algorithms that we didn\u2019t have before. These kinds of systems enable Deep Learning to be what it is today.", "Furthermore, if you look at the trend of A.I., we notice that we really need significantly better computer hardware to be able to keep up with computational demands of A.I. So the way I think about it is to use Machine Learning itself to help A.I. and design the next generation of systems and chips.", "In 2018, my colleague Anna Goldie and I founded the Machine Learning for Systems Team at Google Brain. The main focus of our team is to use AI to design and optimize the next generation of systems and chips. The type of research we focus on is mostly Deep Reinforcement Algorithms \u2014 sequential decision making optimization methods that enable us to solve large-scale optimization problems.", "To give you an example, in a robotics task, let\u2019s say a robot wants to get to a target. The robot is located on a 2-D grid and wants to move around. The sequence of decisions are decisions about where the robots move first (left, right, straight ahead, barriers, etc.).", "So there are series of decisions that you take in sequence. You take one action, which is to go right. And then you take the next action. Your actions are conditioned on the previous actions you\u2019ve taken.", "Your end goal is to take the series of actions such that you reach the target as fast as possible with minimum number of moves. Sequential Decision making task has to do with how you can optimize a series of decisions such that you get to your target reward function (whatever that is) in an optimized way.", "I will tell you in the context of policy optimization (reinforcement learning). You can imagine you have Neural Net model that represents your policy. In the beginning:", "Policy here means reinforcement learning model. The reason why it\u2019s called a \u201cpolicy\u201d is that it takes an input state and it takes a set of actions. It predicts an action given a state. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a policy.", "Yes, there are no labels here, but we still have state of the input of the problem and in the end, we want to optimize for the reward function. In a lot of these policy optimization algorithms, what we are doing is, we are training a policy that optimizes the expected reward function given the distribution of actions that it predicts for a given state.", "This was one of my first projects that I did when I joined Google Brain with a group of excellent colleagues. The idea behind this layer is that if you look into the Deep Learning models (transformer, convolutions, LSTMs), lots of these are relatively dense.", "Dense means that input examples goes through all the network, from the beginning to the end. We process each input with the same amount of computation across all input examples.", "The idea behind this work is that we can have a union of experts where each expert is represented by Neural Network itself, and these experts can be specialized in different types of data within your training dataset. So as you\u2019re passing an example throughout the model, the example goes through certain paths through this Neural Network and goes all the way to the end, but not through everything.", "There are many advantages to this model. First, we can have models with a lot of capacity that can learn from massive data. This means we can have a lot of parameters. One of the models we have built had billions of parameters where we trained billions of data points on it.", "The beauty of this is in its simplicity, as an example only sees a small portion of the model. We can have say 1,024 experts total but the example goes through only 4 or 8 of the experts. So we have this large capacity model but the amount of computing power applied to each sample is still very small. Yet this big model can collectively learn from this large amount of data we have with a large amount of parameters that it can use to encode the knowledge and use for training the model.", "a layer that is integrated with a global model and you have a whole bunch of experts (aka Neural Nets) that are investigating different parts of the data. But why yours is called Sparsely-gated is because we aren\u2019t looking at every experts but a few, but you\u2019re still able to arrive at similar results as all of the different experts?", "Or with better results! The reason why it\u2019s named Sparsely-Gated is because we train what we call a Gater that together with these experts. The input to the expert layer goes to the Gater first, and the Gater decides which experts should process this input. A sparse number of those experts receive any input to this Gater. Think of the Gater as routing input examples through a few number of experts. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a Sparse Gater.", "And yes, as you say, we have these expert layer with the Gater, and you can embed that into a Deep Learning model, like an LSTM. Surprisingly, not only we can not only get results faster or achieve to the same accuracy, we can achieve better results. Part of this was because we could process more data and the other part of it was because of the regularization effects of the Sparse-Gated MOE that make the model generalize better to the unseen test data.", "Dropout is an example of doing regularization. You can think about the MOE as in some sense similar to dropout. Except it is used in a more structured way where we are using the benefit of sparsity for computational efficiency as well.", "So we have all these models, and each time the Gater looks into whatever activation it got for an example and passes it to a sparse number of models. Whereas in a dense layer you see all of the model go through that. Here, we\u2019re dropping by design a large number of experts.", "To explain, the reason why this is a conditional computation is that despite most other Deep Learning models where input goes through all the network, here we condition an input through a Gater model jointly with the rest of the network.", "We condition it through the Gater to restrict it to certain paths of the Neural Network. That way, our experts or modules are becoming specialized in different parts of the training data, which helps them to become better at processing and evaluating the data.", "It\u2019s a great team we have with a large number of great researchers and engineers that work very well together. We focus on important and really hard problems. It\u2019s just a lot of fun working with this team and working on a type of problems that we do.", "I would say we have a good academic culture. We are very actively present in publication and top tier conferences. We really encourage our researchers to publish and collaborate.", "At the same time, a lot of the exciting work came out of Google Brain. An example of it is Google Translate, which is based on the LSTM/Seq-2-Seq approach which is really amazing. They pretty much revolutionized the way NLP machine translation is done.", "Actually my paper on Mixture-of-Experts was with Geoffrey Hinton. I feel very lucky to be able to work with him. He\u2019s an amazing person, such a pleasure just to be around him. The most humble person at the same time.", "I\u2019m very positive about AI. I believe that AI will help everyone. Sure in industry they might have access to compute and data that others might not. At the same time, I feel like there is a lot of work and research that can be done even without a lot of data, because then you can innovate around the constraints that we have. We see this all the time in academia.", "So I think there are opportunities in academia and industry to thrive and in this era of AI and at the same time if we do something great, for example self-driving cars, I personally believe that it\u2019s going to be great to everyone, freeing more of their time to pursue other things and innovate in other areas.", "For the full interview, check out the video here:", "Silicon Valley Data Scientist | Former Project Lead @TowardsDataScience (Medium)"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url": "https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F8a8fcf6ea6b8&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderCollection&source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Open in app"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign up"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign In"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_sidenav-----------", "anchor_text": "Write"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/search?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign up"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign In"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/tds-interview", "anchor_text": "Exclusive TDS interview"}, {"url": "https://haebichan.medium.com/?source=post_page-----8a8fcf6ea6b8--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/?source=post_page-----8a8fcf6ea6b8--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://haebichan.medium.com/?source=post_page-----8a8fcf6ea6b8--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Haebichan Jung"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F3f21c19cacf6&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&user=Haebichan+Jung&userId=3f21c19cacf6&source=post_page-3f21c19cacf6----8a8fcf6ea6b8---------------------post_header-----------", "anchor_text": "Follow"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/?source=post_page-----8a8fcf6ea6b8--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Towards Data Science"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fvote%2Ftowards-data-science%2F8a8fcf6ea6b8&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&user=Haebichan+Jung&userId=3f21c19cacf6&source=-----8a8fcf6ea6b8---------------------clap_footer-----------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F8a8fcf6ea6b8&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2Fthis-google-scientist-teaches-ai-to-build-better-ai-8a8fcf6ea6b8&source=-----8a8fcf6ea6b8---------------------bookmark_footer-----------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/@haebichan", "anchor_text": "Haebichan Jung"}, {"url": "https://www.technologyreview.com/lists/innovators-under-35/2019/visionary/azalia-mirhoseini/", "anchor_text": "Azalia Mirhoseini"}, {"url": "https://www.google.com/search?q=toronto+machine+learning+summit+2019&oq=toronto+machine+learning+summit&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i57j0l5j69i61.3274j0j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8", "anchor_text": "Toronto Machine Learning Summit (TMLS)"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/tds-interview", "anchor_text": "here"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/tagged/tds-interview", "anchor_text": "TDS-Only InterviewRead writing about Tds Interview in Towards Data Science.
