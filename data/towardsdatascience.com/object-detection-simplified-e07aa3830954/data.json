Interpreting the object localisation can be done in various ways, including creating a bounding box around the object or marking every pixel in the image which contains the object (called segmentation).", "Object detection was studied even before the breakout popularity of CNNs in Computer Vision. While CNNs are capable of automatically extracting more complex and better features, taking a glance at the conventional methods can at worst be a small detour and at best an inspiration.", "Object detection before Deep Learning was a several step process, starting with edge detection and feature extraction using techniques like SIFT, HOG etc. These image were then compared with existing object templates, usually at multi scale levels, to detect and localize objects present in the image.", "Intersection over Union (IoU) : Bounding box prediction cannot be expected to be precise on the pixel level, and thus a metric needs to be defined for the extend of overlap between 2 bounding boxes.", "Intersection over Union does exactly what it says. It takes the area of intersection of the 2 bounding boxes involved and divide it with the area of their union. This provides a score, between 0 and 1, representing the quality of overlap between the 2 boxes.", "Average Precision and Average Recall : Precision meditates how accurate are our predictions while recall accounts for whether we are able to detect all objects present in the image or not. Average Precision (AP) and Average Recall (AR) are two common metrics used for object detection.", "Now that we have enjoyed the soup, let\u2019s jump right into the main course!! Two-Step Object Detection involves algorithms that first identify bounding boxes which may potentially contain objects and then classify each bounding separately.", "The first step requires a Region Proposal Network, providing a number of regions which are then passed to common DL based classification architectures. From the hierarchical grouping algorithm in RCNNs (which are extremely slow) to using CNNs and ROI pooling in Fast RCNNs and anchors in Faster RCNNs (thus speeding up the pipeline and training end-to-end), a lot of different methods and variations have been provided to these region proposal networks (RPNs).", "These algorithms are known to perform better than their one-step object detection counterparts, but are slower in comparison. With various improvements suggested over the years, the current bottleneck in the latency of Two-Step Object Detection networks is the RPN step. You can refer to this nice blog below for more details on RPN based object detection.", "With the need of real time object detection, many one-step object detection architectures have been proposed, like YOLO, YOLOv2, YOLOv3, SSD, RetinaNet etc. which try to combine the detection and classification step.", "One of the major accomplishments of these algorithms have been introducing the idea of \u2018regressing\u2019 the bounding box predictions. When every bounding box is represented easily with a few values (for example, xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax), it becomes easier to combine the detection and classification step and dramatically speed up the pipeline.", "For example, YOLO divided the entire image into smaller grid boxes. For each grid cell, it predicts the class probabilities and the x and y coordinates of every bounding box which passes through that grid cell. Kinda like the image based captcha where you select all smaller grids which contain the object!!!", "These modification allow one-step detectors to run faster and also work on a global level. However, since they do not work on every bounding box separately, this can cause them to perform worse in case of smaller objects or similar object in close vicinity. There have been multiple new architectures introduced to give more importance to lower level features too, thus trying to provide a balance.", "Heatmap-based object detection can be, in some sense, considered an extension of one-shot based Object Detection. While one-shot based object detection algorithms try to directly regress the bounding box coordinates (or offsets), heatmap-based object detection provides probability distribution of bounding box corners/center.", "Based on the positioning of these corner/center peaks in the heatmaps, resulting bounding boxes are predicted. Since a different heatmap can be created for every class, this method also combines detection and classification. While heatmap-based object detection is currently leading new research, it is still not as fast as conventional one-shot object detection algorithms. This is due to the fact that these algorithms require more complex backbone architectures (CNNs) to get respectable accuracy.", "While Object Detection is a growing field which has seen various improvements over the years, the problem is clearly not yet completely solved. With so much variety available in terms of different approaches to object detection, all of them with their own pros and cons, one can always choose the method that suits their requirements best and thus no one algorithm currently rules the field.", "This blog is a part of an effort to create simplified introductions to the field of Machine Learning.
