To my surprise, a marketing team at one of the biggest technology corporations in the world asked my team to develop dashboards for them. I assumed that big tech companies had all these things figured out. This company, in particular, had an entire department dedicated to marketing analytics and measurement and had hundreds of dashboards at their disposal.", "The problem was, nobody used any of them.", "When I finally got a look at the dashboards that the team had in place, It wasn\u2019t hard to figure out why. Nobody used the dashboards because nobody in the business understood what they were looking at. Mind you, these were some of the most beautiful, sophisticated dashboards I have ever seen \u2014 they were filled with dozens of KPIs, advanced charts, statistics, gauges, and tables. These were dashboards built to the highest degree of technical proficiency and analytics prowess, but they failed to solve the problem that they were supposed to be solving for: Provide actionable information to the business.", "Don\u2019t get caught in the common trap that complexity = sophistication. Doing more is definitely not always better. This quote, from Leonardo Davinci (supposedly), is one I actually believe in: \u201cSimplicity is the ultimate sophistication.\u201d Follow this creed with your dashboards (and pretty much everything you do). If the business user can\u2019t understand clearly the value that the dashboard gives back to them, they\u2019ll never look at it. It needs to be so simple and easy to use and look at that the business user can\u2019t run their business without it.", "Unfortunately, even folks on the business side can be blinded by really pretty looking charts and graphs \u2014 you might have even been praised by the business for a dashboard you\u2019ve built that was extremely sophisticated. But that expression of approval is just the business recognizing your technical skills, not the satisfaction that you solved their problem. At first glance, they\u2019ll think you\u2019ve solved their problem because of how amazing everything looks. But without even thinking, they\u2019ll be back to pivot tables and manual data pulls within a month.", "The allure of putting huge amounts of information on your dashboards is part of an overarching desire for data analysis \u2014 business users want insights to make them better at doing their jobs. The problem is, dashboards are one of the worst tools for data analysis. They\u2019re not designed for answering deep questions about your data \u2014 but they\u2019re fantastic for tracking and measurement.", "These are the types of questions a dashboard is great at answering:", "These are the types of questions a dashboard is not great at answering:", "Develop your dashboards with an eye towards metrics that can be a) tracked over-time and b) measured against something. Don\u2019t just visualize the numbers, compare them against a target, a historical timeline, or a competing product. The visualization must not only answer the question of \u201cwhat?\u201d and \u201cwhen?\u201d but \u201ccompared to what?\u201d", "3) Dashboards should measure what matters, not what's easy.", "Jobs Theory teaches not only a framework for how to innovate but how to build your organization around \u201cjobs to be done\u201d and identify metrics that matter. Dr. Clayton Christensen, the creator of Jobs Theory, called these metrics \u201ccustomer benefit metrics\u201d \u2014 in other words, the metrics that indicate how well you\u2019re product or service solve the job that it was designed to solve (Competing Against Luck, p.161). Unfortunately, the data behind \u201ccustomer benefit metrics\u201d are typically incredibly hard to gather. Subsequently, as analytics professionals and data scientists, we default to the data that is easiest to get to and most readily available. In an effort to feel like we\u2019re accomplishing something, we pull in, pivot, and analyze these hundreds of data sources, creating complex models and amazing visualizations that, while beautiful to look at, and demonstrate our technical skill, ultimately fall short of the goal \u2014 which is to provide the business with the most important and valuable information possible.", "Spend less time making dashboard widgets, fancy charts, or creating new data pipelines and more time defining your most important KPIs. Then, create strategies to get the data that truly matters to your business.", "Questions or comments? You can email me at cwarren@stitcher.tech.
