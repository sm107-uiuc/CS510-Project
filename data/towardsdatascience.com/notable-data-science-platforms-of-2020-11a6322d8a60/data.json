This is why I\u2019m attempting to do a snapshot of data science platforms (DSPs) that I have found to be notable in 2020.", "First, let\u2019s look at the major cloud providers. Today, all the major cloud providers have their own data science platforms. These options are really amazing because they integrate so well with all the other services they have to offer. Want to deploy a model into an ETL pipeline? \u2014 They\u2019ve got that covered (given you\u2019re doing it in the cloud). Another nice feature of using the cloud is that you can easily spin up and scale hardware for deploying open-source tools like Airflow, Kubeflow, etc.", "If you can\u2019t get access to the cloud in your company, you might want to move to the next section.", "Doing data science in the cloud used to be a huge pain and took 8,000 steps just to get set up. Other companies (see middleweight section) started selling their own \u201cdata science platforms\u201d on top of the cloud, which made scalable data science much easier. Eventually, AWS caught on, and they came out with AWS Sagemaker. When it comes to major cloud providers, AWS Sagemaker was an initial trailblazer. AWS Sagemaker continues to add features like AutoML, Ground Truth, and now Sagemaker Studio.", "Azure ML Studio and AWS Sagemaker feel VERY similar. To some degree, AWS Sagemaker and Azure are \u201cpo(tay)to, po(ta)to\u201d. They both offer machine learning studios, AutoML, labeling services, and more. Even the code looks the same. (Although I\u2019ve heard some say Azure is cheaper).", "Personally, one thing I really like about Azure is its integration with Databricks. It\u2019s very easy to get up and running with a Databricks service on Azure. So to get a Databricks environment, you could call-up Databricks and work with their team, or you could just get Azure and spin up a Databricks environment in no time! Pretty awesome!", "In this space, Google was surprisingly late to the game. Although Azure and AWS are a bit more mature, Google is a groundbreaking company that\u2019s doing amazing work in AI and ML. Their AutoML tools can be impressive, and I can only imagine they\u2019ll get even better. I don\u2019t have to tell you that Google is a pretty smart company when it comes to tech and AI.", "The following options have some maturity behind them, and they generally focus on model training and have varying support for model deployment. Unlike cloud platforms, which can only be hosted in the cloud, these platforms can be hosted in the cloud and/or on-prem.", "From the creators of Apache Spark, Databricks is a company with a ton of steam behind them. Why? Well, their focus on Apache Spark makes them unique. Some companies might say \u201cwe\u2019re not using a lot of Spark, so this doesn\u2019t seem like the right tool\u201d and that\u2019s where you\u2019d be wrong. Spark is a very flexible tool. Spark is an excellent tool for ETL due to its focus on distributed processing of large data (and as I always say, it\u2019s easier to scale down than it is to scale up). Spark has a great ML library and many ML extensions. If your data is small, no worries, you can skip Spark and just train a model on a single node. Or you can utilize just the Spark executors (skipping the Spark language), and run hyperparameter tuning for a Python model over a cluster. Now instead of your hyperparameter tuning taking a day, maybe it runs in under an hour. What makes Spark so powerful, is its strength in not just ML, but in data engineering as well.", "Databricks adds features every day like version control, experiment tracking, and even dashboarding! This platform is a strong solution for not just building models, but also productionalizing those models as batch jobs, and even REST APIs (although probably not as robust a solution for REST API deployments).", "Domino has been a strong and mature data science platform for many years now. In many ways, Domino was a trailblazing company when it first came out, and Domino continues to be a strong company with a strong platform.", "This platform is a strong solution with a primary focus on model building and experimentation, but it also has support for productionalizing those models as REST APIs (and maybe more).", "We all know the Hadoop boom is over, but Cloudera\\Hortonworks is still very much alive and kicking. Cloudera can be deployed in the cloud or on-prem. I think what makes Cloudera a strong company, that probably won\u2019t go away anytime soon, is their on-prem support and their knowledge of cluster maintenance. Want to build models and then deploy them in Apache Airflow jobs? \u2014 No problem. Getting an Airflow cluster up and running is not easy, but with the Cloudera platform, it\u2019s much easier. Due to the plateauing of the Hadoop boom, Cloudera is in many cases an underrated solution today; but depending on your company's needs, it could be a perfect fit.", "This platform is a strong solution for not just building models, but also productionalizing those models as batch jobs, and even REST APIs. And since they\u2019re mainly a cluster company that supports a lot of open-source tools, that makes their solution flexible. And the nice thing about focusing on open-source tools is not only flexibility but in addition, you generally have a large community for support.", "Anaconda is a well known Python package manager, but did you know they have their own data science platform? From reviewing one of their customer case studies with PNC, it seems like a nice option if you already have an on-prem Hadoop cluster (and you\u2019d like to leverage it into a data science platform). Anaconda has had data science platform capabilities for quite a while, so they\u2019re worth a look.", "Here are some platforms that are newer to the scene.", "This is an interesting company that has popped up in the ML space. Seems like their solution leans more heavily on the productionalization \\ ML-Ops side of things, as opposed to model building, but they seem to support both.", "Comet is a company \\ tool that\u2019s gaining a lot of traction. Seems like their solution leans more heavily on the model development side of things, as opposed to the model productionalization space. As far as model building goes, it looks very feature-rich.", "Algorithmia is purely a model deployment platform that focuses on deploying models as REST APIs (although you can also use the service for batch jobs with some finagling). When it comes to REST APIs and deploying services \\ applications over a cluster, they have every inch covered. This is a strong solution for model deployment because they\u2019re invested in that one space.", "Zepl is an overlooked and underrated data science platform focused on model building and data mining. Zepl has strong ties to Apache Zeppelin and again, focuses more on model building than model deployment. Zepl has a lot of great features and at a great price, which really makes Zepl stand out.", "Spell appears to be a platform focused on model building and deploying models as REST APIs. Although I haven\u2019t personally used SPELL, it appears to be a fairly robust tool covering Kubernetes REST API model deployment, accelerated hyperparameter tuning/training jobs, experiment management, and more.", "Pachyderm is more focused on model productionalization. It combines data version control with pipelining features while staying coding language agnostic. Pachyderm has a free open-source version, a version of enterprises, and a SaaS version.", "If you want modeling flexibility, this is not the tool for your team. With AutoML platforms, there is no Jupyter or notebook IDE, there is only the AutoML UI/SDK. If you lack a strong data science team or have a collection of citizen data scientists (people who have data science knowledge but maybe lack coding experience or professional experience) then an AutoML platform could be a great fit. AutoML platforms are focused on AutoML in such a way that you just load your data (either through a UI or an SDK), and they take care of the rest.", "The truth is that there are a lot of pitfalls in data science, and so the idea of a \u2018citizen data scientist\u2019 is a hard one to realize. Also, it\u2019s realistic that many projects could fall outside of the capabilities of your AutoML platform, and then what? That doesn\u2019t mean that AutoML platforms are a bust \u2014 far from it.", "AutoML platforms can also be treated as a great tool in the toolbelt of a data scientist (much like Random Forest or XGBoost, or any other algorithm or AutoML tool for that matter). If you plan to use an AutoML platform in this capacity, then you\u2019ll still need to figure out where your data scientists complete the rest of their work (running other experiments, deployment, etc.).", "DataRobot is a very strong and mature AutoML platform. DataRobot also has some model deployment features, which are getting stronger after their acquisition of MLOps company ParallelM.", "H2O is a very different company. They started as an open-source framework that was similar to Apache Spark, but then transition to an AutoML company that now competes with DataRobot. These days, there are a lot of top Kagglers who work for H2O.ai, making them a very notable company in 2020.", "Sigopt is another company that is very different. Sigopt has a focus on model tuning, which makes it pretty unique. They also have features for productionalization, but their primary focus is on model tuning.", "Here are some other platforms that I didn\u2019t mention. They\u2019re not highlighted for various reasons, but I know they exist and thus shouldn\u2019t be ignored. Also, there are some big companies that use these platforms, so here they are:", "These services could fall under lightweight, but they\u2019re more specialized and they don\u2019t really cover as much ground. But, they might specialize in a specific area that\u2019s very important to a Data Science Platform, so they\u2019re worth a look.", "Similar to open source MLFlow, neptune.ai is primarily focused on experiment tracking. Similar to how GitHub works, where you write code and then you push code updates to a remote server, neptune.ai sort of works in a similar fashion except for ML experimentation. You run your experiments wherever you want, and then using the neptune.ai SDK you can push metrics and other artifacts about your experiment to your neptune.ai server.", "Unlike GitHub and MLFlow, neptune.ai has notebook version diffing. If you\u2019re a data scientist and you\u2019ve pushed notebook changes to GitHub, you\u2019ll notice that GitHub will diff the underlying code of the notebook (so all the ugly HTML and Jupyter IDE code). This is because GitHub is not really intended for data scientists, it\u2019s intended for software developers. Neptune.ai on the other hand understands the needs of data scientists, and so they handle notebook version control differently. Neptune.ai versions the notebook in a way that\u2019s more useful to data scientists by diffing the cells and even the inline visuals.", "DBT is a tool created by a Philadelphia startup called Fishtown Analytics. Fishtown is a trendy and growing neighborhood in Philadelphia, hence the name, since this is the town in which the company was founded. DBT is primarily an ETL tool, but I thought it was worth mentioning given the product's strong growth and adoption. Data science can\u2019t exist without strong data engineering.", "There are a lot of data science platforms/tools out there, and the questions you need to ask yourself are:", "The answer to question #1 is long but can be summarized down to \u2014 a flexible and scalable development environment for model building and analytics, data storage, a flexible ETL tool, a BI tool for publishing dashboards, and a service for hosting REST APIs. More info than this would require another article, which I titled Setting Up A Data Science Ord For Success.", "The answer to question #2 is something only you can answer. If you have access to the cloud, I would check out the heavyweight options. If you don\u2019t have access to the cloud, I would check out the middleweight and lightweight options. In addition, you might need more than just 1 service if you\u2019re not using cloud services. Some platforms are mainly for model building, and some are purely for model deployment, so you might need 2\u20133 different solutions to cover development and deployment. This all comes back to question #1. You need to ask yourself:", "As you can see, it\u2019s unlikely that 1 platform will cover all of this unless you\u2019re using Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud. If you\u2019re going with a middleweight or lightweight solution, you might need to use more than 1 to get everything your team needs.", "Thanks for reading and hope you found this insightful!", "For 2021 updates to this list, check out my other Medium article Notable Data Science Platforms of 2021.", "Your home for data science.
