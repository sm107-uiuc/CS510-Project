You\u2019ve trained your model on Kaggle and saved it.

There is a way to save both the architecture and the state dictionary in a single file so that you don\u2019t have to remember, but that is not the focus of this tutorial.", "I hope this ->\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03\ud83d\ude03 is your mood after you\u2019ve successfully loaded your first model.
