The most common ways of storing data is through the formats of \u2018.csv\u2019, \u2018.tsv\u2019 or \u2018.txt\u2019. Although these files have the ease of reading information using a standard sparser or a customized separator, it becomes difficult to store multi-dimensional data and its corresponding information (about the units, methodology for data collection, etc.).", "A novel way of storing the data and its information is to use the \u2018.cdf\u2019 format for files. CDF stands for Common Data Format, and it accepts the most generalized type of data, irrespective of its dimensions and shape. Created by Wolfram Research, CDF enables easy information storage and transmission. CDF files are used by many organizations, most notably that by NASA, to store its multi-dimensional data into segregated, easily decipherable notations.", "In this article, I\u2019ll guide you to a step-by-step creation of a .cdf file and how it can be used in practice. The detailed documentation for the same can be found here: https://spacepy.github.io/_modules/spacepy/pycdf.html", "The critical library used in creating and reading the .cdf file is the spacepy library, with its pycdf function embedded. To smoothly run the libraries, ensure that your processor has the same architecture (32bit/64bit) as your library.", "In this article, we will consider a simple problem. If you have an array or .csv file, it becomes difficult to store dimensions of unequal length. Let us assume that, the problem at hand is to store the price of USA crude over the period of 2 years (daily averaged) and USA natural gas price over the 2 years (weekly averaged). Thus, in this case, the number of data points would vary for the crude and natural gas, with 730 and 104 points respectively. In order to store the data in an easy readable format, we will use the .cdf format.", "The first step is to generate some random data. We assume that the USA Crude Price fluctuates over 20\u2013100 units, whereas the natural gas fluctuates over 5\u201330 units (Values are randomly picked and have no relevance).", "We consider the variables tcrude and tng as the time steps, with the former being daily and the latter being weekly. The crude and natural gas price has been randomly generated.", "The most critical step of the problem is to correctly write a new cdf file with all the required attributes we have. The sample code for the same is:", "In the above step, the following things are done:", "Now that we have created a .cdf file, we will use the same file as input to be read. This would take us through reading a file and also validating the data we have written.", "The .cdf file has two aspects, the numerical data we have stored and the attributes. We wish to know what the data file contains and if the author wishes to convey any additional information. This can be done by importing the .cdf as read-only and then printing required data.", "The output of this code is as follows:", "Working with Data from the .cdf file", "It is simple to work with data in the .cdf file. It can be done in the same manner as that of a pandas dataframe. A sample plotting is done as follows:", "The plot is the same as you\u2019d get from plotting an array or pandas data-frame. However, the convenience of using .cdf files is that you can pull out variables with different dimensions from the same file with ease. Additionally, certain attributes like the units and Author name can also be directly read from the file without any additional filtering.", ".cdf\u2019s are convenient, Aren\u2019t they? They serve as the perfect combination of a dataframe, but with the perks of allowing uneven dimensions and with the ease of referring them using keys. The only drawback of the .cdf file is that it might have a larger size than the normal .csv or .txt files, but there is a tradeoff. The ease which .cdf files provide is very high!", "CDF\u2019s are pretty interesting. And so is data analysis.
