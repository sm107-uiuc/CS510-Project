This robust framework is the so-called Standard Model, and it has as one of its main ingredients the Higgs field, a ubiquitous quantum field that is responsible for giving masses to particles. Due to the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, the Higgs field has a fundamental particle associated with it, the so-called Higgs boson.The goal of the present article is to provide a more mathematical explanation of the Higgs boson and its properties.", "As observed by Zee, though the fundamental laws of Nature have several symmetries, the world we experience is far from symmetric. In physics jargon, our Lagrangians are symmetric, but the world they describe is not. In fact, the study of how such symmetries are broken is a central topic in physics.", "To start, let us consider an example of symmetry breaking where the system consists of interacting N-component scalar fields.", "Consider a Lagrangian of an N-dimensional scalar field with components:", "Notice that the sign of the mass term is negative (on purpose). The Lagrangian is:", "Case N=1If N=1, the Lagrangian has the extrema", "where \u03d5=0 is a maximum. Any of the other two \u03d5s, namely, v or -v, are equivalent ground states and we can choose either one to be our ground state. The ground state is referred to as VEV (vacuum expectation value).", "Now, note that the tunneling barrier between the two extrema is infinite:", "This occurs because the spacetime integral in Eq. 5 is infinite. Since the potential barrier is infinite, the ground state wave function (or functional) cannot tunnel between the extrema. It must stay at the value v determined by the positive version of Eq. 4. Hence, the reflection symmetry \u03d5 \u2192 -\u03d5, which is present in ordinary quantum mechanics is broken. But, as noted by Zee, the symmetry breaking is not caused by the (artificial) introduction of new terms in L. The \u03d5 \u2192 -\u03d5 symmetry is broken \u201cby itself\u201d.", "Case N=2The potential, in this case, is the famous Mexican hat potential. We now have an infinite number of physically equivalent minima (or vacua). All these vacua have the same (squared) value, namely:", "Now note that each minimum points in a different direction. But the results cannot depend on the choice of \u03d5-direction so I will follow Zee and choose:", "We now study fluctuations around \u03d5\u2081 and \u03d5\u2082 by writing the minima as:", "The 1-component fluctuates in the radial direction and the 2-component fluctuates around the circle at the minimum of the potential (thus, its absolute value is unchanged).", "Substituting Eq. 7 in the Lagrangian we obtain:", "This equation tells us that the 2-component of \u03d5 is massless.", "We will now include a gauge field A in our Lagrangian. A gauge theory is, by definition, a kind of field theory whose Lagrangian is invariant under transformations from certain types of groups. According to the gauge principle, which underlies three of the fundamental interactions in the universe, physics shouldn\u2019t change if we change our way of describing it. There are two types of gauge theories: abelian and non-abelian. An example of an abelian gauge theory is the familiar electromagnetic theory.", "Let us start with Maxwell\u2019s equations for the electric and magnetic fields, E and B:", "The electric and magnetic field can be written in terms of the potentials V and A as follows:", "We can group V and A into the vector potential:", "The Lagrangian associated with electromagnetic fields, whose equations are invariant under a gauge transformation of the vector potential", "Note that F is invariant under the gauge transformation Eq. 12 (by construction). An abelian gauge theory is globally invariant under the U(1) group. Unitary groups U(n) of degree n consist of n \u00d7 n unitary matrices, with the group operation of matrix multiplication. The group U(1) which is also called circle group is the multiplicative group of all complex numbers which have modulus 1.", "The Dirac FieldThe Dirac field \u03c8 is an example of a fermionic field which is a quantum field whose quanta are fermions (they obey Fermi\u2013Dirac statistics). Such fields obey canonical anticommutation relations in contrast to bosonic fields, that obey canonical commutation relations.", "A Dirac field with charge e and mass m has the following free Lagrangian", "is the Dirac adjoint field and:", "are the standard representation of the gamma matrices. The Dirac Lagrangian is invariant under global gauge transformation:", "In a local gauge transformation, \u03b1 becomes a function \u03b1(x) and the new Lagrange invariant under", "The quantum electrodynamics (or QED) Lagrangian which includes the electromagnetic field and the Dirac field is then:", "As mentioned before, our world is not gauge-symmetric. However, it is possible for a theory to have some symmetry even though our experience of that physical theory does not reflect that corresponding symmetry. The absence of a large number of massless vector fields (such as the electromagnetic field) implies that the gauge symmetry is broken.", "Now let us consider an example of how spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs in gauge theories. For simplicity, I will consider the simplest gauge theory, i.e. electromagnetism, which is a U(1) gauge field, coupled to a complex scalar field \u03d5. The Lagrangian, which is invariant under Eq. 18 is:", "Here the components \u03d5\u2081 and \u03d5\u2082 are the real and imaginary parts of \u03d5.", "Now we write the scalar field as follows:", "As we previously did, we choose", "to be the value where the potential is minimized.", "Adding a fluctuation term as before", "This Lagrangian describes a vector field B with mass M=ev which interacts with the scalar field \u03c7 with has mass", "Note that the boson \u03b8 is absent from the Lagrangian. One says that \u03b8 was \u201ceaten up\u201d by the gauge field A which became B and is now massive. The previously massless field A had two degrees of freedom or equivalently, two polarization directions (two spin directions). The massive gauge field acquires one more (longitudinal) degree of freedom (or one more possible spin state). This transition of A from massless to massive is referred to as the Higgs mechanism and \u03d5 is called the Higgs field. And as explained in the introduction, due to the wave-particle duality in quantum mechanics, \u03d5 has a fundamental particle associated with it, the so-called Higgs boson.", "The electroweak theory describes both the electromagnetic force and the weak nuclear force.", "However, the physicists Sheldon Glashow, Abdus Salam and Steven Weinberg, showed that above the so-called unification energy (~246 GeV) these forces would merge into one force.", "In other words, above this limit threshold, both forces are different facets of a more fundamental electroweak force. The spontaneous symmetry breaking of a massless gauge field A, as described above gives origin to three massive vector bosons, namely:", "In other words, the Higgs mechanism accounts for the masses of the weak interaction gauge bosons in Eq. 29.", "Thanks for reading and see you soon!
