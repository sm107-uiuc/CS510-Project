Most likely you have come across or interacted with some type of recommender systems in the past few minutes or hours in your online presence. Even this article might have been suggested to you by Medium or other channels using Recommender systems.", "These Recommender systems can be of different types and the most prominent ones include Content-based filtering and Collaborative filtering. In this article, we will study location-based recommendations, where we specifically focus on geographic locations to render more relevant recommendations utilizing the location of the users.", "To illustrate the crucial aspects of location-based recommenders we will perform a simple Location-based recommendation using the K-Means algorithm with Yelp Dataset from Kaggle. The data comes in JSON files and can be easily read with pandas.", "The following table shows the first 5 rows of the dataset. In this table, coordinates of business are available with rating stars and the number of reviews for each business.", "In this section, we will explore and preprocess the dataset. The dataset contains reviews from yelp users and includes many categories. To simplify our analysis and interpretation of our recommendations models, we will focus on restaurants, feel free to pick up any other categories you are interested in.", "We first create a restaurant dataframe by filtering all business that contains the word \u2018Restaurants\u2019. Then we plot the distribution of the stars from 1 to 5 for restaurants. The plot clearly shows most restaurants have 4.0 or 3.5 stars, while only a small number of restaurants have 5.0 stars.", "Let us also create a sorted dataframe based on a combination of review_count and starsand visualize the top 20 restaurants in the dataset.", "The choice here is to sort the restaurants not only on stars but also how many reviews the restaurant has. Here is a plot of all top 20 restaurants in the dataset.", "Finally, let us also explore the location of these restaurants and visualize as a map before we move into K-Means clustering and Location-based Recommendation. We will use Plotly Express library which offers a flexible and easy way to plot geographic data with beautiful base maps.", "As you can see from the map below, this dataset is not complete and contains only several cities in USA and Canada.", "To tailor our recommendation system, we will focus only on Las Vegas, Nevada, which has the highest number of restaurants in this dataset.", "We create a zoomed map for all restaurants in Las Vegas. Below you can see the map for all restaurants in Las Vegas. The colour of the map is based on the number of stars the restaurant has while the size indicates the review count of this particular restaurant. As you can see, highly rated restaurants cluster around the city centre.", "Before we perform the K-Means clustering algorithm, let us first determine the optimal number of clusters in our dataset. Here we use a technique called Elbow method.", "The elbow method helps us determine the number of clusters suitable. This does not give you an exact number of clusters but potentially helps select the number of clusters. As seen from the plot below, it has multiple elbows.", "With the help of the elbow method, we choose 5 clusters and perform the K-Means clustering algorithm on the coordinates. We also populate a new column in lasVegas dataframe.", "Finally, we create a scatter plot of the clusters from the K-Means algorithm. The map clearly shows the output of the algorithm with 5 clusters.", "In this section, we will pull together the K-means clustering and rating of the restaurants to recommend restaurants based on the user\u2019s location. Let us first create a Dataframe of sorted LasVegas restaurants based on Review Count and the number of stars. We call this DataFrametop_restaurants_lasVegas.", "We are all set to create a function for recommending restaurants based on the location of the user. We create a function to recommend restaurants based on user location.", "Here our function will take a latitude and longitude as well as Dataframe. The function first predicts which cluster the coordinates belong to and further restricts the dataframe to this cluster and returns the top 5 restaurants in that cluster.", "This function is simple and only takes coordinates but we could develop further to accept other inputs like address or zip code. That requires some Geocoding applications, so this will suffice to illustrate the power of location-based recommendations for now. Before we use our recommendation function, let us create a test dataframe.", "Now we can use our recommendation function with any user in our dataframe as input to test the functionality of our simple location-based recommendation. Remember that this test data is only for convenience and recommendation function accepts directly any coordinates given.", "For the first user, the K-Means algorithm predicts the cluster and pulls out this cluster\u2019s top 5 restaurants and recommends them. The red dot is the user location while the blue dots are recommended restaurants.", "Let us take another example, user 3 in this case. Again our \u2018recommend_restaurant\u2019 function predicts the cluster this user belongs and pulls out the top 5 restaurants in this cluster.", "In this tutorial, we have demonstrated location-based recommendations with python using Yelp dataset. We used Restaurants to showcase a location-based recommendation application. Our recommendation system used K-Means clustering based on coordinates of restaurants and only considered the rating of restaurants ( Both number of rating and stars ) to recommend restaurants. We could also consider the type of restaurant to tailor the recommendations. This can also be developed further to incorporate other input methods like addresses or zip codes. Finally, Our recommendation did not consider the distance between users and recommended restaurants explicitly although the K-means clustering limits the scope of recommended restaurants.", "The notebook for this tutorial is available in this Github repository.", "Your home for data science.
