The goal of the boycott? Insist that the social media platform does a better job of monitoring hate speech.", "These companies, along with other individuals, believe that these social media platforms play a critical role in our national debates. And with this great power comes a responsibility to shape those debates in a positive manner.", "Here\u2019s an idea: What if we restructure the spaces by rebuilding the algorithms from the ground up?", "We\u2019ve written about the fairness of algorithms and how organizations can best avoid biased data analysis in their early stages of collecting data. But now we\u2019re going to focus on one algorithm in particular: the recommendation engine.", "According to many media experts, the recommendation engine is the major culprit for the polarization of society. They are supposed to save time and anxiety over finding the \u201cright choice\u201d of books or articles to read. But often they end up limiting our choices and worldview. Facebook and Google\u2019s personalization engines aren\u2019t truly personalized for each individual. The \u201crecommendations for you\u201d are algorithms that suggest recommendations based on users with similar behavior to you. They are not developed with the goal of true personalization, but ad optimization and driving revenue. It\u2019s an important distinction.", "That\u2019s why personalization engines are limited. For example, a user who follows a white supremacist out of sheer curiosity on Facebook will have their feed full of extremist content for a month afterward. Or a user who genuinely wants to read something outside their usual reading habits is only given ones based on past preferences. Or a user who bought a baby gift for his nephew is now inundated with daily sales for baby items despite those ads not being useful for his day-to-day life.", "One solution to making better personalization engines is to collect high-quality web data and develop new algorithms.", "Another group of researchers at Simon Fraser University took it one step further. They decided to eliminate polarizing content as much as possible \u2014 before it is even suggested by the recommendation engine. They built their own algorithms with the help of data that compared real news articles with fake ones. The fake news items were from the Russian Internet Research Agency while the real news articles from Webhose included 2,500 data items from a total of 172 news sources. The result of the research? A fake news detector that would identify disinformation before it was posted.", "Social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter are profit-driven at the end of the day, and their personalization engines are not in the best interest of the public. But healthy democracies need healthy spaces \u2014 and healthier social media platforms \u2014 for public debate. For Webhose, that means delivering web data to organizations so they can build fairer recommendation engines that bring people together rather than tear them apart.", "Your home for data science.
