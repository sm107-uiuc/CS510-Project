Every touchpoint of the healthcare system, every prescription, operation, and immunization, is logged and stored in the hospital\u2019s electronic health record (EHR). It has now reached a point where hospitals have more data than they know what to do with. Even worse, this oversaturation of complex data makes accessing and analyzing the data extremely inefficient.", "So, what\u2019s the solution to this crisis?", "Graphs are perfect for storing and visualizing healthcare data. They are designed to handle highly connected information, like patient records. If you are unfamiliar with graphs, check out this awesome article that introduces some of the basics of graph theory.", "I\u2019ll be walking through an example of how we can use a TigerGraph graph database to represent complex healthcare data. Let\u2019s get started!", "In an ideal world, we could create this graph using real patient data; however, there are a number of rules and regulations that make working with patient data pretty hard. Instead, we can use the next best thing: synthetic data.", "Using Synthea, an open-source synthetic patient generator, we can create an entire healthcare ecosystem full of patients, hospital visits, insurance providers, and everything else you could think of. If you\u2019ve never encountered Synthea before, check out this short post I wrote explaining how it works.", "The output data from Synthea is divided into several CSV files such as Allergies, Medications, Encounters, Providers, etc.", "Some CSV files have column headers that aren\u2019t obvious indicators of the column data. It helps to look at the Synthea Wiki to see the contents of each file.", "The columns of the actual CSV files correspond exactly to the documentation.", "For this example healthcare system, I generated a sample of 500 patients from across the US.", "The schema for this graph is quite complex (as you can see from the picture). And I say that not to intimidate you, but to highlight what I\u2019ve already said.", "Each patient has so many interactions with the healthcare system, a simple schema would most certainly fail to capture all of the data and information available. Our schema must be as detailed as our data.", "We can create our schema using the TigerGraph-native language GSQL. The entire script looks like this:", "I could write an entire blog on this script alone. But, in the interest of sparing you from having to read what would surely be a very boring read, I\u2019ll just note some key points.", "We can write GSQL loading scripts to load in our data. Let\u2019s look at the example loading script for the CarePlans CSV file.", "Again, let\u2019s briefly take a look at the important parts of this code.", "Using the same format, we can write a similar loading job for the rest of our data files.", "For our sample of 500 patients, loading all of our data results in about 800,000 vertices and almost 2 million edges.", "I won\u2019t go into too much detail about GSQL queries. I don\u2019t want to focus on the actual writing queries, but instead on the speed at which queries run\u2014 after all, this blog is meant to showcase the efficiency of graph databases. I have another blog that goes through a number of query examples if you are curious. And, as always, the TigerGraph documentation site is a great place to find more information.", "Let\u2019s run a simple query that grabs all vertices and edges immediately connected to a given patient.", "This query returns a lot of information. It basically calls every touchpoint that a given patient has with the healthcare system. Normally, that would be a tough job for a database. But with our graph database, the information was retrieved within A FEW MILLISECONDS! That\u2019s incredibly fast!", "This speed applies to datasets much larger than 500 patients as well. In a sample system of 100 million patients (wow that\u2019s a lot of data), the time taken to gather this same information is only a couple of seconds.", "Querying using graphs is extremely efficient and shows a huge improvement over standard techniques used for querying healthcare data.", "While graph databases do serve as effective and efficient ways to hold data, their benefits extend beyond storage. We saw already how quickly queries can be performed on large datasets. But, we can also take advantage of graphs for visualizations. For example, using the same database and a slightly different query, we can easily create this 3D network graph, which only takes a few seconds to render.", "Besides looking really cool, this 3D visual is extremely useful. While a 2D representation of the same information would be cluttered and impossible to read, this 3D model provides an open and clean method of viewing our large amount of interconnected data. And, while the aesthetic parts are made with HTML and JavaScript, the data, the key to the entire visualization, lies in the graph database and the query.", "If you want to know how I made this visualization, check out my other blog post here!", "Compared to normal relational databases, graphs are an excellent alternative, especially for representing highly connected data. They\u2019re perfect for representing healthcare networks, where each patient is connected to huge amounts of data. If implemented on a large scale, this technology could greatly reduce the burden experienced by EHRs, and make storing, analyzing, and visualizing data much more efficient. Graphs are the future of medical data!", "I hope you enjoyed this blog and learned something new. Let me know what you think!", "Your home for data science.
