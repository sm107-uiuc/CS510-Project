In the last couple of years as more and more of the non-engineering jobs involve writing code, source control systems like Git have seen a hike in adoption. Although there is a hike in adoption, not enough of the new adopters are good with it.", "Non-engineering teams often face issues with using Git when the employer doesn\u2019t pay enough attention to training their team or when they don\u2019t get enough support from their engineering counterpart. The everyone-on-their-own model is not sustainable. Training is a very important part of the development and growth of a team.", "Non-engineering teams have a different mindset when it comes to writing code. I have tried to summarise the ideas in another article. Here, we\u2019ll talk, not about the mistakes that you can make by running the wrong Git command but by making more fundamental mistakes like working directly on the master branch, making very large commits and so on.", "You\u2019ve essentially missed the whole concept behind Git (or version control systems, in general) if you are part of a team and the only branch you have is master. In this case, everyone has a local master branch and commits to that branch and then pushes the changes to the remote master to find out there are a zillion conflicts. Avoid that, use branching \u2014 that\u2019s where the fun lies.", "There\u2019s a great summary of the reasons why not to use master branch for development written by knittl on StackOverflow.", "the master branch should represent the \u2018stable\u2019 history of your code. use branches to experiment with new features, implement them, and when they have matured enough you can merge them back to master.", "that way code in master will almost always build without problems, and can be mostly used directly for releases.", "Once you have understood the basic concept of branches and are able to create branches and merge them into master, the next issue you\u2019ll encounter is more from a branch management perspective. The most popular and valuable of all the branching methodologies is gitflow. I have written about it here from a Data Engineer\u2019s perspective. The same principles apply to anyone whose work involves writing queries in SQL or something similar like Python scripts using pandas, numpy, scipy and so on.", "Gitflow includes three levels of branching with master, develop and feature as the three different levels. There are exceptions to these three but you don\u2019t have to get into that in the beginning. Read more about it here \u2014", "Technically, this isn\u2019t a mistake, it is just a very bad practice. Apart from the initial commit in your repo, your commits should contain the changes only which can be clearly defined in a single line commit message. Committing all uncommitted changes cannot be a good commit message with a thousand new files.", "Go by this rule and you\u2019ll be fine. The idea is to push the smallest complete unit of work. There\u2019s a great article covering this in-depth.", "Here are a couple of other great articles that I enjoyed and found us", "Just like other widely adopted technologies like SQL, Python, Javascript, Git is probably something you can\u2019t do without if you have anything to do with writing code \u2014 in whatever capacity. You\u2019ll definitely have to deal with version control systems. Hence, it is best if you spend some time understanding what it is and how it works.", "You\u2019d probably not need the fancier and trickier Git commands initially as you\u2019ll get by fine with just the basic ones. There are several articles like this which talk about the mistake you make by running the wrong Git commands. Just go over some of these articles (1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and you should be sorted.", "Your home for data science.
