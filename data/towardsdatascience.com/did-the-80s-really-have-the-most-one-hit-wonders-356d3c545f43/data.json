But was this actually the case? Did the 80s really have the most one-hit wonders? Or is this just one of those facts that we all assume is true, even though it isn\u2019t, like how gum sits in your stomach for 7 years?", "Clearly this was a question we had to solve \u2014 with science!", "My original plan was to do this all in BigQuery, since that\u2019s kind of my jam, but when I started searching for Billboard top 100 data in easily queryable form, I came across this dataset available over at data.world that seemed to have everything I needed. So that\u2019s what I ended up using.", "Please note that I have no affiliation with this company, but I dig their nicely-written terms of service, so that\u2019s something.", "So the first step was taking this data set (which had one row for every week a song was listed in the Billboard Hot 100) and condensing it down into a list where I had each song\u2019s top position in the charts and the date they hit that top position.", "I originally had a much more detailed breakdown on how I did this, but I\u2019m going to skip it because, frankly, it\u2019s not all that interesting.", "Now that we\u2019ve got a pretty good data set to work with, let\u2019s ask ourselves the more interesting question\u2026", "My initial thought was that if you made onto the Billboard Hot 100 only once, you would qualify as a one-hit wonder. The issue here is that making it onto the Hot 100 is a realllllly generous definition of a \u201chit\u201d.", "Do you remember, for instance, that \u201880s classic \u201cNight Pulse\u201d by Double Image (#92 on the charts)? I\u2019m going to guess not, unless you are actually a former member of the band Double Image.", "Similarly, I consider Kajagoogoo a one-hit wonder for their song \u201cToo Shy\u201d (#5). But they had a second song, \u201cHang On Now\u201d that reached 78. Would they technically count a two-hit wonder? Probably not. If a definition of a one-hit wonder doesn\u2019t include Kajagoogoo, it\u2019s probably not a good definition. Ooh, that\u2019s good. Let\u2019s put that in a pull-quote.", "If a definition of a one-hit wonder doesn\u2019t include Kajagoogoo, it\u2019s probably not a good definition.", "So I decided that an equally simple, but probably more accurate measurement of a one-hit wonder is to simply find any band that had one and only one song reach a rank of 40 or better. That seemed like a good cut-off, what with the the top 40 being such an American cultural staple and all.", "So let\u2019s grab a list of all bands that only have one top 40 hit, along with the name of their hit song, the decade, and their top rank:", "Okay, this is starting to look pretty promising.", "And then, of course, it\u2019s pretty easy to group these by decade and count them.", "So, what did we find out when I group this list by decade?", "That\u2019s right. According to our data, the 1980s actually had the fewest one-hit wonders, while the 2000s had the most. So are we done? Can we simple point to our data, shout Whoomp! (There it is), and move on?", "Well, hang on, because there are two issues with the data that I wanted to fix.", "According to our initial findings, Blink-182 is considered a one-hit wonder because only one of their songs (\u201cAll the Small Things\u201d) actually made it into the top 40. Everything else lingered in the 40s-to-60s range. That seemed strange to me.", "I think a lot of this is because, by the time the 90s hit, alternative music had become more mainstream. So it was possible to have a five-time platinum pop-punk album that barely registers on the Hot 100 charts, because those singles are finding their success in the Billboard Alternative charts. I\u2019m guessing there\u2019s a number of country and R&B artists that also fall into this category.", "But none of this really excuses the fact that there are a number of bands that technically count as one-hit wonders based on this definition that just felt wrong. This includes Weezer, Ozzy Osbourne, Missy Elliott, Beck, Rush, and Cypress Hill.", "So I decided to revise my definition of a one-hit wonder to the following:", "An artist counts as a one hit wonder if they have one song in the top 25, but then no other songs in the top 75.", "This works out nicely in that Weezer, Blink-182, et al, are no longer considered one-hit wonders. But, most importantly, Kajagoogoo still is.", "So, with a little bit of work, I was able to re-run my query to look for bands that had one hit in the top 25, and no other hits in the top 75.", "This generated a smaller list of one-hit-wonders per decade (which makes sense if you think about it), but when you group them all together, you still see that the 80s has the fewest one-hit wonders.", "It\u2019s also kinda interesting that the 2000s now have the most one hit wonders by a long shot. This actually brings us to our next problem\u2026", "If you were to browse through these results, you\u2019ll start to notice that there\u2019s a number of one-hit wonders that consist of duets.", "Take for instance, \u201cEbony and Ivory\u201d. This hit #1 on the charts and, technically, it\u2019s a one hit wonder because the performer \u201cPaul McCartney and Stevie Wonder\u201d never had another song that hit the top charts. This also holds true for \u201cKenny Rogers Duet With Dolly Parton\u201d, which released \u201cIslands in the Stream\u201d. But I would not call any of these artists one-hit wonders. Not unless I want to get banned from Dollywood for life.", "So let\u2019s take a look at artists that have \u201c&\u201d, \u201cAnd\u201d, or \u201cWith\u201d in their name, along with artists that have \u201cFeaturing\u201d in their name.", "We can see that this issue is fairly consistent across most decades (although there\u2019s a small increase in \u201cAnd\u201d artists in the 1960s). That is, until you reach the mid 90s. Starting from there and accelerating into the 2000s and beyond, you see a huge increase of artists \u201cFeaturing\u201d another performer.", "So if we were to take a look at earlier results, you can see that both 50 Cent and Akon are considered to be one-hit wonders several-times over (which I know is kinda redundant) because each one of their hits has a slightly different artist name.", "Now I can address this by using a little regular expression magic to reduce any artist name that includes the word \u201cFeaturing\u201d to just the performer listed first. This means that \u201c50 Cent Featuring Nate Dogg\u201d is just considered \u201c50 Cent\u201d for hit-counting purposes.", "The problem comes with that tricky little word \u201cAnd\u201d (or the ampersand symbol, or a few other variations). In some cases, it probably makes sense to condense those down to the performer listed first. That means that you can take \u201cDancing in the Streets\u201d by \u201cDavid Bowie & Mick Jagger\u201d and give full credit to David Bowie \u2014 whether he wants it or not.", "The problem is, there\u2019s no way going by the name alone to distinguish between a band name that just happens to have an ampersand in it (like \u201cCaptain & Tennille\u201d) from a true duet (like \u201cAretha Franklin & George Michael\u201d).", "Now in most cases, this isn\u2019t a big deal. You just end up with some kinda weird band names. Hootie & The Blowfish is now just \u201cHootie\u201d. But in a few situations, you end up with two completely different bands getting condensed into one. For instance, 80\u2019s band \u201cLove and Rockets\u201d and 70\u2019s band \u201cLove and Kisses\u201d are both now considered to be the same artist named \u201cLove\u201d.", "The good news it that this case seems to be really rare \u2014 I only found a handful of instances where two completely different bands got combined into one. And maybe if I really cared, I\u2019d somehow find a way to manually tag these non-duet bands separately from the actual duets. But that\u2019s more work than I care to tackle at the moment. I think for now, the benefits of combining these artists outweigh the small number of false positives", "So, with that said, here is my query of one hit wonders, where a one-hit wonder has at least one song in the top 25, but no other songs in the top 75, and any duet or song \u201cFeaturing\u201d somebody else is attributed to the artist listed first.", "And what does the final tally look like?", "You can see that combining duets and cameos seriously reduced the number of one-hit wonders in the 2000s. The was some reduction in the 1960s, but not as much as you\u2019d think given the number of artists with \u201cAnd\u201d in their name. I suspect (but can\u2019t prove) this is because these artists are less often real duets, but more often bands with names like \u201cRandy & The Rainbows\u201d", "But after all of that, our original results basically still hold true. The 1980s had the least amount of one-hit wonders, and the 1960s still had the most.", "Which leads us to our next big question\u2026", "So if the 80s has the fewest one-hit wonders, why does it seem like they have the most? I don\u2019t really know, but here\u2019s a few theories:", "Maybe we all just think 80s have the most one-hit wonders because that\u2019s the era when we were primarily exposed to pop music. Maybe if I had grown up with the music of the 60s, I\u2019d be reminiscing to \u201cI\u2019m a Girl Watcher\u201d the way I currently reminisce about \u201cCome on Eileen\u201d.", "But, as my friend Sam points out, he also thought the 80s were the peak of one-hit wonders, and he wasn\u2019t alive in the 80s. And that puts a big dent in my theory. It also makes me feel really old. Thanks, Sam.", "So if you ever check out a listicle of \u201cBest one-hit wonders of all time\u201d, you\u2019ll see that they are often dominated by songs from the 80s. Could it be that maybe the 80s simply cranked out better one-hit wonders? And therefore, the decade is associated with one-hit wonders because it had so many gosh darn good ones?", "I\u2019m a little skeptical here. I might have my cause and effect mixed up. If we all walk around thinking that the 80s are the decade in which one-hit wonders were king, then when somebody polls us for a list of the greatest one-hit wonders, we might naturally just start thinking about our favorite hits from the 80s.", "But still, it\u2019s worth investigating. Obviously, figuring out which one hit wonders are the \u201cbest\u201d is hard to do objectively. But as a secondary characteristic, we can look at how long each of these one-hit-wonders were in the Billboard Top 100, and how high they peaked. If a hit is good (or at least memorable), you\u2019d expect it to stay longer on the charts or reach a higher top rating.", "So what happens when we break down these stats by decade?", "Huh. Well, it looks like the data doesn\u2019t really hold up my theory. When it comes to the average top ranking, the decades are pretty similar. When it comes to one-hit-wonders staying on the charts longer, it\u2019s true that the 60s and 70s hits were more fleeting, but it was the 90s that seemed to have the songs that stayed on the charts the longest.", "Oh, and in case you were curious, the one-hit-wonder that was on the top 100 for the longest period of time? Duncan Sheik\u2019s \u201cBarely Breathing\u201d, which was on the charts for a full 55 weeks.", "My final theory is that MTV is somehow responsible for all of this.", "If you think about it, the 80s were the era when MTV was at its peak of music video influence. The network was becoming more and more popular, but reality shows hadn\u2019t taken over yet, so the majority of the programming was actual music videos. And (hi, kids!) this all happened before YouTube was around.", "This means that, unlike the 60s and 70s, we noticed one hit wonders a lot more because we didn\u2019t just hear them on the radio; we saw them in our living rooms every day, and were exposed to the bands behind the music \u2014 not just the songs.", "But unlike the later 90s and 2000s, there were no other alternatives for watching music videos, much less getting to choose which videos you got to see. If you wanted to watch a music video, you really only had one choice (okay, two if you count VH-1), and it was primarily pop music.", "So maybe the reason we all remember the 80s as the era of one-hit wonders is because that\u2019s when they were front-and-center in our living rooms, and the phenomena became that much more obvious. Then, that designation just stuck around and influenced future generations.", "I don\u2019t know if this is right \u2014 but it\u2019s my best theory so far.", "There\u2019s a lot of great one-hit wonders throughout history, but who\u2019s the most one-hit-wondery? I decided to come up with a list of artists that a) Had a song hit #1 in the charts, but then b) Never had another song show up anywhere on the top 100 ever again.", "Here they are, in order of most time on the charts\u2026", "There are several bands who aren\u2019t one-hit wonders because they had other smaller hits that I forgot about:", "Likewise, there are several bands who aren\u2019t one-hit wonders because their songs weren\u2019t as big of a hit as I thought", "I have discovered a truly marvelous demonstration of this proposition that this Medium article is too narrow to contain.", "So there ya go folks; everything you ever wanted to know about one-hit wonders but were afraid to ask. If you\u2019re interested in playing around further with the data, go ahead and check out the project! Maybe you\u2019ll find some insights that I haven\u2019t discovered.
