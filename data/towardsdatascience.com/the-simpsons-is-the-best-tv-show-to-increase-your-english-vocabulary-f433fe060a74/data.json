But have you ever thought that this TV show could make you take your English vocabulary to the next level? This is true, especially if you\u2019re learning English as a second language. In this article, I\u2019ll prove this to you by comparing the vocabulary within dialogues in 83 popular TV shows, including Friends, Game of Thrones, The Big Bang Theory, Grey\u2019s Anatomy and more. You\u2019ll also know which Simpsons 679 episodes are the best for you to learn English.", "Have you ever wondered how do you learn new words through watching TV shows? It\u2019s by repetition. You hear a word in one episode, and then you hear it more times in the TV show during the week. Then voila! You just learned a new word! This is what makes The Simpsons unique. It has the highest number of repetitions in advanced English vocabulary. Some studies say that at least 6 times is the number of repetitions or exposure to a word before you learn it, while others say it\u2019s 17 times. With the transcripts of almost all episodes from 83 TV shows, I calculated the number of words repeated at least 10 (average between the two studies) times in the dialogues.", "The Simpsons is by far the TV show with more advanced words repeated ten or more times (1929 words from level 4 and above). The Simpsons more than tripled advanced words repeated 10 or more times in series such as Friends, Game of Thrones and The Big Bang Theory. Find your favorite TV show in the plot below.", "Now you may think, \u2018If The Simpsons have more total runtime than most TV shows, then makes sense that it has more word repetition\u2019 This is true, but this is not the only reason why this happens. If you check carefully, you\u2019ll find two TV shows with even more runtime than The Simpsons but less repetition. Besides, the first 16 seasons of The Simpsons have more vocabulary repetition than TV shows with less or more runtime.", "Research suggests that 1000 most common word families (Level 1) in English cover 81.54% of the vocabulary in a movie and 85.11% of the vocabulary in TV programs. Later, I\u2019ll show you that the most common 3000-word families (Level 3) cover 94% of the dialogues in a Simpsons episode, but first, let\u2019s see those difficult words from Level 4 and above within Simpsons dialogues. Spoiler alert, you may find lots of slang!", "Before you start wondering why the words on the left don\u2019t seem so difficult, you must know that they're actually the most common words from level 4 and above in all Simpsons episodes. That is, the words in the first wordcloud are the easiest within level 4 and above. In contrast, the ones on the right are the least common advanced words repeated at least 10 times.", "Whether you\u2019re a beginner, intermediate or advance English learner, you might\u2019ve felt frustrated at least once in your life because you didn\u2019t understand a joke your favorite character told. I have good news for you; I ranked all Simpsons episodes by difficulty as I did in The Best 100 Movies to Learn English. The episodes furthest to the right cover more basic (Lvl 1) or intermediate (Lvl 1+2+3) vocabulary. The higher the coverage, the easier to understand a Simpsons episode.", "Hover on the dots in the plot to find what\u2019s the next Simpsons episode you\u2019re going to watch!", "I found that the episode Secrets of A Successful Marriage (Season 5-Episode 22) covers the highest percentage of level 1 vocabulary, which means that this episode is probably the one you\u2019d understand dialogues easily. However, you\u2019d probably have a hard time trying to understand the jokes from the episodes furthest to the left like Redneck and Broomsticks (Season 21-Episode 7) and Sideshow Bob\u2019s Last Gleaming (Season 7-Episode 9).", "This is a clip from the episode Secrets of A Successful Marriage available on my YouTube channel. If you speak or study English, you\u2019ll notice that the dialogues are very simple.", "These are the top 10 episodes from The Simpsons with the easiest English vocabulary:", "If I convinced you of the potential for increasing your English vocabulary with The Simpsons, then you should consider checking the following table every time you watch a new episode. Before watching a Simpsons episode, you can find out which difficult words you\u2019ll hear by searching in the box below. You can filter by word, episode or season.", "Look up the definition of any word you find difficult before you watch a new episode and you\u2019d increase the chances of understanding jokes next time you watch The Simpsons!", "Naturally, Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa Simpson have more lines than the rest of the characters \u2014 that\u2019s why the show is called The Simpsons, right? However, none of the four main characters use complex sentences in their lines. Actually, the characters with less screentime such as Burns, Skinner, Krusty and Flanders are the ones who tend to use more advanced vocabulary. Are they the smartest characters for you?", "The average.number of spoken words in a Simpsons episode is 2,472 words. Most of the vocabulary used in Simpsons dialogues belong to the most common 1000 English words. This happens with most TV shows; then it\u2019s easy to acquire level 1 and level 2 vocabulary for non-native English speakers by watching TV shows. However, most TV shows have a little advanced vocabulary in a single episode. Fortunately, a few TV shows like The Simpsons have many words repeated at least 10 times throughout all episodes, which helps build advanced vocabulary.", "Finally, a few observations about the transcripts and the vocabulary levels:", "If you\u2019d like to see the code behind this analysis, you can find it here. Remember that vocabulary is not the only factor in obtaining a good understanding of TV shows. Pronunciation, accent and speech pace might increase or decrease your level of comprehension as well.", "I have to admit that I\u2019m not a big Simpsons fan, but after finding the benefits this TV shows offer, I\u2019ll consider watching it whenever I have free time! What episode should I start watching?", "Your home for data science.
