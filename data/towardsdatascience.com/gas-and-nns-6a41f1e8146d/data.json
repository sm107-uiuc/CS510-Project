In this article, I will go over the pros and cons of coupling NNs and GAs and share a few thoughts of my own. I will also, describe the basic algorithm used in this process.", "I occasionally write these somewhat short but informative articles to help you learn more about AI and Machine Learning. You can follow me on twitter or on here to stay up to date with my latest articles. You can also ask me questions on twitter or leave a comment here.", "I hope this article teaches you something new! Let\u2019s begin.", "Genetic Algorithms were very popular before NNs. Since, NNs required a lot of data, and GAs didn\u2019t. GAs were used mostly to simulate environments and behaviors of entities in a population. They were mostly used to learn the path to a problem which we knew the answer to.", "GAs are still used today but Machine Learning(ML) has mostly taken over.", "In computer science and operations research, a genetic algorithm (GA) is a metaheuristic inspired by the process of natural selection that belongs to the larger class of evolutionary algorithms (EA). Genetic algorithms are commonly used to generate high-quality solutions to optimization and search problems by relying on bio-inspired operators such as mutation, crossover and selection.", "If this still doesn\u2019t sink in, then I\u2019m sure Daniel Shiffman\u2019s playlist of GAs will help. It helped me learn how GAs work and Shiffman\u2019s videos are really good in general. Although I do recommend speeding them up.", "NNs have helped us solve so many problems. But there\u2019s a huge problem that they still have. Hyperparameters! These are the only values that can not be learned\u2026 Until now.", "Note: Hyper-parameters are values required by the NN to perform properly, given a problem.", "We can use GAs to learn the best hyper-parameters for a NN! This is absolutely awesome!", "Now, we don\u2019t have to worry about \u201cknowing the right hyperparameters\u201d since, they can be learned using a GA. Also, we can use this to learn the parameter\u2019s(weights) of a NN as well.", "Since, in a GA, the entities learn the optimum genome for the specified problem, here, the genome of each NN will be its set of hyper-parameters.", "To solve the hyper-parameter problem, we need to do the following:", "Note: You should create a class of the NN whose parameters you\u2019d like to learn. The population should then initially, contain several instances of that same NN class. Also, everything written above can be learned from Shiffman\u2019s playlist.", "Performing all the steps above, at the end of the latest generation, your algorithm will have found the population containing a NN with the optimum hyper-parameters. It will be the fittest NN of all in the population. The picture shown below attempts to explain the process.", "This being a good solution to learning your hyper-parameters, it does come with its own problems. The 2 most prominent being the problem of computational resources and time.", "Training many NNs simultaneously or one by one, several times requires a lot of time and computational resources. This limits the implementation of this solution to only the people who are willing to put in the money and buy a lot of processing power.", "This is also the reason why it\u2019s widely used by large companies.", "A little less than a year ago, OpenAIs Dota 2 bot beat a pro Dota 2 player(Article and YouTube video). What took the player years to learn and master, took the bot only a few weeks. In a video I saw on YouTube, an OpenAI Engineer explained how they trained the bot.", "They used a GA to train their bot. Since, they had the processing power necessary, they were able to run multiple instances of the Dota 2 simultaneously with each having an instance of the bot playing the game. It took them 2 weeks to teach the bot with this process.", "Just imagine how much processing power that must have required.", "In my opinion, GAs are good to teach a NN but they will not be my first choice. Instead, I will try to look for better ways to learn the hyper-parameters of a NN. If there are any, that is.", "However, if in the future I get access to a lot of processing power, I will be sure to try this method out.", "Your home for data science.
