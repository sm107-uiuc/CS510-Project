Great question.", "There could be multiple reasons for misrepresentation, but one at the top is: to create an emotional response within the viewer in order to compel them to a particular action. Said another way, the visualization creator has a greater interest in promulgating their agenda than accurately depicting data.", "Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, there are many times when factual data supports one\u2019s underlying intentions, but when it doesn\u2019t, one shouldn\u2019t visually exaggerate it so that it does.", "From the above, we know that numbers don\u2019t lie, but how they are presented can drastically affect the conclusions drawn.", "Before walking through a present-day example, I want to first introduce you to Edward Tufte, a professor at Yale University. Back in 1983, he authored a book entitled The Visual Display of Quantitative Information, which has had a profound impact on the world of statistics to this day. The Journal of the American Statistical Organization even called it \u201cthe most important contribution so far to the study of the graph.\u201d", "Within this book, Tufte introduces the concept of a lie factor. In short, the purpose of this factor is to calculate how honest a visualization is in representing its underlying data. Ideally, the lie factor should be 1.0 \u2014 so any other value (outside of minor variance) means that there is some mismatch in how well the visualization is representing the underlying data.", "The lie factor is defined as:", "Next, the size of the effect in the data is defined as:", "Is that still a bit vague? My guess is yes, so a present example should help you easily understand this important metric.", "In a recently published article in the Wall Street Journal, a chart, which is intended to illustrate the increase in all-cause deaths between 2020 and prior years, is shown. Before discussing the chart in detail, what do you think the underlying intention of its creator was?", "I would suggest that they wanted you to think that April 2020 has seen a significant increase in deaths. Not just an increase, but a significant increase. Further, with the context of this graph being within an article about COVID-19, it is also likely that they wanted you to think that the virus itself is very deadly, despite it actually having a fatality rate between 0.2 and 0.4%.", "Now, let\u2019s explore this chart by calculating the lie factor for it to see how accurately it visually represents the underlying data.", "In order to calculate the size of the effect in the graphic, we first measure the distance in pixels from the X-axis to the blue and tan lines. The blue line is 352 pixels tall while the tan line is 92 pixels tall.", "Next, we calculate the size of the effect in the data. Here, we observe that during the week of April 11, 71,784 all-cause deaths were recorded in 2020, while the average of 2017\u20132019 for the same week is calculated to be 55,647 deaths.", "Finally, we compute the lie factor to be:", "Yikes! It seems that our hunch about the graph misrepresenting the data was true. Sadly, this happens far too often. In this case, the trick used to mislead viewers was starting the graph at 50,000 instead of 0.", "In the future, as you view various visualizations, keep the lie factor in mind. In addition, ask yourself these questions:", "These questions, and many more outlined in this book written by Darrell Huff, are important to ask yourself when digesting and creating graphics.", "Remember that numbers don\u2019t lie \u2014 people do, and people have various reasons for doing so. Be someone who creates visualizations that correctly depict your data, while remaining cognizant of the ways others may try to mislead you with theirs.", "Your home for data science.
