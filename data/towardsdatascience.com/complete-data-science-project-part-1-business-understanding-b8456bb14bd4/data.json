I would like to present a guide to the world of machine learning. I will describe basic theoretical assumptions as well as practical solutions. Whether you are a beginner and you are just interested in the subject of artificial intelligence or you are already working as a Data Scientist, I think that my article will reach each of you and motivate you to continue your work. Each article has been divided into Data Science process phases according to the methodology of Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining:1. Business Understanding \u2014 you are here2. Data Understanding3. Data Preparation4. Modeling5. Evaluation6. Deployment", "Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining does not have any rigid frames on it. The process is efficient, iterative and we can always go back to the previous steps when we see that we made a mistake or didn\u2019t take something into account. You will find the whole project on GitHub.", "The project concerns forecasting the number of orders in a production company listed on the stock exchange on the basis of the international Global Management Challenge competition. I represented BATMAJA student team with whom I reached the national final. It is a competition based on business simulation. The teams are divided into groups and the teams with the highest investment result, i.e. market value and dividends paid, pass to the next stages. The company produces and sells 3 different products on the European market, NAFTA and on the Internet. All teams start with the same story. Many factors influence the number of orders in these markets.", "Business Understanding \u2014 this phase consists of a very precise specification of the problem together with methods of evaluating the achievement of the goal.", "Our goal is to create a model of the problem, which we use in turn to find a solution. The model should be precise enough to make the solution meaningful, otherwise, we will make too many assumptions and approximations which will make the solution far from real and meaningless. It should be added that the model is not the same as the problem, but only a representation of reality. Therefore, the model should be precise enough to find a solution and should be general enough not to include irrelevant variables [1]. A correct solution to the problem involves a correct understanding of the problem. Real business problems are rarely obvious. Therefore, an iterative approach to the project with multiple repetitions of individual phases is necessary for the solution to be considered acceptable. Data Scientist should have the creativity and domain knowledge to formulate the problem correctly. We should ask ourselves questions that will lead to the expected value.~ What is the exact business purpose? Creating a machine learning model cannot be an end in itself. The model should be an added value for business, create new profits or reduce costs. It should be verified how this problem is currently solved, if there is any solution at all. The presented problem can be formulated as one or more machine learning models: classification, regression or others [2]. Finally, it is necessary to decide which metrics will be used to evaluate the model. This metric will also allow you to compare the models and determine whether the model is underfitting or overfitting. Okay, this is not the end of the process, there is one more step. Write down all the assumptions and check them. This will allow you to catch errors at an early stage of design [3].", "Let\u2019s move on to understanding the Global Management Challenge. The teams are divided into groups with up to 8 teams competing. Each team starts with the same scenario, these are the reports for the company\u2019s activities in the previous 5 quarters. Then the teams, based on the history of their company, decide how the company is to operate in the next quarter. After the decisions are made, each team receives a report whose structure is the same as the history reports. In the training stage teams make 3 decisions and in each subsequent stage already 5 decisions. In the 1st stage of the competition 2 best teams move on to the next stage. In the 2nd stage of the competition there are 8 groups and the best team from each of them goes to the national final. The best team goes to the world final.", "Let\u2019s move on to the report structure, which teams receive in the form of a spreadsheet. The first section of the report contains the decisions that were made in the last quarter according to the team\u2019s decisions, unless not all of them were possible and were corrected by the system (marked as *). Teams make decisions on a dedicated platform by the deadline.", "The next part of the report concerns resources and products, so the company\u2019s activities in the factory as well as in the sales department. On the right hand side there is information about the sales of products on these markets. Here, there is a problem with forecasting the number of ordered products. If the company produces too many products, it will be necessary to store them, which brings costs or pay for the production of those products that will only be sold in the future. In addition, this situation creates further problems in the future, because fewer products have to be produced than previously assumed. There are more problems, but such a situation reduces the company\u2019s operating profit. The opposite example is the production of too few products in relation to the number of orders. Customers will have to wait for products, which will result in the loss of the company image.", "Then we have the financial statements, which are similar to those of listed companies. At this point, we see how demanding this competition is and how close it is to the actual decisions made by the management. Decisions must be made that combine the common interests of production, advertising, sales and finance.", "The last part of the report is group information. We will find out what the situation is like in this fictional world and what is the situation in the group. It is important to pay attention to the actions of our competitors, including the prices of their products. For an additional fee we can receive information about market shares and advertising of each team. We already have some basis for the competition.", "It wasn\u2019t my first start in the contest, so I had an intuition (Experience) on what the number of orders depends on. Moreover, my team members had domain knowledge of economics, finance, management and production or the functioning of the stock exchange. We used the information contained in the handbook, which is available on the organizer\u2019s website, and the international blog where explanatory variables were proposed. In the next article I will present which variables were selected for the project. A realistic project is far from being a part of a course or a competition on Kaggle. Here, we don\u2019t have the given variables, we often feel as if we are going to the target in a fog. It is exciting and that is why I love Data Science.", "See you in the next post!", "[1] M.
