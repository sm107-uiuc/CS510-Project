The field of investing is no exception as the environment investors operate in is rich with data. Many recent attempts at utilizing machine learning in financial predictions have focused on employing complex deep learning techniques such as Recurrent Neural Networks (and its many variants) to time series price data, simply put, this approach uses past prices to predict future prices. Without a preconceived view on market efficiency, this seems to make sense. Price is one of the most visible and easily obtainable data sets, especially for stocks and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) were designed specifically with the handling of sequential data in mind. However, this seemingly fitting matrimony rarely produces the intended results out-of-sample. But why?", "The signal to noise ratio in price data is incredibly low, due to its availability and ubiquity, it has long been overmined by participants in the market. There exists an entire sub-discipline within investing (technical analysis) that dedicates its efforts to the esoteric art of finding patterns in price history charts. Although these approaches are not as sophisticated as RNNs, any low hanging fruit has still been arbitraged away. But this doesn\u2019t mean that quantitative investing is entirely without use, if the machine learning model is the engine of prediction then data is merely its fuel, if price no longer suffice as the appropriate medium we can look for other sources to enable its function. There are still many free sources of alternative data if you are willing to look hard enough.", "If you\u2019re a data driven non-institutional investor who doesn\u2019t have access to a Bloomberg terminal but you want to upgrade from exporting price time series to csv from Yahoo! Finance, the below list may pique your interest:", "As one of the 12 regional reserve banks that make up the US central banking system, the St. Louis Fed always has a hand on the pulse of the US economy. In addition to its vital role in the setting of monetary policy, it is also a centre for macroeconomic research. In fostering this research it has compiled the Federal Reserve Economic Data database, a source that combines over 500,000 different time series data sets in one location. While this database predominantly houses domestic and international macroeconomic data, it is ever expanding, newer additions have included bitcoin/cryptocurrency price indices. It can be found here.", "More recently to assist empirical research, the St Louis Fed have released the FRED-MD and FRED-QD, monthly and quarterly \u201cbig data\u201d databases of 100 key indicators. This may present a good place to start for your financial prediction problem.", "Kaggle is the world\u2019s biggest online data science community, it also serves as a platform for institutions to post their data related problems for aspiring and proven data scientists to solve in a competition like format. Not only do users gain access to the data but top finishers will often publish a detailed account of their approach, methodology and code on the site blog after conclusion. Prior winners have included Geoffrey Hinton (often referred to as the Godfather of deep learning) and his students. There are many interesting posts on the website including alternative data that can be used in data driven investing. One such data set is from a recent competition held by renowned quantitative hedge fund Two Sigma, where you\u2019re provided news stories from Thomson Reuters with the goal of predicting stock prices.", "An online market place for alternative data sets, Quandl\u2019s target customer base are investors both large and small. With intriguing non-traditional metrics like volume of sales of a particularly car from the week prior or how much Apple spent on operations last month, Quandl definitely presents an unique offering. Some of the harder to come by data sets are available at a cost but the platform does offer large libraries of market and international economic data free of charge. This can be accessed via a number of add-ins/APIs for Excel, R and Python, so it can be easily integrated into any workflow.", "Web scraping refers to the extraction of data from web pages, arguably the single biggest source of raw and unstructured data available. With the ease of use and accessibility of automated web scraping libraries like Rvest in R and Beautiful Soup in Python, any element of a web page can be quickly captured, processed and stored with as little as four lines of code. Useful examples of this technique being used include Lucca and Trebbi 2009, where the authors, from the National Bureau of Economic Research, combined sentences from the Federal Reserve\u2019s FOMC statements with the words \u201chawkish\u201d and \u201cdovish\u201d (terms used to indicate the central bank\u2019s stance towards interest rates) in Google searches and captured the number of returned results. These results were then used to predict the future trajectory of interest rates. Another relevant piece of research is that of Preis, Moat and Stanley 2013 which used Google Trend analytics for particular search terms to uncover early warning signs of adverse stock market moves. There are many other practical examples, but how and where you apply it is limited only by the vast expanse of the internet.", "Although I\u2019ve listed 4 alternative sources of data that may be useful in helping you to formulate your investment-related machine learning problem, it is important to note that we cannot entirely discard the use of prices. Ultimately returns are what we\u2019re after (at least most of us)and that is a function of price. However, in this context we should use price as a measure of the outcome rather than a feature of input. Intuitively this makes sense as past prices are not the only thing that affects stocks, stocks are essentially companies and companies are subject to the business and economic environment of their operations.", "Lucca, D. and Trebbi, F.
