Now, though, Amazon is the second largest apparel retailer in the US and the latest trend is to go a step beyond shopping for your clothes online \u2014 now it\u2019s about letting an algorithm do the shopping for you. I don\u2019t often talk about fashion, as I know very little about it and prefer sticking to my normal areas of interest in technology. But with a new (to the UK) service called Stitch Fix, the two areas collide, finally offering some hope for the style-challenged like me as well as the time-poor but fashion-conscious.", "Having already garnered over 3 million active users in the US, Stitch Fix is now available in the UK, its first overseas expansion. Signing up and completing your profile takes less than ten minutes and a few days later, a box of clothes, picked individually for you by Stitch Fix\u2019s algorithms and refined by one of their (for now) human stylists is delivered to your door. For lazy shoppers or those who would love to have the advice of a personal shopper but can\u2019t afford one, Stitch Fix is the ultimate in convenience, with an added dash of style advice.", "My first box (or my first \u2018Fix\u2019 as they call it) was a success. Although I\u2019m no stranger to letting algorithms recommend items to me for purchase, I was somewhat tentative opening the box \u2014 could they really pick out clothes I\u2019d like? In a victory for the algorithms, everything they had selected for me fit and was a pretty appropriate choice. (You can ask them to push your style boundaries and send you items a little outside your normal wardrobe comfort zone to consider). If you don\u2019t choose to keep everything they\u2019ve sent you, there\u2019s an included envelope for free returns. I particularly appreciated the additional styling advice guiding me on how to combine items.", "How and where we buy things is changing rapidly and Stitch Fix is another example of the relentless push for convenience affecting every sector. I\u2019m sure the next step will be for Stitch Fix to tie up with Google Assistant or Amazon\u2019s Alexa so that ordering will be as simple as \u201cHey Google, I\u2019d like some new clothes\u201d. After that, I imagine my Google Assistant will soon scan my calendar, see an event for which I might need a new outfit and coordinate with Stitch Fix to get me another event-appropriate Fix just in time. But for now, you can order new Fixes as you need, or schedule them to come monthly or quarterly.", "\u201c[Our customers] come to us because they don\u2019t want to go shopping. 5 years from now, people will say, \u2018Remember when we had to wander malls and find our own things? That\u2019s crazy!\u2019\u201d", "Eric Colson, Chief Algorithm Officer, Stitch Fix", "Stitch Fix, perhaps with just a little self-serving hyperbole, suggest that in years to come it will seem quaint that we once visited clothing stores to search for items we like. Algorithms can assess millions of items in an instant and match them very accurately to our preferences. I know plenty of people enjoy shopping and would be aghast at delegating it to an unseen algorithm that dispatches boxes. But the sheer convenience of having the box show up on your doorstep as frequently or infrequently as you need, along with reasonable prices, good quality clothes and spot-on selections, will likely see a significant number of people relying on the service for much of their wardrobe. All it takes is another small leap of faith about what feels right to buy online.", "Your home for data science.
