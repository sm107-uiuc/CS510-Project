The goal of this post is to give an introduction to the categories and highlight some relevant problems. The problems discussed are featured from https://datascienceprep.com/ which covers interview questions from top tech companies.", "These questions are asked to demonstrate that you understand the basic principles of probability. Common topics include: joint and conditional probabilities and various rules and theorems of probability (multiplication rule, inclusion-exclusion, etc.) Many times they are purely technical \u201cbrain-teaser\u201d problems that may or may not be related to a particular product, and will range in difficulty from the easy end (a) to the hard end (b).", "a) Say that you are pushing a new feature X out. You have 1000 users and each user is either a fan or not a fan of X, at random. There are 50 users of 1000 that do not like X. You will decide whether to ship the feature or not based on sampling 5 users independently and if they all like the feature, you will ship it. What is the probability that you will ship the feature?", "b) There are two groups of n users, A and B, and each user in A is friends with those in B and vice versa. Each user in A will randomly choose a user in B as their best friend and each user in B will randomly choose a user in A as their best friend. If two people have chosen each other, they are mutual best friends. What is the probability that there will be no mutual best friendships?", "These problems are designed to test your basic statistical foundation \u2014 while usually not directly applicable since you often won\u2019t be coding A/B tests from scratch, are more there so that you can tweak experiments as necessary, and understand and interpret results. Common topics include various distributions, the Central Limit Theorem and Law of Large Numbers, hypothesis testing, and so on. They will range from anything more of a \u201cbrain-teaser\u201d (a) where you need to apply statistical concepts in a succinct manner, to more product-related open-ended questions (b).", "a) There are two games involving dice that you can play. In the first game, you roll two die at once and get the dollar amount equivalent to the product of the rolls. In the second game, you roll one die and get the dollar amount equivalent to the square of that value. Which has the higher expected value and why?", "b) How can you decide how long to run an experiment? What are some problems with just using a fixed p-value threshold and how do you work around them?", "Product problems are designed specifically for the company at hand, in order to gauge your intuition on a particular topic that is very likely relevant to the company. Therefore it is important to always get acclimated to the company you\u2019re interviewing with and the types of products they build and metrics they track. Generally, the topics will include anything from comparing and contrasting platforms (a) to understanding how feature changes affect a particular metric (b).", "a) Imagine the social graphs for both Facebook and Twitter. How do they differ? What metric would you use to measure how skewed the social graphs are?", "b) Your team is trying to figure out whether a new driver app with extra UI features will increase the number of rides taken. How would you test whether the extra features in the app make it better than the original version?", "Since data science requires proficiency in programming, the coding here is similar in style to the level of interviews you might find for software engineering roles. Common topics involve arrays, linked lists, dictionaries, and often utilize basic algorithms such as BFS and DFS.", "a) Given a number n, return the number of lists of consecutive positive integers that sum up to n. Can you do it in linear time?", "b) You have an entire social graph of users, with nodes representing users and edges representing friendships between users. Given the edges of the graph and the number of nodes, write a function to return the smallest number of friendships in-between two users.", "Similar to programming, data science requires SQL skills to quickly query and slice & dice data. These are often straightforward and involve basic principles, and occasionally window functions. Like product problems, they are often quite practical.", "a) Assume you have an events table on app analytics. Write a query to get the click-through rate per app in 2019.", "b) Assume you have tables on sessions that users have, and a users table. Write a query to get the active user count of daily cohorts.", "While not all roles in data science utilize machine learning directly or indirectly, if you\u2019re looking for a more advanced data science or machine learning engineering role then it definitely helps to have a good proficiency on both the applied and theoretical side. The topics here will vary a lot based on the company you\u2019re interviewing for and hence questions can range from more product-oriented questions for particular applications (a) to more specific theoretical questions (b).", "a) Say you need to produce a binary classifier for fraud detection. What metrics would you look at, how is each defined, and what is the interpretation of each one?", "b) Say we are running a probabilistic linear regression which does a good job modeling the underlying relationship between some y and x. Now assume all inputs have some noise added, which is independent of the training data. What is the new objective function? How do you compute it?", "If you\u2019re interested in further exploring different categories of problems for interview prep, check out: https://datascienceprep.com/", "Your home for data science.
