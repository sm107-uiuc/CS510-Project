I started learning it completely out of my own interest (not just because of hype). It was one of the challenging tracks to opt-in especially if you are working simultaneously on some other technology. I started my journey by enrolling myself in many MOOCs(Massive Open Online Courses) and started reading multiple blogs. Initially, it didn\u2019t make sense, eventually after reading other people\u2019s code and getting my hands dirty with real-time datasets. It slowly started making sense.", "When I started searching for jobs, there began a new interesting story. I opened a top job portal in India and started searching for jobs, I found few jobs that were relevant to what I was looking for but when I opened one of them, to my surprise the requirements they mentioned were something new to me. Leaving traditional Data analysis, Machine learning, Deep learning apart, some ETL tools and multiple Big Data technologies were mentioned as required skills. I thought It\u2019s okay since every company has their own definition of a data scientist these days and opened another job. This time it showed up with a requirement of some other technologies like AWS, Azure and Power BI.", "Remember all these openings were tagged under Data scientist only. All these openings have common requirements like Machine learning algorithms, Statistics, Data Analysis, Data cleaning and Deep learning techniques. Along with these skills, a few companies were expecting the candidates to have knowledge in the cloud (AWS, Azure, or GCP) and data visualization tools like Tableau, Power BI, and ETL tools like SSIS. Usually, these technologies are more to do with Data Analyst/Data Engineer roles but the Data scientist role is still evolving and doesn\u2019t really stick to a particular skillset yet.", "I do understand the fact that companies look for an applicant who fits their vacancy and also has the skillset in the technologies they are looking for. This will definitely save time and money for the company instead of providing the training again.", "So, Here I got an interesting idea to understand what exactly IT industry is expecting for a data scientist role in real-time not what usually taught in MOOCs.", "Objective: We will try to find out the skills and trends that are most sought in the industry right now. For this, we will scrape data from the job portal.", "Note: This whole analysis is done for data scientist role In Indian market.", "In this article, we will try to find answers to a few important questions, which every data science job seeker will have in mind.", "Note: You can find the link to complete code in Conclusion section.", "I have gathered all the relevant job information from the top job portal in India- Naukri.com, which almost every job aspirant and recruiter uses these days. I have used selenium-python for web scraping since the traditional BeautifulSoap approach somehow didn\u2019t work well on this site.", "Disclaimer: The webscraping is performed purely for educational puposes.", "We will scrape theses five elements for each job: Role, Company name, Experience, Location and Key Skills.", "Let\u2019s do some basic preprocessing before we dive in.", "Performed a basic cleaning of finding the missing values and dropping them.", "We need to be really careful while handling duplicate data since a company might post the same requirement multiple times because the job is still open or on the other hand the company might be looking for a completely new opening with the same requirement. To keep it simple I\u2019ve not dropped any data.", "Converted all the strings to the lower case just to avoid redundancy and tokenized the locations and skills columns since there are more than one value in these columns.", "This is how it looked after the preprocessing.", "Now, we just have everything to get started.", "Note: If you are not from India, feel free to skip this locations part.", "This is an important step to look into because after a few results, job portals usually start showing some other jobs that are irrelevant to the job we were searching for. Just to be assured that we are looking at the right roles, let\u2019s check the top 10 frequently mentioned roles.", "Finally, here we are. The main reason why you are probably reading this.", "Let's dive in deep to understand the trends more clearly.", "3. Strong statistical modeling is required to be a better data scientist.", "4. Companies are expecting a good knowledge of deep learning since it provides the state of the art techniques to solve some interesting real-time problems in fields like NLP and Computer Vision.", "5. Employers are expecting the candidates to have knowledge of big data technologies due to the huge rise in the amount of data recorded every day. In real-time, we might be working on huge datasets where these skills will definitely come in handy.", "2. The industry is still in favor of Python due to its rich libraries followed by the R language.", "3. SQL is a must for every data scientist. Though it doesn't fit to be treated as programming language I still included here by taking my chances :).", "4. After python and R there seems to be good demand for SAS and C++ languages.", "2. The industry is in favor of Tensorflow over PyTorch.", "3. Keras has its good share in the market, people love it because of its simple and easy nature.", "4. Though there are many other frameworks like Caffe, Maxnet there seem to be not many openings. If not in the world, at least in India.", "Do you really have to match all the skills mentioned in this post to get a job?", "Well not really, there are few tools in the list which are easy to pick up on job if you are strong with your fundamentals. Having said that if you are just looking for a job having these skills on your resume will probably help you land an interview.", "If you are good with all the mentioned must-have skills for a data scientist then the best approach should be to start attending the interviews and meanwhile try to fill the gaps in your understanding and learn the tools/technologies you feel will give you an edge over other candidates.", "You can find the complete code on my GitHub. You can connect to me on Linkedin.", "If you find this helpful or have any questions do let me know in comments.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data scientist.
