The number of CS students and business science majors who want to know how to analyze insights is growing at a wild rate.", "Right now, \u201cIntro to Data Science\u201d is the fastest-growing class at Berkeley. When it comes to Harvard, \u201cIntroduction to Statistics\u201d was another hot pick among undergraduates \u2014 a change stimulated by the growth of big data and data science.", "We all understand that there\u2019s no end in sight when it comes to data production. Since the 2000s, we have been creating terabytes of data contributing to the worldwide data deluge.", "In 2021, the need for people who could make sense of all this accessible information is drier than ever. That\u2019s why the demand for data scientists has spiked dramatically.", "If you are a computer science enthusiast eager to brand yourself as a big data analyst, you might be confused about what the right starting point is. In this post, I\u2019ll explain why I believe that learning Java is one of the most reasonable decisions a data scientist can make and share some helpful resources to fuel your learning.", "Unfortunately, if you come by a tech forum or data science-related Reddit thread, it\u2019s painfully common to hear claims like \u201cData science will become obsolete in 20 years\u201d. I\u2019d say, there\u2019s no empirical evidence of this happening anytime soon \u2014 rather, as BD and data analytics advance, new applications of these technologies emerge.", "Here are ten applications for big data that can be an excellent motivation to start learning it even if you work in a field with no direct connection to engineering or computer science.", "There\u2019s no tip-toeing around the fact that Python and R are the standard languages of modern big data. I won\u2019t deny the fact that most BD tools have APIs for Python and R so not knowing Java will rarely be indispensable for a data scientist.", "However, there are a ton of Big Data use cases when Java should be one of the languages in your tech stack.", "You should learn Java for big data if:", "Java isn\u2019t the newest and hottest language of the market \u2014 so it makes sense to wonder why it still has so much impact in Big Data, despite the appearance of newer, more concise technologies.", "Personally, I (and many of my peers) am drawn to Java both in application and big data development for the following reasons:", "Hadoop is a framework that helps data scientists process large datasets. Companies use the tool to aggregate all external data in one system, group, and categorize it.", "These are the tool\u2019s main features:", "Is there a flipside? Plenty: Hadoop is hard to learn and to implement so a growing number of data scientists prefer to move on to other tools (according to statistics, 11% of Gartner survey respondents said that they plan to invest in Hadoop).", "Having said that, the demand for Hadoop is still outmatching the supply. At the time of writing, there are nearly 2,500 Hadoop developer job openings on Indeed. The salaries of Hadoop engineers are worth considering as well \u2014 according to ZipRecruiter, the national average is at $125,000.", "Spark is a multi-purpose tool data scientists use for just about everything: stream processing, machine learning analytics, and many other processes. By flexibility, speed, and the smoothness of the learning curve, the framework is a huge cut above Hadoop.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Spark is built in Scala, not Java (there\u2019s a Java API you can integrate to be fully comfortable). Even if you set your sights on learning Scala, the good news is, there are plenty of similarities between Java and Scala \u2014 I outlined the main ones below.", "Storm is another handy tool used to process real-time data streams. The framework approaches streaming similarly to the way Hadoop handles batch processing.", "Storm has a wide range of applications in big data: ETL, continuous computation, machine learning, and many more.", "To understand the range of Storm adoption, it\u2019s enough to take a look at some of its adopters: Twitter, Spotify, Alibaba, and many more.", "\u201cSpotify serves streaming music to over 10 million subscribers and 40 million active users. Storm powers a wide range of real-time features at Spotify, including music recommendation, monitoring, analytics, and ad targeting. Together with Kafka, memcached, Cassandra, and netty-zmtp based messaging, Storm enables us to build low-latency fault-tolerant distributed systems with ease.\u201d", "If you can\u2019t wait to start learning Java to improve your versatility as a data scientist, it\u2019s helpful to have a resource deck for reference.", "While I am not a huge fan of using multiple learning tools at once, I put together a deck of useful books, courses, video tutorials, and forum threads for those eager to learn Java and use it in BD.", "Describing the evolution of big data, Pearl Zhu said: \u201cWe are moving slowly into an era where big data is the starting point, not the end.\u201d The growth rate of the field, indeed, suggests that data scientists will be at the core of every project in the future. So, programmers want to make sure that, when the time comes to jump on the BD wagon, they have the skills necessary to stay relevant.", "The good news is, Java is a programming language a data scientist will not regret learning. Its widespread use to support the big data ecosystem, dominance in writing production code, and popularity at the enterprise level all suggest that Java is here to stay \u2014 that\u2019s why more developers should start learning it as soon as possible.", "Your home for data science.
