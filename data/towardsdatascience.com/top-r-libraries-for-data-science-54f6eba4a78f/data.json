One such popular languages for Data Science is R; a well-known and increasingly popular tool in the Data Science field.", "While we know the most-used Python libraries for Data Science, here I have prepared a list of some of the most useful R libraries for data scientists and engineers, based on my experience. A few would be known to you and few for you to explore.", "R is a software environment primarily designed for statistical computing. The interface and structure are very well suited for tasks related to algorithms and data modeling. With 100s of libraries, R has emerged to be one of the most developed libraries systems that count thousands of packages to solve a wide variety of problems.", "Popular among statisticians and data miners for developing statistical software and data analysis, there also exists an on-going debate about R being obsolete or its comparison to Python. Python and R are two different programming languages with different applications to address and so, the two technically should not be compared.", "Nevertheless, here we begin our list with different Data Science operations as data manipulation, visualization, competitive research, and machine learning.", "dplyr provides essential functionalities for subsetting, summarizing, rearranging, and joining together data sets. dplyr is our go-to package for fast data manipulation. The major functions to operate with dplyr are filter, selection, arrange, mutate and summarize (group by)", "data.table is an enhanced version of data.frames which basically sorts data in R. With data.table,you can perform data manipulation operations such as subset, group, update, join etc., are all inherently related. Keeping these related operations together allows for R for faster manipulation", "Read Rectangular Text Data (readr) provides a fast and friendly way to read rectangular data like csv (comma separated values), tsv (tab separated values), delim (delimited values) and fwf (fixed width files). It is designed to flexibly parse many types of data found in the wild, while still cleanly failing when data unexpectedly changes. readr is part of the core tidyverse, so installing tidyverse should work as well.", "tidyr quite literally makes the R data tidy. A tidy data is important because ensuring that, you\u2019ll spend less time fighting with the tools and more time working on your analysis. This package provides tools for changing the layout of your data sets using the gather and spread functions to convert your data into the tidy format", "Another useful member of the tidy verse family, the stringr package provides a comprehensive set of functions designed to work with regular expressions and character strings with ease.", "Tools that make working with dates and times across durations, periods, intervals easier. The easiest way to get lubridate is t install the whole tidyverse, alternatively install just lubridate.", "R\u2019s rich ecosytem has numerous famous packages for making beautiful graphics but one of the majorly popular and commonly used visualization package is ggplot2. It lets you use the grammar of graphics to build layered, customizable plots.", "Implementation of interactive, web based graphics built with the grammar of graphics. Incorporates lucrative react programming within grammar of data manipulation. It is easy to build interactive graphics for exploratory data analysis with ggvis.", "It differs from ggplot2 in a sense of the visual representation. Every interactive ggvis plot must be connected to a running R session; static plots as ggplots do not need a running R session to be viewed. (Check out vega with ggplot and ggvis)", "rgl is a 3D graphics package that produces a real-time interactive 3D plot. It allows to interactively rotate, zoom the graphics and select regions. The rgl package includes also a generic 3D interface named R3D. It contains high-level graphics commands modelled loosely after classic R graphics, but working in three dimensions.", "A faster and efficient way to build interactive (javascript based) visualizations with R is through htmlwidgets. Packages that implement htmlwidgets include leaflet (maps), dygraphs (time series), DT (tables), diagrammeR (diagrams), network3D (network graphs), threeJS (3D scatterplots and globes).", "lattice is an add-on package as an implementation of Trellis graphics for R. It is a powerful and elegant high-level data visualization system with an emphasis on multivariate data.", "(Trellis Graphics is a framework for data visualization developed at the Bell Labs by Rick Becker, Bill Cleveland et al, extending ideas presented in Bill Cleveland\u2019s 1993 book Visualizing Data)", "mlr is a popular machine learning package in R that interfaces data to a large number of classification and regression techniques. mlr to an extension can also process", "Once we have a split on our data training as training and tests sets, the random forest classifier provided by the randomForest package can be used to construct a random forests with n number of trees. (Note: Unlike scikit-learn, we don\u2019t need to explicily call the fit method to train our model). In R, by default, the number of decision trees in a random forest is 500 and the number of features used as potential candidates for each split will be 3.", "The caret package (short for Classification And REgression Training) is a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models.
