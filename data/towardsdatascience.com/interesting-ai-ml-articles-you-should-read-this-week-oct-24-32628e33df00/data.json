So there is undoubtedly an article within this week\u2019s recommended list that you will find useful.", "If you write AI/ML content on Medium and you would like me to read and include your article in my weekly/monthly article coverage, feel free to tag me in the comment section of your article or connect and send a link to the article on LinkedIn.", "Agustinus Nalwan brings work home as he applies five years of AI knowledge to teach his two-year-old son certain behaviours effectively.", "This cleverly written article discusses the supervised and reinforcement learning training methodology and the mimicry that can be seen in the method used to teach toddlers new skills and behaviours.", "Agustinus\u2019s article does an excellent job of highlighting the similarities between the learning methods in both machine learning models and toddlers.", "Machine learning practitioners are aware that one of the key aspirations of the field is to mimic the learning methodologies that occur in young kids within machine learning algorithms.", "Agustinus mentions one key factor that is missing within ML algorithms, and that is the ability to reason. The ability to reason is also referred to as common sense.", "Reading this article brings to light the similarities between biological and artificial systems. Agustinus article also touches on the significant gap that currently exists between both learning systems.", "AI has a long way to go before catching or surpassing humans in general activities. Humans have the advantage of being able to generate multiple models of the world with little to no training data and more importantly create, access and destroy interconnecting relationships between these generated models.", "Sebastian\u2019s latest article is a practical introduction to the Zero-shot learning technique within machine learning.", "This easy to follow article includes several introductory takeaways on zero-shot learning, including a description of the technique\u2019s learning paradigm.", "Sebastian has written a beginner-friendly article for machine learning practitioners that want to understand the technical implementation of an area of machine learning that is quickly gaining popularity. The implementation of the zero-shot technique within the article is performed using Keras, a popular machine learning library.", "Within an hour, machine learning practitioners can understand the implementation details and ideas behind zero-shot learning, and those that are willing to gain more understanding of the technique can use the external resource links to associated research papers that are included within the article.", "Awais briefly explores the AI applications and technologies that government bodies and agencies in China recruited to curb the spread of Covid19, whilst maintaining a form of functioning society for its citizens.", "China use of its mass surveillance system has always been a subject of controversy when it comes to the handling of personal privacy.", "Awais explores the benefits that this once frowned upon method of citizen governing and monitoring is the reason why China\u2019s handling of the Covid-19 crisis better than certain nations around the globe, even though initially reported cases of Covid-19 originated in China.", "AI technology, big data and robots were more than instrumental in the effective tackling of the spread of Covid-19 within China. Awais mentions the utilisation of various forms of AI-based technology such as facial recognition, mask detection and heat reading, to monitor, alert and inform citizens on all Covid-19 related cases in their local vicinity.", "Reading this article, I was surprised by the collaboration of big tech companies such as Alibaba and Tencent along with other small startups to provide open source tools and research findings that can help the rapid development of Covid-19 applications and solutions. Some of these solutions were utilised by public sectors such as healthcare and policing bodies.", "Arjun latest article explores the process by which one can go about the implementation of VGG16 network using TensorFlow 2.0.", "VGG16 or OxfordNet is a convolutional neural network that a large number of deep learning practitioners would have come across in some shape or form.", "The neural network architecture was used to win ILSVR ImageNet competition in 2014 and is a standard network that can be found readily implemented in most deep learning libraries such as PyTorch and TensorFlow.", "Arjun starts the article by providing a brief statement that describes the gains and developments in the early years of the deep learning field.", "Arjun has done an excellent job in detailing the intrinsic parts of the VGG16 network and has used illustrative depictions of the architecture components to supplement the included code snippets.", "Arjun latest article is one that I\u2019ll implore deep learning practitioners to archive due to its relevancy to deep learning and computer vision.", "Guy\u2019s article is a foreshadowing to the imminent threat that a lack of security within AI systems could pose in the coming decades.", "A couple of decades ago the utilisation of AI-based technologies was a conversation held within research labs and University institutions. Now, AI is integrated within every aspect of our lives, and Guy alludes to this fact very early on in this article.", "As technology advances, security has always been a subject of great importance, and Guy points out that although we\u2019ve seen massive influx and adoption of AI-based technology, there is an enormous disproportion in the amount of effort given to AI security in correlation with AI advancements.", "The article introduces the risks imposed by AI-based technology by highlighting the risk that accompanies the high accessibility and freedom we give to AI-based applications such as phone answering, decisions making solutions, recommendation tools, self-driving systems and more.", "Guy balances the risk of AI by informing the reader of the joint efforts of research groups, pioneers, governing bodies, regulators and agencies in creating policies and guiding rules that can enable safe and ethical utilisation of AI within applications and as a consequence, society.", "There are mentions of several components of AI security that should be considered to build a robust ecosystem of solutions that can enforce suitable security within AI systems.", "Currently, there are noticeable efforts to ensure that security initiatives are up to speed with the current advancement in AI. As a society, we want to avoid playing catch up when it comes to governing the use of AI solutions have a high impact on daily lives. Guy\u2019s article is very time-relevant and is an excellent introduction to the topic of AI security for those that are interested in the field.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
