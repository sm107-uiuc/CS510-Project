Thus, machine learning technology is integrated today into many types of software that turn each software into a smart project that may help people solve many daily routines.", "Large companies like Google and Microsoft didn\u2019t want to lag behind and build their machine learning platforms that make it possible for developers to add machine learning capabilities to their projects without troubles.", "Our goal in this article is to single out all the main machine learning as a service platforms that are available on the market. Also, we will show you examples of projects with integrated AI.", "We think you heard about BaaS (backend as a service) conception or SaaS (software as a service)? MLaaS also works with the infrastructure and all related issues. Thus, developers don\u2019t need to spend time dealing with model training, evaluation, and cloud-based predictions are already configured.", "If you want to know how cloud-based predictions may bring results for your internal infrastructure. Predictions and infrastructure can be combined using REST APIs.", "In fact, cloud machine learning services can be used for creating the first functioning models that will help you get useful insights based on predictions. Moreover, a big development team is not necessary in this case.", "Really amazing and powerful representatives of MlaaS platforms are Amazon MLaaS, Cloud Machine Learning Engine from Google, Azure ML from Microsoft. You don\u2019t need to be highly skilled at machine learning to use these MLaaS platforms.", "Before we proceed to the description of top MLaaS platforms, we want you to make the decision regarding the necessity of machine learning implementation. To help you consider all the pros and cons, we will cover all reasons when you should add machine learning to your software and when it is better to give up this idea.", "These tips below will be a starting point of AI integration.", "Your software works with Big Data. To put it simply, if your software work with a huge amount of data that needs to be processed and analyzed, you may think about machine learning algorithms integration. For example, you create an eCommerce website or mobile app, AI can be used to provide users with a personalized experience, special recommendations, offer them products they really need and so on. Or if you are working healthcare sector and your software will perform healthcare-related tasks, predictive analytics on ML basis will be right on time.", "Your software requires a permanent improvement. What is the advantage of machine learning technology? It is clear from its name \u2014 machine learning is constantly learning new information and improves itself. Thus, your software gains permanent experience and becomes only stronger and more powerful.", "Thus, if you have financial, healthcare, or eCommerce software \u2014 it should improve the experience of users, give them new opportunities, and also secure the data for fraud prevention. AI also helps solve security issues. See the next point.", "Your software should be secure enough. Machine learning technology applies new security tools to protect your app and protect all users\u2019 personal data. ML-based software is capable of learning new threats and create additional protection layers to make sure your software is secure enough.", "Also, any fraudulent activity can also be detected on time and be suppressed.", "Unfortunately, despite the fact that machine learning has a lot of advantages, in some cases, it may become a burden rather than a find. Check these cases out.", "Your app is rather small. Machine learning will be useful only if your software contains too much data. It needs a lot of data to learn. But if your app is small, machine learning won\u2019t work properly and it will do more harm than good. As a result, your app may submit wrong recommendations, improper information, and so on.", "Your resources are limited. Machine learning integration is not a cheap thing, and you will also need to spend money during further improvements. Also, working with a large amount of data requires serious computer power, so this sector will also require additional investments. And specialists will need time to train data sets, so the more they will work \u2014 the more money you will need to spend.", "Your software has simple features. If you create an app, for example, with the schedule of your local subway or the app for managing purchases \u2014 it doesn\u2019t need machine learning at all. Such apps perform very simple tasks and they don\u2019t need permanent improvement and data learning.", "We hope these tips will help you understand what you need and what you don\u2019t. If you know that your app will benefit from machine learning, then we proceed to the list of top MLaaS platforms.", "Well, less talking. Now we will discuss all the mentioned platforms, what capabilities they have, and also we will add a few more existing platforms.", "Pricing: It is very diversified, you can find a plan you need on an official page of the platform.", "CMLE is a service that helps both developers and data scientists create and run powerful machine learning models. CLME has training and prediction services, specialists can use it together or separately. It is already used by many companies for clouds identification in satellite images, food safety ensuring, automated replies to customer emails, and so on. AI Platform Training and AI platform Prediction are used for training and prediction services accordingly.", "CMLE has a large number of features like the following ones:", "Of course, these are only a few useful features Cloud ML Engine provides with, but you can study it more deeply if needed.", "Azure ML offers a visual interface that helps build and train models, choose algorithms to apply, and so on. This platform is working along with ML Studio framework that makes it possible to build modular solutions.", "This is a cloud-based platform that is oriented both on novices and skilled specialists, and many of its operations can be implemented manually. In addition, Azure Machine has detailed documentation and it also provides with hundreds of ML solutions that are stored in Cortana Intelligence Gallery. Any other developers can use these solutions at their discretion.", "This service is one of the most popular and leading ML services among other existing ones. It is very good for many projects, especially if this project comes to the deadline but not everything is implemented.", "At the same time, however, there are some limitations during automation processes, so it is not a very flexible machine learning tool.", "Amazon Machine Learning can be used for detection frauds, documents classification, and many other tasks. Also, various developers like may find SDK for their programming language \u2014 Ruby, Java, .NET and other languages are available.", "The same name company which created this platform tried to make BigML a useful platform for each customer, offering various price plans and detailed documentation along with flexible API for integration.", "A perfect option for Big Data solutions, customer segmentation, basket analysis, predictive analysis, and other tasks. In addition, BigML provides developers with ready-made scripts, despite the fact that this platform is not big in comparison with the platforms mentioned above.", "This is a perfect solution for those who want to control the deployment of machine learning. An open source server that allows developers to create predictive engines.", "This server offers SDKs for many programming languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, Java. Also, a large community on GitHub contributed to creating SDKs for languages like Swift, Node.js and some other.", "IBM Watson is not an ML platform in its conception. IBM MlaaS offers today only data visualization and descriptions of data values interaction with each other. This service offers automated predictive analytics and cognitive capabilities, and it is a good option for users who are not skilled in computer science.", "However, data scientists also may make use of IBM Watson together with developers to integrate AI into software and simplify the deployment process.", "But IBM Watson is evolving every year, and the number of its capabilities will grow exponentially.", "This is not MlaaS platform, but it is a very useful machine learning library from Google and it has a large number of necessary machine learning tools. The library lacks a visual interface, and it is built for developers that want to learn about data science more deeply. Tensor Flow is integrated into Cloud Machine Learning Engine we have mentioned above, but it can be also integrated with many other service providers as well.", "It is no longer a problem to find the storage for data collection and its processing. To achieve it, NoSQL and SQL databases will be required. Along with databases, it is necessary to use such auxiliary solutions like Cassandra, Redfish, Amazon S3.", "If you plan to use machine learning platforms, this challenges becomes simpler. You can use one service provider for machine learning implementation and data storage. Thus, it will help you avoid troubles with data source configuration. If you think that is not a preferable option for you, mind that some MLaaS platforms support the integration with third-party data storages.", "Let\u2019s review a few apps that already use the capabilities of machine learning and make the experience of users much brighter.", "Snapchat users like to have interesting and funny experiments with the app, so machine learning makes it possible. Snapchat has many special filters on the basis of artificial intelligence. Filters are used to track faces, add accessories like hat, glasses, change face with a mustache, beard, eye color, and so on. Also, the recent filter even allows users to change their sex, which is also an amusing feature.", "The company has started integrating machine learning algorithms into Snapchat when it acquired the Ukraine-based Looksery company which specialized in computer vision.", "We, humans, recognize faces without troubles, whereas machines need much time to learn this capability. So specialists spent much time making algorithms smart enough to recognize faces and facial characteristics.", "This popular photo and video social network also wants to attract users with the power of AI, so it has special algorithms to perform specific tasks. First, Instagram app users machine learning to block spam and offensive comments, but this feature can be switched off by a user if they don\u2019t need it. Also, Instagram uses AI to remove fake followers to avoid a large number of fake profiles with bots.", "Thus, Instagram fights with fake likes and users to provide real users with a high-quality and immersive experience.", "This social networking service where people share their news also considers that machine learning is what they need. When users click \u201cShow me the best tweets first\u201d button, they see the algorithmic feed that was created by the development team to provide users with top tweets. This technology makes it possible to evaluate tweets on the basis of a few metrics. Smart algorithms may understand the preferences of customers and show the content interesting specifically for them.", "Also, Twitter fights with trolling using machine learning, it deletes improper and offensive content.", "Apart from this, machine learning algorithms may crop the most interesting part of the image for preview.", "This social web service for images hosting should also know how to provide users with the right content. That is where machine learning algorithms help and become useful. Pinterest acquired Kosei company which specialized in the development of ML algorithms for enhanced content search and better recommendation.", "As a result, Pinterest ML algorithms detect spam, provide users with personalized content, and they are also used for advertising monetization.", "Do you think social networks are the only apps where machine learning is applied? You\u2019re wrong. Salesforce CRM uses machine learning algorithms to analyze customers, their preferences, behavior, and it helps companies build better customer relationships and provide them with a high-quality experience.", "That is what we wanted to tell you. The list of MlaaS platforms is rather large, and you can choose the one that is interesting for you and it can enhance your app and modify it. And if you are not skilled at data science, there are platforms which don\u2019t require such skills. Just make your decision whether you need machine learning in your software or not, and then you will succeed!", "Your home for data science.
