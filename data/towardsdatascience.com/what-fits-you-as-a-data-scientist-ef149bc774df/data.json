But how? Analyzing data, a significant amount of data (so-called big data), trying to understand them and squeeze knowledge and experience, to make decisions and solve problems. For a better understanding of what is the experience in the field of data science and machine learning, please check my introductory article about machine learning and artificial intelligence (link below).", "As a data scientist, the first thing to know is the data lifecycle, which is made of steps.", "Nowadays, data collection is an easy task. Data collection is the action of gathering data from various sources: web pages, news, social media, reports, graphs, tables, etc. are all sources of digital raw data, ready to consume for everyone interested.", "In this field, a good data scientist develops an inherent curiosity about the world; he is data-driven, so he spends enormous amounts of time collecting data to answer the questions of interest. The required skills are:", "Once collected, most of the time, raw data are \u201cmessy\u201d.", "Data cleaning is a complex task, which involves:", "Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a collection of techniques for seeing what the data can tell us. In EDA, we use both mathematical models and common sense to cope with the significance of our data.", "As data scientists, we must know what to expect from the data we collect, have to formulate a hypothesis, and \u201cfill the gap\u201d in what information we have.", "There are many tools to help us:", "It\u2019s worth recalling that, in classical machine learning (ML), this phase of the data lifecycle is up to us, the data scientists. When in deep learning (DL) and even more in reinforcement learning (RL), it is up to the model, the machine, to cope with that. In DL, during the training phase, the algorithm learns the characteristics of data provided and adapt to them. In RL, the environment is, even more, an active part of the learning process.", "Model building is a fundamental part of the ML process. When we create a model, we can then train a machine to learn patterns on our data (training set) to predict unknown or future data.", "In the model building, we try to predict outcomes from the analysis.", "Again, some skills are essential here:", "When our model is ready, and we get good results from the training and test set (training and evaluation stage), it\u2019s time to put it into production. This is the final stage when we get results from data, for business, study, research, or maybe also for fun!", "So far, we talked about the process. But, who\u2019s needed in every step? Let\u2019s clear the concepts and what are the roles involved.", "First of all, let\u2019s summarize all the process with a picture", "As you can see, a data scientist is expected to do everything from data collection to model deployment; he must be aware of the real problems, and he has to know many techniques about every stage of the process. So, the required skills are:", "A data engineer is more focused on data collection and data cleaning. In this position, we must be very expert in database and data query techniques, besides being able in ETL (extract, transform and load) of data from various sources. Then we must know how to clean data, deal with null or inconsistent values and many more techniques to build a strong foundation of sources for the following ML models.", "A data analyst works hard on data cleaning and EDA. He masters statistics, both descriptive than inferential, and is always trying to squeeze every single bit of information from data. His role is crucial for data modeling and to build reliable models that can actually capture the behavior of the environment. In the data science path to knowledge, in my opinion, this can be the first step, and then we can explore other phases of the process.", "A machine learning engineer knows how to get the most out of the data, based on various techniques and ML algorithms; he masters ML models, optimization of hyperparameters, evaluation and metrics, and is on the edge of the latest research in the field. Besides that, he also knows how to scale and deploy models into production systems.", "As you can see, there are many paths to data science. Everyone exciting to be involved in this field, in my opinion, has to be conscious of what could be his journey to a better comprehension of data and machine learning techniques for a new point of view about the reality and what can be his contribution to the progress and the pathway to the future.", "I hope you enjoy this article and feel free to leave a comment and follow me on my future posts here on Medium.
