When I first moved into my apartment, I would stroll randomly along a different route each day, exploring the land, but after a while I became fixated on a zigzag path \u2014 but why?", "Let\u2019s explore why that\u2019s the case, and just how much time we can save by walking in this manner. We\u2019ll perform some basic mathematical modelling and find out what happens in the extreme cases \u2014 let\u2019s get to work!", "When we talk about the distance between two things, we generally talk about either the distance \u2018as the bird flies\u2019 or the Manhattan distance. The former is the direct route to get there, while the latter is the distance if you had to follow along a strict grid pattern. You can see these representations in the graphic below.", "This way of defining distance has many applications from Chess, to pure mathematics to computational biology. You\u2019ll notice one flaw though, real streets have widths.", "Humans are pretty lazy, or, putting it another way, we cut corners. This means that when we\u2019re walking along streets, we will sometimes walk along the diagonal to reduce the total distance walked. This is simply because the distance in cutting a corner is shorter than following the outside of a shape. You can see the simple proof of the Pythagorean Theorem here.", "So if we instead think of the reality of a road with a width, then what is the shortest distance between two points now?", "Of the two extremes, we have the red and blue lines shown in the above diagram, let\u2019s calculate the performance of these on a smaller 2x2 block. We will assume we\u2019re starting in the bottom left outermost corner and want to finish in the top right outermost corner. The width of the road will be w, and the distance between two roads will be l.", "Take note that the shortest route, the green line, can be expressed as:", "First, for the red line, let\u2019s assume we still don\u2019t cut corners. Then the distance measured will be", "Now let\u2019s cut just one corner and head towards to the top left point before making our way to the endpoint.", "This is a little more complicated, but hopefully you can still follow along.", "We can now look at the blue line, which allows us to cut the maximum possible number of corners, resulting in the formula:", "That\u2019s nice, but how do these formulae compare? And how much time can we save?", "In order to calculate that, we\u2019ll need an average length and width of a road. Jumping on Google Maps a measuring around my local neighbourhood with the distance calculator, I found an average length of 55m and width of 3m. I\u2019m sure this varies around the world or even around neighbourhoods, so feel free to try your own numbers.", "Plugging these into our formulae above gives the following results: long red distance=238m, short red distance=232m, blue distance=226m, and optimal distance=168m. This means, that our shortest route will be to cut corners following the blue path, yielding a distance saving of 12m, or, 5%!", "As mentioned at the start of the article, my house is four blocks across and four blocks up from the station, meaning the formula must be adjusted for more blocks. Doing so yields a result of 470m for the longest distance and 447m for the shortest one. This is still a modest saving of 5%, but now equals 23m saved \u2014 and that\u2019s just one way!", "By following the zigzag method, I\u2019m able to save almost 50m each day or 1.5km per month. It might not sound like much, but with the average human walking speed of 5km/h, that\u2019s almost 20 minutes saved per month!", "My block is only four across and four up, but what about bigger blocks? How much saving do we get as we look at bigger and bigger areas?", "Let\u2019s consider what happens to our formulae as the number of blocks, n, increases towards infinity. We must generalise our formula from above to n blocks, giving:", "As n increases, the term on the left becomes insignificant, leaving us with:", "Let\u2019s compare this to what happens with the generalised, worst solution.", "So the ratio between the long distance and the shortest distance we can walk will be:", "Plugging in the numbers for my street gives 5%, quite similar to our earlier calculation with four blocks. This is an interesting result, which tells us that no matter how many blocks we walk, we\u2019ll still only save 5% of the maximum distance.", "However, we can see that different values of widths and the lengths of the road can lead to larger savings. For example, if the roads I walked on were double the width, the savings would be almost 10%.", "This article shows the benefit that cutting corners can have. Not only should we do this in business when it makes sense (especially in startups, imagine a 5% reduction in costs!), we should do it in our personal lives to gain real savings.", "It also shows how simple modelling and estimation can be applied to problems to discover interesting relationships such as the irrelevance of the number of blocks walked to the savings in time.", "Finally, I hope you\u2019ve learnt a thing or two about walking and will think a second longer next time you decide which way to walk home.", "Note: Please be careful when crossing roads in a diagonal manner; I live in a quiet neighbourhood but this behaviour certainly won\u2019t go well on busy streets.
