AI voice assistants can transform speech into a vital sign, enabling early detection and predictions of oncoming conditions. Similar to how temperature is an indicator of fever, vocal biomarkers can provide us with a more complete picture of our health.", "One in four people globally will be affected by major or minor mental health issues at some point in their lives. Around 450 million people currently suffer from conditions such as anxiety, stress, depression, or others, placing mental health among the leading cause of ill-health worldwide. Many of these issues are preventable if detected and treated early, however, nearly two-thirds of people with ill-health do not seek nor receive appropriate help.", "Spoken communication encodes a wealth of information. Only recently has research and technology intersected to enable the use of our own voice to be one of the most effective biomarkers of health.", "\u201cThink about how much precision and coordination of muscles and brain regions are involved to produce voice, and various diseases can subtly or acutely affect one\u2019s voice and use of language.\u201d", "\u2014 Dr. Ghomi, UW Memory and Brain Wellness Center", "Scientific research is validating voice as a biomarker. Some key findings:", "Vocal biomarkers are medical signs coming from features in our voice, similar to other biomarkers like pulse and blood pressure. Capturing and analyzing subtle changes in our voice: pitch, intensity, vocal tract coordination, jitters, shimmers, tremors, pauses, etc., creates a range of health measurements that provide a more complete picture of our health in seconds.", "Today a higher concentration of technology, products, and services focuses on physical health. But what about mental health \u2014 arguably the more foundational aspect of our overall wellbeing? AI voice assistant technology, such as Siri, Alexa, or Google, can change healthcare by opening a new window into the health of our minds.", "Acoustic changes happen when changes in health occur. These acoustic features can predict conditions such as emotional states, moods, stress, anxiety, depression, dementia, concussions, heart disease, and more. Due to the vast amounts of data, AI and machine learning can detect and analyze these vocal features better than the human year.", "AI voice assistants can prompt different types of speech-eliciting tasks. For example, at the start of the day Siri asks, \u201cI noticed you have a lot of meetings today, how are you feeling?\u201d or towards the end of the day Siri asks, \u201cHow was your day today?\u201d Similar to how Apple Watch alerts a person when irregular heart rhythm is detected, once speech is captured, Siri can utilize machine learning to analyze voice responses and provide meaningful recommendations. Early detection of health issues could save lives.", "Successful implementation of voice as a biomarker requires natural conversation. AI voice assistant\u2019s personified and familiar experience makes engagement and capturing high-quality speech more effective than an app. The process of opening an app every time may lead to unnatural conversation, low-quality acoustic features, and cause user drop-offs. Users may also see it as \u201canother wellness app\u201d. With AI, users can speak more openly and conveniently during moments of real need, such as in emotional states.", "The success of this product can be measured in three main areas:", "2. Engagement with the AI voice assistant and health ecosystem", "The initial target customers can be those who already engage with AI voice assistants multiple times per day, thus minimizing additional behavior change. Accuracy can be improved by reducing scope. For example, to iPhone and English speaking users in California so that there is low variation in the experience and vocal accents. If possible, target users who encounter stressful situations, such as asking the AI voice assistant to tell someone they are running late.", "AI should not be a replacement for health professionals. Rather, it is a tool that amplifies the clinician\u2019s capabilities. Some use cases include:", "Customers who will benefit most are those already at-risk. The AI voice assistant must focus on accessibility for people with conditions such as speech, visual, auditory, motor, or other impairments, and be exceptionally user friendly to those less comfortable with technology and support languages worldwide. To achieve long-term global benefits, using voice as a biomarker can extend beyond mental health and into overall health.", "Health is a high impact, high sensitivity space. Prioritization of which area to build for first can be based on these variables:", "Emotion and mood is an ideal starting point because it can provide a user with daily value, is not a severe health issue in comparison to others, and voice datasets for machine learning models and meaningful recommendations for overcoming emotional states are readily available. The roadmap would focus first on mental health areas, then expand into general health.", "A quick way to test would be forming an internal test group and control group. The experiment would be performed manually. Nothing happens for the control group. For the test group:", "We also want to ensure participant diversity, privacy, the comfort of being honest, and possibly deleting all responses once the experiment is complete.", "In parallel, partner with institutions currently researching this field and run a similar, more scientific experiment. If outcomes demonstrate success, we can then justify building automated and sophisticated features. Each experiment allows us to collect more data, optimize the experience, improve the algorithms and recommendations, and lay the foundation to roll out to real users.", "Machine learning models are only as good as the data we feed it. From the start, we must ensure that the data is fair, diverse, and representative. We may control scope by focusing on cultural regions in stages, such as American accents first, but we must keep data quality top of mind. This includes population diversity in culture, language, gender, life stages, and various mental and physical characteristics. We should involve customer experience teams early on to review and ensure datasets are fair and diverse.", "User privacy cannot be sacrificed. To ensure privacy, store personal data locally, and continuously improve the models that can be updated separately.", "Great rewards come with obstacles to navigate. An organization will need to think and act carefully to mitigate risk:", "There are promising companies in this space making advancements in AI voice technology:", "The first-mover in this space would disrupt the health tech industry by reclassifying voice as biometric data. Research and startups already support this movement. Instead of competing directly on existing virtual assistant tasks, the first-mover can leapfrog the competition by owning the AI voice assistant health space. With so much new and meaningful data, startups may sprout in this field and build alongside the ecosystem. This would be a win for the company and for global health.", "Unlocking health through conversations with devices we already use is a revolution in healthcare. For a company, improving AI voice assistants to enrich our health means increased customer satisfaction, better product engagement, and can increase customer lifetime value. For society, the ability to recognize early signs of health issues through our voices is a transformative step in moving reactive to preventive healthcare. The future sounds bright and the opportunity for this technology to make a meaningful impact in our daily lives is just beginning.", "Your home for data science.
