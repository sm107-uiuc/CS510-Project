Businesses are collecting ever-increasing volumes of data and the question of how to derive value from this asset is becoming something of a business obsession.", "We\u2019re entering a new world in which data may be more important than software.\u201d , Tim O\u2019Reilly, founder, O\u2019Reilly Media", "The vast majority of enterprise data is still stored as rows and columns in databases and SQL (Structured Query Language) is the language that enables a business to extract, transform and load this data. SQL is, therefore, the very foundation on which any value-adding data products are developed.", "I am in the middle of running an online SQL course for complete beginners. The program that I have put together uses existing free online resources that I coach my students through via weekly video calls. In this article, I wanted to share with you the five best free resources that we have used so far to learn SQL during the course.", "SQLBolt is a completely free fully interactive introductory course. All SQL basics are covered including writing queries, filtering, joins, aggregations in addition to creating, updating and deleting tables.", "There are practical exercises to complete after each concept is introduced which help to solidify your understanding of the topics covered.", "The Khan Academy Intro to SQL course is a great complement to SQLBolt as it includes video-based content around similar concepts. This provides some useful context and more in-depth explanations. It also does include some practical interactive exercises too.", "Pop SQL is actually a really interesting tool for collaborative SQL querying. It enables multiple users to share queries, store commonly used queries in a searchable library and provides a visual interface for analysis.", "The Pop SQL website also includes a comprehensive library of SQL tutorials in their \u2018Learn SQL\u2019 section. What is particularly useful is that these are organised by database type, for example, Redshift or MySQL specific tutorials. This is helpful if you want to gain an understanding of how the syntax can differ across platforms.", "This course is similar in format to SQLBolt. It is very interactive with lots of practical exercises which you complete in their SQL editor. There is also a sqlcourse2.com which covers more advanced concepts using the same format and editor.", "If you would like to get a more in-depth understanding of the SQL language then a book can be a useful addition to your list of resources. Learning SQL by Alan Beaulieu is one of the best I have found and is available to read for free online via this PDF.", "This book gives some useful background into the origins and usage of the language, provides an overview of query and table design and covers some more advanced SQL topics compared to the courses listed above.", "The older programming languages such as SQL are still very much in demand in today's business world. Fortunately, SQL is one of the simplest languages to learn and as I have found from running my course, people from many different backgrounds can pick up this skill relatively quickly for free through online learning.", "I send out a monthly newsletter if you would like to join please sign up via this link.
