Prices change rapidly and is rather common to see the price moving side-ways for hours before being pumped or dumped 5\u201320% in a matter of minutes. While long-term trading strategies may be still profitable while ignoring the intra-day volatility, any strategy in the middle or short term (not to mention high-frequency trading) will necessarily have to address the issue of volatility in one way or another.", "In the following plot we analyze the volatility of the Bitcoin-US dollar pair since March 2013 until April 2019 for the Bitfinex exchange (data obtained from CryptoDatum.io) using 5-minute candlesticks. Specifically we show: (1) the histogram of absolute price changes (calculated as percentage of change of the close price respect the open price), (2) the proportion of candles at the right of the histogram from a specific point (red line) and (3) the proportion of total amount of price change produced by the candles at the right (green line).", "What we can conclude from point 1 is that time-based candlesticks clearly over-sample periods of low activity (activity understood as price change). In other words, in 70% of the candlesticks nothing is really going on so the question is: if we want to train a ML-based algorithm, do we need all these candles where no change is observed? Would finding a way to remove or discard most of the meaningless candles be useful to enrich our datasets?", "Time-based candlesticks over-sample low activity periods and under-sample high activity periods", "On the other hand, points 2 and 3 indicate that most of the price changes happen in a few percentage of candlesticks suggesting that time-based candlesticks under-sample high activity periods. What this means is that if price changes 10% in 5 minutes and we are using 5-minute candlesticks, our algorithm will not be able to see anything happening in between the opening and the closing of the time-based candlestick, potentially missing a good trading opportunity. Therefore, ideally we would like to find a way to sample more candles whenever market activity increases and sample less candles when the market activity decreases.", "The main reason why we are using time-based candlesticks is because we humans live embedded in time and, therefore, time is something we find tremendously convenient to organize ourselves and to synchronize our biological rhythms with. Furthermore, the sunlight cycle is of utmost importance for humans because it determines the awake-asleep cycle, which is of biological relevance for our survival. As a consequence of the daylight cycle, traditional stock exchanges still open at 9:30 AM (so that actual humans can trade while they are awake) and close at 4 PM (so that traders can sleep in peace \u2014 but\u2026 do they?).", "With the advent of technology, automatic trading bots have started to displace real human traders and, particularly in cryptocurrencies, markets no longer follow the daylight cycle since they remain open 24/7. In these circumstances, does it make sense to keep using time-based candlesticks, a mere standard, consequence of human convenience? L\u00f3pez de Prado, summarizes it well in his book Advances in Financial Machine Learning:", "Although time bars are perhaps the most popular among practitioners and academics, they should be avoided. [\u2026] Markets do not process information at a constant time interval. [\u2026] As biological beings, it makes sense for humans to organize their day according to the sunlight cycle. But today\u2019s markets are operated by algorithms that trade with loose human supervision, for which CPU processing cycles are much more relevant than chronological intervals", "The reason why most good trading algorithms are a well kept secret is because money is made when from an out-of-equilibrium situation we can anticipate going to another equilibrium. And, generally speaking, equilibrium means everyone is already aware of what\u2019s going on and there are enough positive and negative forces to keep the newly reached equilibrium in balance.", "In order to anticipate a change in equilibrium we must be contrarian and correct at the same time: this is, we must know something that the rest doesn\u2019t know and be correct in our assertion. We must find out-of-equilibria that the majority of other traders are unaware of, otherwise we would be already in equilibrium again. It is often referred to as \u201czero-sum\u201d game, although I don\u2019t particularly like this definition.", "Everyone\u2019s data is no one\u2019s advantage", "In order to be contrarian, we must look at the data and analyze it in new creative ways that allow us to gain a certain advantage respect the others. Here\u2019s when small details such as the type of data we use to train our algorithms can make a big difference. In practice, this means that if everyone uses time-based candle-sticks, why would we use the same as everyone else? If a minoritarian \u2014 better \u2014 alternative may exist, why would we still use time-based candlesticks?", "Few times I felt more enlightened than after reading the first chapters of de Prado\u2019s book Advances in Financial Machine Learning. In his book, this experienced fund manager reveals common practices and mathematical tools he has been using to manage multimillionaire funds for more than 20 years. Particularly, he knows from first hand that the behavior of markets has changed dramatically over the years and that competing with trading bots is rather the rule than the exception. In this context, de Prado describes a number of alternative types of candlesticks that aim to replace the traditional time-based candlesticks and that bring the necessary creativity and novelty to the financial space.", "Here are some examples of alternative candlesticks or bars proposed by de Prado:", "In future posts I will analyze each of the alternative candlesticks described in the book. We will look at how to build them, we will compare their statistical properties, such as normality and serial correlation, with traditional candlesticks and we will analyze how exactly these bars overcome the shortcomings of traditional candlesticks.", "Thanks for reading, more content is coming up so stay tuned!", "Would you like to try the alternative bars we mentioned in the article by yourself?
