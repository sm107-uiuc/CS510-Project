I shared my journey through YouTube and my blog. I had no idea what I was doing. I\u2019d never coded before but decided I wanted to learn machine learning.", "When people find my work, they sometimes reach out and ask questions. I don\u2019t have all the answers but I reply to as many as I can. The most common question I get is \u201cwhere do I start?\u201d The next most common question is \u201chow much math do I need to know?\u201d", "I replied to a handful of these questions this morning.", "Someone told me they\u2019d started learning Python and wanted to get into machine learning but didn\u2019t know what to do next.", "I\u2019ve learned Python, what should I do next?", "I put together a couple of steps in the reply and I\u2019m copying them here. You can consider them a rough outline to go from not knowing how to code to being a machine learning practitioner.", "My style of learning is code first. Get code running first and learn the theory, math, statistics and probability side of things when you need to, not before.", "Remember, if you\u2019re starting to learn machine learning, it can be daunting. There\u2019s a lot. Take your time. Bookmark this article so you can refer to it as you go.", "I\u2019m biased towards using Python because that\u2019s what I started with and continue to use. You could use something else but these steps will be for Python.", "The email said they\u2019d already done some Python. But this step is for someone who\u2019s completely new as well. Spend a few months learning Python code at the same time as different machine learning concepts. You\u2019ll need them both.", "Whilst learning Python code, practice using data science tools such as Jupyter and Anaconda. Spend a few hours tinkering with them, what they\u2019re for and why you should use them.", "Once you\u2019ve got some Python skills, you\u2019ll want to learn how to work with and manipulate data.", "To do so, you should get familiar with pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib.", "pandas will help you work with dataframes, these are tables of information like you would see in an Excel file. Think rows and columns. This kind of data is called structured data.", "NumPy will help you perform numerical operations on your data. Machine learning turns everything you can think of into numbers and then finds the patterns in those numbers.", "Matplotlib will help you make graphs and visualizations of your data. Understanding a pile of numbers in a table can be hard for humans. We much prefer seeing a graph with a line going through it. Making visualizations is a big part of communicating your findings.", "Now you\u2019ve got skills to manipulate and visualize data, it\u2019s time to find patterns in it.", "scikit-learn is a Python library with many helpful machine learning algorithms built-in ready for you to use.", "It also features many other helpful functions to figure out how well your learning algorithm learned.", "Focus on learning what kind of machine learning problems there are, such as, classification and regression, and what kind of algorithms are best for those. Don\u2019t about understanding each algorithm from scratch yet, learn how to apply them first.", "Deep learning and neural networks work best on data without much structure.", "Dataframes have structure, images, videos, audio files and natural language text have structure but not as much.", "Tidbit: For most cases, you\u2019ll want to use an ensemble of decision trees (Random Forests or an algorithm like XGBoost) for structured data and you\u2019ll want to use deep learning or transfer learning (taking a pre-trained neural network and using it on your problem) for unstructured data.", "You could start a note with little tidbits like this for yourself and collect them as you go.", "Along the way, it would be ideal if you practised what you were learning with small projects of your own. These don\u2019t have to be elaborate world-changing things but something you can say \u201cI\u2019ve done this with X\u201d. And then share your work via Github or a blog post. Github is used to showcase your code, a blog post is used to show how you can communicate your work. You should aim to release one of each for every project.", "The best way to apply for a job is to have already done the things it requires. Sharing your work is a great way to showcase to a potential future employer what you\u2019re capable of.", "After you\u2019re familiar using some of the different frameworks for machine learning and deep learning, you could try to cement your knowledge by building them from scratch. You won\u2019t always have to do this in production or in a machine learning role but knowing how things work from the inside will help you build upon your own work.", "You could spend 6-months or more on each. Don\u2019t rush. Learning new things takes time. The main skill you are building as a data scientist or machine learning engineer is how to ask good questions of data then using your tools to try and find answers.", "Some days you\u2019ll feel like you\u2019re learning nothing. Even going backwards. Ignore it. Don\u2019t compare your progress day to day. Compare your progress year on year.", "I\u2019ve listed some resources above, they\u2019re all available online and most of them are free but there are plenty more.", "DataCamp is a great place to do most of these. Otherwise, my Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence resources database contains a good archive of free and paid learning materials.", "Remember, part of being a data scientist or machine learning engineer is solving problems. Treat your first assignment as finding out more about each of the steps here and creating your own curriculum to help you learn them.", "If you want to know what an example self-lead curriculum for machine learning looks like, check out my Self-Created AI Masters Degree. It\u2019s what I used to go from zero coding to being a machine learning engineer in 9-months. It\u2019s not perfect but it\u2019s mine, that\u2019s why it worked.", "You will learn these things along the way. Start with code first. Get things running. Trying to learn all of the statistics, all of the math, all of the probability before running your code is like trying to boil the ocean. It will hold you back.", "None of the statistics, math and probability matter if your code doesn\u2019t run. Get something working, and then use your research skills to find out if it\u2019s correct.", "Certifications are nice but you\u2019re not after them. You\u2019re after skills.", "Don\u2019t make the mistake I did and think more certifications equals more skills. They don\u2019t.", "Build foundational knowledge through courses and resources like the above and then build specific knowledge (knowledge which can\u2019t be taught) through your own projects.", "If you have questions, leave a comment below so others can see. Otherwise, feel free to reach out. Affiliate links have been used where possible, read more about who I\u2019m partnered with here.", "You can find the video version of this article on YouTube.", "Your home for data science.
