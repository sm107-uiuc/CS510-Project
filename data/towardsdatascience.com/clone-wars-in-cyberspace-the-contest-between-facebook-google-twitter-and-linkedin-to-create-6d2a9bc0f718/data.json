["Written with Dr Edwina Luck, Senior Lecturer QUT Business School, Advertising, Marketing and Public Relations.", "Do you ever wonder if you have a doppelg\u00e4nger? A twin? Someone with the same DNA as you? It\u2019s an interesting question that probably belongs in a Sci Fi movie or book. A concept from Blade Runner 2049 and not our reality in 2019. But many people don\u2019t realise there\u2019s a very good chance they have a double. In the wars to conquer cyberspace, an algorithm on Facebook, Google, Twitter and/or LinkedIn (coming soon) may have created the perfect replica of you.", "Cloning people online isn\u2019t anything new. Facebook, Google and Twitter have been competing with each other in creating look-alike audiences on their advertising platforms for years. Facebook Ads announced the release of their Lookalike Audiences feature in March 2013, and Twitter Ads rolled out their Tailored Audiences (a pretty similar feature) in December of the same year. Then, Google Ads also copied Facebook and released their Customer Match feature in 2015. In January, LinkedIn announced they were working on lookalike audiences, one of the key features of Facebook\u2019s ad platform.", "Look-alike audiences are created by a predictive analytics method called look-alike modelling, which uses machine learning to predict future outcomes based on current and historical data. For example, machine learning can forecast the actions of customers based on what they buy, when they buy, and even what they post on social media. Facebook offers a free 15-minute course to help advertisers learn when and how to use Lookalike audiences, even though some of their prediction methods were found to be very similar to those used by the shady Cambridge Analytica (who helped Donald Trump win the 2016 US Presidential Election). Likewise, Google is putting machine learning into the hands of every advertiser and Twitter is using machine learning to show the best Tweets for you first.", "However, there\u2019s a distinct lack of transparency about how these companies do look-alike modelling and that\u2019s why it\u2019s often not very well understood. According to Qiang Ma, Musen Wen, Zhen Xia and Datong Chen who developed a look-alike system at Yahoo! that outperforms other methods by more than 50%, the systems used in online advertising can be categorised into three types:", "A straightforward method that finds lookalikes by comparing seed users (ex. your customers) with available users (ex. Facebook users who aren\u2019t your customers) in pairs to judge which user is preferred, or has a greater amount of some quantitative property, or whether or not the two users are identical. Likeness is calculated with distance measures, which are machine learning algorithms in python (the programming language, not the snake) for measuring similarity.", "A statistical method that finds lookalikes based on Logistic Regression, a machine learning classification algorithm that is used to predict the probability of an event occurring. In the regression-based system, the goal of the algorithm is to predict whether seed users (ex. bank customers) will perform the desired outcome (ex. sign up for a term deposit) based on previous data (ex. their age, job, marital status etc).", "A segmentation method that finds lookalikes by creating segments based on user characteristics such as interest categories. For example, if a user likes NBA games, the user is considered as belonging to the Sports segment. The general idea of the segment approximation-based system is to find available users that \u201cshare\u201d as many of the top segments with seed users as possible.", "Articles from experienced independent scientists are probably the easiest way to see machine learning\u2019s powers of prediction in action. In their tutorial, How Did We Build Book Recommender Systems in An Hour Part 2 \u2014 k Nearest Neighbors and Matrix Factorization, senior data scientist Susan Li developed a system to find clusters of similar people on Amazon based on common book ratings and to predict other books they would be interested in.", "Susan Li\u2019s system combines K-Nearest Neighbors, an algorithm that assumes similar things exist close to each other, and Matrix Factorization, a collaborative filtering technique based on the principle that people who share the same interest in a certain kind of items will also share the same interest in some other kind of items. Results of the experiment indicate Li\u2019s book recommendation system was more accurate than Amazon\u2019s, as all of its suggestions were horror novels. In the image below you may notice that Amazon recommended 6 horror novels by Steven King together with a science fiction comedy novel by Douglas Adams, and this combination could have seemed strange to horror story fans.", "As for the future of lookalike audiences in ad targeting, that\u2019s also unclear. Perhaps these worldwide patents on Determining user personality characteristics from social networking system communications and characteristics from Facebook and Hierarchical behavioural profile from Google provide a few clues on which direction they will be taking.", "Your home for data science.
