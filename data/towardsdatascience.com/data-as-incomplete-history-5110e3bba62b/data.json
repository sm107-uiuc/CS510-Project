Just look around and ask yourself how much of the things you are tasting, seeing, touching, smelling, or hearing are generating data that is being collected. In all likelihood, the answer is that almost none of them are. This is easy to forget given how much data now exists, however, by taking a look at where we have been we can better illuminate where we are today, and where we are not.", "To illustrate the point I will look at the job of historians. The goal of historians is to attempt to understand and explain what has happened, sometimes with an additional aim to inform what is happening and or even help to predict what will happen. The starting point, though, is the past as you can\u2019t know hope to know what will happen if you don\u2019t know what has happened.", "While historians are not known for being particularly data savvy, they make extensive use of historical data to achieve their goals. Further, in using this data historians understand the limitation of it. The data of history, or the traces of information, digital or otherwise, of the things that have occurred in the past, is incomplete at best and irrelevant or false at worst.", "While there has been a drastic increase in the collection of data over the last 100 years or so, and particularly in the last 20 years, there is still much that goes uncollected, a fact that historians know well. In fact, much of their craft has been developed to work around this fact.", "In many ways, the craft of a Historian is to develop and deploy techniques to understand past events despite a lack of quality historical data. As an undergraduate history major I remember being pressed to make sure that my papers be mostly constructed off of primary sources: \u201cmaterials that contain direct evidence, first-hand information from a person who witnessed or participated in an event.\u201d Secondary sources which \u201cuse primary source data to analyze an event or solve a research problem\u201d were seen as interpretations of perceptions and often more trouble than they we worth. \u201cGo to the raw source material when you can\u201d my professors insisted.", "The entire framework was indicative of just how much happens in the interpretation of the data and how much of the data itself is just the collected interpretations of events. Those interpretations, the primary sources, are built off human perception, with its many biases and errors. These are then embedded in the data itself. To make sense of it all requires historians to apply additional layers of interpretation on the data creating new secondary sources in the process.", "For some historians, this is not just some data problem, it is a reflection of reality. As Michael J. Kramer eloquently wrote:", "Whether the data challenges are more reflective of how the data is being collected or the world it is collected on, historians have deployed countless techniques to adapt to the data realities of history. Some focus on histories that are more data rich and thus more amenable to compelling narratives \u2014 look here, (another) History of World War II, the History of Salt, the History of Coffee, the History of History. Others focus on histories that are so data poor or so under-studied that almost any data or narrative is seen as additive to our understanding of the subject. And then there are biographies of historical figures. And while Niall Ferguson may be correct that, \u201cThe vantage point of the individual is in many ways the authentic vantage point of historical study\u201d there are still a few too many biographies in my opinion, especially because they are so often about the same people.", "As an undergraduate History major I tried to get around these data challenges by mostly focusing on intellectual histories, devoting my time to understanding the historical context in which great works were written, including those of Dostoevsky, Camus, Hegel, and others. In this way I could anchor my research on what these individuals wrote. In most instances there was minimal debate about that and the data was easy to get at. I simply had to read their writings. I then spent some time reading their personal experiences, where they were born and lived, who they interacted with, etc. This data mostly consisted of basic facts enriched by letters or public speeches. Then I would try to gain a basic understanding of the broader societal context in which they lived and wrote \u2014 the wars going on, the major scientific discoveries, the political circumstances. The last step was to put it all together into some semi-coherent narrative.", "At its core, my strategy was about doing what I could given the data realities. I had limited access to any non-digital primary source data, no travel budget, and limited language skills. When I could get my hands on primary sources, they were frequently tedious to read or read like the eye-witness testimony of someone who had been paid off (or threatened) by mobsters of their time.", "Shifting to the structure of the data, even if the written perceptions of a given person were relatively accurate, from a data perspective the primary and secondary sources are still largely unstructured text. Moreover, many of the most important texts were not, and still are not, digital. Again as an undergraduate I remember spending several weeks doing research at The Newberry Library in Chicago and there was an area of the library with manuscripts, texts, books, etc. that you needed special permission to even look at. At the time I focused my research efforts elsewhere as the effort to figure out what texts were available and then how I would go from controlled reading room to final paper was more than I wanted to take on.", "When you can get access to the unstructured texts that exists, digital or not, the data is difficult to work with and derive meaning from. Although there are some historians who have started building off of the developments in fields like Computational Linguistics and Natural Language Processing, these techniques are still nascent for complex language and particularly complex language from hundreds of years ago and potentially in many different languages.", "Unfortunately, most historians must still rely on brut force methods to try to get around these data challenges: they read. Like many other fields they also specialize, which can be helpful for anchoring what they read because despite our best efforts and coffee, humans aren\u2019t really designed for deploying bruce force methods. We are slow and we don\u2019t actually process the information very effectively.", "Yet, even when they read extensively and specialize appropriately, the documents themselves can be very limited in scope. While Historians may not say it very often, the phrase, \u201cHistory is written by the victors\u201d comes to mind. Implied in this statement is that the histories of the \u2018losers\u2019 are omitted from historical records, or at least harder to find. While this is not always true, and there are countless examples of history being written by the bureaucrats \u2014 the Domesday Book is great example here (even if it was subsidized by the victors) \u2014 as well as the losers, with letters home, counter-stories, and on, the idea is that most histories are informed by the written perceptions of people experiencing the moment in question. This requires a writer and writers historically tend to be overrepresented by certain groups (well-educated, white men in particular).", "Even if we could identify and leverage all of the relevant writings for a particular era, digging deeply into archives and random sources to identify all the things that have ever been written at a certain place in time so, so much is left out. The vast majority of humans in history did not leave behind written works. Their perceptions are simply lost. And those that did write, or were written about, only wrote a certain amount and about certain things.", "Human experience, which itself is only a fraction of all that has happened \u2014 unless you think, of course, that something must be perceived to have actually happened \u2014 only produces an extremely limited set of data. Most all of what we have perceived and experienced has gone uncollected and that remains true today. If you aren\u2019t convinced, let\u2019s take a quick look at the Italian economy.", "The amount of human experience collected as data has, of course, changed as time has gone on. The last 100 years or so has brought in a relative avalanche of data that can be used for modern histories and future histories. A quick look at Italy, a country relatively rich in historical data, provides a good example of the scale of the difference. It also illustrates how little data actually exists, even today.", "If you go back 2,000 years ago to a time when the Roman Empire was a force in Europe in a way that Italy is not today (sorry Italy), the data story is bleak. While Roman architecture is in relatively good condition and remains scattered around Europe, using data to understand something as basic as the economy of the Roman Empire is surprisingly difficult.", "Peter Temin, a Professor of Economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) summarized this challenge in his paper on the The Economy of the Early Roman Empire:", "Compare this to a hypothetical future \u2018The Economy of Italy During the Early European Union\u2019: A historian in this instance would have an almost limitless set of data to work from. For example, as of this writing Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Union, currently makes more than 4,600 datasets on European society available online. It even supplies infographs where non-technical users can easily generate graphs on all manners of the Italian Economy.", "In layering Italian Debt data and GDP data we can see that in the last 10 years gross debt has risen as a percentage of GDP, meaning that Italy as a country is more and more in debt. According to an unnamed EU official, this debt, combined with Recently proposed near-term budget priorities means, \u201cItaly, and the euro zone with it, are sleepwalking into a next crisis\u201d. This current debt/future budgeting is happening within the context of the 2018 Italian General Election where the anti-establishment Five-Star Movement and the right-wing League party were the big winners.", "This is just some basic and easily accessible data I found with a few searches. For a proper future historian there is So. Much. Data.", "Remembering my history professors, however, I must ask how much of this would be properly viewed a primary source data: How much of it is direct evidence and how much is second-hand or summary? Taking a more critical look at the data I reference above, much of it is actually better described as secondary source information, not primary source data.", "For example, GDP \u2014 the estimated total value of all goods and services produced within an economy each year \u2014 is nothing more than the attempted quantification of an idea developed by Economists about one hundred years ago to help drive government decision-making on things like taxes and war spending. It is generally calculated \u201cin three (theoretically equivalent) ways: by adding up all the money spent each year, by adding up all the money earned each year, or by adding up all the value added each year.\u201d It is useful for driving government policy, but it is not the factual measurement of a thing. As if to emphasize the point, the Annual GDP aggregates provided by Eurostat include an almost 6,000 word metadata reference document for anyone looking to better understand how the aggregates are generated. From the perspective of my old history courses, GDP looks much more like a secondary source.", "If we try to dig down into the primary sources the aggregation is built off we find that the lowest levels we tend to get down to are industry or regional aggregations. To get to primary source data we have to go all the way to the actual transactions \u2014 the sum of money spent by individuals and organizations each day for the entire year. Maybe banks will someday expose this kind of information about individuals, however, I\u2018m not sure. Our future historian may find it as difficult to get at that data as it was for Professor Temin to get written transaction records from Roman times.", "For the sake of argument let\u2019s assume that future historians will be able to get transaction records at the individual level, or something like it. This should theoretically allow us develop an individual GDP. Yet, if I look at my own spending patterns it is a mixture of direct payments, cash withdrawals (who knows where that money goes), credit card payments, and on. Some of my spending is on behalf of my wife or my daughters, or for a friend.", "And what if I worked in a cash-intensive business, or participated in the informal economy, exchanging services for goods such as how an au pair will watch the kids in exchange for lodging? Or what if wanted to hide my spending, or used businesses as fronts for money coming in or going out? Or maybe, knowing that there are fewer opportunities for employment in my hometown what if I spend part of the year working abroad?", "If even a few of these factors were present much individual-level data would be uncollected, missing significant levels spending. Further, the data that is collected would probably be misleading or even purposefully false. Turning back to Italy, all of these factors are present, and many more.", "So, while a future historian could probably say a lot more about the Italian Economy During the Early EU than a current historian could say about the Roman Economy, it is not obvious that this will be accompanied by a deeper understanding. In many ways much of the most relevant human experiences still go uncollected as data and much of the so-called data is so abstracted from the core experience that it is hard to know how it even maps to human experience. As one Newcastle woman reportedly responded to dire warnings about a potential drop in GDP if Leave won the 2016 Brexit Referendum, \u201cThat\u2019s your bloody GDP, not ours.\u201d", "Empowering humans to better use data and avoid being used by it.
