In 2004, early investor John Doerr introduced the young company to \u201cObjectives and Key Results\u201d (OKRs). What has followed is a miraculous tale of growth and innovation. Larry Page, Google\u2019s long-time CEO, argues that OKRs had a substantial impact on the companies success. Google isn\u2019t alone \u2014 Amazon, Zalando, and Intel use OKRs to this day.", "First, this article explains how OKRs work. Second, it aims to convince Data Scientists to use OKRs to steer their projects. Often enough, Data Scientists drift into enduring research or optimizing less-valuable metrics. As a result, time and resources are wasted, which endanger a successful delivery. OKRs provide strategic guidance and measurability, which help you achieve your project goal.", "The content is based on the book \u201cMeasure What Matters\u201d by famous Venture Capitalist John Doerr and personal experience with OKRs. Let\u2019s learn. \ud83d\udcd7", "\u201cA goal properly set is halfway reached.\u201d \u2014 Zig Ziglar", "Goal-setting is arguably the most important step to start any project. While research isn\u2019t clear on the benefits of proper goal-setting, we can deduct the advantages and disadvantages. If we fail to state a clear goal, co-workers cannot collaborate, actions are not aligned and we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ve reached the goal. In short, havoc looms.", "Accordingly, every Data Science project aims to fulfill a goal. The breadth of goals might vary from researching a new model to creating a prototype for improving an existing system. Even so, accurate goal-setting is paramount for Data Science projects. Data Science projects are well-suited for accurate goal-setting because we can compare the results of our model with the required metric.", "Let\u2019s explore the Intel-pioneered and Google-perfected method for goal-setting \u2014 OKRs.", "Objectives and Key Results is the method to transparently align and prioritize resources towards a common goal. The approach was established by Intel\u2019s legendary CEO Andy Grove in the 1980\u2019s. OKRs can be used on a company, team, project or personal level by both corporations and organizations. OKRs are widely used to align strategic initiatives across companies in Silicon Valley and Europe.", "OKRs are set at the beginning of the project and define the end-goal. Find below an example of personal OKRs from Rick Klau, who worked at Blogger after they got acquired by Google:", "You can see that Rick declared the Objective to be \u201cImprove Blogger\u2019s Reputation\u201d along with measurable Key Results. At the end of each quarter, these Key Results are graded from 0 to 1.", "Objectives are the \u201cWhat\u201d. What is the goal of the project? They\u2026", "Key Results are the \u201cHow\u201d. How do we reach the project goal? They\u2026", "According to John Doerr, the OKR framework offers four distinct superpowers.", "OKRs transparently align the work of employees towards a committed objective. OKRs are measurable and are evaluated at the end of each quarter. OKRs are successful when 70% of the key results are achieved. This nudges employees to aim high.", "Next, let\u2019s explore how we can use the power of OKRs for Data Science projects.", "Andrew Ng, the famous AI-pioneer, teaches in his Deep Learning Specialization that every Data Science project should start with defining a measurable metric. The goal of the project is to fulfill this metric. This goal steers the actions of your project.", "Metrics like accuracy, precision and recall, or F1-score are common Data Science metrics. Each metrics offers distinct advantages and disadvantages depending on your business case. Accuracy might not be the best metric when you have a highly imbalanced dataset. Would you compare your algorithm to Human-level performance? How important is detection speed?", "Pick the most meaningful metric to define whether you\u2019ve solved the business case or not. Analyzing the pros and cons of each metric is beyond the scope of this article, but you can read more about it here. Defining the key metric will prevent you from doing research while you should create a prototype or continuing to solve an issue when the metric has been already been reached.", "After defining the key metric, we are closer to defining our Data Science OKRs. In many projects, it makes sense that the key metric is a part of the Objective. It shows where we want to go. Next, we need to define Key Results to display how to reach the goal.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re working in the automotive industry. You identify the need to detect pedestrians in an urban surrounding to warn truck drivers. You decide to develop a driver-assistance function for trucks to identify pedestrians accurately. The truck chassis shakes heavily, hence general pedestrian detection models don\u2019t work well enough. The team agrees that a 98% detection rate is a proper stretch-goal for the first quarter.", "Next, you decide that you need a data set with at least 10.000 labeled images. You will need time to do research and to implement a first prototype. Lastly, you need time and resources to iterate until you reach the goal. Let\u2019s transform the information into OKRs.", "These OKRs guide your work on the pedestrian detection project in the next quarter. You review your OKRs at the end. Did you manage to achieve your key results? If you missed them, how so?", "Applying the OKR method to your Data Science project will keep you on track for successful project delivery.", "Every Data Science project is different. However, all projects start with setting a goal. Set your Data Science project up for success through using OKRs. \ud83c\udfaf", "Your home for data science.
