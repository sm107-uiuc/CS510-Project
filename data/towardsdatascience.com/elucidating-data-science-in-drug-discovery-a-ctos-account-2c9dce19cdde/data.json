Research Scientists at the world\u2019s best medical schools, labs, and pharmaceutical companies are driving these experiments and studies. All of it comes at a huge cost, we\u2019re talking in of billions of dollars here.", "This also provides us with a vast variety of areas that we need to optimize \u2014 cost, time, administrative work, legal compliance, processing of huge amounts of data from experiments and trials. We have several companies emerging in each sector. For example, Elucidata is one such company that is enabling labs at various medical schools and pharmaceutical companies with their product called Polly. It provides you with various capabilities to harness the power of biomedical data using analytical applications and research workflows.", "Here are a few areas where AI is being used aggressively and has yielded promising results so far\u2026", "There is a great deal of hype around machine learning and algorithms that are being presented to fund research programs or getting approvals from the FDA. Funding for AI in healthcare is in its golden period, we have numerous startups that have emerged to solve a wide gamut of problems. They have tapped almost every area of healthcare, spinning from reducing the administrative scut work to developing new drugs.", "Healthcare is stitched with a lot of operational and administrative work and investors are funding a good number of companies that are trying to streamline these tasks. We have companies emerging that are trying to upend processes that have been happening but are archaic given the world of technology that we live in.", "Medical imaging is the area that has seen far-reaching results. The AI-powered diagnostic imaging alone would be worth billions of dollars in 2\u20133 years. We have educational programs that are training aspiring data scientists and AI practitioners in different specific domains.", "Due to the significant adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) (with 95\u201398 percent in the US only), we have witnessed rapid progress in genome sequencing. Physicians today have enough data at hand to accurately identify consistent patterns in patient profiles.", "BERG Health is another startup in the healthcare space that is trying to remodel the market for cancer medication via applied data sciences. Incorporating powerful machine/deep learning algorithms, the company has been able to analyze biological samples from thousands of patients. They processed over trillions of data points in each sample which also builds the case for developing such complex deep learning models.", "Similar to these, there are other areas like radiology, prescription accuracy, hospital admission cost, etc that are being converted into business models for startups in the west.", "Talking about data science in healthcare, I\u2019d like to introduce you to this new video podcast series where I managed to host the CTO of Elucidata.", "With this context now cemented, I want to introduce you to my first guest who is also my mentor, Swetabh Pathak, co-Funder & CTO, Elucidata. To give you some background, my first and only full-time job was at Elucidata, as a Data Engineer. About Elucidata, they are a small team of top minds from the world\u2019s best medical & engineering schools. A biotech company that is trying to embed data science across every stage of drug discovery. A highly qualified leadership is at the helm of this organisation that is enabling the world\u2019s best medical labs with their cutting-edge product and services.", "The timing of this interview is highly in coherence with the pandemic times that we are living in. In this ~30-mins conversation, Swetabh threw light on some very interesting facts with regards to the rise of applied data science in healthcare. I believe this enriching conversation is relevant to a wide audience here and almost every aspiring data scientist would have something to take away.", "I started this YouTube channel 2 months back where I plan to cover the entire data science space.
