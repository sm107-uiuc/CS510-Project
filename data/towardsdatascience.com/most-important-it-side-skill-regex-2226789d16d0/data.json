Today we can utilize its power inside Python, but it is the same in all other programming languages, text editors, and IDEs. We will learn the basics faster than Trump tweets!", "Regex is short for Regular expression. Meaning: It is a short sequence of characters used to search or replace words in a long text. It is a minor form of a programming language that you can use to find what you need instantly. We will learn the basics using a weird little trump tweet.", "Let\u2019s load up Python and run through the basics together. First, we have to load up the module re, which handles everything regex related inside python. And let\u2019s cut the text a little", "Let\u2019s practice some magic! We can now ask Regex to find everything until the first occurrence of a word.", "This will print \u201c[\u2018When you see the Drug\u2019].\u201d", "So What Is Going On Here?", "First, you may notice how we are defining our string with the prefix r\u2019 this r indicates to python that we are about to use Regex. Also often called raw strings, this does not change the type of the string. It mostly changes how a string is interpreted. It\u2019s not always necessary, but its best practice.", "The next thing is the \u2018.*Drug\u2019 part. This consists of two ideas. First, we have the part \u2018.*\u2019 this indicates to Regex that we want every letter or symbol possible\u2026\u2026until we see Drug.", "So basically, \u2018.*\u2019 is the so-called wildcard of wildcards. Where \u2018*\u2019 indicates that we want to repeat everything before the star, 0 or more times. Where \u2018.\u2019 is the super special symbol that tells the stars that we want everything, including letters, numbers, and spaces.", "This will print \u201c[\u2018When you see the Drug Companies taking mass\u2019].\u201d Again everything from the First occurrence of \u201cW\u201d to the first \u201css.\u201d", "Will print \u201c[\u2018you \u2018, \u2018the \u2018, \u2018Companies \u2018, \u2018massive \u2018\u2026\u201d. As we see, we wanted to find this time everything that stands between two spaces. I hope there is now a big question mark above your head. We put that there to make sure that Regex matches in the so-called greedy way. Greedy means here that we match only the absolute minimum until the next space. Without the \u201c?\u2019 and only using \u2018*,\u2019 we would match everything, including spaces so that the results would be the entire tweet (Without the last and first word)", "Will print \u201cWhen you see the COVID-19 Companies taking massive television ads against me, forget what they say (which is false), YOU KNOW THAT COVID-19\u201d.", "This is one of the most useful parts of Regex, you can replace everything with everything! The call re.sub(..) takes the pattern we want to replace and substitutes it with a more suiting word. We had to add the \u2018flags=re.IGNORECASE\u2019 to make sure that we match Trump\u2019s case-insensitive tweeting style ;)", "Will print \u201cWhen you see the Kraken YOU KNOW THAT DRUG.\u201d To illustrate again what we have learned.", "This prints \u201cWhen you KNOW DRUGS.\u201d Ok, now we are getting into serious Regex territory. The Brackets \u201c( )\u201d build a matching group. This is a way to refer to something you found later on in the replace statement. We also nested the \u201c*?\u201d around it. So the first \u201c( .*? )\u201d gets us the words putting the \u201c*\u201d around the words matching GETS US ALL THE WORDS between \u201csee\u201d and \u201cTHAT.\u201d Why do we do this? So we can refer to it later on as we can see in the replace statement \u2018\\\\1\u2019 takes the first word and places it into the found string. The first word in this example is \u201cyou.\u201d This gets us to \u201cWhen you KNOW DRUGS.\u201d", "These are the basic building blocks of Regex while there is a lot more you will find on your journey to Regex-Mastery these basic techniques help you understand what is possible. I hope you will now consider Regex more often. First, you may have to invest a bit of time. Once you know it, a whole new world of string manipulation will open.", "If you enjoyed this article, I would be excited to connect on Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Make sure to check out my YouTube channel, where I will be publishing new videos every week.", "Your home for data science.
