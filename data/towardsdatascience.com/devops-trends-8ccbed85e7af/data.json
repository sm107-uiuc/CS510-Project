In the IT world, nothing is definitive. All the technologies and techniques continue to evolve following an innovation trend that we cannot stop.", "We cannot merely say: \u201cI\u2019m tired of changing; please give me a rest.\u201d The only option is to be ready for the change.", "In DevOps, there is a significant change because of the rise of the cloud and the market, always more demanding.", "The DevOps philosophy was adopted by most companies and bring essential improvements to quality and cost-saving. Anyway, the DevOps scenario is continuously evolving and adapting to the new market requirements.", "In this article, we will analyze the new frontiers of DevOps and what to know to keep up with the times. Let\u2019s see in this article what are the latest trends to follow.", "DevOps, in short words, is the practice of integrating Development (Dev) and Operation (Ops) together, creating a cooperative process.", "According to the IDC report, the DevOps market will reach $8 billion by 2022, and another report by Grand View Research speaks of about $13 billion by 2025. This means a very increasing interest in this topic by companies.", "Another driver that contributes to this change is cloud rising. According to Oracle\u2019s predictions, by 2025, 80% of the IT solution will move to the cloud.", "Since the DevOps concept was coined, DevOps practices never stopped to evolve, supported by tools more and more powerful.", "That should be a nudge to read the next chapters and be part of this evolution.", "Security has always been important, but with the growing usage of digital service and the storage of sensible data (biometric, photo, etc.), it is crucial.", "The users started asking where are their data and how they are managed. Our customer expects that we keep their information secure. We cannot fail. By the way, the user is always more demanding, and we need to support agile processes to be responsive to the change.", "We cannot allow the situation where we finish a project or a significant feature, and then we need to submit to SecOps. Our project could be stopped by SecOps for a week or, worst, rejected. We cannot merely redo all the work because some \u201csmall\u201d security detail was ignored b by developers.", "It is not just a matter of cost. It\u2019s more about timing. Marketing doesn\u2019t wait for your internal issues. Customers will buy that feature from another vendor. That\u2019s why, almost for critical projects, we need to integrate DevOps with SecOps, involving security guys since the beginning.", "Starting keeping in mind security requirements from the beginning and involving security teams helps to prevent bad situations and friction during release.", "This problem is more crucial in case you have a NoOps process. NoOps brings more automation, and you may fall in a situation where untrusted code reaches the production without the right supervision.", "This situation can be resolved by including and automating security tests during the pipeline (or assembly line, as we read in the next paragraphs).", "We don\u2019t want to finish in the newspaper for a security breach, right? Well, we need a way to integrate agility with security; this is supported by DevSecOps philosophy.", "NoOps means no operation. The spread of serverless solution and new automation frontiers make possible the NoOps dream. Its philosophy is to remove all the platform management parts and reduce friction between developers and infrastructure.", "As I explain in the article \u201cDevOps is Dead, Long Live NoOps\u201d published on Better Programming, the step forward respect to DevOps is:", "DevOps [\u2026] means that you always need some manual effort. You still have a person behind most parts of the process. This means working in the old way.", "The purpose of NoOps is to define a new kind of process, where there is no need to combine Dev with Ops because most of the tasks are automated. Benefits are less time to market, better quality, less effort on maintenance.", "This is very interesting. We can agree with the principles behind that, but we must aware of the other side of the story: monitoring and security. With a fully automated system where all is driven by the code, who will take care of those steps?", "The solution to the problem is again the automation. You need to implement automation on each part is no more covered by a human, monitoring, and security included. This converges into the DevSecOps direction.", "When DevOps was coined in 2009, probably, the typical scenario was a monolithic web application. It was the time when the MVC pattern was revolutionary, and it seems to me ages ago.", "Today the situation is a little bit different. In the simplest case, we have two application (frontend SPA and the API backend). Often they evolve differently and are managed by different teams. Probably, we will choose a microservice architecture for our next project. This means a lot of applications to be deployed, and a lot of dependencies.", "Our pipeline approach appears quite limiting. The pipeline model is perfect for following linear models (commit > compile >test >deploy) where your project is easy to represent with a simple flow. Let\u2019s see an example.", "In the diagram, we see the code, approved by a Pull Request coming to the CI\\CD tool, build and tested. In case of error during the build to test phase, the issue follows the right escalation to be solved before the deploy.", "This approach may still be suitable for most of the projects, but in many situations, it can be limiting.", "The new approach is an analogy with the industry, and it\u2019s called the \u201cassembly pipeline.\u201d", "Like in the physical assembly pipeline, each department gives its contribution, adding \u201ca piece\u201d to the product.", "Using this approach, all the people that take part in this process are involved since the beginning, and there is a flow, clear from the start. In this way, many teams can cooperate and manage complex scenarios with multiple dependencies (from applications, security, etc..).", "Assembly lines are a response to the DevOps fragmentation in complex scenarios and need cultural collaboration as glue to keep all pieces together. Moreover, we also need a \u201csuper tool\u201d that manages all this interaction.", "Basing on the analogy of industry, we call it Assembly Island. Bad news, most common CI\\CD tools didn\u2019t support this approach natively, and you will need to couple together with a set of tools.", "Nothing is better than source code. It is versionable, can be copied and pasted, can be sent via email, and if you execute twice, you got the same result. Or, almost, this is what we expect from good code.", "Historically, sysadmin things are not the same. You cannot cut and paste a data center and send it via email, right?", "The good news is that your infrastructure can be like source code.", "We already introduced solutions like Ansible, Terraform, or other automation frameworks. We can version our script and automate infrastructure management.", "Also, declarative description of the infrastructure like in Kubernetes is an excellent help to understand how things work without reading tons of docs or understand server configuration by revere engineering on the configuration files.", "Automatomation since the beginning of the process helps to start in the right way and give us a replicable infrastructure, that\u2019s a big help for thousand or reason (jus think to disaster recovery or simply create a new environment for testing a single feature).", "DevOps is a rising topic. Even a lot of things have already been written; we need to evolve our competencies to be aligned with the trends.", "Most essential keywords in this change are:", "Most of them converge to the same goal: use the technologies to improve the quality process.", "The change can be achieved by automating human tasks, integrating security and monitoring inside the process, and use the cloud to accelerate this process.", "We need a tool or a set of tools that supports all the operations and orchestrate people\u2019s cooperation but, as usual, change the mindset is the first step.", "Found this article useful?
