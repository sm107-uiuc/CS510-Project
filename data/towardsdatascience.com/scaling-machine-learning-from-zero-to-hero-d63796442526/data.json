The last \u2014 most important step in a machine learning workflow is deploying your model to work in production.", "A model which does not work in production is worth nothing", "A deployed model can be defined as any unit that is seamlessly integrated into a production environment, which can take in an input and return an output.

Source", "In this post, I will show you step-by-step how to deploy your own custom-trained Pytorch model with AWS Lambda and integrate it into your production environment with an API. We are going to leverage a simplified serverless computing approach at scale.", "AWS Lambda is a computing service that lets you run code without managing servers. It executes your code only when required and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You only pay for the compute time you consume \u2014 there is no charge when your code is not running.", "This post assumes you have the Serverless Framework for deploying an AWS Lambda function installed and configured, as well as a working Docker Environment. The Serverless Framework helps us develop and deploy AWS Lambda functions. It\u2019s a CLI that offers structure, automation, and best practices right out of the box. It also allows you to focus on building sophisticated, event-driven, serverless architectures, comprised of functions and events.", "If you aren\u2019t familiar or haven\u2019t set up the Serverless Framework, take a look at this quick-start with the Serverless Framework.", "By modifying the serverless YAML file, you can connect SQS and, say, create a deep learning pipeline, or even connect it to a chatbot via AWS Lex.", "Before we get started, I\u2019d like to give you some information about the model we are going to use. I trained a Pytorch image classifier in a google colab. If you want to know what Google Colab is, take a look here. I created a dataset for classifying car damage detection and fine-tuned a resnet50 image classifier. In this tutorial, we are using Python3.8 with Pytorch1.5.", "What are we going to do:", "The architecture we are building will look like this.", "Now let\u2019s get started with the tutorial.", "First, we create our AWS Lambda function by using the Serverless CLI with the aws-python3 template.", "This CLI command will create a new directory containing a handler.py, .gitignore and serverless.yaml file. The handler.py contains some basic boilerplate code.", "Next, we are adding our Python Requirements to our AWS Lambda function. For this, we are using the Serverless plugin serverless-python-requirements. It automatically bundles dependencies from a requirements.txt and makes them available. The serverless-python-requirements plugin allows you to even bundle non-pure-Python modules. More on that here.", "To install the plugin run the following command.", "This will automatically add the plugin to your project\u2019s package.json and to the plugins section in the serverless.yml.", "We have to create a requirements.txt file on the root level, with all required Python packages. But you have to be careful that the deployment package size must not exceed 250MB unzipped. You can find a list of all AWS Lambda limitations here.", "If we would install Pytorch with pip install torch the package would be around ~ 470 MB, which is too big to be deployed in an AWS Lambda Environment. Thus, we are adding the link to the python wheel file (.whl) directly in the requirements.txt. For a list of all PyTorch and torchvision packages consider this list.", "The requirements.txt should look like this.", "To make the dependencies even smaller we will employ three techniques available in the serverless-python-requirements plugin:", "You can see the implementation of it in the section where we are \u201cconfiguring our serverless.yaml \" file.", "Our Lambda function actually consists of 4 functions.", "The working program code then looks like this.", "As explained earlier, I trained a car damage detection model in a colab notebook, which takes an image as input and returns whether the car depicted is 01-whole or 00-damaged. I also added some code that does all the bundling magic for you: If you run the notebook it will create a file called cardamage.tar.gz that is ready to be deployed on AWS. Keep in mind, the size of the Lambda function can be only 250MB unzipped. Thus, we cannot include our model directly into the function. Instead we need to download it from S3 with the load_model_from_s3().", "For this to work, we need a S3 bucket. You can either create one using the management console or with this script.", "After we created the bucket we can upload our model. You can do it either manually or using the provided python script.", "The next step is to adjust the serverless.yaml and including the custom Python requirement configuration. We are going to edit four sections of the serverless.yaml, ...", "Have a look at the complete serverless.yaml. Don't worry, I will explan all four sections in detail in a minute.", "In the serverless framework, we define where our function ins deployed in the provider section. We are using aws as our provider, other options include google, azure, and many more. You can find a full list of providers here.", "In addition, we define our runtime, our environment variables, and the permissions our Lambda function has.", "As runtime, we are using python3.8. For our function to work we need two environment variables S3_BUCKET and MODEL_PATH. S3_BUCKET contains the name of our S3 Bucket, which we created earlier. MODEL_PATH is the path to our cardamage.tar.gz file in the S3 Bucket. We are still missing the permissions to get our model from S3 into our lambda functions. The iamRoleStatementshandles the permissions for our lambda function. The permission we need to get our model from S3 is s3:getObject with the ARN ( Amazon Resource Names) of our S3 bucket as a resource.", "In the custom section of the serverless.yml, we can define configurations for plugins or other scripts. For more details, refer to this guide. As described earlier we are using the serverless-python-requirements to install and reduce the size of our dependencies at the same time so we can pack everything into the Lambda runtime. If you want to know how it works you can read here.", "The package section can be used to exclude directories/folders from the final package. This offers more control in the packaging process. You can exclude specific folders and files, like node_modules/. For more detail take a look here.", "The fourth and last section \u2014 function - holds the configuration for our Lambda function. We define the allocated memory size, a timeout, and the events here. In the events section of the function, we can define a number of events, which will trigger our lambda function. For our project, we are using http which will automatically create an API Gateway pointing to our function. You can also define events for sqs, cron, s3 and many more. You can find the full list here.", "In order to deploy the function, we create a deploy script in the package.json. To deploy our function we need to have docker up and running.", "Afterwards, we can run yarn deploy or npm run deploy to deploy our function. This could take a while as we are creating a Python environment with docker and installing all our dependencies in it and then uploading everything to AWS.", "After this process is done we should see something like this.", "To test our lambda function we can use Insomnia, Postman, or any other rest client. Just add an image of a damaged or whole car as a multipart input in the request. Let\u00b4s try it with this image.", "As a result of our test with the red car we get 01-whole, which is correct. Also, you can see the complete request took 319ms with a lambda execution time of around 250ms. To be honest this is pretty fast.", "If you are going to rebuild the classifier, you have to be careful that the first request could take a while. First off, the Lambda is unzipping and installing our dependencies and then downloading the model from S3. After this is done once, the lambda needs around 250ms \u2014 1000ms depending on the input image size for classification.", "The best thing is, our classifier automatically scales up if there are several incoming requests!", "You can scale up to thousands of parallel requests without any worries.", "Thanks for reading. You can find the GitHub repository with the complete code here and the colab notebook here. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.", "Lance Miles mentioned that it could be possible that you have to include `multipart/form-data` as a binary media type in API gateway\u2019s settings so that the gateway would encode the images sent via Insomnia in base64.", "Your home for data science.
