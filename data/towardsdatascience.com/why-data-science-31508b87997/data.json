As part of the school leadership team, we had gotten some questions and concerns about the effectiveness of the current tardy policy. A colleague friend and I had volunteered to gather some data to help drive the investigation and conversation. We were curious and excited to take on this project, wanting to add to the anecdotal story lines and intuitive understanding of teams\u2019 students, staff, teachers, parents, and administrators.", "As we were attempting to wrangle the data pulled from our cryptic learning management system, we had a million questions:", "What does this variable even mean? What are our assumptions regarding this data? How was this collected? Can we trust this data? How significantly under-reported are tardies? Do the classes with the most tardies actually have the highest rate of tardy students, or the teacher most committed to documentation? Is this a valid and reasonable way to aggregate the data? How do we figure out which are the most important factors?", "Eventually, my colleague friend said, \u201cIf we worked in industry, there would be someone to help us!\u201d We wouldn\u2019t be on our own to address these questions, understand the state of tardies as well as possible with this data set, and decide how to go about getting data that would improve our ability to understand and track patterns and evaluate initiatives.", "As I was spending more and more time working on these types of projects, I realized I wanted to be that someone. The person that helps people answer questions, get to the bottom of what they are struggling with, and helps make sense of the world and move forward with decision making. I came to realize that more and more I was excited to come to work each weekday to work on these projects. I was picking up the pace on the weekend hike so that I could get home to the data sooner.", "On a deeper level, I believe humans are inherently curious creatures. Some of my first memories involve me asking my parents some really big WHY and HOW questions, and them making the excellent teaching move: \u201cThat\u2019s a really good question! I\u2019m not really sure\u2026 How do you think we could find out more?\u201d I must have been a seriously exhausting kid, with incessant questioning. Little did I know that, by engaging with and supporting the questioning, they were setting me on track for a life of investigation, a data-oriented life.", "As a data scientist, I am excited to make the world a better place through finding patterns in data and communicating them in ways that help people and organizations confidently move forward with more than intuition. I want to help the world make better decisions.", "On top of all the rest, I love the interdisciplinary nature of data science. It draws on so many academic areas \u2014 information systems and science, statistics and math, computer science, communications, and business. It applies to every industry with a range of possible scale from personal use to government, Fortune 500, and global organizations.", "As much as I loved helping young adults learn to find patterns in data and ask critical questions about their confidence and the validity of their conclusions, I wanted to be doing these creative and analytical tasks myself. I enjoyed designing learning experiences that got closer and closer to achieving my team\u2019s educational goals, but I yearned for better, more reliable and easily analyzed data, and the time and skill to analyze it to track improvement and evaluate the curriculum over time. It felt like the easily analyzed data on student learning (read: multiple choice assessments) did not do a good job showing the range of student learnings and skills, especially for those students who more recently started adding English to their language repertoire or have historically struggled in school, but written and non-standard assessments made it difficult to extract patterns. I wanted a way to accurately assess what each student knew and could do, get feedback on the curriculum and teaching, and provide useful feedback for student growth, all in a time-constrained work environment. This was a constant struggle and balance for me and my teaching team. I love diving into the messiness of real life data, and am excited to learn more about how to tackle complex, unstructured data so that I can help people and organizations make the best decisions in their contexts based on all the available data.", "In terms of the life and career of a data scientist, I see four key pros:", "Seems like a pretty great use of my time and fit with my interests and values.", "Your home for data science.
