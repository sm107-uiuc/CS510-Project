If you want to read up about the legality of scraping, I suggest you try this article.", "The Github link for full code can be found here.", "Thanks to Covid19, it\u2019s a madhouse on LinkedIn. You see people commenting interested in prospective job opportunity posts left right and center. There are about a hundred if not more, headhunters and company HR posting their job requirements on LinkedIn right now. Let us call these postings our direct links. Direct links are good, they are genuine, and most likely your application will be directly going to the person or his company who posted it. Commenting on such posts may even result in a genuine review of your LinkedIn profile and if you are very lucky, feedback! Now comes the 2nd links. People whose bio reads connecting talents to opportunities. They mostly share these direct links and try to redirect candidates to them. And finally the 3rd links. Job Pages on LinkedIn. Aggregating data from all over the internet, mostly job listing websites like Naukri, Indeed, and others. All this may do very little towards demotivating you and you still fight on!!", "The fun begins though when they say you have to go follow them back at Instagram to get a particular job listing. Or just comment on their post to get the application link. This is digital marketing 101, what they are trying to do, i.e cross-platform campaigning, and there is nothing wrong here too, except for a candidate who has spent his whole day searching for jobs has to now go to Instagram, see which friend is having foodgasm or who couldn\u2019t be anymore happier on a hilltop, and then look for just the link to apply to his job. Then there is your own direct search on these various job listing websites. Where after applying about 10 filters including what experience salary location criteria you are looking for, you are still left with about 2k results.", "In a market with so much information, being distributed and redistributed by so many groups, it becomes overwhelming for an individual sometimes. 2 days of aggressive application and commenting \u201cinterested\u201d later, you lose your mojo and perhaps immerse yourself in the next trending Netflix series.", "As students, we can only hope, that among the hundreds of applications we have sent out thus far, few of them hit the right planetary locations and help us land that dream job of ours. But there is a smarter way to go about these things if you are willing to get your hands dirty in a few lines of generic python code.", "If you are an IT guy you probably have already used them for testing purposes of client websites. These two python libraries together are your bread and butter if you need to collect publicly available data from websites at a scale in no time. These type of extractions depends heavily on the fact that the information you are looking for will mostly be found in fixed positions on the website. A variation in the position up to 2\u20133 different places can be managed with exception handling but variation greater than that becomes a problem.", "\u201cAny listing website owners reading this, if you don\u2019t want your publicly available data to be easily scraped, try randomizing the positions of your data as much as possible in the DOM. That ought to discourage us puny scrapers!!\u201d", "A webpage devoid of heavy CSS styling or javascript enabled buttons can be scraped using only Beautifulsoup and requests. Beautifulsoup downloads the whole DOM once requests command has successfully loaded the whole page of interest. But if your data lies at a point, which only gets disclosed after clicking a particular item, i.e. JavaScript enabled then you will be needing selenium to the rescue. A more sophisticated scraping library, it does more than requests, it can make clicks, enter search keywords set filters and basically mimic all the actions that a human can through an automated chrome driver instance.", "Now to the problem. Take for example the website of Naukri. While searching for a job, you most probably apply a certain number of filters like your desired salary, the experience you have and domain in which you are interested, and then browse through the results. This page contains each listing inside a particular box and if you right-click and go to inspect elements, you can see all the listings on a page being contained under the same address of a particular div and class name.", "If there is say 10 listings on a single page, we can save all these addresses as a python list element and loop through one by one to extract our required data. Let's call them soup1.", "Soup.find_all finds and stores all similar addresses as a list while Soup.find can parse singular objects inside a particular list item to extract the data. That is all there is to BeautifulSoup basically. Now if there are about 60 pages on which the results are distributed, you need to call an instance of the driver from selenium, find the address of the button to click for going to the next page and then click it by .click command", "Right, now you may be asking what I get as an end result for doing all this. So time for some motivation.", "Here is Sherlock with his pipe explaining to you what skill sets are in high demand at naukri.com job listings.", "So clearly if you are looking for technical skills, SAP would likely be a good skill to pick up now. On the other hand sales skills seem to be leading the listings closely followed by audit. Data analysis and risk compliance are not far behind too.", "Here is another vibrant visualization showing you the top 5 industries that have most job listings according to the criteria given by us. It also shows the average experience demanded by each of these jobs.", "All the visualization has been formed from 120 jobs selected from Naukri after browsing through about 3k jobs posted over the last 10 days. All these jobs meet minimum salary criteria or the companies have a very high glassdoor rating. And your script can do it all and provide you with these visualizations(mainly the word-cloud) in few hours only.", "Imagine this level of insight every week, once you make this crawler and run it on various other sites.", "Once you determine all the different kind of addresses your data can be present in, inside each mother address item, you just instantiate a python dictionary, inside the main loop, keep on saving each of the data points in the dictionary with a relevant key of the format d[\u2018Your Key Name\u2019]=value, handle exceptions by try and except command if your data has any chance of occurring in more than 2\u20133 places, and then append each of this dictionary, when filled with all the required data to a list. Remember the keys will be the column names of your CSV file when you retrieve your list as a data frame object.", "Now for selecting companies based on criteria, you can simply put an if-else statement, and dictate that the minimum salary key of your dictionary and minimum experience must have a certain number for you to consider it a good company. I named the variable holding these companies as gem(yes sometimes you need to make your boring code cheesy!!). Once they satisfy these conditions, we can search for their glassdoor review in google using requests and BeautifulSoup by pretty much the same fixed position data extraction method we discussed above.", "If you consider opening your own LinkedIn page and help others with their job search, you can just open LinkedIn in a new tab by switching driver handles", "Then find the post element in your LinkedIn page, mention its XPath and click on it by driver.find_element.click function. You can use this XPath element location and passing the keys method to completely type your whole message and post it on LinkedIn. Time.sleep should be used here not only to let the page get loaded properly after each click but also to prevent your program from going too fast. Or else LinkedIn may be up in arms and throw their terms of violation at you!!", "Don\u2019t forget to switch your tab once the posting is done so that your program can carry on with the search. This can be done through driver.switch_to.window()", "Once the CSV file has been assembled, you can use any image with a transparent background as a mask for your wordcloud. Suppose you want to form a wordcloud of all the JDs. You would want to preprocess the text as given below. I am saving the text of interest under the jobs variable.", "This code basically removes all symbols, numbers, links, stopwords, and other irrelevant objects from the text, lemmatizes words back to its root source, for eg, transforming analytical to analytics.", "You can use imagecolourgenerator to generate your wordcloud color similar to the original image, but don\u2019t expect same kind of vibrancy. Finally, plot your wordcloud to see the insights. Below is the job search automation in action.", "And there you have it. Your very own crawler complete with a LinkedIn job search Automator who can post updates on its own and also give you much-needed insights related to your job search needs. So next time one of those pages tells you to go follow their Instagram or twitter handle to get a link to a particular job, you give them your own researched job links and tell them to follow you. The scope of this is huge. The same program with few changes can be even used to automate your application process in several websites. I would suggest not using the bot for posting as LinkedIn has very stringent rules regarding the way the website traffic comes in and an automated chromedriver may rub them the wrong way. Use it for your own needs, and remember to keep your extraction limited to publicly available data only. Good luck and Godspeed.", "Your home for data science.
