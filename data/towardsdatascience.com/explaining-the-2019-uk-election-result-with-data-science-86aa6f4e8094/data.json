Anyone with an ounce of political nous knew what was coming next.", "On the morning of Friday the 13th (naturally) of December, the country awoke to find that it had given Boris Johnson the biggest Conservative election win since the days of Margaret Thatcher.", "The Conservative victory was as much a product of poor opposition as it was any particular Tory strength. Voters lamented the dire choice they faced \u2014 every single party leader had negative approval ratings throughout the campaign, and Johnson, for his part, avoided media scrutiny like the plague (even retreating into an industrial refrigerator to dodge a live television interview on the last day of campaigning).", "Despite this chicanery from the Conservatives, the opposition Labour party had their worst result since the 1930s. They lost badly in their talismanic \u2018Red Wall\u2019 \u2014 a swathe of post-industrial English constituencies (analogous to the American rust belt), many of which voted Conservative for the first time ever.", "Could such a shocking result have been predicted? And if so, could anyone have done anything about it? Even if not, are there any lessons that Labour can take from such a painful defeat? These are all questions that a political scientist would be well placed to answer. Quality of leadership, campaign strategies, and the role of the media are all qualitative factors worth exploring.", "However, this is a data science blog. We\u2019ll therefore try to extricate ourselves from fuzzy issues of personality and policy, and get down to some cold hard numbers. Before we do so, it\u2019s good to understand exactly how the UK\u2019s political system works, since this will inform how we proceed with our analysis.", "Political power in the UK lies in the House of Commons (or Parliament). This is populated by 650 members (MPs), one from each of the UK\u2019s 650 \u2018constituencies\u2019.", "In a general election, each constituency votes for a single MP from a selection of candidates. The one candidate with the most votes in that constituency is elected as an MP. The political party that has the most elected MPs overall wins the election, and typically forms the government.", "This system is known as \u2018First Past The Post\u2019 (FPTP). It can lead to some significant disparities between a party\u2019s overall popular vote share, and the share of seats that it wins in the House of Commons.", "For example, in 2015 The Conservatives managed to win more than half the seats with just 37% of the popular vote. On the other end of the spectrum, The UK Independence Party (UKIP) won just one seat (0.015% of the total seats) with 13% of the national vote.", "This is a voting system that unambiguously helps the UK\u2019s two main parties \u2014 the Conservatives and Labour, who have won every general election since 1922.", "Another phenomena that arises from FPTP is \u2018safe seats\u2019 \u2014 constituencies that are almost certain to vote a given way. In the run up to the 2019 election, there were 170 constituencies that have voted for the same party since World War 2 (the constituency of North Shropshire is probably the safest seat of all \u2014 it has been held by the Conservatives since 1834).", "Though there are always overarching national factors that influence how people vote, general elections are, in essence, 650 local mini-elections. Thus, we should try to understand as much as we can about the demographics of these individual constituencies.", "Happily, a lot of official data is available at a constituency level through government websites, in particular https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/local-data/", "We can pull various CSVs together to create a grand table of constituency-by-constituency KPIs across a range of metrics; from house prices, weekly wages, and population density, to educational attainment, ethnicity, and even broadband quality.", "The ultimate aim of this will be to create a model that uses this demographic data to predict which party is likely to win in each constituency. Once we have developed an accurate model, we can analyse it to see what the most important drivers were, thus inferring the biggest electoral factors.", "Before we do this, however, it can be eye opening to investigate the geographical distribution of some of these KPIs, and the regional disparities that they demonstrate.", "For example, we see that wages are higher in constituencies in London and the South East, which should be no surprise to any UK resident. However, house prices have grown so much in these places compared to the rest of the UK, that the average property is worth up to 30 times the annual wage (compared with 5\u201310 times elsewhere).", "Where you live also correlates strongly with the type of industry you\u2019re likely to work in.", "Blue collar work (for example, heavy industry and hospitality) is more prevalent in the Midlands and North of England \u2014 white collar industries (financial services, IT, and sciences) are clustered in cities, especially London. Perhaps unsurprisingly, constituencies with more white collar workers have higher wages, and lower unemployment.", "This \u2018London vs. The Rest\u2019 narrative runs through much of the data; Londoners tend to be better qualified, more ethnically diverse, and more international than the rest of the country.", "These factors all come into play when we think about the great bogeyman of current British politics: Brexit. This is not the place to discuss any benefits (or lack thereof) of leaving the European Union, but to ignore its effect on the 2019 election would clearly be a mistake.", "The first thing to note is the diversity of opinion that Brexit generates. Though the national margin of victory was very narrow, at 52% vs 48%, this vote spread was not evenly across constituencies. The leave vote was as low as 20% in some areas, but as high as 75% in others.", "Unsurprisingly, this spread appears to be dependent on geography. We note strong Leave votes outside of London \u2014 mostly in middle England.", "The drivers for Brexit were complex and diverse, however, there are some individual features that correlate very strongly with a constituency\u2019s leave vote \u2014 qualification levels, and industry.", "The correlation coefficient between the share of leave votes in a constituency and the share of people with level 4+ qualifications (degrees or equivalent) is very negative, at -0.72, whereas the coefficient between the share of leave votes and the share of people working in heavy industry is very high, at +0.72.", "Though one would have to deal with feature collinearity (which this dataset has in spades), I imagine you\u2019d easily be able to create a model that perfectly predicts a constituency\u2019s leave vote.", "Though analysis the EU Referendum is a rabbit hole we could happily spend time descending, the aim of the above data gathering was to create some predictive model for how each constituency would vote in a general election.", "This will therefore become a categorisation problem, where the model will decide whether the constituency is a safe seat for a given party, or a marginal seat between two given parties (we define a seat as \u2018marginal\u2019 if the difference between first and second place is less than 15 percentage points).", "We should also remember that part of this exercise was about working out if anything could have been done during the campaign to change the eventual result. For this reason, rather than using the final 2019 election results as our target, we will use the results of YouGov\u2019s MRP Poll published on November 27th (just over two weeks before polling day).", "MRP (Multilevel Regression with Poststratification) is an advanced polling methodology, and the YouGov poll in question had a huge sample size, with over 100,000 people responding in the space of seven days. It was therefore able to give a projected vote share for each party in every constituency. In the event, it slightly underestimated the Conservative success in seat terms, though its projection of overall vote share was within 1\u20132% of the final result for the main parties.", "YouGov\u2019s MRP poll showed a harrowing picture for Labour. A third of the seats that had previously been Conservative / Labour marginals now looked like they were safe Conservative, and up to 30% of seats that had been safe Labour in 2017 now looked as if they were going to be Conservative marginals.", "By contrast, the Conservatives were set to lose very few safe seats, and they were still competitive in most seats that had previously been marginals.", "Now that we have features and target values for each constituency, we can do the final two steps:", "As a first step, we need to address the dataset\u2019s class imbalance problem. The dataset currently has over 250 Conservative safe seats, but only four Liberal Democrat safe seats (and one each of four other types of seat).", "This is not an appropriate dataset to train a model on \u2014 we would likely overfit a model to the majority classes. To combat this, we will use the SMOTE algorithm to generate synthetic datapoints for the minority classes. This is relatively straightforward to implement in Python.", "Note, since SMOTE uses a \u2018nearest neighbour\u2019 algorithm, we can not synthesise for classes where there was only one datapoint to begin with. We will therefore drop such classes from our analysis going forward (these only represent half a percent of the seats in parliament, so this shouldn\u2019t affect the analysis unduly).", "Given that our analysis will depend on our ability to train a highly accurate model, we should both:", "The easiest way to do this is through a \u2018grid search\u2019 approach, where we specify all the different values for each hyperparameter that we want to test out, then let the code iterate through them in turn, to see which combination produces the best results.", "This is quite easy to implement in code, and if we use Scikit Learn, it also comes with bonus in-built cross validation, which means we don\u2019t need to bother with a train/test split.", "Though conceptually straightforward, grid search can be computationally intensive and time consuming. If we have six hyperparameters that we want to tune, each with three possible values, that\u2019s 729 potential models. If we then do 4-fold cross-validation, then we\u2019re actually fitting some 3,000 different models.", "You can improve performance by setting the \u2018n_jobs\u2019 parameter in GridSearchCV to -1 (this forces it to use all of the computers processors in parallel), but this is still the sort of code that takes hours to run.", "Happily, in this case it was worth the wait \u2014 we created a model that predicts seat types with 100% accuracy.", "This is all well and good, but we now need to investigate which features are driving the model to make its decisions. There might be a way to unpick, say, a simple decision tree or a logistic regression model. But XGBoost, for all its accuracy, is notoriously opaque.", "Machine learning explainability is a topic that is becoming increasingly important, especially as models become simultaneously more complex, and more open to public scrutiny (how, for example, can you prove that your bank\u2019s credit scoring algorithm isn\u2019t racist?)", "I highly, highly recommend this free course on Kaggle (approximately four hours\u2019 worth of material), which covers three techniques that you can unpack any machine learning model. For this blog, I will use the most straightforward of these \u2014 permutation importance.", "The concept of permutation importance is very intuitive:", "This procedure breaks the relationship between each feature and the target, thus the drop in accuracy is indicative of how much the model depends on that feature.", "It\u2019s worth noting that these values don\u2019t tell you in which way the feature impacted the model\u2019s decision for a given datapoints. For that, SHAP values can be used (see the Kaggle course for an introduction to these).", "Calculating permutation importance can be done in Python using the eli5 package (though an equivalent function has been recently added to Scikit Learn).", "The most impactful feature is whether or not a constituency is in Scotland. This should not be surprising given the Scottish National Party, who are competitive in 58 out of 59 Scottish seats.", "The next most important is the share of people who voted to leave the EU. Let\u2019s see how this breaks down depending on the seat type.", "We can see how the leave vote share could be an important factor in deciding the seat type \u2014 there are stark differences across the categories. Two key things jump out from Labour\u2019s perspective:", "These two findings manifest themselves across many other KPIs with high permutation importance. Consider the two most important features pertaining to home ownership:", "The potential Labour seats are spread over a very wide range of values in both cases, and, as with the Brexit vote, the Conservative / Labour marginals look much more like safe Conservative seats than they do safe Labour seats.", "This is even true when we think about the geographical type of seat \u2014 the Conservative / Labour marginals were mostly in towns (rather than cities). Again, the profile of the marginal seats much better reflected existing Conservative safe seats.", "All of this meant that the Conservatives were better placed to run a focussed campaign that would still appeal to a broad range of constituencies. Labour, however, were forced to appeal to a very wide range of voters, which came across in their campaign, which came across as muddled and too wide-ranging.", "These demographics are not likely to shift around any time soon, and Labour is obliged to take back these marginal seats if it ever wants to win an election. Does this mean that it is doomed to failure?", "Uniting the various types of voter that might support Labour looks like a difficult task, especially when the Conservatives are able to be much more targeted. If nothing else, it would take seriously talented leadership, and there is significant evidence to suggest that Labour was sorely lacking this in the 2019 election.", "There is a sea of anecdotal evidence that Jeremy Corbyn, their leader, was profoundly unpopular on the doorstep during the campaign. More scientific polling since the election seems to bear this out.", "To win back power then, Labour\u2019s next leader is going to have to be nothing short of spectacular. No pressure, then, for the candidates already lining up to replace Mr. Corbyn, and the party members who will ultimately try to pick a winner from them.", "Thanks for reading all the way to the end of the blog!
