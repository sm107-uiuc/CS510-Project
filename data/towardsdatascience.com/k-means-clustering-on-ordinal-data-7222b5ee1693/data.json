It\u2019s the holy grail of unsupervised learning. And honestly? I understand why\u2026 Sure, there\u2019s a bit of an art form to deciding on the number of clusters you should calculate, but by and large it\u2019s borderline magical to sit back and let the algorithm do it\u2019s thing. Even so, there\u2019s one very important caveat: k-means clustering only works on numerical data\u2026 Right?!", "In general, attempting to broaden k-means into categorical applications is precarious at best. The most integral part of k-means clustering deals with finding points with the minimal distance between them. How do we define distance amongst categorical variables? How far is an apple from an orange? Are those closer to blueberries or watermelon? In unordered contexts, it just doesn\u2019t make sense to ask these questions.", "Wow, I\u2019m so glad you asked. Just as you\u2019ve astutely pointed out, there absolutely are contexts where it seems like there should be a way to answer these questions.", "Recently, I was looking at some data from KFF regarding the statewide social distancing mandates that have been implemented in the United States in response to COVID-19. After some wrangling, here\u2019s what the first few rows looked like:", "(Note: If you want to see my whole process for wrangling and analyzing this dataset, you can check out my R code on Github.)", "Consider for instance, the Stay at Home Order attribute. This attribute describes whether or not a state has a Stay at Home order, and which populations are affected by the order. Obviously having no order is different from having a statewide order, which is different from having an order that only applies to high risk groups. And here\u2019s the important part: a statewide order seems \u201ccloser\u201d to an order affecting only high risk groups, than no order at all.", "It seems like we should be able to answer the questions required for k-means clustering. The natural ordering of our data lends itself to further analysis. Sure, it\u2019s not actually numeric data, but it behaves in a roughly numeric way, so what\u2019s holding us back from treating it as such? In the ubiquitous words of Hannah Montana, life\u2019s what you make it so let\u2019s make it possible to perform k-means clustering on ordinal data! (No? That wasn\u2019t her quote? Shoot.)", "Here\u2019s the gist: in order to make k-means possible on an ordinal dataset, we\u2019re going to define a mapping from our ordinal data into numerical values. Essentially, we assign weights to each factor level, and use those weights to perform our analysis.", "(Reminder: this is a bad idea if your categorical data has no natural ordering. We\u2019re basically creating the concepts of order and magnitude and forcing them upon our dataset. If this doesn\u2019t make sense for your data, you may be interested in k-modes clustering.)", "For my data, I had 3 attributes that I wanted to transform. In order to make sure the attributes were equally important during clustering, I made sure that possible weights for each attribute ranged from 0 to 10. The exact selection of 0 and 10 doesn\u2019t matter as much as the idea of ensuring all attributes have scales of similar magnitude. This is perhaps the most important thing to keep in mind when defining your mappings.", "Creating scales of similar magnitudes for all attributes is the most important aspect to consider when transforming ordinal data for k-means analysis.", "Ultimately, I defined my mappings as follows:", "Once I had my mapping defined, I performed an entire k-means clustering analysis on my now-numerical variables. Here\u2019s a glimpse into the shape of my transformed data:", "It seemed to work pretty well: my cluster means were quite distinct from each other, and scatterplots of each of the combinations of the three variables appropriately illuminated the delineation between clusters. (Check out out the code on Github for full details.) When all was said and done, I ended up with the following cluster identifications.", "Defining the mapping from ordinal to numerical values is an extremely subjective process. It depends heavily upon the specifics of the data, and I don\u2019t believe it is possible to give anything more than general advice about how to go about choosing a mapping.", "In some datasets, a simple rank of ordinal data may be the best fit. In other instances, such as our case study here, a more fluid scale may be necessary. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to this method, but I still believe it has the potential to produce highly valuable insights.", "Your home for data science.
