And I have to say it was an awesome read. How do I define an awesome or great book? A book that changes your attitude permanently. You must not be the same person that you were before you picked up the book. It impacts one or more aspects of your life: personal, financial, social, romantic, family, or professional. Also, I read a book only if I can use what I learn from it. I don\u2019t read it just for the sake of learning something. It needs to be practically usable in one of the areas of my life immediately if a book has to be on my desk. So yes, this book made a big impact not only on my professional understanding of data science but it also helped me uncover my interests. There are two primary things to learn from the book. First one is from the five effects:", "Without giving away the book\u2019s ideas, Eric has hidden a lot of his experience in predictive analytics into these effects. The prediction effect proves that a lesser accurate prediction is better than a guess in business. The data effect says the data always has a story to tell and there is always something valuable to learn from it. The induction effect proves that it is the art that drives machine learning. The ensemble effect explains how the concept of synergy is useful in prediction. The persuasion effect connects marketing techniques, business-sense, and A/B testing. You might think it is all so simple and you already know it and you might be right unless you have a decade of experience in predictive analytics. And you still can learn something new in the book. Each effect is explained with real-life business cases. The book is filled with practical business results obtained from applying these effects. The most contrasting thing is he was a professor in a university but his writing style is practical, non-academic, and business-results oriented.", "The second thing I learned from the book is the understanding of the subject itself. I have taken several data science courses and written short programs using Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn. I have built a few machine learning models and I thought I knew something. I was wrong. This book taught me the usefulness of machine learning in real-life. Writing code to build, test, and evaluate models is not understanding machine learning. This book gives a detailed explanation of what machine learning is. There is an even more detailed explanation of decision trees without a single line of code. That in itself shows the grip of Eric\u2019s understanding of machine learning modeling. Then there is a good amount of coverage of important topics like correlation does not imply causation, how models over-learn, and why training-test data split exists. Of course, all of it with real-life business cases. What looks like business risk, Eric converts it into an opportunity using predictive analytics. There is not a page in the book where he loses the focus from using predictive analytics to solve business problems.", "My professional interests have permanently changed after reading the book. Now I am curious and very much interested in learning and finding more about how machine learning uncovers financial frauds, how a machine learning program can be applied to marketing or advertising problem in a business, and how it can be used in law enforcement. All of which I was least interested in doing before reading the book. I skipped some parts of the book but still, it was a mind-bending experience.", "Your home for data science.
