This is not what you expect when you visit a friend to try out the new micro-cafe in the office of their ad-tech startup (well, when visitors were allowed), but it is increasingly becoming a reality.", "Large technology companies invest large amounts of money in exploratory research ($10-$20billion per year among the biggest players) and hold onto even more money for a rainy day (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Facebook jointly have $550billion in cash). In terms of billions, hiring a couple of robotics researchers is pennies in a sea. It also collects more top talent under their roof, but I think that helps shorter term than I am considering.", "The outlook for robotics as an industry is nearly-exponential impact in the next decade (or sooner, pending pandemic continuation as I wrote about in detail). The portion of this that technology companies are looking to capture is those robots embodying their algorithms in your homes. As I wrote about in Recommendations are a Game and Automated,", "A general theme of recommender systems and these platforms is: if we can predict what the user wants to do, then we can make that feature into our system.", "Extend this to agents that take up space in your life and home, and the problem compounds: there is no escaping devices by turning off your data or closing your app if it can come up and ask how you are doing.", "I am a big proponent of these technologies, but the framing of (one important reason) why the large companies are investing heavily in the area is important. There are many, many more huge gains that autonomous agents can have in homes \u2014 including safety for at-risk populations living alone, helping with chores, interfacing with your digital life (email) in conversation, and more. We need to make sure we build this right.", "Giving autonomous agents the ability to interact with the physical world.", "I think this a more nuanced topic than only translating state-of-the-art approaches in artificial intelligence and machine learning \u2014 learning with physical interaction is the first type of learning we experience. Children learn what new objects are by touching them and how they interact with their budding lives.", "The tasks of trying to learn in hardware has different constraints: samples are more valuable (we cannot run hardware forever), the results are interpretable visually (connecting well with how humans operate), and more proofs that the learning is possible to exist. We are trying to mimic nature because it works, but there is no reason that embodied-machine intelligence cannot far surpass how we humans learn.", "Building AI systems that are designed for hardware tunes the objectives and methods, creating a feedback loop to more digital AI methods that we interact with every day, like computer vision and natural language processing. I will continue to open up this box of how learning robots will synergize with traditional machine learning research.", "So, I want to expand the definition of embodied AI: learning how to learn, by letting autonomous agents have new ways of interacting with the world.", "To wrap up \u2014 learn about Facebook\u2019s robotics efforts, Facebook\u2019s in-home exploration push (Habitat), Microsoft\u2019s public research websites, Apple\u2019s job postings, or Google Brain\u2019s Robotics team.
