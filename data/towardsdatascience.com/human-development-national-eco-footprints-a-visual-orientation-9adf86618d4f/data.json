If you don\u2019t quite share my enthusiasm, check out some of the interactive, sometimes entertaining, sometimes culturally-relevant projects of The Pudding\u2019s \u201cjournalist-engineers\u201d. In my opinion, they\u2019re leading the way for the art of data visualization. That said, data scientists absent of the ability to blow minds with their visualizations alone and with time-sensitive questions all their own have accessible resources to quickly stand up data communications that are both informative and digestible.", "Visualizations aside (for now), here are some questions I\u2019ve been throwing around recently: do we share a standard global definition of human progress? How should education and health be weighed against economic wealth in assessing a nation\u2019s development? Does a nation\u2019s effort to nurture its people necessitate a greater ecological footprint and greater spending of finite natural resources? Which countries are leading the way forward, and which are not? I\u2019ll be exploring these ideas below while diving into some useful Python libraries for scraping the web and visualizing related information.", "Gross Domestic Product (GDP) seems to be the most readily available and heavily cited metric in conversations concerning national \u2018growth\u2019. Though easily measurable and comparable, a higher GDP certainly doesn\u2019t guarantee that a typical citizen is better off in one place than elsewhere. Billions of dollars each year are spent in the US extracting oil, and GDP grows with it. China, one of the world\u2019s largest emitters of carbon dioxide, has also seen incredible growth in GDP while citizens exist in highly polluted living and working environments. The metric of GDP is 1-dimensional and clearly has its limitations in measuring real progress. In response, the United Nations have often referenced a new metric called the Human Development Index (HDI), which not only takes into account per capita GDP but also indicators such as life expectancy, literacy rates, enrollment ratios. There\u2019s also the inequality-adjusted HDI (IHDI), which is similar but penalizes countries for uneven distribution of health, education, and income. Keep in mind this not a perfect metric as it\u2019s not easily interpretable (between 0 & 1), and a ranking will depend on the growth of others, but it is a bit more comprehensive than GDP as a guide to progress, which is the main reason I chose to focus on HDI for a quick dive into data scraping, searching, cleaning, merging, and visualizing. On to the data exploration process!", "I used the Python libraries BeautifulSoup, Requests, & Pandas to scrape a simple table of data from Wikipedia. After importing the libraries, I parsed the Wikipedia table, extracted the text for countries and HDI, and put each into a list object, depicted below:", "After creating a Pandas dataframe with IHDI values by Country Name, I\u2019m able to structure a variable (\u2018data\u2019) that can be passed into the plot.ly methods, displayed below:", "Plotly is great because it\u2019s easy to use, dynamic, and interactive. As great as it can be at times, relying on a 3rd party resource for data science can eventually be costly in terms of price, complexity, and availability of documentation, so I definitely appreciate straightforward libraries like matplotlib. Below you can hover over countries to view individual IHDI values, pan the map in any direction, and zoom in/out, and reset it to the original scale \u2014 all using the plot.ly buttons in the top right of the embed.", "We can now easily see that countries such as Canada, Australia, Japan, Iceland, and a handful of Scandinavian countries index really highly in this particular measure of inequality-adjusted Human Development. They are leaders in striking a good balance of economic strength, education, and wellness in their development efforts, and such benefits have likely been disseminated more evenly to a larger portion of their citizens. Governments looking to improve their own score should look to emulate some of the values and actions employed by these nations moving forward. The US has been penalized a bit on the inequality-adjusted scale (down to 25th from 13th place in HDI). African nations such as the Central African Republic, South Sudan, and Niger are clearly in urgent need of improved educational enrollment, per capita income, public health services, and other determinants of economic opportunity and average life expectancy. These things may be obvious without a map, but a choropleth allows us to clearly see how land mass, oceans, borders, and nearest neighbors may contribute to the value measured. It can be used as a sort of geographic table of contents to guide further awareness and future research.", "Does economic growth necessitate damage to our biosphere? Do the eco-footprints of developed nations correspond to their biocapacity, or are we spending resources at a deficit? Which countries are increasing their IHDI without depending as much on finite natural resources? Which countries are burning through natural resources, and not necessarily growing their economies? How have these factors changed over time, by country, by continent, with respect to total and per capita metrics, and populations? How could I possibly visualize all this in a digestible way?", "To explore these questions briefly and visually, I downloaded, cleaned, and merged *.csv data from the World Bank and the Global Footprint Network on Kaggle using Pandas. Without going into too much detail, I\u2019ll summarize some of the cleaning hurdles I ran into:", "After cleaning and loading the merged data into a Pandas dataframe, I created a bubble plot using a Python library called Bubbly that depends on NumPy, Pandas, and Plot.ly. Each bubble plot can, incredibly, take arguments for up to six meaningful variables at once!", "What to look for in the following visualization:", "*Click to Explore Interactive Chart (Biocapacity pc vs. Eco-Footprint pc)*", "Insights: Biocapacity Per Capita vs. Eco-Footprint Per Capita", "Keeping in mind this analysis is not predictive, but descriptive, we can conclude that some countries are developing and growing in a more sustainable and healthy way than others, but we can\u2019t quite comment about a potential relationship between variables, nor causation. Also, keep in mind this chart helps us analyze a strictly ecological ratio that, although interesting, ignores plenty of meaningful factors that might help assess past performance and motivate new action, and is truncated at 2014.", "Bolivia is looking really good here (for now)! The South American nation has a biocapacity 5x greater than its footprint (a 16:3 ratio), an astounding net positive ecologically. The story in Bolivia is not flawless, however. This is a country that has been experiencing rising rates of deforestation since the turn of the century, primarily related to the conversion of forests to large-scale agriculture and pasture, particularly in the Chaco. It\u2019s South American counterpart, Brazil sits at a similar footprint per capita, while has about half the biocapacity per capita. This effect, on the per capita scale, seems to balance the benefit of Amazon with its enormous population. In the United States, we\u2019re using up about 2.3x what the ecology provides \u2014 an operating deficit that is tough to ignore. China (3.8x) and India (2.4x) round out the leaders (or lack thereof), with similarly terrible ratios on a per capita basis and, expectedly, the largest total footprints. The least efficient ratio of footprint to biocapacity on a per capita basis on the chart \u2014 Qatar, which, along with its neighbors, the World Health Organization has called the world\u2019s most toxic nations. Each dot seems to tell a new story. Each story seems to reveal a need for continued awareness and action.", "Another Bubble Chart: HDI vs. Eco-Footprint Per Capita", "In order to look at a different set of variables on the bubble chart, I manipulated the \u2018figure\u2019 object (displayed in Python code above) with new arguments for x_column, y_column, and bubble_column (size).", "*Explore Interactive Chart Here (HDI vs. Eco-Footprint pc)*", "Insights: HDI vs. Eco-Footprint Per Capita", "Do national human development efforts necessitate damage to an ecology? There are certainly economic benefits from digging for oil, for example, something we benefit from every time we get in a car. At the same time, there are ways to effectively redirect that benefit to programs that would improve a metric like HDI. Easier said than done, of course, but what countries are doing well given that sometimes indirect, often direct, tradeoff?", "Europe, on average, seems to set the standard for human progress alongside eco-consciousness. Shout out to Spain, Portugal, Italy, Romania, Hungary, and Cyprus for managing to curb their per capita footprint, while sitting in or near the upper tier of national HDI. Most of Europe sits in or near that tier, but some of the European countries not mentioned seemingly made it there with a bit more willingness to overexert their ecological resources. Africa is another continent where most nations seem to remain clustered on this bubble chart. On average, most African nations sit in the bottom half of the HDI ranking, though none seem to be huge perpetrators of ecological damage. North African nations Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia have the most ideal ratio of the bunch, possibly achieved by the perk of being on the Mediterranean near many standard-setting European countries.", "Asian nations don\u2019t appear to be clustered clearly, though there are a few trends and important observations to note. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Oman, and some close neighbors seem to have made incredible progress on the HDIndex from 2000 through 2014 but have also all seen similarly drastic spikes in their reliance on natural resources to make it happen. War and corruption aside, numerous open trade policy reforms, diversification beyond oil, and the effort to integrate into the global economy have been a positive for the HDI and the overall standard of living of citizens in the region.", "The US, Canada, Australia, Denmark, and Singapore seem to be the highly developed environmental culprits of the bunch. Our current standard of living in the US may not have been achieved without a real toll on the environment. We can be equally grateful for what we have, and equally committed to improving our systems and values going forward. These vast, intimidating advances certainly start locally. We can all teach someone something, plant something, take quick showers, finish your food, ride a bicycle, and vote.", "I hope you enjoyed the read,", "View my GitHub repository for project data, code, and details.", "Stay tuned as I move forward from here with additional technical posts as I dive further into data science.
