We will cover all the topics related to Tensors in Tensorflow in these five simple steps:", "Tensors are TensorFlow\u2019s multi-dimensional arrays with uniform type. They are very similar to NumPy arrays, and they are immutable, which means that they cannot be altered once created. You can only create a new copy with the edits.", "Let\u2019s see how Tensors work with code example. But first, to work with TensorFlow objects, we need to import the TensorFlow library. We often use NumPy with TensorFlow, so let\u2019s also import NumPy with the following lines:", "There are several ways to create a tf.Tensor object. Let\u2019s start with a few examples. You can create Tensor objects with several TensorFlow functions, as shown in the below examples:", "As you can see, we created Tensor objects with the shape (1, 5) with three different functions and a fourth Tensor object with the shape (5, )using tf.range() function. Note that tf.ones and tf.zeros accepts the shape as the required argument since their element values are pre-determined.", "TensorFlow Tensors are created as tf.Tensor objects, and they have several characteristic features. First of all, they have a rank based on the number of dimensions they have. Secondly, they have a shape, a list that consists of the lengths of all their dimensions. All tensors have a size, which is the total number of elements within a Tensor. Finally, their elements are all recorded in a uniform Dtype (data type). Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of these features.", "Tensors are categorized based on the number of dimensions they have:", "For example, we can create a Rank-3 tensor by passing a three-level nested list object to the tf.constant function. For this example, we can split the numbers into a 3-level nested list with three-element at each level:", "We can view the number of dimensions that our `rank_3_tensor` object currently has with the `.ndim` attribute.", "The shape feature is another attribute that every Tensor has. It shows the size of each dimension in the form of a list. We can view the shape of the rank_3_tensor object we created with the .shape attribute, as shown below:", "As you can see, our tensor has 2 elements at the first level, 2 elements in the second level, and 3 elements in the third level.", "Size is another feature that Tensors have, and it means the total number of elements a Tensor has. We cannot measure the size with an attribute of the Tensor object. Instead, we need to use tf.size() function. Finally, we will convert the output to NumPy with the instance function .numpy() to get a more readable result:", "Tensors often contain numerical data types such as floats and ints, but may contain many other data types such as complex numbers and strings.", "Each Tensor object, however, must store all its elements in a single uniform data type. Therefore, we can also view the type of data selected for a particular Tensor object with the .dtype attribute, as shown below:", "An index is a numerical representation of an item\u2019s position in a sequence. This sequence can refer to many things: a list, a string of characters, or any arbitrary sequence of values.", "TensorFlow also follows standard Python indexing rules, which is similar to list indexing or NumPy array indexing.", "Let\u2019s create a rank_1_tensor with the following lines:", "Now, let\u2019s create our rank_2_tensor object with the following code:", "and test the 4th rule with several examples:", "Now, we covered the basics of indexing, so let\u2019s take a look at the basic operations we can conduct on Tensors.", "You can easily do basic math operations on tensors such as:", "Let\u2019s see these operations in action. We will create two Tensor objects and apply these operations.", "Let\u2019s continue with the element-wise multiplication.", "We can also do matrix multiplication:", "NOTE: Matmul operations lays in the heart of deep learning algorithms. Therefore, although you will not use matmul directly, it is crucial to be aware of these operations.", "Examples of other operations we listed above:", "Just as in NumPy arrays and pandas DataFrames, you can reshape Tensor objects as well.", "The tf.reshape operations are very fast since the underlying data does not need to be duplicated. For the reshape operation, we can use thetf.reshape() function. Let's use the tf.reshape function in code:", "As you can see, we can easily reshape our Tensor objects. But beware that when doing reshape operations, a developer must be reasonable. Otherwise, the Tensor might get mixed up or can even raise an error. So, look out for that \ud83d\ude00.", "When we try to do combined operations using multiple Tensor objects, the smaller Tensors can stretch out automatically to fit larger tensors, just as NumPy arrays can. For example, when you attempt to multiply a scalar Tensor with a Rank-2 Tensor, the scalar is stretched to multiply every Rank-2 Tensor element. See the example below:", "Thanks to broadcasting, you don\u2019t have to worry about matching sizes when doing math operations on Tensors.", "We tend to generate Tensors in a rectangular shape and store numerical values as elements. However, TensorFlow also supports irregular, or specialized, Tensor types, which are:", "Let's take a closer look at what each of them is.", "Ragged tensors are tensors with different numbers of elements along the size axis, as shown in Figure X.", "You can build a Ragged Tensor, as shown below:", "String Tensors are tensors, which stores string objects. We can build a String Tensor just as you create a regular Tensor object. But, we pass string objects as elements instead of numerical objects, as shown below:", "Finally, Sparse Tensors are rectangular Tensors for sparse data. When you have holes (i.e., Null values) in your data, Sparse Tensors are to-go objects. Creating a sparse Tensor is a bit time consuming and should be more mainstream. But, here is an example:", "We have successfully covered the basics of TensorFlow\u2019s Tensor objects.", "Give yourself a pat on the back!", "This should give you a lot of confidence since you are now much more informed about the building blocks of the TensorFlow framework.", "Check Part 1 of this tutorial series:", "Continue with Part 3 of the series:", "If you would like to have access to full code on Google Colab and the rest of my latest content, consider subscribing to the mailing list:", "If you like this article, consider checking out my other similar articles:", "Finally, if you are interested in applied deep learning tutorials, check out some of my articles:", "Your home for data science.
