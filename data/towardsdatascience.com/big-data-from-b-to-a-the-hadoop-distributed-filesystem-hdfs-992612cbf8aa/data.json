Therefore, comes the need for a reliable system, called distributed filesystems, to control how data is stored and retrieved. However, many challenges emerge with the implementation of such infrastructure, for instance, handling hardware failure without losing data.", "In this article, we\u2019ll focus on Hadoop\u2019s distributed filesystem \u2014 HDFS, its design, its architecture, and the data flow.", "The Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a distributed file system designed to:", "Hadoop is designed to run on affordable devices commonly available from multiple vendors. The nature of the hardware gives an extreme scalability within a cluster; the bad units can be easily replaced without expensive costs. Although the probability of hardware failure gets higher within a large cluster, HDFS will continue to work without a noticeable change.", "HDFS is made for handling large files by dividing them into blocks, replicating them, and storing them in the different cluster nodes. Thus, its ability to be highly fault-tolerant and reliable.", "HDFS is designed to store large datasets in the range of gigabytes or terabytes, or even petabytes.", "Streaming data and providing high throughput", "The write-once model that assumes data never changes after it is written simplifies replication. Thanks to this model and to the independent parallel processing, the data throughput speeds up.", "HDFS has a master/slave architecture. It consists of:", "The files associated with the metadata are:", "From Hadoop version 0.21.0 onward, a new type of namenode, called a backup node, was introduced to maintains the up-to-date state of the namespace by receiving edits from the namenode, besides a checkpoint node, which creates a checkpoint of the namespace is replacing the secondary namenode.", "*Block: A disk has a block size, which is the minimum amount of data that it can read or write. Files in HDFS are broken into block-sized chunks, which are stored as independent units. The default size of a block in HDFS is 128 MB (Hadoop 2.x) and 64 MB (Hadoop 1.x).", "To read a file from HDFS, the client opens the file it wishes to read, and the Distributed Filesystem communicates to the NameNode for the metadata. The NameNode responds with the number of blocks, their location, and their details. The client then calls read() on the stream returned by the Distributed Filesystem, and it connects to the first (closest) datanode for the first block in the file. When a block ends, DFSInputStream will close the connection to the datanode, then find the best datanode for the next block. This happens transparently to the client, which from its point of view, is just reading a continuous stream. When the client has finished reading, it calls close() on the FSDataInputStream.", "When a client wants to write a file to HDFS, it calls create() on DistributedFileSystem that communicates to the namenode to create a new file in the filesystem\u2019s namespace, with no blocks associated with it. If the file doesn\u2019t already exist, and the client has the right permissions, the NameNode creates the file; otherwise, file creation fails, and the client is thrown an IOException. The DistributedFileSystem returns an FSDataOutputStream for the client to start writing data to. As the client writes data, DFSOutputStream splits it into packets, which it writes to an internal queue, called the data queue. The data queue is consumed by the Data Streamer, whose responsibility it is to ask the namenode to allocate new blocks by picking a list of suitable datanodes to store the replicas. The list of datanodes forms a pipeline. The DataStreamer streams the packets to the first datanode in the pipeline, which stores the packet and forwards it to the second datanode in the pipeline and so on. DFSOutputStream also maintains an internal queue of packets that are waiting to be acknowledged by datanodes, called the ack queue. A packet is removed from the ack queue only when it has been acknowledged by all the datanodes in the pipeline. When the client has finished writing data, it calls close() on the stream. This action flushes all the remaining packets to the datanode pipeline and waits for acknowledgments before contacting the namenode to signal that the file is complete. The namenode already knows which blocks the file is made up of (via Data Streamer asking for block allocations), so it only has to wait for blocks to be minimally replicated before returning successfully.", "To conclude, HDFS is a reliable, distributed filesystem to stores large files across big data clusters. It was designed to be scalable, highly available, and fault-tolerant. Its architecture helps to manage the distributed storage across the network of machines and maintain replicas in the case of hardware failure.", "The \u201cBig data from B to A\u201d article series covers all Big Data concepts: Business concepts, its tools, its frameworks, etc.", "For more articles like this, please make sure to follow to get the latest updates.", "You can also join me on my social media profiles Linkedin and Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
