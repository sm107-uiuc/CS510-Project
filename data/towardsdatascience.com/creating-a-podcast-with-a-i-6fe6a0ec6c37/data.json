There were \u2014 and are \u2014 various approaches to generate music using algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. Towards Data Science has already a decent collection of essays on AI Music.", "Still, it has that nice but limited MIDI quality.", "OpenAI had another approach. JukeBox is a Neural Network, trained on a dataset of 1.2 million songs (600,000 of which are in English). Using self-attention benefits of transformer it generates new music pieces. You get neither a MIDI-scores anymore, nor simple melodies, but an entire audio \u201crecording\u201d. Top-even transformers predict audio tokens along to genre and artist conditioning. This, combined with corresponding lyrics, trained on LyricWiki makes JukeBox to something fully novel.", "There are some limitations \u2014 in lengths, in content-related songwriting (you hear either existing texts to new sounds, or GPT-2 generated lyrics or incomprehensible language imitation), and hardware-intensity. You need a good system to generate new sounds. Luckily, there are two options:", "With more than 7k music pieces, searchable after genres, artists and other features give you enough insights into the capacity of JukeBox.", "It is not official, but it works very well: \u201cInteracting_with_Jukebox.ipynb\u201d.", "This notebook is far from stable (here are some interesting workarounds to let it run better) \u2014 and it needs time. A lot of time. It produces at one session 3 music tracks \u2014 and top-level running from Level 2 to Level 0 can be around 8 hours long. With a danger for your notebook to crash and to lose all the data and checkpoints. But when it runs, it is powerful. You can define genre and interpreters \u2014 and cross-mix them as you want.", "Here is an example. This was one of the first runs \u2014 and it overwhelmed me at the end.", "The initial Level 2 has still much noise:", "Level 1 (after around 4 hours iterative upsampling) has some more clarity:", "But when you have luck and your Notebook don\u2019t crash \u2014 after 8 hours you get something beautiful, like a glimpse to another world, a narration of a documentary about an unknown culture, in a language you never will understand:", "Look how the music evolves and the unearthly voice sings. One minute \u2014 and it\u2019s over. And you also understand that you never will be able to hear the continuation of this piece, or this interpret. Because the results are unique. There is no score elsewhere. This is the only original.", "Here are just some interesting pieces for your delight:", "A noisy feel-good mix of Folk and British Rock:", "A radio broadcast alike song with comments:", "Some classical organ music with modulations between Samuel Barber, Enya, and Yoko Kanno:", "And then this perfect Jazz freestyle improvisation:", "Check out Playlist with AI-generated Music I did use various approaches. With earworm potential.", "Now we have a music library. But for which cases can be used a piece of music outside usual solfeggio standards, with unknown languages and sometimes buggy and glitchy?", "The big benefit is \u2014 it\u2019s copyright free. Because if JukeBox as a framework is the property of OpenAI, the music you generate with it is yours.", "The basics are almost the same as in my Article \u201cAI as Moviemaker\u201d.", "Generally, you need the following Podcast components:", "And Artificial Intelligence grants you all the possibilities.", "For my first episode of MERZeye I used:", "Here, like in my previous movies I used Replika Studios. There are various existing solutions at the moment, but the voices library and quality of Replika Studios convinced me by some unique theatrical quality. Other solutions are rather good for informational videos or moderation.", "For both Alchemists I used voices of Solomon (Aged Gentleman with British Theater Voice, good for Shakespeare stage plays) and Greta (American Lady with emotional intonation):", "Here you can post the whole script and assign the voices to specific phrases. Meanwhile, even emotional adjustments are possible (like Greta above: \u201cannoyed\u201d or \u201clively\u201d).", "Now you just need to mix it in a multitrack audio editor of your choice \u2014 and voila!", "Have you any other ideas, how we can use all those creative generative media models?
