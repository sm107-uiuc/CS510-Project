Thanks for taking the time to read this article \u2014 but before you do, I made a video that talks about the same topic and can be found here which you might find useful.", "I\u2019m sure those that have asked the same question are already aware of the current situation in the job market. Companies are generating and collecting more data than ever. They need people that are equipped with the necessary skills to derive actionable insights from data to generate more profit.", "This trend has spurred a series of new master\u2019s programs from universities everywhere to satisfy this demand. A lot of prospective students are asking the same questions that I were asking a few years ago:", "Do I need a master\u2019s to be a Data Scientist? Is it worth the time and money?", "I\u2019ve received a number of messages from prospective students asking similar questions. My short, biased answer would be that yes, it\u2019s worth the time and money. It also most definitely helped me with my career. In reality though, it really depends on the individual.", "I graduated with a maths degree in 2016 without any knowledge of data science. So like most graduates, I applied for analyst jobs through a graduate recruitment agency.", "Once I was working as an analyst, I realised there\u2019s a lot of things a maths degree doesn\u2019t teach you, both technically and socially.", "At the start, I strugged with basic things like querying a SQL database. It was hard creating simple data visualisations and then communicating the results to stakeholders.", "As I became more comfortable being an analyst, I began learning about data science and machine learning. It was during that time that I realised I lacked the technical skill and experience about programming in general. This was especially true for Python which is arguably the most popular data science language at the moment.", "I wanted to learn more about the computer science aspect of data science, but it was really hard for me to stay disciplined whilst working a full-time job. I decided that I had three options:", "The last two options felt unrealistic for me. I lacked both the experience and technical skill, and finding the discipline to stay on track with self-studying was hard. Plus, there\u2019s no guarantee the company could offer such a position in the future.", "Working as an analyst probably could\u2019ve still provided me the relevant experience required. I could also develop my technical skills by doing projects on the side. The problem with this approach was the lack of rigour and structure. It was what I needed to achieve anything significant in a short amount of time.", "Hence, it made the most sense for me to create some savings and go with the first choice. Devote a year of my time to study something that I was passionate about. I decided that I\u2019d rather quit than work as an analyst for a few years with only the hopes of transitioning to a Data Scientist role later.", "I graduated from my master\u2019s a few months before the lockdown happened in the UK. During those first few months, I was having little success with my job search and the lockdown made the situation worse.", "I decided to take a step back and re-evaluate the skills and projects that I had to offer which would make me stand out. Despite lacking in work experience, the data science master\u2019s was always a good starting point for my CV.", "I felt much more qualified after having the master\u2019s despite my little work experience. Passing the initial job requirements was noticeably easier due to the things I\u2019ve learnt from it. It gave me plenty of projects to talk about and provided a much stronger foundation to work on my own projects. Tackling those projects would\u2019ve been siginificantly harder before I started the master\u2019s.", "For example, I worked on a computer vision project during lockdown to improve my data processing and machine learning knowledge. At the time, it would\u2019ve been hard to muster the confidence to start and finish the project.", "And I think it\u2019s that confidence which had the biggest impact to me. The structure of a master\u2019s really forced me to learn a lot in a very short amount of time.", "I could progress much quicker to being a data scientist by building the foundation that I was lacking previously.", "In August, I finally landed a job as a data scientist. It would\u2019ve been difficult for me to get this position without the experience and qualification gained from the master\u2019s degree. My job search was easier during the summer thanks to the portfolio that I built, an improved data science skillset and the understanding of what companies are looking for in a data scientist.", "With all that being said, I still don\u2019t think someone needs a data science master\u2019s. The best part about the internet is that almost everything is available online. You can build a portfolio of the same quality if you have the motivation and discipline to study and finish meaningful projects on your own. You\u2019ll save a lot of money too.", "Additionally, if you\u2019re already working, then returning to school isn\u2019t easy. Going from financial stability to having no income can be a difficult transition. If you already work in a data-oriented role with a senior position, the experience alone is likely more valuable. You can do projects outside of work to make up for the technical skills that you think you\u2019re lacking.", "But it does have the potential to fast-track your career to working as a data scientist. If you\u2019re in a situation like I was, I still think it\u2019s one of the best ways to get a solid understanding of what data science is about. You won\u2019t regret starting the degree if you\u2019re willing to sacrifice the time and money and you\u2019re truly passionate about data science.", "An important thing to keep in mind though, is that not all data science masters are created equal. Master\u2019s degrees aren\u2019t cheap these days so it\u2019s important to do your research into what each course offers. You can then decide whether the selection of modules (and especially projects) will actually be of any use to you in the future.", "Those that have a fair amount of work experience with data will probably do better at this. However, I\u2019ve seen many students avoiding harder modules and then regret it later. In some cases, they might end up needing to learn it again at work (e.g. machine learning).", "Be smart about the time spent during the year, and I\u2019m sure the investment will be worth it.", "Your home for data science.
