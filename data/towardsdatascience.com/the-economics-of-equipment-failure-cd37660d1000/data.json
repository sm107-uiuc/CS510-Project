This means I have spent most of my time focused on humans. There\u2019s one thing I can say with certainty. Sometimes people are completely rational and logical. Sometimes people are totally, completely and utterly incomprehensible.", "Over the past five years or so, I\u2019ve had the opportunity to branch into the industrial sector. In the industrial sector, the primary focus is on optimizing machines, not humans. It\u2019s been interesting for sure.", "One focus area that continues to rear its head in the industrial sector is machine asset health. In other words, how healthy is my asset or fleet of assets?", "The health of assets can take many forms. Sometimes it is expressed as a time to failure (how long until the machine breaks). Other times it is expressed as a health score. For example, a machine that is about to fail may have a health score of 5 and a machine that is not likely to break may have a health score of 100.", "Time to failure and health scores typically come from statistical models that predict failure or expected lifetime. Obviously the two are related. Of course it can vary, but time to failure estimates are usually based on a survival model. Asset health scores are usually based on a logistic regression or some decision tree model (GBT or Random Forest).", "The primary question that I hear when talking about machine assets and machine asset health is, \u201cWhen is it going to fail\u201d? From this, the conversation almost always migrates to, \u201cOk, Mr. Data Scientist, how accurately can you predict the failure of my assets?\u201d Sometimes, this absolutely is the right question to ask. Sometimes it isn\u2019t. That is, sometimes your primary focus should be on failure prediction. Sometimes, it should be on \u201csomething else\u201d.", "This \u201csomething else\u201d is the focus of this article.", "Linear programming is definitely not new. It, and its kissing cousin non-linear programming, have been around for a long-time. Lately, I have heard these two concepts referred to as decision optimization or prescriptive analytics. Prescriptive analytics allows you to optimize a resource relative to some criteria. When I say optimize, I mean optimize in the purest sense. I literally mean make the decision that optimizes an objective. In the business world, that usually means make a decision that will maximize revenue, minimize cost or maximize profit.", "The classic example of prescriptive analytics is crew scheduling for airlines. How do you assign pilots to routes so that you minimize the costs of moving your passengers from point a to point b? Another example is pricing optimization. For example, a company can charge any price it wants, but what price ensures the maximum profit?", "When I referred to \u201csomething else\u201d a few minutes ago, one of the things I was referring to is decision optimization or prescriptive analytics. That is, in many situations the data science question around managing machine assets isn\u2019t, \u201c how accurately can I predict failure?\u201d Rather, it should be, \u201cwhen should I service my assets to maximize the overall profitability of my business?\u201d", "The other \u201csomething else\u201d I was referring to is \u201cdo nothing\u201d or \u201crun to failure\u201d. In this case a descriptive solution or set of reports that describes failures after the fact is probably sufficient. In other words, sometimes you really don\u2019t need to worry about predictive analytics or prescriptive analytics. You just need to let stuff break, then fix it.", "So, how do you know if you should worry more about predictive, prescriptive or descriptive analytics? Of course, it depends on the economics.", "To further explore this problem, let me first define two costs that are relevant to equipment failure and maintenance.", "The first is Inventory Cost. Like the name suggests, inventory cost is the total cost of keeping replacement parts for a machine. This obviously includes the cost of physically storing the item, but it also includes the opportunity cost of storing the item. For example, if you buy extra batteries for the tv remote control and put them away knowing you will need them eventually, the opportunity cost is the candy bar you could have purchased had you decided that having extra batteries on-hand wasn\u2019t a priority. It is what you forego or give up when you make a specific consumption decision.", "Managers will think and act very differently depending on the cost to keep a replacement part on hand. Depending the part, this cost can vary dramatically. If a replacement part costs a dollar, it makes sense to keep a few dozen in a drawer somewhere convenient. If a replacement part is hazardous and can literally kill you, most wouldn\u2019t want it hanging around indefinitely. I mean who wants a gallon of hazardous chemicals stored indefinitely in the break room? Being slightly less dramatic, if a part costs 1 billion dollars, it probably doesn\u2019t make economic sense to have a bunch of them sitting around doing nothing. At a minimum you can put your billion dollars in a savings account and earn interest, right?", "The second cost is failure cost. The failure cost is what it costs when a machine fails. This includes costs like losses in production, litigation costs, damage to property and even the injury to or loss of human life.", "Again, failure costs can vary considerably. If the batteries go dead in my remote control, that\u2019s annoying. If the engines fail on a jet airplane, people will die.", "So, the inventory costs and the failure costs determine the best analytical approach to managing your machine assets. They answer whether you should be using a prescriptive, predictive or descriptive approach.", "A Machine Asset Wellness Decisioning (MAWD) Chart details, in a very simple way, how practitioners can effectively balance failure and inventory costs. A MAWD chart clearly dictates whether the economics of your problem suggest a descriptive, a predictive or a prescriptive analytics approach. Please see the MAWD Chart below.", "The vertical axis of the MAWD Chart is the continuum of inventory costs. The horizontal axis is the continuum of failure costs.", "Let\u2019s start in the southwest quadrant, which I labeled \u201cZone 1\u201d. In this quadrant there are low failure costs and low inventory costs. This is your \u201dRun to failure\u201d zone, given that storing replacement parts and failing is a relatively \u201cho-hum\u201d experience.", "The northwest quadrant is zone 2. Here, failure costs are low, but inventory costs are high. In this zone, the emphasis should be on prediction and predictive analytics. Because it is expensive to keep replacement parts on hand, a good predictive model will let you know when an asset part is likely to fail. Knowing when the part will fail minimizes the time a replacement part will sit in inventory.", "Because failure costs are low, maintenance is not a big concern. The objective should be to run to failure, but use predictive models to minimize inventory costs.", "Zone 3 is the northeast quadrant. Here inventory and failure costs are high. The emphasis in this area should be on both predictive and prescriptive analytics. You\u2019ll need predictive analytics to gauge the health of your assets and minimize inventory costs, but this isn\u2019t enough.", "In Zone 3, because the failure costs are high, you will need to use predictions of failure in a larger prescriptive analytics solution to ensure that your assets NEVER fail. The higher the cost of failure, the more a firm needs to ensure that failure never happens. When failure costs are high, the emphasis should be on optimizing the maintenance schedule, not just predicting failure. Optimizing the maintenance schedule allows you to minimize failures at the lowest possible cost. It makes sure everything works perfectly in a profit maximizing way.", "For example, if you currently maintain a group of assets every six months, prescriptive analytics may highlight that 10% of the assets need to be maintained every five months, while others can wait six or seven months.", "Smarter maintenance means fewer failures and higher profit.", "Again, predictive analytics will more than likely be a part of the prescriptive solution. For example, the decision to maintain will be based on many factors, including a prediction of the time to failure or asset health.", "Zone 4 is the southeast quadrant. Here the inventory costs are low, but the failure costs are high. In this scenario, you will again likely need both a predictive and prescriptive solution. A predictive solution to gauge asset health or time to failure. A prescriptive solution that takes predictive metrics and combines them with other factors to optimize the maintenance schedule. Like Zone 3, in Zone 4 the emphasis should be optimizing the maintenance schedule, not just predicting failure.", "So if someone says to you, \u201cHey Mr. Data Scientist. How accurately can you predict failure?\u201d You should say, \u201cHi Mr. Client. Before we go there, let\u2019s explore the economics of your machine assets.\u201d", "Having a conversation about the economics of the problem before jumping into a predictive model will always dramatically improve the odds of a successful client engagement.", "Your home for data science.
