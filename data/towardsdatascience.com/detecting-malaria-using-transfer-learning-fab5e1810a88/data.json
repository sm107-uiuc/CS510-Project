Then we will talk about the ML model used to detect malaria with the help of blood samples and the results of its performance.", "Malaria is one of the deadliest parasite-related diseases humankind has ever known. It has been around ever since humans have been on the face of the earth and it is certainly here for the long term.", "In 2018, 228 million were infected and 405'000 people died, making it a significant health concern and problem.  Africa is home to 94% of all malaria cases (2018), but it is also prevalent in southern China and present on nearly all continents. As malaria mainly hits African countries, it is even harder to contain and effectively fight this parasite. Indeed, the developing countries in which it prospers do not always have the appropriate resources to reduce their vulnerability to malaria. There are an estimated 12 billion US Dollars lost by malaria-hit countries per year, due to the inability of many citizens to work during big malaria outbreaks, high healthcare costs and adverse effects on tourism. Add to the pot around 2.7 billion Dollars of humanitarian aid and there is no doubt that malaria has a tremendous negative impact on the economy of affected countries.", "Malaria is actually only the name given to the disease. It is caused by a unicellular protozoan parasite known by its genus name, Plasmodium.", "Plasmodium comprises a wide variety of parasites, around 200, but only a handful can contaminate humans. As they are parasites, they use several hosts to feed and reproduce.", "5 species of plasmodium parasites can successfully parasite humans and be harmful to them, P. flaciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P.malariae, and P.knowlesi (P. stands for Plasmodium). While all of the 5 species cited can cause malaria, it is p.flaciparum that is usually lethal and causes severe malaria.", "These parasites have a rather simple life cycle compared to other types of parasites, as they only have two hosts, mosquitoes and humans.", "The parasite\u2019s life starts in the mosquito\u2019s gut, and after a multiplication stage, they move to the insect\u2019s salivary gland. When the mosquito feeds on humans for blood, the plasmodium goes into the human\u2019s blood flow. Following the infection, they first go in the liver and go through a multiplication phase. Once mature and in more significant numbers, they leave the liver and go in the red blood cells (erythrocytes).", "At this point, the parasite will keep multiplying until the body can effectively fight the infection. Some of the plasmodium will differentiate into sexual egg-like cells and will freely flow in the humans\u2019 blood until a mosquito feeds again and uptakes them. Once in the mosquitoes gut again, the male egg-like cell will fertilize the female, and the cycle can start again.", "Malaria fevers usually occur when the plasmodium burst out of the erythrocytes in big numbers and provoke an immune response such as high fever, vomiting, nausea, and headaches. As many red blood cells are being lysed, it can also result in anemia in some instances and this anemia can lead to several organ failures and metabolic acidosis.", "The best way to effectively fight the parasite lies more in prevention above all else. This includes using mosquito repellent as well as insecticide-treated mosquito nets when sleeping at night. Some high-risk areas are also smoked with insecticide in order to avoid having too many mosquitoes.", "Once infected, several medications exist, but this medication must be given very rapidly to avoid severe harm or even death of the individual.", "One big problem with this parasite and probably one of the main reasons it is still around is its ability to rapidly evolve and develop resistance to the medication it encounters. As the mosquitoes develop resistance to insecticides, it makes it even harder to fight malaria. Additionally, the unhygienic conditions in developing countries, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, are an ideal mosquito breeding ground, especially in the rainy seasons when the insects have many puddles to lay their eggs in.", "The most effective way to avoid severe complications from malaria is to give a rapid diagnosis. This will avoid death as well as contain the parasite, so as not to infect more people.", "The most common way to detect a malaria infection is to carry out microscopic blood analysis. This does not require a complex set of skills, however, basic medical knowledge is essential. The problem is that in developing countries the appropriate medical material and personnel are not always readily available, making this diagnosis slower than desirable if not non-existent.", "Another major issue is that when the resources are available, there is a trend to overestimate the number of infected individuals. Many studies suggest that there is a huge problem of overdiagnosis (as high as 98% wrong diagnosis in some certain rural health centers (Angola, 2012). This results in a massive misuse of malaria treatment and therefore, could end in a shortage of malaria drugs. Plus, this misuse of medication lowers the patients\u2019 response to the drugs when really sick as well as strengthening the plasmodium\u2019s resistance. Finally, this entrenches the lack of appropriate knowledge necessary to do the microscopic blood analysis.", "We have seen that misuse of resources is a major problem, but how could money be better invested in order to help with malaria?", "A. I could be the answer and on many sides. First and foremost, rapidly detecting this disease using A.I and ML programs could save countless lives by quickly giving a diagnosis. Not only would it be faster than a human, but it could potentially be much more accurate, given the numbers seen earlier. This accuracy would lead to better management of the medication, leading to enormous money savings. Those savings could then be reinjected and be of better use.", "Taking photos of red blood cells is very easy and one would only need a microscope and an adaptor ring to take pictures of the erythrocytes. Once the photo is taken, it would be possible to simply run it through an ML program, trained to recognize infected cells.", "Given the rather simple way to detect an infection, we thought we could try to develop a malaria detection program using Giotto, no code involved. The point would be to input unclassified images of red blood cells and let the program do the classification, with satisfactory accuracy.", "Giotto is a machine learning platform that can develop an ML program in image classification, without having to code. For a more detailed, step-by-step description of Giotto, you can read one of our previous blog-posts.", "No-code platforms are straightforward to use, and this could really democratize A.I. Not only can anyone use it, but the possibility to deploy a docker means with only a computer and no wifi, you can use A.I in the simplest way. This is a critical point as many of the high-risk malaria zones are very remote and, therefore, don\u2019t have access to decent internet connexion. If this worked, rural communities would not have to travel to the closest health center (keeping in mind that this is very far sometimes). The point would not be to replace human expertise, but when there are no other choices, this could be an answer.", "The key to properly train a program is to have the appropriate data. This means that you need to have adequately labeled folders of each class to analyze as well as more less same number of images in each folder (when talking about image classification, of course). We used a data set composed of 27'558 images of erythrocytes, half parasited, and half normal.", "In order to work with this data set, we first had to upload it to Giotto. We then had to choose the data augmentation techniques that had to be applied to our images. In this case, all of the methods were applied, as none of them would alter the images\u2019 integrity. By doing this augmentation process, we boosted our model\u2019s performance by feeding it more data than the initial set.", "Once this was done, we had to choose all of the specificities of our model, such as the resNet number and the number of epochs. Our model performed best with a resNet 34 and 30 epochs.", "Training time was rather long on this project as the data set was massive; it took around 3 hours to complete the training.", "With a 20% validation split, our model achieved 97.88% accuracy, without a single line of code.", "This accuracy is satisfying as the setting chosen for the program are not too high (resNet 34 and 30 epochs). Very similar results were achieved with 10 epochs already (~96%).", "Despite medicine\u2019s impressive innovations, this parasite still thrives in many parts of the world, taking hundreds of thousands of lives every year. Finding new ways to fight malaria is crucial. This could help millions as well as promote economic development in high-risk areas.", "97.88% accuracy is satisfactory, especially as this was achieved after training of only 3 hours, using absolutely no code. In low resource locations, this could easily achieve better results than someone who has little if no training to run an appropriate analysis. Such an easy application would be straightforward to deploy in rural places, allowing populations to self- medicate if there is no other choice.", "You can try the program yourself : https://cloud.giotto.ai/ic/malaria password: malaria123", "Your home for data science.
