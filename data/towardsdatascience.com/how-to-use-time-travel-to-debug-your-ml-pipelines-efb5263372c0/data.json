The latter can introduce ghost issues, that are not so easy to debug: for example, data leakage (i.e., when information outside the training dataset is used to create the model) can affect the model\u2019s generalization ability, but it won\u2019t throw an exception during training.", "To avoid this kind of errors, we should be able to peek into the pipeline and detect them early. Thus, data scientists end up inspecting logs, print raw metrics and create visualizations, like learning curves and confusion matrices.", "While these tools offer valuable insight for building more robust models, it would be great if we could travel back in time and explore the state of a running step. In this story, we explore how we can do exactly that, in Kubeflow Pipelines.", "Learning Rate is a newsletter for those who are curious about the world of AI and MLOps. You\u2019ll hear from me every Friday with updates and thoughts on the latest AI news and articles. Subscribe here!", "First, we need a workstation. Setting up Kubeflow is not an easy task, especially if you have no experience with Kubernetes. But that shouldn\u2019t stop you; we can use MiniKF on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) to spin up a single-node cluster in 10 minutes.", "For best performance, it is recommended to keep the default VM configuration", "That\u2019s it! The deployment takes up to ten minutes, and you can watch the progress by following the on-screen instructions; ssh into the machine, run minikf on the terminal and wait until you have your endpoint and credentials ready.", "Now, we are ready to visit the Kubeflow Dashboard. Click on the URL, enter your credentials, and you\u2019re ready to go!", "For more details about the deployment process, as well as how to start a Jupyter server, read the following story:", "To demonstrate how you can turn back at a certain point in time and explore the state of a pipeline step, we need the pipeline itself. It\u2019s effortless to create a Kubeflow Pipeline from your Jupyter Notebook without writing a single line of code. You can see how, in the story below.", "For this example, we assume that you have run a pipeline successfully. If you want to follow the aforementioned story, we use the well-known Titanic dataset to train five different classifiers. In the end, your pipeline should look similar to this:", "So, suppose we are not happy with the SVM algorithm results. We would like to return to this step, before training the algorithm and explore the state of our world live, in a Notebook. To do this, we turn to Rok!", "Rok is a data management product that allows you to snapshot, version, package, distribute, and clone your full environment along with its data. It is natively integrated with Kubernetes as one of its supported platforms and is deployed in minutes on an existing cluster, on-prem, or the cloud.", "It comes pre-installed in MiniKF, so let\u2019s use it:", "When the notebook server is ready, connect to it, and a New JupyterLab environment will open precisely at the point you requested. All the cells up until this point are executed for you. You can continue your work from this cell; explore the variable state, the dataset and your model.", "You now have a way to debug errors by exploring what was happening in your pipeline at a particular point in time. This is certainly more valuable than raw logs and more powerful than static visualizations.", "In this story, we saw how we can use Rok, a data management service, to travel back in time and explore the state of a pipeline step live, in a Jupyter Notebook. This gives us the power to debug our ML pipelines but also version them. If you care about versioning, take a look at the following article.", "My name is Dimitris Poulopoulos and I\u2019m a machine learning engineer working for Arrikto.
