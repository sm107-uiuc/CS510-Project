While a lot of work has been done in regards to 3D Computer Vision but it has been mostly focused on creating systems for Autonomous Vehicles.", "Objectron dataset provides us with short videos of 8 classes of commonplace objects along with 3D bounding boxes for each of the frames along with a plethora of data such as camera poses, sparse point-clouds, and the characterization of plane surfaces around the objects. All-in-all, you get 15K annotated videos along 4M annotated frames, covering 10 countries from around the globe.", "Let\u2019s delve deeper now. First of all, let\u2019s look at the class distribution in the dataset. This dataset is imbalanced \ud83d\ude22. To give you an idea mathematically, this dataset has a Shannon\u2019s Entropy of 3.06. But, then there are many ways to alleviate that issue such as downsampling, creating synthetic data, loss functions that handle class imbalance such as focal loss etc.", "With most examples belonging to book and the least to bike, this dataset focuses more on objects you would find indoors.", "For evaluation of 3D object detection, we have the 3D counterpart of IoU (Intersection over Union) i.e. 3D IoU. This works by finding the intersection points of the 3D bounding boxes and then, using volume instead of area to do the calculation of IoU.", "This is the field that will most benefit from this dataset. Datasets with indoor objects are less publicly available while most of them focusing on Autonomous Vehicles. This will really boost AR research and applications. Along with Google ARCore, Apple\u2019s ARKit, and others, we will be seeing some great developments by next year\u2019s NIPS.", "Robotics is one field where the analysis of 3D scenes holds more importance if the robot is to interact with the real-world. Picking up things requires the pose estimation of the object (the angle at which the object is lying down on the surface) is one of the things that will be highly improved with this. Apart from that surface understanding, depth estimation, shape classification, and 3D plane detection are other things that will benefit from this.", "Things like Google Lens will be much more possible for anyone to make now. Even more complex queries like where you describe the angle of the camera or distance from the camera will be possible.", "View synthesis is generating a view of an object from a different angle. This field is going to be supercharged. Check out this honorable mention in ECCV 2020 example for seeing what view synthesis looks like. Since this dataset has the exact data you would require to achieve the view synthesis task. Your 2D photographs shall come alive!", "3D representation is the generation of a 3D model of an object given you have any modality. In purview of this dataset, you can have point clouds, multi-view images etc. This field is going to get a great push. Good data has surfaced for everybody to work upon.", "Unsupervised Learning is the future! With much of the focus on applications where we have labeled data or get our data labeled, less focus is on where the actual magic is happening. But the next big bang will happen here because when we would no longer require labels, then the possibilities become completely endless.", "This dataset would open the doors to do that in the case of 3D computer vision. While much of the work in the area of 3D seems in infancy, it is a good time to take a look at the unsupervised aspect. Data labeling is much more costly for 3D as compared to 2D vision requiring specialized hardware.", "From ML/AI developers perspective who directly want to explore real-life applications of models derived from this dataset, Google has got you covered.", "This model can be used invariably on any platform and can provide you with 3D bounding boxes \ud83d\ude03. Go crazy with your ideas now!!! But, it has limitations with models only available for shoes, chairs, mugs, and cameras, as of now.", "Apart from this Google has released Colab notebooks for loading the dataset in Tensorflow and PyTorch, 3D IoU and, SequenceExample (a new format different from tf.examples) amongst others. For more, check out their GitHub repo.", "With the release of this great dataset in the field of 3D Computer Vision, we are going to see some great things happening next year. The fabric of reality (I mean, Augmented Reality) will be pushed much further. Our smartphones are going to get some great apps to play around with.", "Apart from that, both from the researcher\u2019s and developer\u2019s perspective things are looking up as new data has just flowed along with ready-to-use models. It would be really great to see some interesting applications people come up with this model!", "Your home for data science.
