Therefore I have grown a professional interest in making this topic accessible.", "We all can discover the visual secrets of \u2018big data\u2019 even just using Excel, when doing things right; this post details my own approach and its rationale.", "Yes, in 2020 there are many fancy, advanced graphical tools out there\u2026 and I know it: our scientists use them, for their specific purposes and product use-cases.", "But after all the core analytical hard work will have been completed with other powerful tools, \u2018big data\u2019 must become small to make it understandable.", "Charting is the very last mile of analytics, with a simple rule: clarity of message is the only mantra, regardless of tool choice.", "And when it comes to \u2018charts for the rest of us\u2019, for people like you and me, nothing beats the ease of use and sheer power of good ol\u2019 Microsoft Excel:", "Excel charting is fast, flexible and cheap.

Especially to achieve fully automated results, rather than clunky manual Excel work.", "Default settings are core to the experience of the average user.", "But Bill Gates must have wanted to pull nasty pranks and/or inflict painful experiences on the global business community: Excel charts are initially set with the wrong default choices. Many of them, even.", "Some examples, just to name a few?", "(note: each of these defaults, and many more, can be addressed & fixed with some love)", "I entirely avoid those apparently fancy options like \u2018chart sheets\u2019 or \u2018pivot charts\u2019, which are in fact less flexible and therefore not worth the effort. My exclusive focus is on standard charts inside normal worksheets.", "It is possible to make Excel charts work, right now, and relatively fast too!", "After reading this post, armed with brand-new settings, anyone can achieve brilliant automated results with limited effort:", "The content that follows is best seen using a desktop monitor or larger tablet.", "My key guiding principles, developed over years of working with \u2018big data\u2019:", "Visual data only makes sense as a comparison with relative reference to something else. Is it a lot? Or not enough? Is it growing fast? Is a set relatively bigger than another?", "The same holds true of (any) pricing in general, as we can instinctively only evalutate a price in comparison to something else \u2014 ours brains desperately do that in the background \u2014 so do we with any data shown on a chart.", "Which is why I like to design my charts with clear visual references to underpin the so-what.", "Armed with these principles, mastering a handful of chart types is all it takes to truly own Excel charting.

I prefer having charts above each other, than adding multiple units of measure; with the added benefit that X axis labels can often be omitted in the \u2018above charts\u2019.", "Excel renders each series progressively, one after the other: the first series is placed behind every other series; this typically should be the X axis, which is itself a line chart because scatter lines are always rendered above any normal line series, and this cannot be changed.", "The \u2018tick marks\u2019 are fully controllable \u2018error bars\u2019.", "The most important series, in the example above \u2018This year\u2019, is rendered last \u2018above everything else\u2019 when two series cross each other: to achieve this I moved it to be the last data set.", "Additional dummy data sets are often needed, and they are fast to implement. This is what my list may look like, for example:", "These dummy data sets may show, for example, the X axis, or legend keys in the right order with the most important data series first, rather than reversed, which is exactly as logic would suggest.", "Dummy data sets may also show the automated \u2018vertical line\u2019, in my example case to highlight the specific date when a price change was applied by the company.", "These all show components of a whole. Specific settings:", "To show the content of labels spanning across multiple lines, I use \u2018char(10)\u2019 as the \u2018new line\u2019 character, together with the \u2018text()\u2019 function to build the label string.", "Frequency & item values.

Mekko is a \u2018stacked area\u2019 chart with date axis. Clustered, which I do not like to use as it tends to hide its message, has series overlap set to 0%.", "Bi- & tri-dimensional correlations. Specific settings:", "With regards to preventing data labels overlap, I calculated the X/Y coordinates of each corner and then checked if one rectangle is either above the top edge or on left side of left edge of the other rectangle.", "Other related chart types in this family:", "For the \u2018Ladder\u2019 chart: thin gridlines 0.25pt, with light grey 0% transparency.", "Distribution, for example of price ranges. Specific settings:", "For the line showing \u2018our median\u2019, I programmatically hide the segments that should fall behind boxes, as Excel would otherwise overlay unwanted sections on top. The X axis is also programmatically generated.", "These examples show my approach to automated charting in Excel: no external tools, VBA or manual work. Maybe one day even Excel defaults will be fixed in a future release of the software.", "For now, I find the results of my approach building the \u2018home-made templates\u2019 to be clean, easy to read and fast to render.", "Please do not hesitate to let me know if any questions?", "PS During my first week at work, back in 2005, Gene Zelazny\u2019s book \u201cSay It With Charts: The Executive\u2019s Guide to Visual Communication\u201d inspired me.", "Even today, this remains one of the very best charting guides ever written.
