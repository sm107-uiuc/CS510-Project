Within a matter of weeks this snowballed into a pandemic, bringing almost the entire world to a standstill. As things stand right now, the future of job-seekers especially the new entrants to the workforce have become quite bleak.", "With the ongoing pandemic, an injured economy was a given; but to actually witness my friends, batch-mates and seniors losing their jobs and internships was gut-wrenching. So as a counter measure, I started searching for available jobs and interns on LinkedIn and frantically sent loads of connection requests to the alumni from my college.", "It was then, that the idea struck me. In these harrowing times, the ones that are most likely to help us out are our alumni. So, failing to find an institutional portal to reach out to the alumni, I decided to take matters into my own hands.", "What I wanted was clear in my mind, I wanted to provide insightful and actionable information on our alumni to my fellow batch-mates. This pushed me into a predicament, as I\u2019m not much well-versed with web development but had been working with R for quite some time now.", "Since time was of the essence and in view of my general restlessness, this choice was a no brainer.", "Although I had ample working knowledge of R, R Shiny development was completely uncharted territory for me. So I decided to complete a quick course on R Shiny development and get on with my project.", "Thanks to the concise and clear explanations of the Datacamp instructors, I blazed through the course, all the while in awe of the people behind the development of such incredible tool such as Shiny.", "This was the first issue I faced right off the bat. To gather data on the alumni of my university, I had to scrape data off LinkedIn and LinkedIn is very vigilant about detecting scrapers.", "So I did some research online and found that the safe limit was 150 profiles per day. Exceeding this limit meant there was a high chance of my profile getting flagged. Also, I had to use my own profile for scraping otherwise most of the alumni would be displayed as \u201cLinkedIn Member\u201d to a dummy profile void of many connections. Hence, with an initial target of around 400\u2013500 profiles, I got down to work.", "Once the data was scraped and stored in a .csv file, I had the task to clean the data. In the code given below I\u2019ve taken the following steps:", "I decided to use \u201cShinydashboard\u201d instead of plain Shiny for aesthetics. In any kind of development activities, it is paramount that you have a rough sketch of the finished product before you start coding. I envisioned my app to have the following functionalities:", "With the layout in mind, I started out to code. Below are the steps I took in my ui.R file, along with the code (The entire code can be accessed from my Github repo, the link to which is given at the end of the article):", "Below are the steps I took in my server.R file, along with the code(The entire code can be accessed from my Github repo, the link to which is given at the end of the article):", "Deploying the app is pretty easy using \u201cRStudio\u201d and \u201cShinyapps.io\u201d. It was a matter of minutes after signing up and account creation. More information can be found here.", "Here is a snippet of my final product (IIIT Bhubaneswar Alumni Wall):", "If you are interested in the code, here it is.", "If you want to check out my final deployed product, here it is. But bear in mind the following points:", "My lack of CSS skills left much to be desired, but if you have decent CSS and/or JS skills you could use this tutorial to come up with an even better version of this \u201cAlumni Wall\u201d for your institute. So I\u2019ll sign off for now, wishing you all the best for using your skills for the betterment and aid of people you care about.", "You could also buy me a coffee to support my work.", "Your home for data science.
