Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning | by Kriti Srivastava | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Shades of Machine Learning", "description": "In the last few blogs, we discussed various methods of cleaning and transforming data at different scales before applying any ML algorithm to it (you can find the links at the bottom of this\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "http://www.linkedin.com/in/kriti-sri", "anchor_text": "www.linkedin.com/in/kriti-sri", "paragraph_index": 13}], "all_paragraphs": ["In the last few blogs, we discussed various methods of cleaning and transforming data at different scales before applying any ML algorithm to it (you can find the links at the bottom of this article). This preprocessing of the data is required because dirty/messy data would not make any sense to the model and to us. So now that we have learned how to clean the data, let\u2019s look at the main picture \u2014 the different ML techniques to solve the different types of problems around us.", "Let\u2019s start with the basic ML Techniques in the world!", "As the name suggests, supervised learning is learning under some supervision. For example, what you learn in school is supervised learning because there are books and teachers who supervise you and guide you towards the end goal. Similarly in terms of machine learning, when the model is able to learn the \u201cif this \u2014 then this\u201d pattern, it is called supervised learning.", "Supervised learning consists of Classification and Regression techniques because in both cases, the end goal is set. In the case of classification, one of the different classes/categories/targets are supposed to be predicted from a finite list. In regression, a continuous number is supposed to be predicted. But in both cases, historical data tells what should be predicted when a particular sequence of things happens.", "For example, you want to decide if today you should go \u201cout in the park\u201d or \u201csit at home\u201d? The first thing which will come to your mind is the weather \u2014 if it rains, you would \u201csit at home\u201d, if it\u2019s sunny, you\u2019d definitely want to go out in the park because that\u2019s the logical thing to do (unless you are a couch potato and just want to sit inside anyway and finish that series!).", "But if you ask a computer the same question, it doesn\u2019t understand human logic. So it needs some kind of supervision or a set of rules to give an answer, which is what the historical data will do. The historical data will help the computer understand patterns like, in the past, you\u2019ve stayed indoors 8/10 times when it rains. So it\u2019ll develop a rule in its memory that \u2014 when it rains -> stay at home. And the next time you ask the computer this question, it\u2019ll ask you to stay indoors when it rains.", "Easy right? This is how we learned daily stuff as kids by remembering what our adults told us, or just watching what they did. Supervised learning is pretty friendly in that matter. It wants us to succeed, and it is ready to help us in whatever way possible. We just need to find the right datasets.", "Unsupervised Learning is not so friendly! It doesn\u2019t supervise the model in the ML journey, but that\u2019s the thing, unsupervised learning helps you get more and more curious. It\u2019ll help you explore patterns and groups you would\u2019ve not thought about before. The data is not labeled before, the target is not known for unsupervised learning data.", "For example, you have to divide the people in your office into different groups for Holiday Activity, and instead of randomly dividing everyone into groups, you come up with some features like height, weight, department, designation, gender, the floor they sit on, team, etc. And based on these features, you make several groups. These different groups are called clusters, and the features of people in each cluster would be different from those of the other cluster\u2019s people, but very similar to the people in the same cluster. So in this case, instead of coming up with the number of groups beforehand, we let the distinguishing features of people decide the group they want to go in or create a new group if their features don\u2019t exist in any previous cluster.", "Now that we have understood the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning, the image below explains some basic ML techniques in these categories and their distinct features.", "In the next blog, we will try to understand some techniques of supervised learning in-depth. Meanwhile, you can check my previous blogs for the data preprocessing and ML project flow:", "I hope this blog helps someone understand the things they were not able to get earlier (and keep them questions coming)! :)", "Your home for data science.
