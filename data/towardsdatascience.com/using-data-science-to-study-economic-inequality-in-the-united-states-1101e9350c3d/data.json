This article will continue off of that, researching some of the counties suffering the most from COVID-19, and try to paint a better picture of what issues surround these communities.", "My goal is to identify primarily Black counties that are suffering economically, and find commonalities (or differences) between them.", "I first looked at the counties with the highest unemployment rate. It looks like Michigan is the hardest hit, pieces of Nevada and California, then parts of South.", "Using Census data gives us the following areas of highest Black population.", "After comparing the two charts, here\u2019s the list of counties I settled on:", "Wilcox and Holmes have had high unemployment rates since the last recession (even when the national unemployment rate dipped to 3.9%), and the lowest mean incomes of the six. The following chart shows employment reliance by industry in each state.", "For both states, Government and Trade/Transportation/Utilities make up a a higher proportion of jobs in the state.", "Now that we have an overview of the counties economically, let\u2019s see what other data sources we can gather. It\u2019s important to understand the history/context of the counties we are studying, so let\u2019s start by understanding media coverage and public policies in the area. To do the former, I relied on typical NLP preprocessing/visualization methods. I web scraped 100 articles from the search \u201ccounty_name + \u2018economy\u2019\u201d using a Google news query format (https://news.google.com/rss/search?q={}), then tokenized the words (using nltk to remove stop words and lemmatize) in each article using TF-IDF (Scikit-learn).", "I then did a PCA analysis (Scikit-learn) all the articles, and plotted the first two components with the 600 articles. For those who aren\u2019t familiar with PCA, think of it as variance of words/topics in the articles. For all the interactive links, you will have to download the html file.", "It looks like general economic coverage is pretty similar, Chickasaw has a bunch more variation along the first component though. The main cluster is centered around \u2018Pandemic\u2019 and \u2018Unemployment\u2019.", "I ran the same analysis on a separate time frame (2008\u20132019), and got the following more dispersed results:", "I then did TSNE as well on the PCA components. TSNE is much harder to succinctly explain, but think of it as unwrapping complex non-linear relationships in high-dimensional space (like unrolling a fruit roll-up but you can tear and rearrange the roll-up by color to some degree). TSNE doesn\u2019t work well if you have more than 50 features.", "From a quick scan of the interactive plot, the clusters are focused around \u2018Casinos\u2019, \u2018Agriculture\u2019, \u2018Trade Deals\u2019, \u2018Immigration\u2019, and \u2018Civil Rights\u2019.", "The top left of the TSNE are articles about the Black Belt, homelessness, and students. The middle is about civil rights and wealth/inequality since the Civil War. The bottom right are articles mostly covering Trump, trade, and factories.", "Through follow-up reading on some of these articles, I found that the three counties in Alabama are part of the black belt, meaning it has the region\u2019s rich, black topsoil. The area also has a history of having half of Alabama\u2019s enslaved population concentrated there. There was a historic march in 1965 from Selma to Montgomery. Selma is in Dallas county, and Montgomery (the Capital of Alabama) is right outside of Lowndes county.", "For public policy, I first studied the distribution of voters and public issues. I used Ballotpedia and Politico on the most recent elections: Lowndes, Dallas, Wilcox, Tunica, and Holmes were Democrat, and Chickasaw is a pivot county (republican leaning). I wonder if that explains why Chickasaw media clustering was so off to the side.", "A quick overview of the US legislative system before we dive deeper: just as each state has two senators and multiple representatives for the US Senate and House of Representatives, each District has a senator and representative for the State Senate and House.", "To figure out problems these six counties face, I went to sponsored bills by District legislators. The Alabama and Mississippi District splits look like this:", "Lowndes, Dallas, and Wilcox are all part of District 7. Proncey Robertson (Republican) is the representative for this district and Sam Givhan (Republican) is the senator.", "Tunica and Holmes are part of District 2, Chickasaw is from District 1. District 2 representative is Nick Bain (Republican) and senator is Michael McLendon (Republican), District 1 representative is Lester Carpenter (Republican) and senator is David L. Parker (Republican).", "I used billtrack50 to look at how what bills they sponsored in the state legislature, and clustered them with the same NLP methods as earlier on the bill summaries. In total there were 140 bills sponsored.", "I didn\u2019t find TSNE particularly useful, but you can check it out here if you like. Gensim keywords on bill summaries gives us by occurrence:", "Also, the sponsored bills by state seem to diverge a little:", "The bills at going towards the top from Alabama are focused around firearms and crimes. Below is by District (7 is Alabama, 1 and 2 is Mississippi):", "I\u2019m most interested in the bills around the center at (0,0), as that is where we have the most commonality across the Districts (and counties).", "The topics at the center: are around firefighters and other infrastructure, medical/health aid to many constituents (immunization of school students, provide pregnancy benefits to those with infertility, etc.).", "District 2 (Tunica, Holmes): Mostly goes to the left, and covers many child issues such as baby drop-off, adoption, child support, and sexting youth as well as drug issues on tobacco and nicotine.", "District 1 (Chickasaw): has a wide variety of policies, to the left the topics are very similar (and some repeats for bills sponsored together) but have the addition of some road/driver bills (driver\u2019s license/DUI bills/highways and interstates). In the center, there are a few bills about education (teachers income, dyslexia, conflicts-of-interest and tax provisions). The spread to the right are all bills that commend or congratulate sports teams and coaches on winning various awards and competitions and put it in official record.", "District 7 (Dallas, Lowndes, Wilcox): There are many bills about firearms (specifically unlawful discharge of firearms on campus, concealed carry) and crimes (adding to the list of controlled substances, making it a crime to lie to a police officer). But the bills near the center are most amendments around Governor, municipals, board, and Judicial (modifying authorities, terms, documentation, etc). There are also a few tax and investment bills.", "We now have context on what media discussion and public policy has focused on. I would\u2019ve liked to access town hall and District meeting transcripts as well to see what questions were posed by the community, but those were not easy to find.", "Our last step is to see if we can find how these problems are actually being addressed using open data sources.", "Each state in the US typically has designated opportunity zones, some have gone to take the scoring system further. Berkeley has done a good one on a tract level (one smaller than county) of California, seen below:", "Using OpportunityDb I found that Alabama has 158 opportunity zones, Mississippi has 100. Each county has 0 or 1 zones, all falling under the \u201cLow Income Community\u201d classification. I like how Berkeley scored their study, so I went through their methodology to understand what I can transfer to these counties. I won\u2019t go into detail here, but these are the indicators they used:", "Some interesting data points they used were \u201cAdult Education\u201d, \u201cJob Proximity\u201d, and \u201cStudent Poverty Rate\u201d. They also used something called \u201cCalEnviroScreen 3.0 indicators\u201d, which would be interesting to look into as well.", "Mississippi\u2019s open data is mostly GIS focused, and Alabama is focused on state spending. Their web interfaces are different from places like San Francisco, Chicago, and New York City which all seem to have the same web template and similar datasets.", "For Mississippi, I looked for data around age distribution and anything school/child related. They didn\u2019t have anything really useful from the portal, so I relied on census.gov. It\u2019s outdated, but a starting point. It seems like the population is mostly middle-aged families.", "I also found the 2nd and 1st Districts have a high school graduation rate of 77.6% and 81.2% respectively, compared to the national average of 88%.", "School District data is good because it gives insight on both children and their parents together. First, media coverage of the schools (pre-covid) using same methodology as earlier:", "The bottom left cluster covers crimes, thefts, and shootings. The middle/top clusters cover the poverty, failing, and segregation The right side covers child battery/enticement and child deaths (also a bunch of crimes that are seemingly unrelated to the schools based on headline).", "I used National Center For Education Statistics (NCES) to try and understand challenges in local school districts. You can find Tunica County School District here, and search for others. I started collecting data on the largest 100 school districts in the United Sates as well as our six county school districts using bs4 and Selenium. After cleaning it, I was left with 70 school districts of data (csv linked here).", "Here\u2019s the df.hist() plot on the variables I collected:", "Here\u2019s the plotly boxplot of only % variables. On the interactive version, you can mouse over the dots to see the school district names.", "All three Mississippi districts have 97%+ health care coverage, which initially surprised me. However a few statistics stuck out to me, here\u2019s a zoom in on those boxplots:", "For reference, you can compare these statistics with this county in California which is very well off. 92.3% internet access, 88% married couples, 27.2% speak English very well, 79.9% parents with Bachelor\u2019s degree or higher.", "It was hard to find to child abuse/neglect/substance use on a county level, so I couldn\u2019t tie anything out there.", "For Alabama, I looked for data around crimes and school safety. Their open database is focused on state spending, split like this (on the period Oct 2019 -June 2020). It\u2019s a lot of click-throughs and page tabs, which is really messy to work with considering all the data should fit on a single excel sheet (if you exclude all the dates payees were paid on).", "Most of the expenditure is \u201cGrants and Benefits\u201d, which if we click into gives us the some top categories:", "I then looked at how much of the $3.782bn went to the Dallas, Lowndes, and Wilcox school districts.", "I\u2019ll note that these don\u2019t really match up proportionally to the size of the school district budgets, which is why data definitions are so important. If anyone knows more about school district budgets and state funding, please connect with me! But looking through the Dallas district\u2019s proposed budget for 2020\u20132021, I found", "I wonder if the decrease in budget has to do with the bills that went through on school safety \u2014 though that would be very hard conclusion to make from the outside. Alabama doesn\u2019t seem to have Complaints or Arrest datasets like this one from NYPD.", "Let\u2019s compare these school districts with the one\u2019s in Mississippi. Here\u2019s the overall distribution again so you don\u2019t have to scroll up:", "I was able to dig into some of the problems communities in these predominately Black counties are facing, but unfortunately could not really tie it back to unemployment directly or how spending is used to tackle those problems. As such, I won\u2019t try and make any conclusions.", "My intent here was to provide a story behind a bunch of scattered datasets that is easy for us to empathize with, using typical data science libraries. There are some items I want to mention:", "Data science is a strong tool for all sorts of models, but the same skill set is very strong for providing clearer questions and portrayals of the data. There\u2019s no set way to do this, which is why my approach probably feels rough around the edges compared to what you\u2019re used to reading.
