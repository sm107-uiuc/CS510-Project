But the average doesn\u2019t tell the whole story.", "Suppose you are at the beginning of Week 37.

As you expect, with each week that goes by, the average remaining time goes down.", "The following figure shows the cruelest statistic in obstetrics: the average remaining time computed at the beginning of each week of pregnancy:", "Between Weeks 39 and 43, the remaining time until delivery barely changes. Time goes by, but the finish line keeps moving into the future.", "At Week 39, if you ask a doctor when the baby will arrive, they say something like \u201cAny day now.\u201d If you ask again at Week 40, they give the same answer. And again at Week 41. That might be frustrating to hear, but they are right; for almost five weeks, you are always one week away.", "The situation is a little worse for first babies.

In that case, they are likely to be predictive: if you are expecting your first baby, you will have to wait a little longer, on average, than for subsequent births.", "But these results might be due to measurement error.", "But even if measurement errors are different for first babies, it\u2019s not clear why they would be biased toward longer durations.", "The apparent differences between first babies and others might also be caused by a confounding factor related to pregnancy length.", "The results I\u2019ve presented are statistically significant, which means that if there were no difference between first babies and others, we would be unlikely to see these gaps. The results are also consistent over the course of the survey, from 2002 to 2017. So it is unlikely that the apparent differences are due to random sampling.", "This article is based on a case study in my book, Think Stats: Exploratory Data Analysis in Python, which you can download at no cost from Green Tea Press.

I also excluded 3 cases where the duration of pregnancy was reported to be 50 weeks or more. This analysis is based on the remaining 31 906 cases.", "The NSFG is representative of United States residents, but it uses stratified sampling, so some groups are oversampled. I used weighted resampling to correct for oversampling and to generate the confidence intervals shown in the figures.", "The details of data cleaning, validation, and resampling are in this Jupyter notebook.
