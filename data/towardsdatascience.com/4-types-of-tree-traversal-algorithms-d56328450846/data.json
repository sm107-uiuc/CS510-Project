But those algorithms can be generalised to other types of tree, as well.", "\u201cIn computer science, tree traversal (also known as tree search) is a form of graph traversal and refers to the process of visiting (checking and/or updating) each node in a tree data structure, exactly once. Such traversals are classified by the order in which the nodes are visited.\u201d \u2014 Wikipedia", "The definition of Wikipedia is self-explanatory to understand what Tree Traversal mean.

Level order traversal follows BFS(Breadth-First Search) to visit/modify every node of the tree.", "As BFS suggests, the breadth of the tree takes priority first and then move to depth. In simple words, we will visit all the nodes present at the same level one-by-one from left to right and then move to the next level to visit all the nodes of that level.", "Implementation is slightly challenging here than the above three traversals. We will use a Queue(FIFO) data structure to implement Level order traversal, where after visiting a Node, we simply put its left and right children to queue sequentially.", "Here, the order of adding children in the queue is important as we have to traverse left-to-right at the same level.
