You might hear stories of people applying deep learning models to very simple problems although higher accuracy results and better performance can be obtained by simple conventional models.", "Similarly, someone who does not have much knowledge about machine learning can even make some inferences by taking a step back and looking the data from a more general view. Data have something to tell everytime. In this writing, I just want to give a simple starting point for event predictions without diving deep into machine learning. It can be applied to all prediction problems for event based datasets.", "To make it more clear, take an example from telco domain and think about a network consists of thousands of devices and a monitoring tool that keeps all alarms occur on the devices. These alarms can be in various types. In a simple manner, you are working with a dataset which includes alarm datetime, device name and alarm type. And the goal is to predict a specific type of alarm before occurring on any device.", "With a simple reasoning, finding out related alarms(indicators) in order to predict the target alarm is the first thing. For this, you do not need to be a machine learning expert.", "I will mention about 4 different criteria to narrow down the alarms which might be indicators from the entire alarm set. These criteria are definitely open to be extended.", "It basically gives the occurring frequency of the candidate alarm which is very straightforward. The target alarm is most probably an infrequent alarm, so you expect the indicator alarm to be not so recurrent one as well. So, the less value it has, the more chance to be an indicator alarm.", "This criteria is about the correlation between the target alarm and the candidate alarm. It states the percentage of frequency that both target and candidate alarm occur at the same device. So, the higher value it has, the more chance to be an indicator alarm.", "It is actually a kind of extension of Criteria 2 which indicates target and candidate alarm arise together on the same devices. Which one is the cause of the other? The target alarm also might cause candidate alarm:) We are interested in the alarms occurring before the target alarm. To use this criteria, I highly recommend to set a threshold for the time interval. For instance, a candidate alarm might occur 30 days before the target alarm, but most probably not behaving as an indicator, because it is a long time. Patterns which have shorter time periods like one week or one day can be used according to the reasons of the target alarm. The candidate alarm hereby will not be taken into consideration for the case it occurred 30 days ago and threshold is set to one week. Obviously, the higher value it has, the more chance to be an indicator alarm.", "Last but not definitely least, time intervals between candidate and target alarm are very critical in terms of especially prediction range. While some indicator alarm arises 10 hours before, some arises 5 minutes before the target alarm. In such a case, predicting the target alarm 5 minutes before might not be compatible with business goals. I encourage to use a time interval threshold with this criteria similarly with the previous criteria. Mean and minimum of the time lags can be utilized together. The value of this criteria will give an insight about the prediction range, in other saying it specifies how long before the target alarm can be predictable.", "In an event prediction (here I generally talked about alarm set in telco domain, similarly it has a large usage field in production line in manufacturing domain as a predictive maintenance implementation), finding out the indicator events before the target event occurs is the most challenging and prominent part. After deciding on the indicator events correctly, it is easier to make a prediction about the target event by using them as features in conventional machine learning models. It is undoubtedly not a trivial and easy task, however, I just want to give a very simple starting point without needing any machine learning background. In light of the outputs of criteria, a small event set that might be a sign for the target event can be composed among hundreds of different types of events. Actually, reasonings behind the criterias I mentioned above are based on advanced machine learning concepts like Market Basket Analysis and Association Rule Mining. I wrote about one of their possible adaptation to a prediction problem in event based dataset here previously.", "Your home for data science.
