Some are awesome! These interviewers will help and guide you throughout the interview. But, let\u2019s face it, some are not going to be as great. There are the misleading ones. These interviewers are those who will give you positive feedback during the interview, which makes you feel great and confident, only to send you a rejection email the next day. Then there are the silent ones. They give you very little feedback during the interview, making it difficult to communicate with them. There are also the tough ones, who will \u201cgrill\u201d you over every single question until you feel like a nervous wreck.", "There is no getting around the fact that interviewers play a critical role in hiring decisions. It\u2019s critical for you to learn their styles and develop strategies to work with different interviewers. It can be incredibly frustrating to put in so much effort preparing for an interview only to get an interviewer with whom you do not click. In this post, I will share with you 5 types of interviewers and how to deal with each of them. Equipped with this information, you can ensure that your preparation pays off. You can use these tips in your very next interview!", "I have been on a dozen data science interviews myself, so I understand both the wide array of interviewing styles out there and how awkward it can be when you face an interviewing style you do not know how to deal with. I know I could have used some advice at the time, and I hope this blog will provide you with tips for impressing any interviewer.", "You can reach out to me here if you think I might be able to make your journey easier in any way!", "Before you start reading, if you are a video person, feel free to check out the YouTube video below for an abbreviated version of this post.", "You may have read somewhere that during interviews \u201cyou\u2019re entitled to ask the interviewer clarifying questions\u201d and that \u201cIt\u2019s not fair for you to discuss a product you don\u2019t know\u201d. Maybe you took this advice and asked the interviewer clarifying questions. Only the interviewer responded with \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d instead of answering your questions. Now instead of getting the clarification you wanted, you find yourself even more confused.", "The \u201cwhat do you think\u201d type of interviewer is the interviewer who refuses to be helpful. Whatever questions you ask, even simply for clarification, they will direct the back at you. Interviews with this type often sound like this:", "Interviewer: How would you plan to increase engagement on our website?", "You: Before I begin, I wonder how do we define \u201cengagement\u201d? Is it defined by active users or the time spent on the platform?", "Interviewer: Why don\u2019t you tell me what you think it is?", "This type of interviewer is difficult and frustrating because you never really get any feedback from them. This can be especially problematic during an interview where the questions tend to be open-ended, such as a metric interview (aka business case interview, product sense interview). In these cases getting feedback is very important because it\u2019s hard to provide a good answer without narrowing it down to a certain direction. So how do you get the information you need when the interviewer is being difficult?", "To deal with this type of interviewer, you need to find ways to kind of \u201cforce\u201d the interviewers to give you some feedback. Here are two methods you can try.", "If you want feedback from a tightlipped interviewer, start by making that feedback as easy as possible. Ask questions with brief answers, such as \u201cDoes it make sense to you?\u201d, or \u201cIs there anything I could explain more?\u201d. With simple questions like these, it is less likely for the interviewer to still reply with \u201cwhat do you think?\u201d.", "For example, this tactic could be used in the above situation. You could respond: \u201cI understand that engagement can be measured by different metrics. To help us maintain focus, I\u2019ll use the proportion of active users among all users as the metric. Does it make sense?\u201d", "Another way to force feedback from a reluctant interviewer is to provide options. For example, you can say \u201cHere are a few reasons that cause the problem: First.. second.. and third.. Which one would you like me to explore more?\u201d Most of the time, the interviewer will then give you a direction on which to focus.", "However, some interviewers may still say \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d. In this situation, you need to prioritize the options based on your reasons and assumptions and make sure you clearly communicate by saying things like \u201c I understand that\u201d and \u201cCorrect me if I\u2019m wrong\u201d. In such cases, it\u2019s helpful to confirm with the interviewer again once you are done explaining your approach.", "The second type of interviewer can be called the \u201cThis is not what I expected\u201d type. This type of interviewer usually gives you some positive feedback such as \u201cOK, continue\u201d through most of the interview. However, after half or the majority of time has passed, the interviewer suddenly says: \u201cThis is not what I expected\u201d or \u201cI was expecting something else\u2019\u2019. This creates a lot of frustration and anxiety because the interviewer switches unexpectedly from being fine with your approach to denying it.", "There are many reasons this sudden turn can happen. One possible cause is that the interviewers lost focus earlier, and when they regain their focus, they only hear part of your answer causing them to begin questioning your approach. Another possible cause is that the interviewer simply misheard or misunderstood your earlier arguments. They may have previously thought you were on the right track, but now realize that your approach is not correct.", "First of all, do not panic when this happens! It does not mean that you are doomed to fail the interview. You can recover, but panicking will only hurt you.", "Here are steps you can take to convince the interviewer that your answer is, in fact, great.", "Knowing how to deal with this situation when it happens is great, but, to be honest, this is not a pleasant experience, and most of us would rather just prevent it from happening in the first place.", "To prevent the dreaded \u201cthis is not what I expected\u201d response, do your best to keep the interviewer on track with your thoughts throughout the interview. The best strategy for this is to always state the big picture of your approach before going into detail. For instance, you can say things like \u201cFirst, I\u2019d make sure that I understand our goals and constraints; then, I\u2019d explore..; and lastly, I\u2019d prioritize .. and focus on \u2026\u201d. After you have finished diving into some details, confirm with the interviewer that your approach is correct and ask whether they would like you to dive deeper or move on to the next topic.", "The third type of interviewer is very different from the first two types. Instead of not giving you any feedback or telling you that your answer is not as expected, this interviewer gives you positive feedback. They appear agreeable and engaging during most of the interview. However, they have very high expectations of the candidate, and they do not hesitate to fail you if your answers don\u2019t meet their standards.", "An interview becomes tricky when the interviewer does not give any negative feedback explicitly during the interview. Even if they notice flaws or lack of depth in your answers, they may nod at you or say \u201cThat\u2019s great!\u201d, \u201cThat\u2019s awesome!\u201d.This makes you feel that you did well, so when you end up receiving a rejection notice for the interview you don\u2019t know the actual reason. The result is confusion and no knowledge of how to improve.", "To begin with, you should be alarmed if you notice that your interviewer is too agreeable or always giving positive feedback. Double-check with the interviewer about whether your answer is comprehensive, whether he/she wants you to consider more aspects to the problem, or dive deeper into any of the factors you mentioned earlier. For example, if you are asked to diagnose the issue when an important metric shifts to the negative direction, you want to confirm with the interviewer whether it\u2019s enough to only provide potential causes to the issue or if you also need to provide suggestions to fix the issue. Ensure that the interviewer does not want anything further from you for each question.", "The aforementioned three types of interviewers require you to be proactive in the interview so that you can get some useful feedback. This type of interviewer is on the opposite side of the spectrum: the \u201calways cutting you off\u201d type.", "These interviewers are often experienced. They pay close attention to your answers and find every opportunity to question your answer. They can sense that you\u2019re following a framework (or a structure) and intentionally destructure you to test whether you can remain organized and perform well under stress.", "Understanding how this type of interviewer works is best seen through an example. Imagine you are asked a question to investigate a problem that the average ETAs of trips went up by 5 after you clarify the definition of the metric:", "You: I would look into a few factors to diagnose the problem. The first one is to check if there\u2019s any outlier that impacts the metric because average values are affected by outliers. The 2nd\u2026", "Interviewer (interrupts): That makes sense, how do you define outlier?", "You: A simple way is to see if there is any value that\u2019s much larger than the rest of the values. We could set a threshold such as 99.99% of \u2026", "Interviewer (interrupts again): okay, could you come up with a few ways to deal with outliers?", "Under the pressure of these constant disruptions and follow-up questions, it\u2019s completely normal to become nervous and feel like you are being \u201cgrilled\u201d.You may also be afraid that the interviewer is starting to drag you in a different direction instead of letting you answer the original question. But, in fact, if you have prepared, you should know the answers to these follow-up questions. You know the answers. You just need to change your strategy to answer them. If you can defend your answers and convince the interviewer, the interviewer will be more likely to give you a strong yes as the hiring decision.", "Although this interviewer can be both frightening and frustrating, here is a strategy to help you keep your cool and deal with this situation:", "An interviewer of this type is not all bad. They will give you a lot of signals and feedback, so you know how you are doing in the interview. These interviews feel more like a real discussion session with a colleague. Your ideas are constantly challenged, and you have to defend them.", "The above 4 types of interviewers can make your interviews harder and more challenging. What does an ideal interviewer look like then?", "The ideal interviewer gives you the right amount of information about the questions and tells you what the expectations are. When you ask for clarifications, they should tell you the high-level business goal. When you are asked metric related questions, they will tell you how the metric is defined, and they should tell you what a product does when you are asked to improve a product.", "Ideal interviewers provide useful feedback to you. They pay close attention to your answers so that they can steer you in the right direction when needed, and they don\u2019t let you waste time in the wrong direction. It\u2019s common for a good interviewer to ask \u201cWhat do you think?\u201d to test your ability to lead the problem-solving process. However, a good interviewer also tells you whether your assumptions are correct, if your answers make sense, and whether you should dive into other factors. The ideal interviewer communicates clearly.", "It would be great if all the interviewers were ideal interviewers. In reality, though, you will likely encounter different types of people, and some of them may make you incredibly nervous. Remember that it is possible to get rejected even if you have done your best in preparing for and communicating during the interview. It is discouraging when this happens, but don\u2019t blame yourself because many factors go into a hiring decision. Some of those factors are out of your control.", "You can even ace the interview and still not get hired due to other factors that affect the decision making. For example, there may be another candidate who has more relevant experience and fits the job better. Or maybe another candidate has a strong referral. Both of these things can cause the hiring manager to choose them over you. In rare cases, the hiring decision could have been made before the interview due to an improper headcount from reorganization or cut in the budget. There are a lot of things that happen beyond your reach which can impact the hiring decision, so don\u2019t overanalyze your rejections or interviews.", "As a candidate, focus on the things you can control: interview preparation and your performance during the interview. In most situations, the biggest deciding factor of hiring is your performance in the interview. Walk in prepared to deal with whatever type of interviewer you have, and feel more confident that your interviews will go well.", "Now you\u2019ve learned that interviewers have different styles and how to work with those styles in an interview. The overall key to a good interview is to interact with the interviewer. Make the interview a dialogue. You, as the candidate, will lead the problem-solving process and, at the same time, you want to pay attention to the other person\u2019s feelings and thoughts. Using the tips in this post, you\u2019ll get real feedback from your interviewers and know how your interview is going. Try these tips in your next interview and impress the interviewer with your performance!", "If you like this post and want to support me\u2026", "Founder | Data Interview Pro
