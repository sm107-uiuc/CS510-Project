Our professional lives span multiple fields, each containing decades of valuable discoveries with new insights added every day. How can data scientists stay afloat in this vast knowledge lake? Failure to utilize the right tool or approach can be costly for projects as well as careers. How do we avoid remaining in our comfortable tech bubbles, ultimately risking obsolescence?", "Thankfully, we can solve this problem the same way we solve our programming questions: the internet. The advance of blogs, open-access publications and Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) have created a wealth of perpetually updated information, more than we could hope to process in a lifetime. Many of us are already familiar with this content and use it to some extent. Depending on my daily availability, I might flip through Hacker News, read a technical blog post about Principal Component Analysis, then surf my LinkedIn profile for inspirational quotes. But if my schedule is busy, I could go several days without reading anything.", "This scattershot approach has several issues:", "All of these issues can be solved by using what I call the \u201cSearch-Collect-Process\u201d method (SCP). With just 30 minutes per day, I can review hundreds of articles and only focus on the ones that matter, while making sure that few important posts slip through the cracks.", "The first step is to identify sources of relevant content. I try to remain a \u201cgeneralist\u201d data scientist and hence follow a range of different publications, but if you\u2019re an ML researcher there may only be a handful of academic journals that you\u2018ll focus on. Below are some good starting sources that I\u2019ve found during my career:", "Many tech organizations run blogs (Medium or otherwise) that highlight interesting work, new technologies in the field or just fun tutorials for beginning data scientists. Some of my favorites are Airbnb Engineering & Data Science, The Netflix Tech Blog, Kaggle\u2019s No Free Hunch and Stitch Fix\u2019s Multithreaded. I\u2019ll also make a shameless plug for my alma mater, Insight Data Science.", "There are several sources that serve as content platforms for individuals, academic organizations and companies that don\u2019t already have their own blog sites. Three great examples are Towards Data Science (but you knew that already), KDnuggets and DataTau. I also love following Hacker News, although the quantity of stories can get overwhelming at times.", "3. Individual blogs and everything else", "Machine Learning Mastery, Hyndsight and AndrewGelman.com are all written by experts in their respective fields.", "I\u2019ll admit that I don\u2019t personally use these sources as much, but it can be helpful way to get the latest thoughts from leaders in AI, data science and analytics. Brandon Rohrer, Monica Rogati, Hilary Mason and Ben Hamner have all provided valuable insight to me at various points in my career.", "Once we\u2019ve identified our sources, the next step is to collect all of our new content for review, preferably in a single location. RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a fantastic invention: by subscribing to a website\u2019s RSS feed, I\u2019m notified every time a new article is released. News aggregators like Feedly allow me to add and capture content in a single place. This is much easier than visiting every website on my list and scrolling through every headline; news aggregators also allow you to \u201csave\u201d articles across multiple days. Find what works for you, but I highly recommend Feedly \u2014 it even lets you follow Twitter accounts!", "Now that you\u2019ve completed the first two steps, odds are that you\u2019ll have anywhere from 20\u2013200 articles to review per day. (Side note: Go easy on the number of sources when starting out and build over time.)", "There are three levels of understanding when it comes to reading articles. They are:", "For example, we can break down this article using the above schema:", "Why are these distinctions important? It\u2019s because my ideal level of understanding depends on my role and active project(s). Currently, I focus on time-series anomaly detection applications, so spending an hour going through every little detail of this chatbot article may not be the best use of my time. However, by simply engaging at the \u201cTitle\u201d level, I now know that there\u2019s an easy chatbot implementation available should I ever need it. To put it another way, this kind of \u201cdictionary knowledge\u201d can serve as a personal Wikipedia that can be used to help guide future work.", "In contrast, when I worked with a team at Target that wanted to automatically answer questions in their customer chat room, understanding that Flottbot is language-agnostic would have been a huge time saver (one team member knew Ruby, another knew Python, another knew C++.,\u2026). In that case, understanding at the \u201cSynopsis\u201d level would have been more appropriate. If our team ultimately decided that we wanted to evaluate Flottbot as a potential solution, I could then go back to the \u201cDetails\u201d level and dive into the actual implementation.", "The key to the SCP process is to filter judiciously. Each level should remove roughly 90 percent of the content passed through. That is, only 10 percent of all article titles are interesting enough for me to form a synopsis. Of those articles, only 10 percent are relevant enough for me to read the full details. Finally, of those articles, 10 percent will be so good that I\u2019ll save or bookmark them for long-term reference. Thus, I\u2019ll read 100 article titles, skim 10 articles for their synopsis, and only read one(ish) article per day, which is much more manageable. Your percentages may vary, but the idea remains the same: filter, filter, filter!", "Remember, this should be fun and you should be learning! If you find yourself getting swamped by too many articles, cut down on the number of publications you follow. Source XYZ hasn\u2019t published anything useful in weeks? Get rid of it! Remember, the idea is to consistently put in a small amount of time throughout your career. Good luck!", "Have other great content recommendations?
