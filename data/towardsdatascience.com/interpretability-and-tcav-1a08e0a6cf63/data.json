The ideas are just based on some common sense and simple math.", "I am currently working on the interpretability of a model prediction. I would like to share my understanding of what is interpretability and go one step further in explaining concept activation vectors and their importance. As always, I\u2019ll try my best to explain it in as simple terms as possible. Here are a few concepts to get you going.", "Interpretability/ Explanation: For suppose, there is a model that is trained to classify a set of images as a cat or not a cat. Interpretability would be explaining why was a particular image classified as a cat. This is important to confirm if the domain expertise knowledge has been reflected in the NN model. Also, it helps the user to develop trust which is needed to use the model.", "Local explanation: If we consider a single data point/ a single image of a cat and explain why is it classified the way it is, then it would be a local explanation. For suppose, it could be the pixels of the face and body of that cat.", "Global explanation: would be explaining what particular features or concepts, in this case, give rise to a classification in the model. In the example that classifies images as a cat or not, the global explanation could be whiskers or the ears of a cat. You can see that I have stressed upon the word model because these features help in understanding the overall behavior of the model and not just a single image.", "Okay, I think you have got the basics now.", "Let\u2019s now talk about a local explanation method namely, saliency maps. For those of you who don\u2019t know much about saliency maps, it assigns how important each input feature was for the prediction. Meaning, the derivative of the probability of the class to each pixel i.e. will a small change of a pixel change the probability of that particular class. If yes, then by how much?", "The problem with saliency maps is confirmation bias, we see only what we think is true. Hence now instead of human\u2019s subjective judgment, if we have a quantitative judgment to understand which concept mattered more it would be a better measure of quality. Also, since humans don\u2019t think in terms of pixels we shall consider high-level human-understandable concepts. Further, understanding why a model works is fairly important instead of a local explanation. So we would like to focus on a global explanation. These desires gave rise to Testing with Concept Activation Vectors (TCAV).", "TCAV provides a quantitative explanation of how important is the concept that we came up with after training for the prediction. But, how would you represent a concept? We do it using a vector, namely Concept Activation Vector (CAV).", "For CAV, we take images of concepts and a few other random images, then we take activations of the network we are investigating. Now since we have activations and the concepts, we train a linear classifier to separate the concepts from the random images. The vector that is orthogonal to the decision boundary gives us the CAV which is a vector that moves towards the concept images and away from the random images.", "Now for the TCAV score, we do something similar to what we did in saliency maps. TCAV score tells us how important each concept was for the prediction. This means that the derivative of the probability of the class to each concept i.e. will a small change of a concept change the probability of that particular class.", "In the paper, TCAV was applied to the real-world problem of predicting diabetic retinopathy (DR) which is a diabetes complication that affects eyes. The model was trained to predict DR level using a 5-point grading scale based on complex criteria, where level 0 corresponds to no DR and 4 corresponds to proliferative DR. Doctors diagnosed DR on diagnostic concepts such as microaneurysms (MA) or pan-retinal laser scars (PRP), with different concepts being more prominent at different DR levels. [1]", "The importance scores of these concepts to the model were tested using TCAV. For some DR levels, TCAV identified the correct diagnostic concepts as being important. However, the model often over-predicted level 1 (mild) as level 2 (moderate). Given this, the doctor said she would like to tell the model to de-emphasize the importance of HMA for level 1. Hence, TCAV may be useful for helping experts interpret and fix model errors when they disagree with model predictions. Thus, making sure that the domain expertise knowledge is reflected in the model. [1]", "It is great but this tool requires humans to collect relevant concepts. There is further research that discusses more on how to do this without human supervision.", "Your home for data science.
