Here, we\u2019ll learn to apply a few essential foundational concepts that help us describe the data using a set of statistical methods.", "A sample is a snapshot of data from a larger dataset; this larger dataset which is all of the data that could be possibly collected is called population. In statistics, the population is a broad, defined, and often theoretical set of all possible observations that are generated from an experiment or from a domain.", "These observations in the sample dataset often fit a certain kind of distribution which is commonly called the normal distribution and formally called Gaussian distribution. It is the most studied distribution because of which there is a subfield of statistics simply dedicated to Gaussian data.", "In this post, we\u2019ll focus on understanding:", "When we plot a dataset such as a histogram, the shape of that charted plot is what we call its distribution. The most commonly observed shape of continuous values is the bell curve which is also called the Gaussian distribution a.k.a. normal distribution.", "It is named after the German mathematician, Carl Friedrich Gauss. Some common example datasets that follow Gaussian distribution are:", "Let\u2019s try to generate the ideal normal distribution and plot it using python.", "We have libraries like Numpy, scipy, and matplotlib to help us plot an ideal normal curve.", "The points on the x-axis are the observations and the y-axis is the likelihood of each observation. We generated regularly spaced observations in the range (-5, 5) using np.arange() and then ran it by the norm.pdf() function with a mean of 0.0 and a standard deviation of 1 which returned the likelihood of that observation.", "Observations around 0 are the most common and the ones around -5.0 and 5.0 are rare. The technical term for the pdf() function is the probability density function.", "It is important to note that not all data fits the Gaussian distribution, and we have to discover the distribution either by reviewing histogram plots of the data or by implementing some statistical tests.", "Some examples of observations that do not fit a Gaussian distribution and instead may fit an exponential (hockey-stick shape) include:", "Until now, we have just talked about the ideal bell-shaped curve of the distribution but if we had to work with random data and figure out its distribution, this is how we would proceed:", "Here\u2019s the output of the code above with the histogram plot of the data.", "The plot looks more like a simple set of blocks but if we change the scale which in this case is the arbitrary number of bins in the histogram. Let\u2019s specify the number of bins and plot:", "We can see that the curve looks closer to a Gaussian bell-shaped curve. Although, we should notice that we have a few observations that are going out of bounds and can be seen as noise. It points to another important conclusion that we should always expect some noise or outliers in our sample of data.", "A fundamental step in exploring a dataset is getting a summarised value for each feature (variable): this is commonly an estimate of where most of the data is located (i.e., the central tendency).", "At first, summarising the data might sound like a piece of cake i.e. just take the mean of the data. In reality, although the mean is very easy to compute and use, it may not always be the best measure for the central value. To solve this problem, statisticians have developed alternative estimates to mean.", "We are going to use the Boston dataset from the sklearn package. I\u2019ve dropped a few columns and this is what the dataframe looks like now:", "Let\u2019s look over the commonly used estimates of location with the help of a sample dataset rather than greek symbols:", "The sum of all values divided by the number of values.", "Python code: Calculating the mean of the Age variable in the data.", "The sum of all values times a weight divided by the sum of the weights.", "Two main motivations for using a weighted mean:", "The value that separates one-half of the data from the other and thus dividing it into the higher and lower half.", "The value such that P percent of the data lies below.", "Python code: we can use the describe method to learn about the percentile", "This gives summary statistics of all the numerical(metrics are different for categorical variables) variables.", "The value such that one-half of the sum of the weights lies above and below the sorted data.", "The average of all values after dropping a fixed number of extreme values. A trimmed mean eliminates the influence of extreme values. For example, while judging an event, we can calculate the final score using the trimmed mean of all the scores so that no judge can manipulate the result.", "Python code: for this, we are going to use the stats module from the scipy library.", "A data value that is very different from most of the data. The median is referred to as a robust estimate of location since it is not influenced by outliers i.e. extreme cases whereas the mean is sensitive to outliers.", "Besides location, we have another method of summarizing a feature. Variability, also referred to as dispersion, tells us how spread-out or clustered the data is.", "Calculating the variability measures for the same dataframe using libraries like pandas, numpy, and scipy.", "The difference between the observed values and the estimate of location.", "The sum of squared deviations from the mean divided by n \u2014 1 where n is the number of data values.", "The square root of the variance.", "The mean of the absolute values of the deviations from the mean.
