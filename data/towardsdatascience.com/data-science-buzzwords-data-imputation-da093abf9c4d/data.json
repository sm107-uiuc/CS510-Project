There are algorithms that don\u2019t accept null values and it can improve model accuracy."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Data Imputation is when you deal with missing data in your data set. We need it because there are algorithms that won\u2019t accept null values and also because we can build more accurate prediction models if we fill the data. How we fill that data in well is something we\u2019ll explore in this article.", "First things first, we need to have a look at our data \u2014 is there a trend to the missing data?", "There are 3 main categories of missing data:", "Missing Completely at Random (MCAR) \u2014 this is the only type of missing data that can be verified. When data are MCAR it means there is absolutely no pattern to the missing data points. This can be checked by randomly splitting your data into the rows that are completed and the rows with missing data. If the characteristics of the two sub-datasets are different, it means your data is MCAR.", "Missing at Random (MAR)\u200a\u2014\u200awhen data are MAR it means that the data is missing due to something systematic that can be observed, but not related to the missing data itself. For instance, in your dataset of two columns, Age and Gender, you might notice that there is more data missing in the Age for the Males\u00a0than\u00a0the\u00a0Females,\u00a0by\u00a0counting\u00a0the\u00a0missing\u00a0values\u00a0for\u00a0each.", "Missing Not at Random (MNAR) \u2014 when data are MNAR it\u2019s because there is a relationship between another factor and the missing data. For instance, if you have a survey with a question asking for their first pet\u2019s name, it might be left blank often by those have never had a pet. There is a systematic reason that there is missing data.", "I\u2019m going to outline a few common methods to deal with missing data. There are lots more, but this is just an insight into some things that you can do.", "Drop the missing data \u2014 depending on how much data is missing, we could just ignore the rows that have data missing. If this is only a few, maybe a couple of percent of the data when you have 10,000s of rows, that might be the simplest option which doesn\u2019t impact your results much.", "Replace with the average of the data\u200a\u2014\u200athis one has a lot of variations, depending on what you find in your data. Firstly, we have three types of average: mean, median and mode. With non-numeric data, you of course can\u2019t use mean or median, so your only option is to fill the missing data with the mode. However, with numerical data, all three averages are a possibility. Something to be aware of when you use these methods, is that you are artificially reducing the variance of the data which may affect how a model trained on the data performs on new data. Which average you choose is dependent on your dataset, for instance, you might choose the median if the column with missing data has a large skew in its distribution.", "This method can be used on the whole of the dataset or you can break it down. For instance, if you are trying to fill in the Age column with an average value, you could either take the average of all of the data in question and fill the null values or you might look at another column, let\u2019s say you have a Gender column and you realise that the average Age for Males is 25 but the average Age for Females is 35, so choose to fill the missing Age values with the respective calculated averages for the two Genders. Note though, that the more you break down your dataset to calculate the means, the more computationally expensive it is and the longer it\u2019s likely to take.", "Regression \u2014 you can use regression techniques to predict what the null values are, based on the other variables in the data. There are many different types of regression, depending on what types your data are and the relationship between them. In theory, you could use any appropriate regression algorithm to impute your data. This is another method that can be computationally expensive depending on the amount of data and the complexity of your regression algorithm.", "Multiple Imputation \u2014 to compensate for the potential biases of imputing data, it is possible to introduce some natural variation into the values calculated. The variation is calculated based on the distribution of the data; the algorithm can estimate how much variation in the created values there should be. This is a computationally expensive method, but something worth considering, particularly if your data is from a source which is likely to have natural variation.", "Key point: make sure to only do calculations on the training data so there is no data leakage. If you do the calculations with your test/validation data you might find that your algorithm is really accurate, but then when you get to brand new data, you get a really low accuracy.", "There are lots of ways to fill missing data, and what you choose to do will be different depending on your dataset and how much data is missing. The more complex your imputation algorithms, the longer they are likely to take. It\u2019s important to trade off between the complexity of your imputation and the pay off it will give you.", "Your home for data science.
