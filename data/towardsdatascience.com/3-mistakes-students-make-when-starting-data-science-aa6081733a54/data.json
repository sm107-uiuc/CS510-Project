Visualization need not be novel but must be thoughtful and complete. Some tips to improve visualization:", "2. Rainbow colors are a big no! Colors can make the plot visually stimulating, but too much is never good. The downfall of the rainbow palette has been documented several times and countless posts go over this in more detail, a simple Google search will uncover numerous articles.My rule of thumb: Use color sparingly and bring a certain aspect of the viewer\u2019s visualization to attention.", "The post below goes into some detail to show how you can use some easy tools to pick better colors, colorbrewer2.org is a website I often use.", "3. Choosing the right visualization: This may sound like a \u201cduh, genius!\u201d point, but it is worthwhile to think of a plot in the sense of conveying a message rather than conveying an observation from the data. The post below is a good starting point. Tip: Try to think of less ideal visualizations for the examples presented.", "Finally, if you are a Northeastern student I would highly recommend taking up a visualization course \u2014 like DS5500.", "Storytelling is incredibly powerful to help the audience understand your perspective on the data and problem you are trying to solve.

Watch how presenters go over the analysis and try to think if there is another way you would convey the same message.", "Final thought: The presenter is like the shepherd guiding the audience (the sheep) through the data to a conclusion. You don\u2019t want the sheep to be lost when you arrive at the conclusion.", "Starting with data science I too was eager to fit models and present the highest accuracy on the test set. But over time I have realized that a model is only as good as the data used to build the model. Exploratory data analysis is not only a way for you to better understand the data but also to better communicate to the audience why certain decisions are made. 70% of my time as a data scientist is spent cleaning up data and spotting inconsistencies.", "A few things to think about before modeling:", "In conclusion, focus on your audience and present a story from the data.
