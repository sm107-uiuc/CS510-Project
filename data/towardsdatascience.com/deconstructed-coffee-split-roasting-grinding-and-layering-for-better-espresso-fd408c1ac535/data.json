Then I made a layered (staccato) shot by first putting the fine layer, then the coarse, and then the mid. I found each layer provided certain flavors contributing to the overall flavor, and through this method, I got a better tasting espresso shot. Then I started thinking crazy.", "I started thinking about coffee roasting. I didn\u2019t like single origin coffees because I found them not to be balanced, and I had been roasting at home for three years. Typically, I would blend a bean from Africa and a bean from South America to produce a great blend. I blended before roasting because I didn\u2019t want to invest the time into roasting two separate times and blending after the roast.", "However, a natural extension to separating particle sizes is to separate coffee blends to separate bean groups. I couldn\u2019t resist making the process more complicated because at that point, I had the most complex espresso preparation routine. I present the history, the technique in both staccato espresso shots and staccato tamped shots, and show some data collected over the months to show how it produces a better shot in taste and EY.", "To experiment, I roasted a typical blend of two bean types separately. I kept the blend separated, and I ground and sifted them separately. I started experimenting with a six layer staccato shot: 2 fine layers, 2 coarse layers, and 2 mid layers. I examined taste by alternately which layer came first, and which layers benefited the most from being split. I found only the fine layer needed to be separated, but which layer came first had an impact on how beneficial the technique was.", "In a first experiment, I roasted Colombia Honey Process Buenos Aires Gesha and Rwanda Dry Process Rusizi Nyakarenzo separately. I then ground and sifted them separately, and I started testing. I immediately saw score differences. I didn\u2019t know how significant they were, and at the time I started splitting all my shots, I would only change the orientation in the first two shots of the roast.", "I pulled the data I had across a few different roasts, and it is not enough data to draw any strong conclusions, but there is certainly variability across roasts. Here is a head to head:", "This comparison looks at No Split vs the two different orientations:", "Staccato tamping was a derivative of the staccato shot. I was working with some darker roasted coffee from Hawaii, and I found putting all the grounds in the filter to be too messy. So I started putting only half, distributing, and tamping, followed by the other half. At the same time, I was developing a deeper understanding of staccato espresso, and I discovered the mid layer (top layer in staccato shot) was the key layer to determine how well the shot donuted or not based on its tamp.", "I experimented with doing a harder tamp on the first half of a regular shot followed by a much lighter tamp for the top half, and the staccato tamping technique was born. I started tracking the bottom layer pressure, and I found somewhere between 300g and 500g of pressure you be optimal for the bottom layer. For the top layer, I use a leveler, and I track the depth of the leveler.", "After I felt more secure in the technique, I started splitting the roast for staccato tamped shots resulting in four layers. I would weigh and distribute the first two layers, tamp, weight and distribute the second two layers, and level.", "For Staccato Tamped preparation, I also found a benefit in splitting the beans. That preparation involves two layers, top and bottom, where the bottom layer is tamped harder than the first. Similarly to splitting a staccato espresso shot, the top layer doesn\u2019t need to be split. I typically split it just for simplicity sake.", "I collected this data over the course of a year, but the difficulty was making sure I had controlled samples. A lot has changed in my technique in the past year, and I would take some samples with and without splitting on a regular basis. Recently, I curated the dataset, and I found I had a reasonable amount of samples to convince myself that the phenomena was not due to confirmation bias on my part, but it was observable.", "I used two metrics for evaluating the differences between shots: Final Score and Coffee Extraction.", "Final score is the average of a scorecard of 7 metrics (Sharp, Rich, Syrup, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Aftertaste). These scores were subjective, of course, but they were calibrated to my tastes and helped me improve my shots. There is some variation in the scores. My aim was to be consistent for each metric, but some times the granularity was difficult and affected the final score.", "Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) is measured using a refractometer, and this number is used to determine the percentage of coffee extracted into the cup in combined with the output weight of the shot and the input weight of the coffee, called Extraction Yield (EY).", "Looking at some scatter plots of all the data, it is difficult to see a separation of regular and split shots. This is due to a data imbalance due to my data collection.", "So let\u2019s reduce this data to just the best pairs of shots for each roast, regular and split.", "The pattern seems a little clear, but we have paired data, so let\u2019s compare shot per shot. For taste (Final Score), split shots seem improve over regular shots, and for EY, they are often better.", "When viewed on a line chart instead of a scatter plot, we can sort the shots and see how they perform. There are some anomalies, but it isn\u2019t random.", "We can look at a statistical test to understand if these differences in results are statistically significant. For taste, they are, but EY is still a bit too close in distribution. More data is needed, but at the same time, I\u2019ve been working to increase EY, so my hope is that the taste is improving even if EY stays the same. I don\u2019t have enough data to show a trend one way or another.", "We can further break this data down by roast and staccato espresso or staccato tamped. For taste, some of the roasts don\u2019t get much of a benefit, but some do. For EY, one roast in particular is problematic (4/6/2020).", "For the 4/6/2020 roast, two of these shots split the roast based on the top or the bottom but not a split in both the top and bottom layers. So it was 9 grams of one roast, 9 grams of the other, instead of 4.5 bean 1, 4.5 bean 2 on the bottom and the same on the top. Removing those two samples, the EY now sees a statistically significant improvement (the threshold is a p-Value < 0.05).", "We can expand the data to compare the same regular shots multiple times to different split shots because the number of split shots was much greater than regular shots. Not all split shots were great. I was merely comparing the best split shots to the regular shots. Some of these shots had lower Final Score and/or EY because they were involved in other experiments such as heat beans, cooling grinds, or modifying the distributor.", "One of the variables that is not controlled, as well as I would have liked, is the output to input ratio. Ideally, this would be the same for every shot, but part of the artistry is ending the shot visually. Some people use a scale, but I\u2019ve been using a measuring cup where I knew the volume range that would give the desired output level. Then I measure the output with a scale after the shot. At the start of this collection, the ratio was typically 0.9 to 1.1, and towards the end, the ratio has drifted to 1.2 to 1.4.", "Let\u2019s assume there is a linear relationship between EY and ratio, we can do a best-fit line as seen below. There is a variety of wiggle, but we could still use this to adjust all the EY\u2019s to what the EY would be at the 1:1 ratio. There are more shots used for this linear relationship than the paired shots because I included as many shots as I could from those roasts even though they didn\u2019t have a pairing.", "Then we could take a look at the pairs with adjusted EY\u2019s and test for statistical significance. Again, we run into a similar issue with two shots from the 4/6/2020 roast due to them not being in the same manner of staccato tamped shots. After removing those, the difference between split and regular shots is statistically significant.", "This results should not be too surprising because the paired shots were pulled in the same time frame, so the range of ratio was usually similar.", "I presented a work here built on the staccato concept to improve espresso even further by splitting a roast by the bean. The result has been an improvement on taste and extraction. This split roast staccato technique has had a lasting impact on my espresso routine, and these experiments have furthered the notion that the espresso process is still mysterious with room to grow.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
