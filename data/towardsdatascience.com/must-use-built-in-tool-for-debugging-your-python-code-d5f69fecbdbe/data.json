However, this chore could be time-consuming and quite stressful.", "Fortunately, python is an exceptional programming language and offers us a variety of ways to deal with the issue of debugging.", "One such simple to use module that we will utilize today to debug our program is the pdb library module.", "PDB stands for The Python Debugger.", "The pdb library module defines an interactive source code debugger for Python programs.", "It supports setting (conditional) breakpoints and single stepping at the source line level, an inspection of stack frames, source code listing, and evaluation of arbitrary Python code in the context of any stack frame. It also supports post-mortem debugging and can be called under program control.", "Let us discuss with some code on how we can utilize this module for debugging our python programs! Oh, and technically it can be just done in one line! \ud83d\ude03", "Alright, so the debugging of your python code can be done with just this one line. The command is as follows \u2014", "You could also write this command as follows \u2014", "Now, we will understand in further detail how this can be utilized in our programs. Let us start off by looking at the set_trace command.", "This command is used to enter the debugger at the calling stack frame. This is useful to hard-code a breakpoint at a given point in a program, even if the code is not otherwise being debugged (e.g. when an assertion fails). If given, the header is printed to the console just before debugging begins.", "To understand this module in more detail let us use the help of the simple code block below and analyze it \u2014", "The above code block consists of a simple for loop that is going to run for five iterations. Since we have used the pdb.set_trace command, the program at the end of each iteration will have a breaking point and let you analyze the loop.", "The below output block is a representation of how to use the python debugger module. The pdb.set_trace() functions offers the user many command options. We will discuss these shortly.", "I have typed \u2018c\u2019 next to the (Pdb) block. This command tells the function to continue with the execution. The \u2018h\u2019 command is the option that allows users to look at the various command choices available to them. The help command displays the following options \u2014", "Let us analyze what these choices available to the user exactly represent.", "The commands recognized by the debugger are listed below. Most commands can be abbreviated to one or two letters as indicated; e.g. h(elp) means that either h or help can be used to enter the help command (but not he or hel, nor H or Help or HELP). Arguments to commands must be separated by whitespace (spaces or tabs). Optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets ([]) in the command syntax; the square brackets must not be typed. Alternatives in the command syntax are separated by a vertical bar (|).", "Print a stack trace, with the most recent frame at the bottom. An arrow indicates the current frame, which determines the context of most commands.", "Move the current frame count (default one) levels down in the stack trace (to a newer frame).", "Continue execution, only stop when a breakpoint is encountered.", "Without argument, print the list of available commands. With a command as an argument, print help about that command. help pdb displays the full documentation (the docstring of the pdb module). Since the command argument must be an identifier, help exec must be entered to get help on the ! command.", "Quit from the debugger. The program being executed is aborted.", "These are most of the important commands that will help you debug your code more easily. For more codes and commands, visit the official website for the python debugger module.", "The python debugger tool is an asset for python developers. However, it is sometimes overlooked. I would highly recommend all of you to check out this module and make good use of it when you are stuck while debugging your python code.", "The python debugger pdb is an absolutely amazing library module for step-wise debugging of your code.", "If you are stuck in a problem, and you don\u2019t know where exactly the underlying error is occurring, then it is a good choice to make use of this module.", "Debugging your code is one of the most significant aspects of programming. Writing code is an important part of computing programs, but evaluating and debugging is also an essential characteristic of coding.", "If debugging is the process of removing software bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.", "Check out these other articles that you might enjoy reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope you guys enjoyed reading this article. I hope you all have a wonderful day ahead!", "Your home for data science.
