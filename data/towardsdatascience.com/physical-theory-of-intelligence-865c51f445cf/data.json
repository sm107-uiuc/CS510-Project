Among the ones I\u2019d encountered most share some core ideas, so I\u2019ve been trying to combine and distill them into a more formal and general framework. Here I want to propose PTI in attempt to describe basic blocks required for understanding of intelligence on top of which you can describe related phenomena.", "Let\u2019s start with a review of how intelligence is described among different fields.", "In psychology, probably the most famous theory is Spearman\u2019s General Intelligence or g factor. Based on factor analysis of multiple tests, he concluded that scores among those are remarkably similar. Since then, psychologists have tried to describe and measure this general factor, and created a bunch of IQ tests which measure a wide range of abstract cognitive abilities. While those tests are widely used nowadays, their weak theoretical foundation often leads to misinterpretation of the results.", "On the other\u00a0side, some psychologists have tried to describe intelligence as a compositional system with modules for different sensory modalities, levels of abstraction or another way of dividing mental capacities, like Thurstone\u2019s Primary Mental Abilities, Gardner\u2019s Multiple Intelligences, Sternberg\u2019s Triarchic model and others. Those usually have more descriptive nature and rarely lead to testable predictions or practical tests, but they capture a much wider scope of abilities of our brains.", "In philosophy, study of consciousness gets most attention among related concepts, but often this consciousness is attributed with all kinds of cognitive abilities described by psychologists. Most significant development\u00a0over the last decades, in my view, have been the transition from Cartesian theater / single actor descriptive models to distributed computational\u00a0systems.", "In neuroscience, after researchers have discovered that brains consist of individual neurons which regularly communicate through spikes, development of computational models became a trend. We already have a good understanding of how spikes are generated in neurons and how they propagate, but still rather little about how circuits of such neural models can represent our behaviour. Some theories, like Hierarchical Temporal Memory, use networks of neurons as basic elements, but this complicates multi-scale analysis and experimentation ever further.", "On the edge between neuroscience and philosophy you can find models like\u00a0Information\u00a0Integration\u00a0Theory and Information Closure Theory. IIT\u200a\u2014\u200acomputationally hard, but has interesting predictions and promising approximations for medical research of consciousness. ICT is similar in many ways, has simplified theoretical foundations and computations, but is rather new and hasn\u2019t\u00a0been\u00a0developed\u00a0as\u00a0much.", "In economics humans are usually modelled as rational agents using decision theory. These models, like Functional Decision Theory, are quite good at describing how agents should act to maximize their rewards. However, huge amount of factors impacting our behaviour and individual preferences makes it very hard to apply these models in real world scenarios.", "All this research inspired engineers to try to build machines that can think on their own. Nowadays, first computers may look like clumsy noisy calculators, but for a long time people believed that doing algebra requires a lot of intelligence. Modern approaches to artificial intelligence engineering, like artificial neural networks and decision trees, have a much broader scope of applications in all kinds of industries, as well as promising results on problems which were considered extremely hard just a decade ago. While passing Turing test under strict rules is still a hard problem, AI-generated content already competes with humans in some areas and research in this direction often reveals mind-blowing findings.", "As you may see, questions about intelligence arise across many fields, but unfortunately this research rarely intersects. I believe a simple commontheoretical framework can help with that.", "Let\u2019s start with observable universe U and some agent a \u2286 U. Choice of the boundary is arbitrary in general, but humans, brains, neurons, hardware and software get most of the attention. Complement of a is an environment E, which may send inputs i and receive outputs o from the agent. Also, in some cases it makes sense to construct abstract agents like mathematical models for research or engineering purposes.", "On the very basic level inputs and outputs are represented as elementary particles, but for most cases it makes more sense to approximate them as chemicals, symbols, electrical signals, words or in other ways.", "In some cases defining agent\u2019s boundary can be rather straightforward, like neurons with their cell membrane or a standalone chip. In others, like humans with all the devices we use every day which shaped the way we communicate with each other, there arises an important distinction between someone touching the screen or sending a message, especially with all the research of direct brain-computer interfaces\u00a0going\u00a0on\u00a0right\u00a0now. Same goes for software and all the systems most production applications are connected with, cells, social groups, and even elementary particles in quantum states whose boundary may not be completely understood.", "Also, in most cases tracking all the inputs and outputs of the agent is virtually impossible due to an extreme amount of information coming in the form of photons, sound waves, pressure on the skin and other ways every second. I want to emphasize that we don\u2019t usually know complete internal state of the agent, but only some outputs that it\u2019s emitting. So, we must stay aware that clean experimental studies are rarely possible and interpret the results accordingly.", "Suppose agent\u2019s a outputs aren\u2019t entirely random and depend on the inputs. Then, we can model agent\u2019s behaviour as a policy function a(i)=o. Also, most agents change with time depending on their previous state, so we can represent them like a(i\u1d57)=f\u1d43(i\u1d57, a(i\u1d57\u02c9\u00b9))=o\u1d57, where f\u1d43 is a transition operator of a.", "Simplest agent I can imagine is an abstract ideal wire, who\u2019s policy is an identity function a(i)=i.", "We know pretty well the behaviour of elementary particles as well as smallest atoms, which is usually described with wave functions. This is also true for many artificial and abstract agents. However, policies of larger molecules, cells, plants, animals and social agents are way more complicated, so we have to deal with different models and approximations. Even with a complete description of the agent\u2019s function, analysis can be extremely hard, like with modern artificial neural networks with billions of parameters.", "Suppose a encounters some problem while we observe i/o, then we can use some performance function p(i, o) to estimate how well is it doing. In many cases measurements change with time or have stochastic nature, so it makes more sense to calculate performance over a set of observations.\u00a0Also, in some cases what we are really interested in are relative scores, like IQ or performance of AI agents in comparison with humans.", "Then, we can describe most definitions of intelligence as some performance functions.", "Probably the most famous intelligence metric is IQ or intelligence quotient, which was designed to assess cognitive performance of humans relative to the peers of the same age. Over the last hundred years a bunch of IQ tests were developed and tons of experiments\u00a0were\u00a0conducted\u00a0to\u00a0explore\u00a0correlations\u00a0between\u00a0scores\u00a0and different\u00a0aspects\u00a0of\u00a0our\u00a0lives. However, despite statistical significance in some cases, these tests usually measure performance on abstract problems, which leaves very little room for extrapolation of results to real-world problems. Also, misinterpretation of IQ scores in public sphere led to poor reputation of such tests, so most psychologists gradually shifted towards the development of more specialized ones.", "Anyway, IQ is not the only option, and we have a wide variety of other human-oriented tests for marketing, hiring, medical,\u00a0educational\u00a0and\u00a0other\u00a0purposes. One particularly interesting example is consciousness level measurement of the brain activity based on IIT. However, even IQ is rather poorly understood, while other tests usually have even less studies behind them.", "On\u00a0a\u00a0bigger\u00a0scale with\u00a0social agents, from groups and companies up to countries, performance functions mostly come from economics, like profits, GDP, etc. However, other options based on member count, average lifespan, depression rates, group-IQ and other social factors exist as well.", "For artificial agents, performance measurement problems and solutions are quite similar in many ways. With usual hardware and software, first tests usually give just a binary output whether it\u2019s working or not\u00a0at\u00a0all. Then, subsystems might be checked one by one, agent might be overloaded with inputs or get particularly tricky ones, as well as tested for speed of execution. Some developers are even focusing on testing as the core of\u00a0software\u00a0engineering.", "Also, since the beginning of transistors and modern computers people have thought about what would it take for a computer to get human-level intelligence. The most famous one is Turing test, which basically measures if a computer can mimic a random human in a written conversation. But, it proved to be rather easy task for short dialogs, and more strict versions are developed as capabilities of artificial agents grow.", "With the rise of differential programming, statistical modelling and deep learning in particular, a lot of new performance metrics were developed to handle uncertain outputs and use this information to train those agents. Also, many AI researchers are using multiple tests for each model to make sure they have as wide capabilities as possible. Overall, as artificial agents tackle more and more human problems, their performance functions become more and more similar.", "First of all, as I have tried to base this theory on physics, metaphysical aspects of consciousness and intelligence were discarded completely. Also, there are things that are much harder to measure like aesthetic pleasure from art, social skills, quality of moral judgements and many others.", "Another common theme is general intelligence. While psychologists are trying to distill and explain g factor responsible for a lot of variation in intelligence tests and AI engineers are trying to build better generalisation measures and even Artificial General Intelligence, I think it is ultimately a meaningless question as agent\u2019s performance tied to particular problems in its environment.", "Your home for data science.
