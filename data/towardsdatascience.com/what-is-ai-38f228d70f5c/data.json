What\u2019s most relevant is the idea of the duck test; here\u2019s what it says:", "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.", "Interestingly enough, that\u2019s the basic formula for artificial intelligence today. You can break it down into two parts: training, which is done using machine learning, and inference, which is usually done by AI.", "If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck\u2026", "The first part of the duck test refers to the training. This can be done in several ways, and it\u2019s where other practices like machine learning come into the picture. Regardless of what type of learning is applied, though, the goal is to produce an algorithm that can be used by a computer (or any device that can do computing like your cell phone or anything that has the word \u201csmart\u201d in it) to accurately identify in the future what it previously learned.", "Let\u2019s use images of ducks as an example. We want a computer to be able to identify ducks in the future, whether it\u2019s in still images like JPEG or PNG, or video like MP4; after all, a video is just a collection of images being shown really quickly (e.g., cinematic video is usually 24 frames per second, or FPS, which means that in one second, 24 images are flashed across the screen to produce what looks like movement). The ability to identify ducks or other objects (usually called Objects of Interest) in images or video is called computer vision, which is a practical term because computers or other devices are simulating a sense of sight. Computer vision is one of the hottest topics in AI, and the specialty of the only profitable pure-play AI startup in the world, SenseTime.", "Without getting into detail on how machine learning or the different types of machine learning work, let\u2019s train our algorithm to accurately identify a duck in images or videos. We could do this by providing a set of images for it to learn with, which we call the training dataset. In the training data set, thousands of different images of ducks and not-ducks (any other animals or objects). Sometimes, the duck might be waddling on land, while in others, it might be flying, swimming, or opening its bill to quack. We might throw in some trickier images of geese or swans. We can also feed it images that are obviously not ducks (e.g., cats, which are four-legged animals that don\u2019t have feathers, wings, nor bills). We can label each photo as \u201cduck\u201d or \u201cnot duck\u201d and after feeding the computer all the images, it should have a good idea of what is or isn\u2019t a duck.", "Now it\u2019s time to test its learning. After looking through thousands of pictures of ducks and not-ducks, the computer will have generated an algorithm (an algorithm is just code, and you can think of it as rules) that it will use to identify future ducks. Before deploying it into the real world, though, we need to make sure that the algorithm it generated is accurate, and to what degree. The degree is especially important because different use cases require different levels of accuracy (we\u2019ll talk about this more later). To test its learning, we have another set of images that are different from the first set of images, which we call the validation dataset.", "This set will also have lots of images in it, similar to the training data set. Some will be of ducks, and some will be of not-ducks. The computer now looks through each of the images, but does not do any learning; instead, it applies its algorithm and labels each image as a duck or not-duck. As the human trainer, we have all the answers \u2014 we know exactly how many images are ducks, and which ones they are. We compare the correct answers we have to the guesses that the computer made to see how accurate it (and therefore its algorithm) is.", "Let\u2019s say the algorithm was able to accurately identify 95% of ducks; i.e., out of 1,000 images of ducks, 50 of them were incorrectly labeled and 950 of them were correctly labeled. The 5% of labels that were errors is called the error rate. In some cases, images of ducks were incorrectly labeled as not-ducks. We call those errors false negatives (it was falsely labeled as negative, i.e., a not-duck). On the other hand, we have some images of not-ducks incorrectly labeled as ducks. We call those errors false positives (it was falsely labeled positive, i.e., a duck).", "95% might sound great \u2014 I would be very happy to receive such a grade on my final exam. Putting something with 95% accuracy into production at scale, though, might be a terrible mistake. Let\u2019s say, for example, instead of looking at ducks, we\u2019re looking at medical images to detect signs of cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that in the US in 2019 there will be almost 2 million diagnoses of cancer (more accurately 1.7 million, but I rounded to 2 for simpler math). If a computer algorithm that had 95% accuracy made those diagnoses, we would have quite a problem.", "On the one hand, if the 5% error were all false positives, then 100,000 people would have been told they have cancer when they don\u2019t have it. It probably goes without saying, but being told you have cancer is a life-changing diagnosis that impacts patients and their loved ones on a deeply emotional level. Research on the long-term effects of false-positive diagnoses for breast cancer has shown that even three years after the diagnoses, patients will feel the effects of the psychosocial impact.", "On the other hand, if the 5% error were all false negatives, then many patients would have been told they don\u2019t have cancer when they do. The impact of that extends both psychologically and physically.", "Could we have just written the algorithm for identifying the duck ourselves? Yes, a programmer could certainly write one. But it would unlikely come close to the algorithm the computer could write based on its own experience of seeing thousands of pictures of ducks and not-ducks. This is why machine learning has become such a critical piece of artificial intelligence recently.", "To clarify, artificial intelligence and machine learning are not the same things. Machine learning, as we just learned, is used to create algorithms that are used to predict (a fancy and confident way of saying guess) certain things such as whether or not an object of interest is a duck.", "Let\u2019s say our duck algorithm\u2019s 95% accuracy was good enough; i.e., we could forgive a 5% error rate. The next thing we would need to do is put the algorithm into use, a process called inference.", "\u2026Then it is probably a duck.", "Inference is the process of taking the trained algorithm and applying it to a use case. Unlike in training, there are no more datasets; instead, data comes flowing in and is automatically processed by the algorithm, which then produces a result. With inference, data does not need to be stored; instead, once the incoming data is processed by the algorithm, it is no longer needed.", "In our case, we are ready to deploy our duck/not-duck algorithm. I can install it on a video camera in my backyard (just like the algorithm example I\u2019m using, my backyard is imaginary as well) to log the number of times ducks visit my large koi pond (imaginary) every day. In this example, I might refer to my video camera as an AI camera, because it now can take a video feed and think about whether or not a duck has appeared by using the machine learning algorithm we just trained previously.", "At the end of the day, I may check the results from the camera, and it would tell me it counted 100 ducks. But there are limitations to this data. The problem with inference is that it can only tell me that it\u2019s probably a duck, not that it certainly is a duck; after all, we know that the algorithm is 95% accurate.", "There is a 5% error rate that could be due to false negatives or false positives \u2014 but that\u2019s acceptable for my use case, because maybe my goal is not to count the exact number of ducks that visited my koi pond, but rather, reduce the number of ducks visiting because every time they visit, my koi are at risk of being eaten. I can use the duck count as a benchmark, try doing different things and seeing if that number changes significantly. For example, I could place a wolf statue around the pond and then recheck my numbers. If the number of ducks dropped to 99, that could be just due to the error rate \u2014 I can\u2019t draw a clear conclusion from that. If it dropped to 10, though, I can be more confident that my fake wolf was worth the investment!", "Another issue is that I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 100 unique ducks that visited my pond or just one persistent, pesky duck. But then I can use machine learning again, to retrain my existing algorithm as not just a duck-identifier, but a duck facial-recognition algorithm to identify each duck and the number of times they visited. I could also just train an entirely new algorithm to do the duck facial recognition, and add that algorithm to the camera, too, so that after the first algorithm identifies the duck, the second one can identify whether or not it\u2019s the same as a previous one or not.", "I hope this was a fun and simple example of what AI is in today\u2019s world, and how machine learning is a big part of it. Through the example, I wanted to also point out some of the limitations when creating algorithms and also the considerations when deploying them \u2014 seemingly acceptable error rates can have large consequences when scaled out in production. If you want to read about more, real-world examples of such consequences, take a look at Cathy O\u2019Neil\u2019s book, Weapons of Math Destruction (referral link).", "Your home for data science.
