I started using a scale for coffee in 2016, and it made a big difference in consistence for shot preparation. I recently got a PYXIS scale, and I put it through some tests to see how well it would.", "I didn\u2019t start using it to measure the espresso shot until 2018, and that improved the quality of my shot. I later got a shot glass with markings, and I could usually get my shots to be within a gram or two of each other by using those markings as a guide. Others have used a scale during the shot to end the shot at a more exact output, but my machine doesn\u2019t have the room underneath to fit a digital scale\u2026 until now!", "I got the PYXIS scale by Acaia (as a birthday gift from Mom, thanks Mom!) because it could log the shot, fit under my machine, and seemed reliable. It comes with a nice carrying case too! I had to remove the grate on top of my drip tray, but the scale fits perfectly in the tray.", "My previous scale is inexpensive, and it has been pretty accurate. The company says it is accurate to 0.03g.", "I had done a spatial test with this scale, and there was a bias from front to back.", "I had read reviews, and almost everyone loved the scale but not the app. There are a few apps that Acaia has made, and they are okay, but they could be better.", "The first shot I pulled, I liked the graph, but when I pull the cup, I don\u2019t stop the app immediately, so the graph is unreadable due to a large jump. I would stop the app, but one hand of mine is holding onto the lever of my machine.", "However, as a data scientist, I clean my data anyways, so it isn\u2019t a big deal. I pull the data into Numbers, and I correct any values for cup movement or the end of the shot. I also use a median filter to remove some of the data spikes, which cleaned up the data dramatically.", "For flow rate, I looked at smoothing over a few seconds of a window so I could see a general trend. During pre-infusion, coffee drips out, but during infusion, I\u2019m pressure pulsing which is why the flow fluctuates drastically.", "I also used the scale to profile my super automatic, and it showed a nice steady flow.", "One of the issues with scales is that a change in temperature can change the measured weight. I know this very well from putting a cold filter basket onto my old scale. So I did a similar test for this one.", "I did two hot tests and one cold. Then I recorded the weight drift over time. The trend is consistent, but it isn\u2019t much. I looks like 0.4g/C, but that isn\u2019t too bad, and it took a long time for that to happen.", "I wanted to repeat similar tests like I did for my other scale, and I was very impressed. I looked at repeatability where I did multiple weight trials and recorded the results with the app. Then I did spatial trials.", "Not only was the error about 0.01g, in most cases the weight stabilized in 0.5 seconds. This is incredible performance and necessary to get meaningful flow rate logging from the scale.", "Not all everything is rosy, but I can live with these issues.", "Overall, this was a solid piece of equipment. I\u2019ve been using it for every shot for a week, and I\u2019ve been impressed. I\u2019ve really enjoyed adding it to my workflow, and I\u2019m excited for what data discoveries I will be able to make with it.", "I suspect it will give insights about the rate of flow change for pre-infusion and infusion, and I wonder if it could give a better signal for when to end pre-infusion or infusion.", "Hopefully, it will help me make better espresso. So far, it has helped me nail an output weight target which is excellent for controlled experiments.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
