Yet somehow, I feel like I\u2019m no further along than when I started.", "As I continue reading articles on programming, data science, and cloud computing, it\u2019s hard not to feel overwhelmed and intimidated by the cool stuff everyone else is doing. Even looking at the Python subreddit makes me wonder how people who have only been learning for a few months can build such complex projects.", "I started the CS50 course by Harvard, which I would highly recommend to anyone looking for an introduction to Computer Science. After every lecture, you\u2019re tasked to write code to solve an assignment based on that week\u2019s topic. I recently finished Week 3 on \u201cAlgorithms\u201d and completed the second assignment.", "It took me almost six hours.", "When my code finally passed all the tests, I was more relieved than ecstatic. Staring at a seemingly simple problem and not knowing how to fix bug after bug for so long made me question whether I even had any problem-solving skills to speak of. I also wondered how long it took others to solve. Surely most people (from students of Harvard to the thousands of enrolled in the online course) didn\u2019t need to spend half a day on one assignment.", "Thankfully, before I spiraled into a black hole of self-doubt (mild exaggeration), two events put me back on track. They helped me realize that while it\u2019s great to always want to learn more, it\u2019s also important to believe in your abilities so far. You might be further along than you think.", "Let\u2019s dive into the two things you should do to check if you suck at programming!", "I recently looked at some code I wrote for work a few months ago and thought \u201cwow, this is bad.\u201d I shook my head and started to untangle the mess of functions and variables I\u2019d created, wondering all the while why I didn\u2019t add more comments to it.", "My girlfriend saw me grumbling to myself as I typed away and asked what was wrong. When I told her that my code sucked, she asked, \u201cDoes it work?\u201d", "\u201cYeah, it works, but it\u2019s so messy and I barely remember how I wrote this in the first place.\u201d I said.", "\u201cWell, you\u2019re already almost done fixing it now, so that means you do remember.\u201d she replied.", "It\u2019s a simple question, yes, but it can reveal so much. First, I will preface the rest of this section by saying that yes, it\u2019s important that what you build is built well (scalability, readability, avoiding deep nesting, DRY, etc.). I\u2019m not saying that you should be happy if you write garbage that technically fulfills its intended function.", "However, if you what you built serves its purpose and isn\u2019t completely confusing when you need to explain how it works, you should be proud!", "This brings me to how you can test your programming skills by building something for someone. There\u2019s an incredibly satisfying feeling that you get watching code you wrote help someone else.", "My girlfriend recently needed to translate text from PDF files. However, the PDFs she\u2019s working with are scanned images. She can\u2019t actually copy any of the text, so she\u2019s had to manually type paragraphs into Google Translate. Also, since she only needs a few paragraphs of the PDF translated, using an online service that would translate the whole document (or even a page) wouldn\u2019t be very helpful.", "I saw what she was doing and thought to myself \u201cHm, I could probably help with that\u201d.", "I then wrote a really, really simple CLI application for her that would take an image as an argument, get all the text from the image with pytesseract, then copy that text to the clipboard.", "Typing paragraphs into Google Translate isn\u2019t a hugely time-consuming task. With that being said, even if I\u2019ve only shaved off 30 minutes of her work every day, that\u2019s still an extra 30 minutes of her life that she gets back!", "Identifying a solution and building it to help her, strangely enough, helped me realize that all my learning so far isn\u2019t confined to my head. I could actually use it to make other peoples\u2019 lives better.", "And you can too! Look around to the people close to you, whether it\u2019s your family or colleagues, and I\u2019m sure you\u2019ll be able to find something that you can help them automate. Being able to think of and develop a solution, even if its one for a trivial problem, is programming.", "This is advice that you\u2019ve probably seen before. Teaching someone a concept you just learned is a great way for you to retain information. This is because it\u2019s impossible to teach without first understanding the subject. If you try to teach someone a new concept without having mastered it, you may be able to recite a basic summary, but you won\u2019t be able to answer any of their follow up questions.", "I first learned about list comprehensions in Python a while back and I\u2019ve used them in various scenarios since. However, I only really knew that I understood them when I helped my girlfriend with one of her scripts.", "She was looking for a way to automate moving files into different folders based on part of the filename matching a folder name. She first wanted to create all the folders based on the filenames. For example, a file called 12345_file.pdf was in the directory, which meant that she needed to create a folder called 12345.", "To do this, she wanted to implement a for loop to get the first digits of all the file names and put them in a list, then loop through that list to create all the folders. However, there were some cases where some of the first digits were duplicated. There could be another file called 12345_newfile.pdf, 12345_oldfile.pdf, and so on. This would lead to a list containing duplicate values, which would not work.", "To simultaneously avoid using for loop to create a list and remove all duplicates from the list, I wrote this for her:", "We already had a list of the file paths, so I explained to her that you could use a list comprehension to create a list. You could define the components of the list and any conditions for it using a list comprehension instead of making an empty list and looping through and appending new elements to it. In this example, I would take the first 5 characters of each element in the existing list of file paths. Then, to remove all duplicates from the list, I just converted the list into a set, because a set in Python cannot have duplicate values.", "Going through that process felt great because:", "Sidenote: I know there are many other ways to accomplish the above process- she ended up using shutil to move everything into folders by checking if each file keyword was present in the list of folder names. If you've got another solution you'd like to share, please do. I'll send them to her and you can say you helped some random person on the internet with your code.", "I\u2019m not saying that if you can build something and teach something to someone else that you\u2019re an amazing programmer. In fact, sometimes by building and teaching I realize (yet again) that I still have so much to learn. I will likely never run out of new things to learn, but by helping others, I know one thing for sure: if someone else benefits from something I did for them, I don\u2019t completely suck!", "If you do find yourself stuck in a rut, read this encouraging excerpt from a very wise friend:", "\u201c\u2026 [programming] it\u2019s like math man. You can spend your whole life learning math and you can always learn more\u2026 Everyone has a certain affinity for it but it\u2019s mostly practice anyways\u2026 It\u2019s never too late to learn.\u201d", "I hope I\u2019ve made it clear that you most likely don\u2019t completely suck at programming. You may not be a prodigy, an expert, or even just competent yet, but keep practicing and helping others, and you\u2019ll be well on your way.", "Medium has become a place to store my \u201chow to do tech stuff\u201d type guides.
