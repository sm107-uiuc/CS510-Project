Your team wanted to propose new business strategies. But the team cannot decide on the right factors to replicate the process.", "Story 3: Correlation is not causation", "Your team identified a strong correlation between two factors and proposed a business change plan. Your team got the buy-in of the clients to implement the business proposal in a promising pilot test. After the testing period, you got no claimed outcome.", "If so, you may have committed the fallacy of using correlation to prove causation. In my post \u201cMachine Learning or Econometrics?\u201d I shared that many analytic questions are about causality. These causal questions require the designs of data generation and cannot be derived from big data. Today the divergence of machine learning and statistical experiments seems converging into the big data science umbrella. However, the two distinct disciplines can and should cross-pollinate to solve numerous business initiatives.", "The use of Design of Experiments (DoE) is the right way to do it. The design of experiments has been practiced in manufacturing, clinical trials, and hospital services for decades. In this post, I will walk you through the steps to set up a successful DoE that leads to your change management. I will use a service operation in banking to present the DoE thinking.", "What is Design of Experiments (DoE)?", "Design of experiments is the appropriate planning, conducting, analyzing, and interpreting controlled tests to evaluate the factors that influence the outcome.", "What Are the Benefits of DoE?", "The design of experiments can truly identify the cause-and-effect insights. The results let you propose actionable strategies for your change management. DoE is less costly. It uses statistics to design the minimum sample size for an effective test outcome. You can deal with multiple input factors at the same time, and identify important interactions that may be missed.", "The DoE has its proven procedure in the following seven steps. First, what\u2019s the goal? You shall determine the measurement for the objectives. Second, what to test? You will identify the factors for the test. Third, how to conduct? you will determine the way to conduct and measure. Fourth, how to measure? You will choose the right statistical analysis. Fifth, will the results be credible? You will determine the required sample size. Sixth, how to analyze the data? Apply the statistical analysis. Seventh, what\u2019s next? With the help of statistical analysis, you then make the conclusions and actionable items.", "Case Study: The DoE for a Service Operation in Banking", "Below is a successful case that the DoE has guided change management.", "A retail bank needed to reinvent its account application process. Although many customers are comfortable with online application, some customers still want the walk-in application at a retail bank. However, the bank has experienced a high percentage of incomplete applications, which required re-processing for the applications. The re-processing work also slowed down other operations and resulted in overall inefficiency. The bank needed to implement the right change of actions to eliminate the waste in re-processing. Let\u2019s see how to solve the problem.", "Step 1: Determine the Measures for the Objectives", "A quantifiable objective is always the starting point. The project team decided that the percentage of completed applications is the target. The team ruled out other interesting but less irrelevant measures such as the average deposit amount.", "Step 2: Determine the Factors for the Test", "The project team suspected four factors that might affect whether an application was complete. And the team designed two levels for each of the four factors:", "The experiment was conducted in the two branches for two months. The self-administered application forms continued to be displayed at the front desks so there was no change to the way they were displayed. Each location only had one type of application form. The varying combinations of the factors are listed in Table (A).", "Step 4: Choose the Right Statistical Analysis", "The project team needed to understand the impacts of all the possible combinations of the levels of the factors. Exhibit (A) is called the full factorial design. Such an experiment allows the investigator to study the effect of each factor on the target variable, as well as the effects of interactions between factors on the target variable.", "Step 5: Determine the Required Sample Size", "How to determine the minimum sample size for a factorial analysis? This is a tricky question because it not only depends on the number of factors, but also the \u201cloading\u201d, or the coefficient, of each factor. As explained by \u201cExploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis\u201d (Bruce Thompson, 2004), if there are more than four levels in a factor, and the coefficient of each level is less than 0.60, then N = 60 will be adequate. If there are more than ten levels in a factor and the coefficient of each level is around 0.40, then the sample size should be at least 150. Any sample size over 300 is considered adequate. The project team decided to collect at least 300 applications in each combination of the factors.", "Step 6: Conduct the Statistical Analysis", "The goal of the project was to determine which factor combination showed the highest average with statistical significance. The \u201cstatistical significance\u201d was the key, meaning the difference was significant enough to guarantee replicability next time. The team used the technique called the ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) that compared the \u201cAvg. % Completion\u201d to verify if the difference were statistically significant.", "Exhibit (B) show the differences for each of the five factors. Only the difference in \u201cDescription\u201d and that in \u201cExample\u201d is statistically significant with a 95% level of confidence. This means a high level of description and an example in the application form will result in a high rate of completion.", "One factor can affect another factor. This is captured by the interactions between factors. The result in the graph below shows if the application form has an example in the Northeast region (red line), the avg. % of completion is higher.", "Step 7: Conclusions and Actionable Strategies", "Based on these results, the project team concluded several actionable strategies:", "The new application forms increased the completion rate from 60% to more than 95%. The change greatly shortened the application time and eliminated the reprocessing time.", "It is worth noting here that in the \u201cidentify causality\u201d series of articles I cover econometric techniques designed to identify causality. These articles cover Regression Discontinuity, Difference in differences, Panel data analysis, and Randomized Controlled Trials with Factorial Design:", "You can also bookmark \u201cDataman Learning Paths \u2014 Build Your Skills, Drive Your Career\u201d to find more.", "Your home for data science.
