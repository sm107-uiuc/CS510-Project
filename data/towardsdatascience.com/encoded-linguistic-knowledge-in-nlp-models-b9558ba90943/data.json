Linguistic features (like part-of-speech, co-reference, etc) have played a key role in the classical NLP. Hence, it is important to understand how modern NLP models are arriving at decisions by \u201cprobing\u201d into what all they learn. Do these models learn linguistic features from unlabelled data automatically? How can we interpret the capabilities of modern NLP models? Lets probe.", "Linguistic knowledge is an essential aspect of natural language processing. We can think of it in the following dimensions,", "In statistical methods and classical machine learning, solving any problem related to natural language processing involves deriving linguistic knowledge described above. Thus, the research community gave attention to numerous tasks related to linguistic knowledge. We can see a few examples as below:", "Above are a few examples of important tasks related to linguistic knowledge, where part-of-speech mainly deals with syntactic knowledge, dependency trees, and co-references are important to further understand semantics, and lemmatization is an example of morphology.", "Numerous other tasks further analyze the linguistic properties of a sentence, like semantic roles, semantic proto-roles, relation classification (lexical and semantic), subject noun, main auxiliary verb, subject-verb agreement, etc.", "Modern NLP models are either LSTM based or transformer based. ELMO and ULMFIT are examples of LSTM architecture based language models. In contrast, BERT [1] and GPT are examples of transformers architecture based language models. For the rest of the study, let\u2019s take an example of \u201cBERT\u201d as a reference.", "Representations produced by the pre-trained BERT models encode relevant information, which enables task-specific fine-tuning with very limited labeled data. The question is,", "As a result, a flurry of research sought to understand what kind of linguistic information is captured in neural networks. The most common theme across different approaches can be grouped as \u201cprobes\u201d (or probing classifiers, diagnostic classifiers, auxiliary prediction tasks), which probes how internal mechanisms of neural networks can classify (or perform on) auxiliary linguistic tasks (or probe tasks, or ancillary tasks).", "These probing classifiers can be categorized based on what neural network mechanisms they are leveraging to probe for the linguistic knowledge. These are mainly", "Quite a few techniques are probing how much linguistic knowledge is encoded in internal representation at different layers of models like BERT. Let\u2019s take a look at a couple of examples.", "(A.1) Edge Probing: A framework introduced by Tenney et al.

For cases like determinant (det), direct object (dobj), possessive word (poss), passive auxiliary (auxpass), etc performance gain was huge (~100%) compared to the baseline model (predicting a token at the best fixed offset).", "Now that we got introduced to representation based probes and attention weights based probes to discover the encoded linguistic knowledge using auxiliary tasks, it would be interesting to ask deeper questions:", "Lets elaborate further on the above questions in the next article \u201cAnalysing Encoded Linguistic Capabilities of NLP Models & Beyond\u201d.
