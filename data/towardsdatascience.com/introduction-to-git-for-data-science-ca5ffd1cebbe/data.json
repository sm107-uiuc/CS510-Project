Most of us did something similar to this at some point in our life. This is a simple example of (manual) version control.", "Using version control systems, we could make this process more elegant. In fact, version control systems provide more functionality than manual versioning. They help us to organise, backup and document our work flow better, and collaborate efficiently with others. As Data Scientists, we should definitely use version control system. In this post, we will learn the basics of Git, a free widely-used open-source version control system.", "If you want to follow along with the code in this post (which I encourage so), ensure your computer has Git version 2.23.0 or higher installed.

This example is here to illustrate how to set up/update user name and email address. I would recommend to use your full name and professional email address. Git will use this name and email address as author details when you make a commit.

In order to make a commit, we first need to stage the files we edited, created or deleted. This is because when we commit, Git only stores the changes made to the files in the staging area as part of that particular commit. Next, you can think of repository as a storage for all your commits. All the information regarding commits is saved in a .git subdirectory, which is a local repository. Because Git stores information about commits, we can check out any commits in the past. It\u2019s almost like it gives us an ability to travel back in time and inspect the state of the project in the past.", "Staging and committing are central to Git workflow. To illustrate the idea of staging and committing, let\u2019s use online shopping as an analogy. When shopping online, you usually add items in your shopping cart. Once you feel ready to place an order, you first view your cart and assess it, you may want remove certain items or add more items to your cart. After making changes and when you feel satisfied with what\u2019s in your cart, you place an order. We can imagine staging area is like a shopping cart and commit is like an order. Staging is like adding an item to your shopping cart whereas making a commit is like placing an order.", "Hopefully, you now have an understanding about how Git works to some degree. In the next section, we will learn how to do basic Git operations on your computer.", "In this section, commands are accompanied by a brief description when it\u2019s shown for first time in the following format:", "I encourage you to follow along on your computer as you read through to get hands-on experience. Whenever you are not sure what a command does, try searching it in explainshell.com, it will explain what the command does.", "As the name suggests, we will create a new folder and initialise a repository in the folder:", "After initialising a local repository, we can now see that there is a hidden .git subdirectory in the terminal (or Git Bash if you are on Windows). Notice how it\u2019s not visible in Finder? If you are using Windows, you may or may not see the .git subdirectory in File Explorer depending on your setup.", "Since we now have a repository, we will add a file and make our first commit:", "You may have noticed how we are frequently checking status. This is to understand and monitor what is happening. My tip is to use git status (my most used Git command) regularly especially when you are learning Git.", "In the second last line, we also gave a short description to the commit: \u2018Add README.md\u2019 . This is referred to as commit messages (technically, it\u2019s the subject line of the message but in this post, message is used to refer to what\u2019s inside the quotation mark). It\u2019s important to keep your commit messages clean and informative. If you need some guidelines, here\u2019re some style tips I picked up over time on how to write a good commit messages:\u25fc\ufe0f Start with a capital letter\u25fc\ufe0f Don\u2019t put period at the end\u25fc\ufe0f Keep the message within 50 characters\u25fc\ufe0f Use imperative form to describe what the commit will do\u25fc\ufe0f Keep the message concise, descriptive and professional", "Here\u2019re some example commit messages that follow this style guide: \u2705 Update model hyperparameters\u2705 Add deep-dive analysis for target", "Additional resources for commit message:\ud83d\udd17 Udacity commit style guide\ud83d\udd17 How to Write a Git Commit Message", "Your project directory may contain certain files or folders that you don\u2019t necessarily want to track in the repository. .gitignore helps to ignore/not track certain files or folders in the directory. All you have to do is to specify either literal file names: example.pdf or patterns: *.pdf of the files or folders that you want to ignore in a .gitignore file.", "Most of the time, it\u2019s very useful to inspect all the changes before you stage. This way you can avoid committing unintended changes and be 100% sure that the actual changes align with your intent.", "Let\u2019s now learn how to ignore files and inspect unstaged changes:", "In this example, we have included *.pdf in our .gitignore file. As a result, Git will not track any pdf file. After adding *.pdf in .gitignore, example.pdf no longer appears as untracked file when checking status.", "Additional resources: \ud83d\udd17gitignore.io for creating a useful .gitignore file\ud83d\udd17 How to Use a .gitignore File", "Using git diff, we can see details on unstaged changes we made. This means you can use this command for inspecting modifications in your working directory before you stage them. If you run it by itself, it will show the details of unstaged changes for all modified files. We can also put multiple file names behind the command too: git diff README.md .gitignore. You may have noticed when we ran git diff .gitignore, it didn't return anything. That\u2019s because it\u2019s a new file and we have nothing to compare against.", "Jupyter Notebooks are popular among Data Scientists. Jupyter Notebooks are stored in JSON format. This makes it hard to see differences between Jupyter Notebooks using git diff. nbdime is a useful tool that makes differences more friendly and human-readible.", "Additional resources: \ud83d\udd17Friendly guide on Git diff\ud83d\udd17Useful tool for diffing Jupyter Notebooks: nbdime", "In the example above, we created two separate commits instead of one. This is because I want to point out that you don\u2019t always have to commit all the changes in one go. In other words, you shouldn\u2019t just dump all the changes into one commit. Instead, you should evaluate the changes and plan each commit to be for one logical set of changes (it\u2019s up to you to define what that is). Earlier this year, I did a Git course from Udacity. I would give this free course a 10/10, the content and delivery of content was amazing. I highly recommend it to anyone learning Git. From the course, I learned that if your commit message contains the word \u2018and\u2019, it\u2019s a sign you should split your commit into multiple commits. So that\u2019s one tip to remember when sizing your commit.", "Now let\u2019s learn how to browse commit history and view the files as of specific commits.", "Using git log, we can see the history of commits for the repository. Each commit is followed by its hash (think of it as an id for a commit), author details (remember how you had to set it up in section 1) and datetime of its creation. Adding --oneline, we get more succinct summary for commits.", "With git checkout <commit_hash>, we can check out our project directory as of specific commits. In other words, we can travel back in time and inspect versions of your files in the past. Of note, when passing on a commit hash, you don\u2019t have to reference the entire 40-character hash. Git is smart enough to figure out the commit if you provide the first few characters of the hash, as long as that partial hash is at least four characters long and unambiguous. I usually use first 6 characters to reference commits, that has worked fine so far.", "Additional resources: \ud83d\udd17 Git Checkout Explained by freeCodeCamp", "While learning Git, you may sometimes face a situation where you want to undo what you previously did. We will learn a few useful commands to undo:", "Let\u2019s say you have built a decent model and you have committed your code. But a new idea came to your mind and you really want to try it before deployment. git restore gives you peace of mind in trying this new change. If your idea didn\u2019t work out and you want to just restore to how it was as of last commit and undo all unstaged changes, git restore will save you.", "In the example above, we have used git reset in two different ways. First, we used it to unstage incomplete.py. Second, using git reset HEAD^ , we wiped out the last wrong commit as if it never existed.", "If for some reason, you need to delete a repository, you can do so like below:", "As we can see, we no longer have a repository after runningrm -rf .git.", "Well done for making it this far. Let\u2019s visualise some of the commands we have visited in this post:", "Learning Git for the first time can be challenging, so if you are still a little bit confused about Git, don\u2019t worry, you just need more exposure and practice. I encourage you to practice what we just did and try to apply your knowledge to your real projects.", "We only touched on the very basics of Git in this post. As you learn more about Git, you will find out that the commands we visited have more uses with small tweaks and there are multiple ways to accomplish the same thing.
