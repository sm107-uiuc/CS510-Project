Although they may not be as apparent as financial statements or research reports, Social Media presents a goldmine of alternate data VCs could leverage on in the form of Social Capital.", "SNA is the process of investigating social structures through the use of networks and graph theory. It emerged as a key technique in modern sociology and our goal is to apply this on web data to identify social capital in different actors in the market: investors, start-ups, news agencies, ecosystem partners and government agencies. We aim to use SNA to identify key players in the market, strategise portfolios to manage risks, source new opportunities, and map out online relationships to preempt any necessary defensive or offensive actions.", "Our objective is to build Knowledge Graphs with Twitter data. To prevent a cold-start problem, we did a preliminary manual search and gathered 79 corporate accounts from the bigger startups, VCs, government statutory boards and news sites in Singapore. They had a total of ~1m Followers, ~50k Following and ~400k tweets collectively.", "We maintained separate dictionaries to contain 4 different types of relationships between users with the following Key : Value pairs:", "We then expanded our dataset by recursively scraping users from the lists of following and mentions. We could potentially have a lot of noise and spam accounts so we filtered them based on the activity of their accounts. The dictionaries will then be used to build the graphs.", "Nodes represent users and Edges represent their 2-way relationship via following, mentions, keywords or hashtags. For the Hashtag and Keyword Graph, an edge is formed between 2 nodes when they have a common keyword/hashtag. The size of the graphs is limited by the amount of scraping done.", "The social network is sparse and could imply that the entire online social community related to VCs in SG is disconnected. The different actors could have very diverse interests and possibly be in different industries. For the small 79-sized graph, the articulation points are @BluzelleHQ, @SocietyOn & @FintechSIN in the Follow graph and @PayPal & @SGInnovate in the Mention graph. These could be key accounts who could connect the different communities together.", "We used an Unsupervised Learning algorithm to find patterns in the input graph data without any labels.", "@JimMarous is a Speaker & Publisher in Fintech, @drspangenberg a law professor, @enricomolinari an Innovation manager, @wef the official account for the World Economic Forum. Although possibly wildly imaginative, a relationship could have been formed during an event at the World Economic Forum, a new project might be in the works or they might simply have the same interest in some topics. This could be used by the VC to explore a potential strategic partnership or even an investment.", "Bridges are important relationships in the graph that hold several communities together. In the Mention graph, a bridge between @SlackHQ and @vertexventures was found. This is interesting because Vertex Ventures does not seem to have invested in Slack according to their portfolio, but they might have a particular interest in the company.", "Dijkstra\u2019s algorithm is used to find the shortest path between 2 accounts in the Mentions graph.", "@500Startups might be interested in the startup @BluzelleHQ and would want to know the best way it can reach them. While they could cold-contact or find a lead, it might be more efficient to contact the common person between them. This happens to be @Alka_Gupta, a board member & advisor at Wharton and eBay.", "Another interesting example is the path between @monkshillvc to @DigixGlobal, a smart asset company. @SGX and @NASDAQ are both in the securities exchange business and there is a possibility of a collaboration across the path with monkshillvc as the investor.", "Aside from the obvious and popular names, there are several interesting accounts to note.", "@intelcapital\u2018s bio: \u201cHelping build great companies \u2014 through the power of partnership\u201d.

This seems to be aligned to their bio \u201cVertex Ventures is a global network of operator-investors who manage portfolios in the U.S., China, Israel, India and Southeast Asia\u201d.", "@salesforce is an interesting discovery because they have been mentioned a lot in the network directly or at least through another party which could usually be an employee in the organization. This highlights the potential demand for the CRM software among the network and could be an opportunity for VCs to collaborate with such vendors to reduce costs among their entire portfolio of companies.", "@nihsingapore and @ICE71_ are both community platforms / ecosystems based in SG. This makes sense because they are frequently \u201cbetween\u201d startups and investors as a broker of relationships.", "@ImpactTap is highly influential but it is not well-connected to other influential accounts. This could be an opportunity for a VC or startup to collaborate with this News Source organization.", "@OriginateLabs is a digital product company from Berlin and @SynergisCAD, is an engineering innovation company from the US, that are both influential but connected to only @FintechSIN among the \u201crich club\u201d. They could possibly be interested in the SG market.", "@KaporCapital is a California-based VC which is linked to @jpaine from GoldenGateVC, their collective influence could present a more compelling reason for cross-border co-investment opportunities.", "We trained binary classification models to predict whether an edge will be formed between 2 nodes based on features of the graph. The graph is represented by features obtained from an embedding layer via node2vec, a semi-supervised algorithm which maximises the likelihood of preserving network neighbourhoods of nodes in a d-dimensional feature space. Edges from the graph will be removed to form the training data for the models. The edges removed would then be the ground truth to validate the predictions.", "Interesting Link Predictions in the Follow graph", "(@tekjau, @jpaine) \u2014 AVP of Technology at Razer Fintech Malaysia could possibly be associated with GoldenGate\u2019s founding partner.", "(@peignoir, @500Startups) \u2014 Co-Founder of Startup Weekend (one of the largest entrepreneurial events) and VC 500Startups might possibly have an association and even collaborate on an event in the future.", "(@TerenceLeungSF, @Reuters)- TerenceLeungSF works at a startup, One Network Enterprises, and this predicted relationship could signify a potential interest from the VC arm of Reuters.", "Interesting Link Predictions in the Hashtag graph", "There are several VCs: @singtelInnov8, @GobiPartners, @500Startups potentially forming relationships with startups: @Snapcart_sg, @Haulio_io, @ViSenze, @DathenaScience.", "Social Capital in the form of web data has the potential to disrupt the VC ecosystem.
