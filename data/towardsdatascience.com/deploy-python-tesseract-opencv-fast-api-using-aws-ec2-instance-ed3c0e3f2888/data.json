And unless deployed, our model is as good as a simple demo. To scale or to even put into production, it needs to deployed as an API or embedded into the existing systems. In this article we will learn how to create a simple OCR algorithm and deploy it realtime on AWS EC2 instance.", "Besides the obvious Avengers\u2019 reference, Tesseract is an optical character recognition engine for various operating systems. It is a free software, released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, and development has been sponsored by Google since 2006. In 2006, Tesseract was considered one of the most accurate open-source OCR engines then available.", "Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2\u2019s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction.", "In this blog we will be concentrating more on how to deploy the python + tesseract + openCV model on AWS EC2 instance than on actual accuracy. Different steps. 1. How to configure an AWS account  2. Security Groups 3. SSH into the EC2 instance 4. Install different dependencies  5. Copy the Python Code to EC2 6. Run the application on server", "Creating a new account on AWS is quite easy.  \u2192 Go to \u201chttps://signin.aws.amazon.com/\u201d \u2192 \u201cCreate a new AWS account\u201d \u2192 Enter the necessary information like first name, email address, password and you are done.", "You get 12 Months of Free Tier Access to AWS Accounts including EC2 instance, Lambda, S3 buckets and Sagemaker.

(We will be needing it shortly)", "Voila! You have created your first EC2 instance. Congratulations!", "Only port 22 is open for both inbound and outbound traffic. That is the reason we are able to SSH into the EC2 instance. (More on that in a while).

There are a couple of things that will be needed from this screen. 1. Instance State \u2014 tells us whether instance is running or not. (When you are not working on anything, remember to stop it, otherwise it will keep consuming hours in free tier) 2. Public DNS IPv4 3. IPv4 Public IP", "Next is SSH into the EC2 instance. But first \u2014 what is SSH?", "The SSH protocol (also referred as Secure Shell) is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another. It provides several alternative options for strong authentication, and it protects the communications security and integrity with strong encryption.
