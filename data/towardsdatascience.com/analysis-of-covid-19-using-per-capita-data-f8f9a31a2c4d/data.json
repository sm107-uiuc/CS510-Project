China\u2019s population is more than 20 times the population of France.", "If we want to compare different countries\u2019 actions, we need to take into account the disease spread by the number of cases per million inhabitants. This fact may seem to be obvious, but, it is almost never applied by the media or by official organizations.", "Moreover, since more than 80% of the deceased are above the age of 65, we need to go even further and check the number of cases/deaths per million inhabitants over the age of 65. This is true when comparing different countries, or between different neighborhoods in a single city.", "It is important to note that the are other problems that difficult a thorough understanding of the COVID-19 spread.

Here we can see that at the local level there is great variability of the affected areas. If the death rate in the neighborhoods is correlated to other factors such as access to health facilities, population density, and income level, we could gain a better understanding of why the disease is spreading and how to contain it.", "Unfortunately, the detailed data this chart is based upon is not public.
