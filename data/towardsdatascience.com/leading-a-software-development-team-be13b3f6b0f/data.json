The role of a Technical Lead does not stop at designing and writing code and being the guardian of software quality; it also involves directing and representing the technical team and requires adopting a new set of non technical skills. Throughout my career I have found that the principles outlined below provide a strong foundation for becoming an effective leader \u2014 one who consistently achieves great results!", "So in this article, we will dig deeper into this question:", "What makes a great Technical Lead?", "A newly appointed Tech Lead (TL) can rapidly fall for a number of traps, often caused by habits created from their time as developers. To overcome these pitfalls, they must find ways to strike a balance between their technical and leadership responsibilities.", "Let\u2019s explore some of these mistakes:", "As a Developer you probably spent at least 80% of your time writing code. At the end of each day you could look back and see progress: whether it is code, design specs, peer reviews, or fixing bugs, you could say: This is what I did today.", "But being in a leadership role quantifying your daily achievements becomes very difficult, as you are measured by how productive and effective your team is. To be precise, the difficulty emerges from within; albeit others can clearly see your accomplishments, it is your inner voice that keeps thinking: What on earth have I done today? After numerous meetings, planning sessions, grooming the backlog, status reports, technical discussions, and all sorts of interruptions, you reach the end of the day with a feeling of under-delivery.", "This is certainly not true. As a TL you should use measures that focus on the team\u2019s outcomes, not your personal output.", "When I first assumed my TL role, the most obvious mistake I made was to continue to code just as much as before. After being coding non-stop for a few years, my natural tendency was to operate in the same manner, not realising that although I was maximising my productivity as an individual contributor, I was doing so at the expense of my team\u2019s productivity (sorry chaps). It is very tricky to stop seeing yourself as a producer when you believe your technical ability is the reason for becoming a TL in the first place.", "Another mistake new TLs often make is to no longer do enough coding. When you are not hands-on, you will gradually become less able to design the right architecture, evaluate the solutions suggested by your team or help debug that pesky multi-threading bug that keeps creeping up in Production. Running the risk of invoking the \u201cIvory Tower Lead\u201d anti-pattern, i.e. leading technical decisions without understanding their real implications, can have terrible consequences for the team, who will eventually lose faith in you as a leader.", "In my experience, there is no right answer to this problem. The sweet spot lies somewhere between 30%-40% of the time to be devoted to coding, leaving the rest for the remaining of the responsibilities.", "Another aspect of the role that new TLs find challenging is how to adjust their \u2018focus level\u2019. As a Developer you used to be laser-focused on one task at a time. Obviously some awareness of how your feature/module/service fits with the entire system was important, you were able to lose yourself in the implementation details. But as a TL this changes: you need to have a bird\u2019s eye view of the software ecosystem and a broader understanding of the code design.", "Think of a zoom lens on a camera: It allows the operator to pull back and see the big picture, but also allows them to zoom in on the detail. Similarly, an effective TL can move from the big picture to nitty-gritty details, switching perspective, and context constantly.", "Newly minted TLs have the urge to actively manage their team as they believe the fallacy that leadership involves making all the decisions, no matter how big or small. They become gatekeepers: they review all the code changes before being released, they are the only people that can access critical services, they handle all the task management and estimation, they have conversations with the Business on behalf of the team, and the list goes on. Each of these situations can result in the team feeling disempowered and has a bad impact on their morale, motivation, and performance.", "The line between a competent leader and a micromanager can be thin and although the line can seem hazy for you, chances are your team can easily recognise it. Do let go! Trust your team, try not to dictate everything, get your daily updates in the morning Scrum, and do not be a suffocating boss!", "In Greek mythology Atlas was the God who was tasked to hold the Earth apart from the sky. On a much smaller scale, as a TL you may try to take this role and single-handedly complete all the key work. Obviously, there are some tasks that your experience and knowledge are required, but you do not want to be a bottleneck in solving problems, so you need to find a way to delegate and still be involved.", "Delegating is only possible when a leader believes someone has the sufficient skill and motivation to complete a task, and it does not only encourage creativity in problem-solving but is also an opportunity to empower the team and see them grow. A team that is never asked to own their work, switch contexts, or solve something outside of their comfort zone will never move forward.", "Trying to serve the role of Atlas, in the long run, is a load that is not worth bearing. It is much better to share it with the team.", "Although solid technical know-how is crucial for TLs, the most important skills an effective leader brings to the table are social ones. But here is the bad news:", "There is not an obvious \u2018Hello World\u2019 for non-technical competencies!", "These skills are developed over time in your leadership journey. Your ultimate goal should not be to be good at your new role, but be brilliant! Achieving excellence is all about having a sense of accomplishment for a job well done \u2014 which is the thrust of this article!", "As Aristotle said: \u201cWe are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit\u201d.", "Let\u2019s see what it takes to be an excellent TL!", "Servant leadership turns the traditional hierarchical approach to leadership upside down. It takes an altruistic approach to leading by focusing on the support and growth of others.", "Keeping a serve-first mindset means you are focused on empowering and uplifting those who work for you. You are serving instead of commanding, showing humility instead of exhibiting authority, listening to understand rather than to determine your response, and always looking to enhance the development of your team members in a way that unlocks potential and boosts performance.", "It is impossible to serve when you think you are better than your team members \u2014 there should never be a job too small for you! Servant Leadership is not about having people under you; it is about carrying people with you, to build something better than you could ever build on your own! And that is a great feeling by itself!", "Whenever there is success, people want credit (sometimes they even want credit for things they did not do). If you want to be exceptional, give away the credit for any success stories with your team, as it pays back tenfold: praise, not only gives the team a greater sense of ownership, but also a greater sense of accountability for the success (and later, maybe failure) of their work!", "In failure, when most people start pointing fingers, that is the time to take responsibility! Even if you may not believe that it is your actual fault, you must own everything that your team produces. If they feel that you will push the blame on them, they will resent your leadership. Give them feedback on their shortcomings, but always cover for your team to the senior management.", "Strong team culture is the foundation for accomplishing your mission.", "You should strive to create an atmosphere of trust, i.e. build an environment where risks are taken, where those around you feel safe and motivated to exercise their creativity, communicate ideas and provide input to major decisions without hesitation. Granting trust is a strong signal that motivates returning the favour.", "Trust and humility go hand in hand. Not sure who coined this quote: \u201cWhen I talk to managers, I get the feeling that they are important. When I talk to leaders, I get the feeling that I am important\u201d, but it is the perfect example of what it means to lead with humility. Each person in your team should walk away after talking to you feeling empowered, valued, and appreciated.", "When the good leader\u2019s work is done, his aims fulfilled, the people will all say, \u201cWe did this ourselves.\u201d \u2014 Lao Tzu", "An equally important aspect to reinforce the team ethos is to ask them \u201cHow am I doing?\u201d \u2014 it takes humility to ask such a question and even more humility to consider the answer!", "Keeping my team as a priority in my leadership style has greatly impacted my career path and my personal brand. I hope you recognise the significance of being team-oriented early in your career!", "Your leadership philosophy should be defined by the experiences you had earlier in your career as a Developer. I remember my younger self feeling uncomfortable speaking up in meetings. Now I make sure everyone\u2019s voice is heard by asking those who are quiet if they have anything to add. Addressing some of the problems you had as a Developer, both technical and social, is a good starting point. Your team will love you!", "Likewise, I have worked for frustrating TLs as well as absolute heroes. I tried to avoid being the TL I really disliked and note the strong characteristics of those who I admired incorporating them into my management style.", "Seek to replace yourself, unless you want to keep doing the very same job for the rest of your career! You need to give your team opportunities to shine by taking on more responsibilities and occasionally let them lead the team. After mentoring them and helping them find their strengths and weaknesses, ask them to step into your role while you are on holiday. You can then assess where they might need additional training and development. Gradually delegate more to them, until it is time for you to try pastures new!", "Thinking of your succession plan means that you need to develop those around you. When they know that the next role awaits, they receive a boost to self-esteem and self-respect, which enhances their efficacy and value as team members. It is a win-win situation!", "Here are a couple of resources that have influenced me the most in my former role as a TL.", "Technical Leads combine unparalleled technical expertise with social skills. If you made it this far you probably care enough about doing well in the role of TL and you have a natural aptitude for being one.", "Becoming the best is about continually improving who you are and keep evolving\u2026 This is your journey. Take it!", "I regularly write about Leadership, Technology & Data on Medium \u2014 if you would like to read my future posts then please \u2018Follow\u2019 me!", "Your home for data science.
