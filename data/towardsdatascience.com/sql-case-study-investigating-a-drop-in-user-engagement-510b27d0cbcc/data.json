Individuals share documents, updates, and ideas by posting them in groups. Yammer is free to use indefinitely, but companies must pay license fees if they want access to administrative controls, including integration with user management systems like ActiveDirectory.", "Yammer noticed a drop in Weekly Active Users, \u201cthe number of users who logged at least one engagement event during the week starting on that date\u201d. Engagement is defined as having made some type of server call by interacting with the product (shown in the data as events of type \u201cengagement\u201d.", "My goal is to determine the cause of the dip in the image below.", "Potential causes of a dip in engagement include the following:", "Each row represents one user, with information associated with each user.", "Each row represents an event, which is an action that a user has taken on Yammer. These events include login events, messaging events, search events, events logged as users progress through a signup funnel, and events around received emails.", "This table contains data on events related to sent emails. It is similar in structure to the events table above.", "The final table is a lookup table that is used to create rolling time periods.", "The first thing I wanted to see was what events are categorized as \u2018engagement\u2019.", "The events categorized as \u2018engagement\u2019 are as follows:", "Using the query above, we can deduce that the difference in engagements between July and August is 18,037.", "The next thing I wanted to do was count the number of occurrences of each \u2018engagement\u2019 event month over month, to see if there\u2019s any significant event(s) that caused the dip after July 28.", "The dip in engagement was largely attributed to home_page, like_message_ view_inbox, send_message, and login. It seems like the drop in all of these events are simply related to the fact that users are logging in less.", "Next, I wanted to analyze the data on a user level to see if the drop was due to a drop in users or a drop in the number of engagements/user.", "Using the code above, I found the number of distinct active users on a monthly basis.", "We can see that the number of users declined from 3058 in July to 2795 in August, a drop of 8.6%. This is likely the cause of the decline in engagement events, specifically homepage, like_message, view_inbox, send_message, and login.", "I also looked to see if the engagement per user declined as well.", "The number of events per user fell from 30 to 26, representing a drop in engagement by 13%, which is also a fairly significant number.", "Therefore, we need to find out why there was a drop in active users and also a drop in engagement per user.", "I wanted to take an aggregated look at the email activity to see if there was a change in emails sent, click-through rates (CTRs), or something else that may have caused a reduction inactive users.", "Immediately, I noticed that there was a steady increase in the number of emails sent (weekly digest and re-engagement) and emails opened, but there was a decrease in clickthrough rates. From July to August, there was a 6.5% increase in emails open but a 27% decline in clickthrough rates.", "I wanted to take a deeper look into the clickthrough rates and see if the decline had anything to do with the devices. It could have had to do with the type of operating system (IOS vs Android) or mobile vs desktop.", "Using the query above, I noticed that the clickthrough rates on laptops and computers were stable from July to August, but not the tablets and cellphones.", "By categorizing the device names into \u2018mobile\u2019, \u2018tablet\u2019, and \u2018laptop\u2019, I could determine if this is truly the case.", "Indeed, it seems to be the case that the drop in clickthrough rates was attributed specifically to mobile devices and tablets.", "So far, I\u2019ve determined that the lack of engagement is due to a decrease in email clickthrough rates from July to August. To gather more information, I want to see if we can narrow the problem even further by email type.", "It\u2019s evident that the drop in clicks is due to the weekly digest email and not the re-engagement email.", "Through my analysis, I can conclude the following:", "The drop in engagement was mainly attributed to a drop in five engagement events (home_page, like_message_ view_inbox, send_message, and login).", "I then found that the decrease in events was caused by a reduction in total active users MoM, as well as a decrease in engagement per user.", "After I took an aggregated look at the emails table and I noticed that there was a significant decrease in click-through rates from July to August even though there was an increase in the number of emails opened.", "By segmenting the clickthrough rates by device type (mobile, tablet, laptop), I noticed that the drop in clickthrough rates was attributed to mobile and tablet devices.", "Lastly, the decline in click-through rates is attributed to the weekly digest email and not the re-engagement email.", "My recommendation is to immediately take a deeper look into the weekly digest emails specifically for mobile devices and tablets. It\u2019s possible that there\u2019s a technical problem, making it difficult for users to click the email or simply a UX problem, where the content and layout of the email are not enticing users to click. A good first step would be to see what changes have been made from July to August and working backward.", "Some other things that could\u2019ve been looked at include the following:", "Founder of ShinTwin | Let\u2019s connect on LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
