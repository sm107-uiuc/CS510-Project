Cloud Data Warehouse become the solution for these problems.", "In this article I will give you an overview of the most used cloud data warehouses nowadays, which are Amazon Redshift and Azure Data Warehouse.", "Amazon Redshift is a fast and scalable data warehouse, used by the largest companies in the world. It allows companies to build powerful applications and generate reports.", "Redshift is a collection of nodes organized into a group called cluster. Each cluster run on Amazon redshift engine and it contains one or more databases. The cluster has a leader node and one or more compute nodes.", "The mechanism is quite intuitive, the leader node receives queries from the client applications and it passes the queries and develops a suitable execution plan. After the setup of the plan, the compute nodes, divided into slices, start working on the plan by transmitting data among the nodes to solve the queries.", "So, once the execution is done, the leader node aggregates the results from the compute nodes and sends it back to the client application.", "Every time we launch a cluster we need to specify the nodes type that could be a Dense Storage nodes (DS) which uses a hard disk drive or a dense compute nodes that uses a solid-state drive.", "The decision of which type of nodes to use is based on the amount of data that we want to import into our Amazon Redshift, the complexity of the queries we want to run and the need of the downstream system that depends on our queries.", "For what concerns the advantages of Amazon Redshift compared to a traditional Data Warehouse, we can easily understand that with Redshift is possible to scale quickly by resizing the cluster size. So, you can scale up and increase the number of compute nodes or you can scale down and decrease the number of compute nodes. Alternatively, you can use a single node or multiple node option.", "A particular aspect of Amazon Redshift is the columnar data storage that permits storing data by column instead by row as happens with traditional Data Warehouse. Columnar storage permits a better data compression, the input/output operations decreases, and by storing all the records in one field together, the database can query and perform analysis on a similar type of data quicker.", "Another particular advantage of Amazon Redshift is the massively parallel processing, where the different processors compute together. In fact, as you remember, the cluster has a leader node and one or more compute nodes divided into slices. So, when the leader node receives a query, it develops the execution plan. The compute nodes and slices work together or in parallel to execute that plan. After that, the leader node sends the result back to the client application.", "Redshift is a very cost effective data warehouse because unlike a traditional Data Warehouse we have not to spend for hardware, real-estate, electricity and employee costs. That fact bring down drastically the costs for a company. It is also important to know that Amazon Redshift permits querying data from Data Lake that is a storage repository that can hold raw data in its native format.", "Last but not least, data in Redshift is secure and safe thanks to the option of backup and recovery. When we stored data in Amazon Redshift a copy of the data is made on S3. Redshift offers also the option to encrypt your data.", "Part II: Azure SQL Data Warehouse", "Azure SQL Data Warehouse is a massively parallel processing system that permits us to implement relational big data store. It is a platform as a service (PaaS) which means we don\u2019t have to worry about the underlying architecture including OS, storage, servers and so on.", "Azure SQL DWH is composed by the storage and by two types of nodes such as the control node and the multiple compute nodes.", "In Azure, data is stored in Blob storage, a service that stores unstructured data in the cloud as objects. Blob storage can store any kind of text data.", "The control node, as the leader node in Amazon Redshift, coordinates all the data movements that are required to run parallel queries. So when Azure SQL DWH receives a request, the control node transforms the request into separate queries that run in parallel on each compute nodes.", "We can define the compute nodes as databases that have the aim to store data and process the queries. After the processing, the results go back to the control node which aggregate the results and give to the user the final result.", "It is important to know that when compute nodes interact with data, nodes write and read directly from the blob storage.", "Thanks to the two examples of Amazon Redshift and Azure SQL DWH we can confirm that the best choice today for a company, regardless of its size, is to consider a Cloud Data Warehouse rather than a traditional Data Warehouse.", "In fact, the Cloud DWH is faster and gives hyper-elasticity, which allows companies to scale easily. In addition, it provides pay-as-you-go models or fixed asset purchased models.", "Cloud DWH eliminates for the customers the need to do software upgrades and hardware migration projects.", "Building a traditional Data Warehouse requires a solid budget for hardware, but with cloud it is not necessary to have a solid budget for hardware. In fact, we can start from a small architecture and growing over time as our data volume and number of users grows.", "I send out a periodical newsletter.

A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Data Analyst, Data lover & Dreamer. My aim is to make Data Science accessible to everyone.
