Following their lead, Twitter and Youtube have followed suit. Grown from the roots of white supremacy, what was once a theory has morphed into an aggressive movement seeking to wage information warfare as a means of influencing the upcoming American presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. The FBI has identified QAnon as a domestic terrorism threat, and earlier this year Twitter acted to ban thousands of QAnon-affiliated accounts. However, many pro-QAnon accounts continue to tweet, and more insidiously Trump has a proven history of amplifying these voices by irresponsibly retweeting their malicious content. He also refuses to publicly condemn the theory, side-stepping with comments about pedophilia, further spreading toxic uncertainty.", "I thought it would be interesting to investigate what these accounts were tweeting. Specifically, I was curious about the most popular topics discussed by the far-right and whether I could leverage recent developments in machine learning to analyze tweets from currently active, known QAnon accounts on Twitter. I decided to try zero-shot learning to classify tweets into topic categories of my choice: politics, public health, climate change, religion, controversy and fake news. For this experiment I used the Twitter API to gather tweets, and Hugging Face\u2019s out-of-the-box implementation of zero-shot learning for text classification (released August, 2020). As per an unsupervised learning approach, unlabeled tweets were classified into socially relevant topics, without any task-specific training or annotated tweets for fine-tuning. To make my zero-shot classifier accessible, I built a web app with the Python framework, Streamlit, for an interactive interface where I could drag and drop a large batch of unprocessed tweets stored as a csv or json file.", "In the field of machine learning, zero-shot learning is a type of unsupervised learning where the goal is to get a model to do a task that it has not been explicitly trained for, without relying on labeled data. In the past three years, the trend in natural language processing (NLP) has been to create extremely large pre-trained language models that allow for transfer learning from unsupervised models, which are then fine-tuned on downstream supervised tasks, necessitating labeled data. There is a low resource cost associated with sourcing raw unlabeled tweets from social media compared to the quality annotated data required for supervised learning. Therefore, in requiring fewer resources and no additional training time, zero-shot learning has a clear advantage. Furthermore, the implementation of zero-shot classification allows for versatility in choosing labels. Since the label choice is not bound to the labels the classifier was fine-tuned on, labels can be arbitrarily chosen depending on the specific task.", "Last month, I discovered that the Python library, Hugging Face transformers, released a pipeline model for zero-shot text classification. As usual, Hugging Face made this classifier accessible. It was easy to tinker with, and I was able to build a simple web app around it using Streamlit in a single afternoon. I was inspired by this excellent blog post written by Hugging Face research engineer, Joe Davison. He briefly explains the history of zero-shot learning and discusses in detail two approaches that are commonly used: the latent embedding approach and natural language inference (NLI). The Hugging Face pipeline model utilizes the latter approach.", "NLI refers to a NLP task whereby two sentences are considered: a premise and a hypothesis. The task is to determine the effect of the premise on the hypothesis. The result is a label for the hypothesis as determined by the premise, which can be true (entailment), false (contradiction) or irrelevant (neutral). For zero-shot classification, Hugging Face uses the method introduced in a paper by Yin et al. (2019). In this method, the premise will be a sequence that is to be labeled (text of a tweet) and the hypothesis will represent a candidate label (topic category). A sequence and all possible candidate labels are embedded in the same latent space so that the distance between embeddings can be measured. Additionally, this allows for the assessment of the compatibility of two distinct sequences. The topic label that is predicted for each tweet represents the hypothesis/candidate label with the highest possibility of entailment.", "Hugging Face\u2019s implementation involves a pre-trained BART model fine-tuned on the multi-genre natural language inference (MNLI) corpus to build a sequence-pair classifier that is then used as a zero-shot classifier. A BART model refers to a seq2seq machine translation architecture with a bidirectional encoder (like BERT) and a left-to-right decoder (like GPT-3). Pre-training randomly shuffles the order of the original sentences with a novel in-filling scheme, where spans of text are replaced by a single mask token. Thankfully, Hugging Face has made it possible to use their zero-shot classifier with just a few lines of code. The entire process can be simplified and visually depicted. My diagram below shows an outline of the process:", "For the sake of practicality and my hardware limitations, I had to pick a single day to analyze. Therefore I chose to look at all the tweets from October 2nd, the day Trump announced he tested positive for Covid-19. I collected roughly 5,300 tweets from a hand-picked sample of QAnon-linked Twitter accounts curated by the Shorenstein Center, Harvard University. I saved the tweets as a csv file that I was then able to drag and drop into a machine learning web app that I built with Streamlit. At the backend, I wrote a Python script to preprocess and apply a zero-shot classifier to the batch of tweets, classifying each tweet into one of six categories I had arbitrarily chosen. I was interested in the conversation about politics, public health, climate change, religion, controversy and fake news. On a later occasion I intend to perform further sentiment analysis on the categorized tweets, and compare across categories for a more nuanced understanding of the discourse.", "As shown in the diagram above, I needed three things for classification: a classifier, topic labels and a hypothesis template. As shown in the code snippet below, I built a zero-shot classifier with a single line using the pipeline from Hugging Face, a list of topic labels were assigned to a variable, and I added a line of leading text for a hypothesis template.", "The output had three components: a sequence of a single text entry, a set of six labels and a set of six corresponding scores between 0 to 1, representing a probability distribution of the likelihood of entailment. See the example below:", "In the sample output the tweet\u2019s topic was labeled as \u201cmisinformation\u201d, with the first and highest score of 0.59 representing the confidence that the tweet belongs to the misinformation category.", "Next I wrote a function to iterate over a pandas dataframe of tweets, to preprocess, classify and store the results in the same dataframe.", "To visualize the results I used my favourite Python graphing library - Plotly, to plot an interactive bar graph, showing the distribution of topics.", "Of the 5,300 tweets, around 5000 of them scored over 50% for a particular label and were thus classified. The remainder had scores that were too low across all labels, and would have likely been classified as \u201cother\u201d, signifying that my choice of labels was not fully inclusive. The most popular topic was controversy, followed by politics. The least popular topic was climate change, which was surprisingly followed by fake news and public health. Given that misinformation about the current pandemic should be a serious concern, I was surprised at the low amount of tweets classified as public health. I selected a few random tweets from the controversy category since it was the largest and I was concerned about classification accuracy.", "I think that controversy was too broad of a topic label, and I should have added specific conspiracy categories as topic labels, such as medical, government, media, or other conspiracies. The third sample tweet, in my opinion, since it is against vaccinations, would have been better classified as \u201cpublic health\u201d, or more accurately \u201cmedical misinformation\u201d. The last sample controversy tweet would have fit better into the topic of \u201chate\u201d, and it was an oversight on my part for not including the topic of \u201chate\u201d as a label in my initial experiment.", "Furthermore, a quick look at the tweets labeled \u201cpolitics\u201d cropped up the following tweet:", "The label score for this tweet is only 50.2% meaning that it barely classified as \u201cpolitics\u201d, and I feel that it would better fit the topic label of \u201cgovernment conspiracy\u201d. Therefore, for future tests I will amend the topic labels to be more specific about the type of controversy or conspiracy, as well as including, \u201chate\u201d as a topic.", "Hidden amongst the many controversial tweets, were subversive attempts to organize; statements that were vaguely threatening, as well as being inept attempts at obfuscation.", "Considering the prevalence of this type of tweet, another topic that might be wise to include would be \u201corganizing\u201d or perhaps \u201cdemagoguery\u201d.", "A preliminary look at the results leads me to believe that a majority of the tweets from QAnon-affiliated accounts are controversial, so \u201ccontroversy\u201d as a topic blurred the results. However, I believe that these results show evidence of a convergence of conspiracies, a term I became familiar with while watching the virtual open hearing by the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) on the topic of misinformation and conspiracies. During the hearing, Nina Jankowicz refers to,", "\u201cconspiracy convergence, when adherents of one theory are exposed to and encouraged to spread others.\u201d", "The original QAnon conspiracies have become entangled with many other fringe conspiracies, such as anti-vaxxers, flat-earthers, or holocaust deniers. The failure of social media platforms to protect users from misinformation, means that joining a Facebook group celebrating Vinyasa yoga, might expose you to harmful medical misinformation.", "At the center of this infodemic are the mob of QAnon influencers that disproportionately wield the power to negatively affect reality with dangerous and destructive consequences. A few months ago the WHO held their first ever infodemiology conference, a clear signal of the importance of treating misinformation as a danger to public health. On the WHO website it states:", "\u201cLike pathogens in epidemics, misinformation spreads further and faster and adds complexity to health emergency response.\u201d", "Despite the danger of misinformation, it is exceedingly likely that QAnon will continue to utilize social media for nefarious purposes such as undermining civil society, sowing harmful medical lies, and connecting all of this with an agenda of hate. Physicist Neil Johnson, in a paper published earlier this year, talks about the proliferation of racist views across anti-vaccine communities,", "\u201cThe rise of fear and misinformation around COVID-19 has allowed promoters of malicious matter and hate to engage with mainstream audiences around a common topic of interest, and potentially push them toward hateful views\u201d", "My experiment with zero-shot classification cropped up several anti-vaccination tweets, enough to convince me that I need a specific medical misinformation topic label, and perhaps an additional label for pandemic conspiracies.", "My attempt at topic labeling tweets using zero-shot classification had promising results. For now, it will be interesting to play around with other topic labels and curate other datasets for investigation. Since it is very simple to change the topic labels, my next set of tests will be to try other topic labels and to adjust the number of categories. In order to use my zero-shot classifier on a production scale while retaining interactivity, my current web app will require further work to speed up predictions with caching and integrate additional exploratory data analysis tools to be more useful.", "The most interesting concept I encountered while testing zero-shot classification, was the idea of tracking misinformation with the machine learning methods that epidemiologists use for tracking pathogenic transmissions. A fun idea for exploration!", "Hopefully, my experiment inspires you to try out zero-shot classification for a novel, unsupervised machine learning approach that is functional straight out-of-the-box. And I encourage you to think about the potential applications to socially-conscious, equity-informed research.", "Interested in collaborating?
