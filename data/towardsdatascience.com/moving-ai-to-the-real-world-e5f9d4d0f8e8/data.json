You\u2019d like to learn what happens downstream: How your model turns into a product.", "\u25cf You are a software architect. You are designing or expanding a platform to support data science use cases.", "I recently completed an online course that I think you should check out. It\u2019s called Full Stack Deep Learning. It covers the full lifecycle of an AI application, from ideation through deployment but it does not cover theory or model fitting. If you are an intermediate data scientist and want to \u201czoom out\u201d from your niche, this course will show you how the sausage is made, tracking it from one station to the next.", "The course started out as a pricy SF-based bootcamp in 2018 but is now available for free. It features some industry heavyweights, including Tesla\u2019s Andrej Karpahy and fast.ai\u2019s Jeremy Howard. I took it because I wanted to compare my own practices against what the celebrities do. By way of background, I am a partner at Genpact, a consulting company. I help clients transform their processes and sometimes their business using AI. In practice, this means I create a proof of concept (POC) to demonstrate potential value and then run the team that implements the solution to capture that value.", "\u201cFull Stack Deep Learning\u201d exceeded my expectations. It is organized into six content areas as well as hands-on labs and guest lectures from AI luminaries. Here is what I found most new and useful:", "This is an \u201cexecutive\u201d module that discusses planning, prioritizing, staffing and scheduling AI projects.", "I did not find much new here, but it is a good, concise executive overview. Since the course focuses on deep learning as opposed to traditional ML, it brings up three important points:", "\u25cf Deep learning (DL) , unlike more traditional machine learning, is \u201cstill research.\u201d You should not plan for a 100% success rate", "\u25cf If you are \u201cgraduating\u201d from \u201cclassical\u201d ML to DL, plan on spending a lot more time and money on labeling than you are used to\u2026", "\u25cf \u2026but don\u2019t throw out your playbook. In both cases, you are looking for settings where cheap prediction will have a large business impact", "This is the module I found most helpful. It sets up a comprehensive framework for developing an AI/ML application, from the lab through production. At each layer or category, it covers key functionality, how it fits with other layers and the major tool choices.", "Let me emphasize: what makes this course different is how comprehensive the framework is. Most public AI/ML content is focused on model development. Some sources cover just data management or just deployment. Commercial vendors often understate the complexity of the process and skip steps. This is the most \u201cpanoramic\u201d picture I\u2019ve seen if you are trying to understand the AI/ML pipeline from alpha to omega.", "The course is \u201copinionated\u201d \u2014 it sometimes calls \u201ccategory winners\u201d which is helpful if you\u2019re placing bets. For example, it calls Kubernetes as a winner in the \u201cresource management\u201d category. I agree with most of these calls, but not with all. For example, among cloud providers it picks AWS and pans Azure as having a \u201cbad user experience.\u201d While AWS is excellent, several of our clients (rightly) chose Azure, particularly those that already have a Microsoft stack (Excel, MS SQL, etc.)", "After setting up the overall framework, this module digs into Development and Training/Evaluation. I found three areas particularly interesting:", "\u25cf Prototyping: I\u2019m always looking for quick and easy ways to create a proofs of concept (POCs) for clients. I need to produce a visually attractive, interactive POC that is easily accessible over a public or semi-public URL. My ideal solution would give me code-level control over the model while not making me code a lot of HTML or Javascript. One-click deployment is a plus. I\u2019ve been using Shiny but would like to do something similar with Python. The course introduced me to streamlit, which I will be investigating further. Also interesting is dash, which is curiously not covered.", "\u25cf Experiment Management is an interesting category: It keeps track of how well your model performs under a variety of configuration options (experiments). I coded my own version of this for competing on Kaggle. I didn\u2019t know this was a category with a name. I will be checking out a few of the tools recommended by this course, including Weights and Biases.", "\u25cf All-in-one: There was a nice, informative comparison between all the all-in-one platforms available. AWS SageMaker and GCP AI look like the best choices at the moment. If pressed, I would bet others will be acquired or copied by the cloud providers.", "This module discusses how to store and manage datasets related to your pipeline. I did not find much new here. The material on data augmentation was interesting, but mostly applies to computer vision, which I have not done much of.", "This module discusses the HR portion of the project: roles, team structure, managing projects, etc. In my view, this content belongs in module 1 above \u2014 Setting up ML Projects.", "There were some interesting points about how to get a job in the field \u2014 for hiring managers and candidates. There is also a good summary of the typical roles in an ML project:", "This module discusses the process of getting a model to work in the lab. It should really be required reading for every data scientist, and is similar to the workflow I used to win several Kaggle contests. You can also get this content in many other places, but this is a well-organized and succinct presentation:", "The discussion around debugging DL models was particularly good: Get your model to run, overfit a single batch and compare to a known result. Just to illustrate the depth, here is the subsection on overfitting a single batch:", "More tips on overfitting are at the end of the article.", "This module discusses how to get your model from the lab to the real world. It\u2019s the module I was originally looking for when I took the class. I found several useful nuggets here:", "Testing an ML system is very different from testing traditional software because its behavior is driven by the data as well as the algorithm:", "You need to adjust your test suite accordingly. The course provides an excellent checklist for doing just that, taken from the now-famous paper Hidden Technical Debt in Machine Learning Systems.", "The course recommends you check that training-time and production-time variables have approximately consistent distributions (Monitoring Test 3, above). This is a critical test. It can help you detect a runtime error, such as blanks in the data feed. It can also tell you it may be time to re-train the model because the input is different than what you expected. A simple way to accomplish this is to plot training data vs production-time data, variable by variable. The Domino Data Lab tool does this.", "A better way, which is not covered in the course, is to use adversarial validation: Train an auxiliary model (in production) which tries to classify an observation as belonging to train or prod data. If this model is successful at distinguishing the two, you have a significant distribution shift. You can then inspect the model to find the most important variables that drive that shift.", "Deployment is covered with a good introduction to Kubernetes and Docker, as well as GPU-based model serving.", "The course includes guest lectures from industry heavyweights. The quality is highly variable. Some speakers are polished and prepared, others\u2026 not so much. I was most impressed with two guests:", "\u25cf Jeremy Howard of fast.ai: This talk provided lots of \u201cnews you can use\u201d in terms of improving model performance.", "o The Fast.ai library is designed to use fewer resources (human and machine) to get good results. For example, training ImageNet in 3 hours for $25. This focus on efficiency is very much aligned with what our clients are looking for.", "o Howard asks \u201cWhy are people trying to automate machine learning?\u201d The idea is we can get much better results working together. He calls this \u201cAugmentML\u201d vs. \u201cAutoML.\u201d Platform.ai is a case in point. It is a labeling product that allows the labeler to have an interactive \u201cconversation\u201d with a neural network. Each iteration improves both the labels and the model. I\u2019ve never seen anything like it, and it seems to work, at least on the video he shared.", "o Howard shares a box of tricks for improving model performance, particularly for computer vision tasks. I found Test Time Augmentation (TTA) particularly eye-opening. Will have to try it in my next project.", "\u25cf Andrej Karpathy of Tesla: This talk was interesting as well, although the audio wasn\u2019t great. Karpathy discussed his Software 2.0 concept, the idea that we will increasingly use optimization methods like gradient descent to solve problems probabilistically rather than devising fixed software rules or heuristics to solve them. Like many others, I found this mental model compelling.", "The course is not perfect. A lot of this material was created in 2018 and is starting to show its age. Three examples:", "\u25cf Richard Socher, chief scientist at Salesforce.com, is arguing for a unified NLP model with something called decaNLP. BERT has since taken over this niche, and GPT3 is an exciting recent development.", "\u25cf Model Explainability has developed rapidly over the past few years, but is not well represented", "\u25cf As mentioned above, Microsoft Azure has been making strides since and does not get a fair shake in my view", "Despite these nits, I think the course packs a lot of value into a compact and well-organized frame. The price is right, and I recommend it to anyone interested in understanding how AI/ML applications are built.", "Lastly, and for no particular reason, I hope you will enjoy this thrilling conclusion:", "Your home for data science.
