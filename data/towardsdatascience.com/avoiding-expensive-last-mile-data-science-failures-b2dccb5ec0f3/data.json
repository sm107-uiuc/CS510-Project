You believe these insights can help them make better decisions \u2026 decisions that eventually lead to real business benefits.", "Deep down, there\u2019s a sliver of doubt. What if you\u2019ve provided insights to a problem your customer doesn\u2019t care enough about?", "Back in first year civil engineering, our seen-it-all-before professor would throw new students a challenge. Two towns, separated by a fast-flowing river, and we need a bridge \u2026 a toothpick bridge.", "\u201cAny kind of toothpick bridge. Truss? Cantilever? Arch? You decide \u2026\u201d", "\u201cMake assumptions!\u201d he\u2019d growl in response to the howls of protests at almost zero information. No google in those days!", "The models that students brought in the following week ranged from terrible to half-decent, boring to downright wacky. The professor, with a wry half-smile, would first ask \u201cDo you guys trust any of these designs?\u201d.", "And then he\u2019d pull out a steel ball bearing, place it at just the right spot and sure enough, one by one everyone\u2019s structure would collapse.", "From an engineer\u2019s point of view, last-mile success is a structurally stable bridge. But civil engineering is also a mature discipline. It has well-defined processes that will get you to an output \u2026 unless things go very wrong.", "Data science, for the most part, is probabilistic. Where predictions are concerned, we extract knowledge from data and then try desperately to make a more educated guess about the future.", "We tend to say \u201cMr Customer, you\u2019re likely to get a bridge \u2014 we just don\u2019t know what kind and we don\u2019t know how strong it\u2019s going to be. But we think you should cross it because we\u2019ve \u2026 done the work!\u201d", "To many customers, it is a black box. Magic happens but what kind of alchemy? Is it sleight of hand? No one is certain.", "And the unsaid question usually is \u201cDo we trust that black box? And the people who front it?\u201d.", "\u201cThere\u2019s an old saying in business: if don\u2019t ask the right questions, then how can you expect to get the right answers? For any given product or service, customer expectations, aspirations and requirements are often locked up in the customer\u2019s mind.\u201d ~ Forbes ~ \u2018Why Business Fails To Travel The \u2018Last Mile\u2019 Of Analytics\u2019", "That question of trust goes back to the beginning. A data science-type business problem, as the customer sees it, can take many forms and evolve over multiple iterations.", "What the customer usually tells you is what they think they want at a particular point in time. But if they don\u2019t know you, they might not quite tell you enough at first\u2026 or give you the context needed to understand the nature of the problem.", "So realistically, that first version of the problem you hear is unlikely to be the problem you need to solve.", "See how this one morphs for example.", "Ultimately, every day we get to spend with our (internal or external) customer is one step closer to knowing what the real problem is.", "Finding a way to get to that dirty underbelly as quickly and intimately as possible means the difficult task of always trying to imagine being in our customer\u2019s shoes \u2026 and then asking questions of the supplier with the intent to feel viscerally.", "And this is where storyboarding, with its ability to frame questions and answers in a way that invites dialogue, can come in handy for data science.", "A few years ago, plagued by poor communications and outcomes, data science latched on to the concept of telling stories with data.", "Having seen first-hand our audiences being overwhelmed by data-driven dialogue, we had to look for alternatives. And we found the WHY of using visuals and narratives as described by Brent Dykes in his \u201cEssential data science skills\u201d article simply too compelling to ignore.", "It\u2019s one thing carving out time to learn a new skill but how does one find motivation? For that, we went to the film industry \u2026 possibly the true masters of visual storytelling.", "So we read Studio Binder\u2019s guide to storyboarding and then went through its repository of movie favourites in storyboard form. And in all honesty, the thought of trying to wrangle a customer\u2019s problem on a sketchpad first was a lot more inspiring!", "Of course, that still left us with how to effectively work data into a storyboard for an audience of C-levels, engineers, managers and others. Thankfully, we found Nancy Duarte and gobbled up her ideas on humanising data.", "For us, storyboards have now become guideposts for the path we and our customers need to take.", "One of the early mistakes we made was starting our storyboarding process during data analysis. Too late \u2026 unless you\u2019re confident you understand the problem as the customer sees it.", "Now we start with the goal of making sure we can first see the problem via data, which isn\u2019t always as easy as it sounds. But it gives us confidence that the problem is tangible.", "By replaying the problem back to the customer in your words, they get to understand your process, and you get to understand theirs.", "You also have the opportunity to refine the problem and the customer will likely sense that you\u2019re genuinely trying to understand and acknowledge their pain.", "Customers usually want to know that something is happening. A picture at a time, with a hint of progress, can do wonders.", "More importantly, as they see what you\u2019re doing, that black box becomes less of a black box.", "We need to find out quickly what makes the customer tick, and preferably as far away from the finish line as possible.", "Introducing cost estimates is a surefire way to get an early gauge of how bad the problem is, how much your customer cares about it and how off track you potentially are!", "Like horses for courses, the same storyboards may not necessarily work for different tiers of audience in your customer domain. And that\u2019s why it\u2019s critical to use tools that allow multiple storyboards off the same underlying data.", "Make no mistake, it is time consuming and exhausting. We\u2019re in effect front-loading effort in the hope of more certain future gains. Clarifying the problem extensively never meant that all the other work of data cleaning, transformation, model building and machine learning application stops.", "But it does give us the opportunity to self-correct before the last mile \u2026 without too much collateral damage.", "And helps us build the all-important narrative and business case brick-by-brick with our customer.", "\u201cAll his life has he looked away\u2026 to the future, to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was\u2026 what he was doing\u201d \u2014 Yoda", "The reality is, even if the business problem was defined adequately, any usable insight is unlikely to work if decision makers don\u2019t believe the process of how we got there. And that usually happens if they aren\u2019t part of the journey in the first place.", "But if we participate in the customer\u2019s version of the process, we give ourselves a chance. We might just end up spending enough time with them to allow trust and respect to naturally build up.", "Of course, the quality of our work had better be decent and the numbers must work.", "And then, they might just cross that bridge on your say-so \u2026", "Your home for data science.
