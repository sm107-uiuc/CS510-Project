This means that in essence, neural networks solve problems by trying to find the best possible approximation to a function that allows us to solve our problem.", "To do this we have a series of parameters (the weights and the bias) that we are updating using the backpropagation algorithm, which is based on the descent gradient.", "Thanks to our labels, we can calculate the error in each iteration and modify the weights to reduce it progressively.", "And what\u2019s a convolutional neural network? Or more importantly, what problems does it solve?", "In short, convolutional neural networks can solve all the problems that can be expressed in image form.", "For example, just take into account when you are trying to label someone in your Facebook pictures. Have you noticed that it suggests the person\u2019s profile? That\u2019s a convnet!", "Or perhaps you have heard of autonomous cars, which can \u201cread\u201d traffic signs, recognize other cars and even detect if a person is crossing the street. That functionalities are based in convnets too!", "CNNs are the state of art for solving medical imaging problems.And these are just a few examples but there are many more.", "The reason why they have become so popular in the past recent years is because they can find the right features, on their own, to later classify images correctly. And they do it in a very efficient way.", "But what exactly is a CNN?", "CNN is a neural network in which new types of layers are introduced, the most important of which is convolutional.", "Strictly speaking, convolution is mainly used in signal processing and is a mathematical operation that allows two signals to be combined.", "In digital signal processing, convolution is used to know what will happen to a signal after \u201cpassing\u201d through a certain device.", "For example, to know how our voice changes after passing through the microphone of our mobile phone, we could calculate the convolution of our voice with the response to the microphone impulse.", "Convolutional neural networks have become famous for their ability to detect patterns that they then classify. Those pattern detectors are convolutions.", "Let\u2019s see how a computer understands an image:", "As you can see, a color image is represented as a 3-dimensional matrix: Width x Height x Channels.", "There are several ways to represent the images, but the most common is using the RGB color space. This means that a computer eventually sees 3 matrices of Weight x Height, where the first one tells you the amount of red the image has, the second one tells you the amount of green, and the third one tells you the amount of blue.", "If the image were in grayscale, the computer would see it as a single two-dimensional Weight x Height matrix.", "Finally, the values that the elements of the matrix can take depend on the type of the variable used. The most common ones are:", "Knowing that the image is a matrix, what the convolution does is to define a filter or kernel through which it will multiply the image matrix. If we take a look at the next image:", "You define a kernel, 3x3 pixels, and multiply it to the input_image. What happens? That the kernel is much smaller than the image, so to multiply the whole image, first we place the kernel on the first 3x3 pixels, then we move it one to the right, then another, then another\u2026 and we calculate the sum of the multiplication of each element of the kernel by each corresponding pixel of the image. The result of this operation is stored in the output image, as you can see.", "Here you can see it more clearly:", "Let\u2019s see some examples to see what happens when we do these multiplications and additions and how they help to detect patterns and make predictions.", "This a vertical line detector. Let\u2019s define and use a horizontal line detector.", "Let\u2019s see some of the most used kernels in Traditional convolution", "Let\u2019s print first an unmodified picture:", "Other kernels that are most used (and their outputs) are:", "All of this is very informative\u2026 But how is convolution able to detect patterns?", "Let\u2019s say that we have this filter:", "What happens if the filter lays on the rat\u2019s back?", "Which is a very high number and indicates that we have found out a curve.", "What happens if the filter lays on the rat\u2019s head?", "Now that we have introduced the concept of convolution, let\u2019s study what are the convolutional neural networks and how they work.", "In these images, we can see the typical architecture of a convolutional neural network. This is nothing more than a W x H x 3 matrices (because it is RGB). Then the \u201cconvolutional blocks\u201d start.", "These blocks are usually composed of:", "Before we already know how convolution works: We define a kernel or filter that serves to highlight certain structures in the image.", "But how do I define a filter that allows me to find out that the input image has a black cat in it?", "That\u2019s CNNs magic! We don\u2019t have to define any filter, the network learns them automatically thanks to backpropagation!", "Our CNNs has two stages: feature extractor and classifier.", "The feature extraction stage goes from the general patterns, or structures, to the specifics:", "So in the end, what we have is a network that learns on its own, so we don\u2019t have to worry about which characteristics we choose to classify since it chooses them on its own.", "And how is it learning? The same way as a traditional neural network.", "The second stage, the classifier, is made up of dense layers, which are the layers used in traditional neural networks.", "So finally a CNN could be understood as a set of convolutional stages coupled to a traditional neural network, which is the one that classifies the patterns extracted by the convolutions and returns some probabilities for each class.", "These layers are in charge of applying the convolution to our input images to find the patterns that will later allow us to classify it:", "Here you can see the general scheme, in which you can see how a given input image is convoluted by each filter, and the output is 2D activation maps. This means that if the input image is RGB, it will have 3 channels. Therefore, we will convolute each filter for each channel, and then we will add the results, to reduce from 3 channels to only 1:", "As the input has 3 channels, R, G and B, this means that our input image is defined as 3 two-dimensional arrays, one for each channel.", "So what the convolution layer does is apply the convolution separately to each channel, get the result of each channel, and then add them up to get a single 2D matrix that is called an activation map.", "In this link you can see it more in detail:", "Besides the number of filters and the size, convolutional layers have another important parameter that we should take into account: the stride.", "This would be an example of a 1 unit Stride:", "And this would be an example of a 2 unit Stride convolution:", "You can tell that the difference is the length of the step that the kernel takes in each iteration.", "In the case of convolutional layers, the output neurons have been connected to only one local region of the input image.", "It can be understood as \u201cwhat the network see\u201d. With the dense layers the opposite happens, all the neurons have been connected to all the previous elements. However, the neurons still function the same, the only thing is that at the entrance they \u201csee\u201d the whole image, instead of a region of it.", "As you can find in this great article:", "The receptive field determines what area of the original input to the entire network the output gets to see.", "Pooling layers are used to reduce the size of our activation maps, otherwise, it would not be possible to run them on many GPUs. The two most common types of pooling are:", "It must be taken into account that this is done for each activation map of our volume, that is, the depth dimension does not intervene at all in the calculations.", "Let\u2019s see an example of maxpooling with different strides:", "Imagine we have an input image of 32x32, and our network has 5 convolutional layers, each with 5 filters of size 3x3. This is because the filter runs through the image.", "This is based on the assumption that if a certain filter is good at detecting something in the position (x, y) of the image, it should also be good for the position (x2,y2).", "This assumption is almost always valid because normally we do not know where our features are going to be located in the image, but if for example, we have a dataset in which faces appear centered in the image, we might want the filters to be different for the eye areas than for the nose or the mouth, right?", "In this case, if we know where our features are going to be located, it makes more sense to have a filter for each area.", "That\u2019s a huge difference. So unless we know where we want to look for the patterns, that they are going to be different and always in the same position, it is worth using convolutional rather than locally connected layers.", "By the way, look at the image below: the layers with the most parameters are the dense ones! It makes sense, in them, all the neurons interconnect with all the neurons in the next layer.", "As always, I hope you enjoyed the post, and that you gained an intuition about convolutional neural networks!", "If you liked this post then you can take a look at my other posts on Data Science and Machine Learning here.", "If you want to learn more about Machine Learning, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence follow me on Medium, and stay tuned for my next posts!", "Your home for data science.
