This is due to the idea that English is the only language that can be applied. Because of this linguistic bias, I decided to investigate how to preprocess Chinese text data for NLP.", "First, I would like to thank my cohort mate David Bruce for pointing out this disparity. In his blog post on Learning a New Language in a Word Cloud, he shared that Professor Emily M. Bender coined \u201cthe Bender Rule\u201d which encourages people to at least name the language(s) they\u2019re working on for NLP.", "So the question is, \u201chow can we perform NLP on Chinese?\u201d In this blog, I\u2019ll be walking through the basic preprocessing steps that occur in English NLP, including data cleaning, stemming/lemmatization, tokenization and stop words. TL;DR: not all of these steps are necessary for Chinese text data!", "Text normalization is a method for standardizing text to prepare it for the tokenization, vectorization and classification steps. With english, the first step would be to convert all text to lowercase. Because Chinese characters are not capitalized to begin with, there\u2019s no need for that data cleaning step.", "Next comes stemming or lemmatization. Compared to English, there is also no concept of a stem in Chinese. Therefore, there is no need to perform this step either! So far, it seems like that preprocessing Chinese text data requires less steps than English text data; making the process (surprisingly) a little easier.", "It\u2019s worth noting, however, that there\u2019s a concept similar to stems in this language, and they\u2019re called Radicals. Radicals are basically the building blocks of Chinese characters. All Chinese characters are made up of a finite number of components which are put together in different orders and combinations. Radicals are usually the leftmost part of the character. There are around 200 radicals in Chinese, and they are used to index and categorize characters.", "For instance, the radicals for female and horse come together for the character mother. This character uses the phonetic sound for horse but the gender indicator of female.", "Therefore, procedures like stemming and lemmatization are not useful for Chinese text data because seperating the radicals would change the word\u2019s meaning entirely.", "Another difference is that Chinese handles plurality much differently. A basic example is that instead of a single word for them, it\u2019s split into two characters \u4ed6\u4eec. We wouldn\u2019t be able to get to the root of this word without completely changing the meaning.", "Just to drive this point even further, the final reason why we can\u2019t preprocess Chinese in the same way is because it uses different grammatical tenses for past, present and future. In Chinese, characters are added onto the main verb. This could be considered adding to stem, but it\u2019s a little more tricky because the additional character could appear at the front or end, depending on the context. Here is a quick, basic example.", "With stemming and lemmatization in English, you can just remove the ing or ed to get to the root word and meaning. But with Chinese, it\u2019s not that simple because like I mentioned before, there\u2019s no concept of \u201croot word\u201d in Chinese.", "I could go on all day about the differences between English and Chinese. But the bottom line is that NLP is pretty different between the two languages, and these fundamental linguistic differences are very important for any computer scientist to understand.", "Before I get into stop words, let\u2019s tokenize some text first. Tokenizing breaks up text data into shorter pre-set strings, which help build context and meaning for the machine learning model. For this example, we will be looking a short excerpt from the textbook A New China.", "The plane landed at Beijing Capital International Airport at 7 o\u2019clock this evening. The foreign affairs office sent Mr. Zhang to come pick us up.", "It\u2019s worth noting that Google Translate somewhat incorrectly translated the second sentence as \u201cA Mr. Zhang from the school\u2019s foreign affairs office picked us up.\u201d This could be due the Chinese Room Theory, which argues that a computer cannot truly have an \u201cunderstanding\u201d of language, no matter how perfectly things are translated, and no matter how human-like the program behaves.", "For the sake of simplicity, I\u2019ll only tokenize the first sentence. We can use jieba text segmentation module to tokenize Chinese. Fun fact, \u201c\u7ed3\u5df4\u201d in Chinese means \u201cto stutter.\u201d Here is a link to their github for more information.", "With this output, the tokenization was somewhat successful. The translated words are as follows: airplane, is, today, night, seven o\u2019clock, punctually, land, in, beijing, capital international airport, and of.", "There are three things that you may immediately notice:", "These \u201ctags\u201d label the part of speech. There are 24 part of speech tags and 4 proper name category labels in the jieba package\u2019s existing dictionary.", "\u5317\u4eac and \u9996\u90fd\u56fd\u9645\u673a\u573a should have actually been considered a single phrase because that\u2019s the full name of the airport. Also, \u4e03\u70b9\u949f could have been separated into individual characters; but that\u2019s up for debate.", "To fix the words that should and should not have been separated, we can manually create custom words within the package\u2019s dictionary.", "This line of code sets the name of the airport as a custom token, with the place name tag. We can repeat this code for each of the individual custom words we want to set, and then the tokenization should be able to pick that up if we run it again. Obviously this process can get tedious with a much larger text file, so it\u2019s suggested that you find a well established dictionary beforehand, outside of what jieba provides by default.", "In NLP, stop words are \u201cmeaningless\u201d words that make the data too noisy or ambiguous. In our example sentence, the stop words are \u662f, \u5728 and \u7684. We could manually filter them out, but that\u2019s also very tedious. Just like with English, there are pre-set lists of stop words out there. There are about 119 official stop words in Chinese, and they can be viewed on this website. Instead of manually removing them, could import the stopwordsiso package for a full list of Chinese stop words. More information can be found here. And with this, we can easily create code to filter out any stop words in large text data.", "After all of this work, our hypothetical data is ready to be vectorized with TF-IDF Factorization and fed into a classification model! Obviously with real text data, we would be working with more than just one sentence. And this can present many other challenges.", "This was just a rough introduction to preprocessing Chinese text data for NLP, and may not totally represent the process for more complex data.", "And finally, just like with English, further procedures can be done with NLP, such as sentiment analysis.
