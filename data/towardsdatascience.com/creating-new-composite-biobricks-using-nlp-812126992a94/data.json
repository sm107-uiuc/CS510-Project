They work by first taking the basic nucleotides of DNA: A\u2019s, T\u2019s, G\u2019s, and C\u2019s, and forming a synthetic protein out of them that has a specific function. For example, if I wanted my protein to be responsible for making a cell glow green, I would create a sequence that would encode for this property (or mimic it by extracting the sequence of the proteins that make jellyfish glow).", "I would then optimize it by adding on more structures, such as RBS (Ribosome Binding Sites), depending on what the cell needs to successfully produce these proteins. The analogy of Lego blocks is often given when referring to BioBricks because of the \u201cstacking\u201d of structures used to create the protein.", "BioBricks don\u2019t just have the capability to make proteins, but entire systems depending on the function of the composite proteins made.", "BioBricks are so controversial because theoretically any protein can be made from a computer. The implications of this are massive as they can be applied to human cells as well in the future, which means if we continue to pursue this knowledge, altering the human genome for traits that we want can become reality much faster than just using CRISPR technologies (simple gene editing), for example.", "For now, however, to obtain results, BioBrick parts are usually injected into an empty bacterial cell, mainly E. coli cells for observation. But BioBricks can have very useful, positive implications as well. For example, using BioBricks we can create our own proteins that produce human compatible insulin, suggesting that there is no need for extracting insulin from other animals and converting it to a usable protein anymore.", "Shortening the process of developing human compatible insulin would be extremely beneficial to diabetic patients, as medicine would become cheaper and more readily available, not to mention all other diseases that require proteins for easing symptoms.", "But how do we go from single BioBrick parts to growing an insulin factory in bacteria? How do we leverage these parts to produce more composite proteins, like a more optimal insulin molecule, for example, efficiently? In other words, with so much opportunity in the field of syn bio, where do we start?", "Using natural language processing (NLP) though spaCy + NLTK libraries I was able to manipulate the BioBrick parts database to produce variations of entirely new composite proteins.", "By providing the sequence of the parts of a composite structure, not the specific names of the parts, my application produced a composite brick that can be used for the function needed. For example, if I wanted to make a complete protein that glows green and is compatible in a bacteria cell, I would enter in the demands for a promoter, an RBS, the GFP gene (glows a fluorescent green), etc.", "A lot of nonsensical patterns of nucleotides at first, but when compiled and analyzed closely, you will see that this is exactly what we need.", "My program optimizes for the best result of a composite protein by matching sticky ends of DNA, which arranges the bricks to contain the highest chance of being successfully implemented within bacteria. Using NLP is integral to this process because it allows you to specify what not to include within the new part.", "For example, by just throwing random words at the program, it will output a random part that has a chance of fitting together with the others, but not a high one. But if you specify the conditions of which parts can be picked and which cannot, you drastically increase the chance that your part will fit together and function as wanted.", "The NLTK and spaCy libraries are perfect for this because they make NLP processing very simple. Based on the inputs, you can now process the negatives associated with the words, the adjectives wanted for certain proteins, and more.", "The database for BioBrick parts includes around 500,000 lines of sequenced parts, which consists of a vast majority of options for every single category. Each new part the program creates tries to include promoters, RBSs, reporters, terminators, etc, based on the specifications.", "This program also includes the use of a simple classifier to classify which bricks would fit best with which bricks. This other, relatively simple, use of AI in this project shows how easy it is to create a complex output from simple inputs and processes.", "Many more ideas can stem from this one. Just one example of another AI + syn bio project could be generating new parts using GANs, similar to how scientists are developing new drugs with the same technology.", "The bricks could also be tested using AI. ML has the potential to learn from any data, which means if it finds patterns within the requirements of successful composite bricks and continuously learns from them, it then has the accuracy needed to test future bricks. This would be extremely helpful because all process work in the middle could be eliminated, leading to a more efficient system.", "The more parts we experiment with, the better understanding we get of how far we can go with both AI and syn bio alike. With ML combined with any science, we can efficiently speed up the process of understanding current unknowns and develop applications to help us grow as a society.", "Your home for data science.
