In my mind, this is the single most important chart because it represents the acceleration of the infection. I\u2019ll explain \u2014 but if you already know this feel free to skip the next paragraph.", "Although total speed is important, acceleration (the growth curve) means the difference between being on city streets and being on the freeway.", "If you think of it like traveling in a car, and the spread of the infection is represented by the number of miles traveled, then the total number of cases is like the speed you are going (the velocity), whereas the growth curve is how fast the car is speeding up (the acceleration). Although total speed is important, acceleration (the growth curve) means the difference between being on city streets and being on the freeway. That is to say that, total cases represent the change over time, but the growth curve shows how quickly the number of cases is growing.", "This chart shows the growth in COVID-19 cases over time. The x-axis shows the date from the time that the Bay Area started getting COVID-19 cases. The y-axis shows the delta, the change in the total number of cases. Or to put it more simply, the y-axis shows the new cases by day. The different colors in the stacked bars show the breakdown by county. But for looking at the growth curve for the Bay Area as a whole you can just pay attention to the total height of the bars.", "Looking a this chart you can see a clear leveling off of new cases. As a contrast, here\u2019s the growth curve for Illinois.", "With the Illinois chart, you can see that over the past few days there is potential for leveling off, but it\u2019s recent enough that there isn\u2019t sufficient data yet to say for certain.", "One other factor to keep in mind with all of this data is that these are confirmed COVID-19 cases. So these numbers are affected by the number of tests conducted.", "The SF Bay area total cases continue to rise, but due to the slowing growth, it is rising linearly and not exponentially. This is what we would expect from the growth curve shown above.", "There are a lot of other variables involved in attributing these results; things like: the general health of the population, how closely shelter-in-place is followed, population density, availability of health facilities, and cultural factors. One other factor to consider is that the SF Bay Area already has a significant work-from-home culture, which may have increased the compliance with shelter-in-place orders.", "We can use the SF Bay Area example to create a rough timeline of how long it takes shelter-in-place to reduce infection rates and by what amount.", "That said, if we assume that this model will work roughly the same for other regions, then we can use the SF Bay Area example to create a rough timeline of how long it takes shelter-in-place to reduce infection rates and by what amount.", "The shelter-in-place for California as a whole went into effect March 19th and the New York shelter-in-place order took effect March 22nd. The Bay Area shelter-in-place having taken effect March 16. So if we follow this rough model that puts California 3 days behind the Bay Area and it puts New York just under a week behind.", "As predicted in this article (prior to the updating it), we do seem to be seeing similar results in other regions as their shelter-in-place timelines catch up.", "All data and visualizations for this article are from the Knowi Coronavirus Data Hub.
