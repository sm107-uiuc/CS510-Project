In my last two blogs, I covered reweighing as a mitigation technique within the pre-processing stage of modeling, and adversarial debiasing during the in-processing (model training) stage of the machine learning workflow.", "The third stage in the machine learning (ML) pipeline where we can intervene to reduce bias is called post-processing. Post-processing algorithms are mitigation steps that can be applied to the model predictions. On Fairness and Calibration [1], Equality of Opportunity in Supervised Learning [2] and Decision Theory for Discrimination-aware Classification [3] are among the different post-processing bias mitigation techniques proposed from academic literature.", "In this post, I will focus on exploring decision theory for discrimination-aware classification technique called Reject Option-based Classification (ROC). In this approach, the assumption is that most discrimination occurs when a model is least certain of the prediction i.e. around the decision boundary (classification threshold). Thus by exploiting the low confidence region of a classifier for discrimination reduction and rejecting its predictions, we can reduce the bias in model predictions.", "For example, with a classification threshold of 0.5, if the model prediction is 0.81 or 0.1, we would consider the model certain of its prediction but for 0.51 or 0.49, the model is not certain about the chosen category. In ROC, for model predictions with the highest uncertainty around the decision boundary, when the favorable outcome is given to the privileged group or the unfavorable outcome is given to the unprivileged, we modify them.", "The advantage of this method is that you directly intervene at the last stage of the modeling workflow. This can be valuable for situations where at the prediction time (or in the deployment environment), the protected or sensitive attributes are available. In addition, this approach, and in general, post-processing techniques provide the option to mitigate without modifying the learning stage and so are not restricted by any specific learning algorithm. Additionally, this approach is applicable to different fairness definitions as well.", "Like before, to demonstrate how this technique can be used to reduce bias, I used the Adult dataset [4]. The binary target in this dataset is whether an individual has an income higher or lower than $50k. It contains several features that are protected by the law in the US, but for simplicity in this post, I will focus on sex. As can be seen in the table below, Male is the privileged group with a 30% probability of having a positive outcome (>$50k) compared to an 11% probability of having a positive outcome for the Female group.", "The disparate impact metric (DI), as described in the previous blog, is a measure of discrimination in the data. A score of 1 indicates the dataset is discrimination-free. When calculated on the Adult dataset for Male versus Female, the score is 0.36.", "To evaluate the effect, I applied the available implementation of the ROC technique in the IBM toolkit [5] on model predictions on the test data. For this example, I used the statistical parity difference (this metric is the same as DI but rather than a ratio, takes the difference between the two probabilities). To simplify comparing this analysis with my previous blog, in addition to DI, I also looked at Average Odds Difference as another metric to further analyze the bias in the predictions of these models. As mentioned there, Average Odds Difference calculates the difference in mean of false positive and true positive rates for predictions on unprivileged and privileged groups.", "The results of the experiment point to the usefulness of the reweighing method in reducing discrimination, as seen in the table below:", "As we can see, the model accuracy dropped by 0.07, but this technique was able to substantially improve the DI score and reduce the Average Odds Difference almost to zero. To achieve this reduction in bias, the decision-makers should consider the tradeoff between accuracy and fairness.", "In comparison to in-processing methods like adversarial debiasing, experiments show that in-processing techniques are more effective at reducing bias than post-processing techniques such as ROC. However, if we applied the ROC technique to a hiring algorithm and ended with the same DI score as in our experiment, 1.0, it would satisfy the 4/5ths rule specified by US employment law (DI score of at least 0.8).", "[2] Moritz Hardt, Eric Price, and Nati Srebro.
