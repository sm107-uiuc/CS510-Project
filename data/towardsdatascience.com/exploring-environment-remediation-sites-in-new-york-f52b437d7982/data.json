Also, the least common type is the Hazardous Waste Management Program with almost negligible sites out of all the data.", "The class/status of each site is identified using an alpha-numeric code as described below:", "While the description for each class is clearly stated, some of it appears redundant such as using both 05 and N for indicating that nothing more needs to be done. However, let\u2019s take a look at the plot and see if it reveals any information.", "The data distribution is quite unique in itself. One thing that clearly stands out is that many site projects have been completed.", "While proposed completion dates are also provided for all sites, I\u2019m more interested in the sites that have already been closed and if there is any trend in the data.", "As we can see from the line plot above, very few sites closed from 1985\u20132005, however, the number grew significantly after that. The maximum sites closed in the year 2015.", "There could have been less closes as there were less number of sites back in the period of 1985\u20132005 which grew as the waste production increased with human population outburst.", "Rather than exploring the waste names, it\u2019s better that we know which site has what contaminant. This may allow for similar solutions to be applied to sites that have same contaminants. There are over 237 different contaminants that have to be dealt with.", "Lead is the most common contaminant across all sites with a whopping 2500+ sites with it. The least common contaminants are pickle liquor, mineral/white spirits and calcium carbonate.", "The control type is divided between Institutional and Engineering at the top level which are further composed of Deed Restriction, Decision Document, Environmental Notice, Environmental Easement and Other Controls.", "Deed Restriction is the most common type of control type with approximately 45% of the total dataset.", "The data reveals a lot of information about the remediation sites which enables us to handle similar sites clubbed together.", "Hope that you liked my work.
