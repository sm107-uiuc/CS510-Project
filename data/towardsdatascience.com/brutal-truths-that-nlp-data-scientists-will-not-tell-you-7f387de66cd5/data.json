This is approximately 40 times growth in 10 years!", "On the other hand, Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), the sponsor of the journal Computational Linguistics, has been holding an annual conference which attracts dozen of NLP scientists to submit their works. The submission of scientific papers alone in 2019 had increased by 75% compared to ACL 2018.", "You might be thinking \u2014 Boom! I am going to work my ass off to become an NLP data scientist in the near future! I love NLP!", "Does this mean that you should get into this field just because of its bright future ahead?", "Here is the thing. Everything you read suggests the future of NLP is bright and it will be great. However, you should not get into the field without knowing what an NLP data scientist does in and out. I want you to be well-informed of the actual situation so that you can make a better decision on whether to enter the NLP field.", "In this article, I will share with you the truth about working as an NLP data scientist.", "In short, it involves computational techniques for the analysis of human natural language and speech.", "This means that you are going to deal with text in different kinds of forms. Let me share with you some situations that an NLP data scientist will face from time to time.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the tweet below.", "Imagine that you are analyzing this text. Your aim is to get the meaning out of the text. Let\u2019s say you identify the subject is \u201cmy pants\u201d and the verb for it is \u201cmissing\u201d. Then, what do you get from this tweet?", "This is obviously not representative of the meaning of the tweet, right?", "Now, let\u2019s say you are performing aspect-based sentiment analysis. Aspect base analysis consists of sentiment (positive or negative) and a target (of opinion).", "For instance, \u201cthe service provided by the restaurant is good\u201d. Here, the aspect is \u201cservice\u201d and the sentiment is \u201cpositive\u201d.", "Why is this important? It is because the owner of the restaurant not only knows the customer\u2019s experience is good but also specifically the service provided by them is great.", "Let\u2019s say you saw this review in your dataset.", "The subject here is the vacuum cleaner, but what should be the sentiment? The term \u201csucks\u201d generally represents a negative sentiment but you can see the meaning could change when it paired with a vacuum cleaner.", "A vacuum cleaner cleans by creating suction. When you say it really sucks, you are describing this vacuum cleaner works well, isn\u2019t it?", "To make things even complicated. Consider the following question.", "Hey bro, where to eat nice food ah?", "Does this sentence mean the food is nice? Nope, this is actually just a question.", "Another situation is when you are working with text which you have no idea what does it mean. For instance, you understand English, Chinese, and Malay. However, your company is working on Japanese text classification projects. Therefore, when you are trying to understand what goes wrong with your model, you will have a hard time.", "One of the solutions might be to use google translate to convert the sentence into the language you know. However, google translation is not perfect. There will be some cases where the translation provided does not make sense and you will need to consult your native Japanese speaker.", "Besides, let\u2019s say you are working on a text classification task. The goal is to detect whether an item name should belong to either wine or juice.", "Maybe you are thinking of using keyword lists as a feature. After you spend a few hours finding some useful keywords to differentiate the two classes, here is what you think:", "First, you decide to have a set of keyword list for each class. For instance, the keyword list for class wine is [\u2018wine\u2019, \u2018grape juice\u2019] while the keyword list for class juice is [\u2018juice\u2019]. If the element in the keyword list is found in the item name, then the element will be fed into the model as a feature.", "However, the performance of your model turns out to be lower than the benchmark of 90% accuracy.", "What should you do? You go through each of the wrongly classified test data patiently. You are shocked as you figure out that there are many typos for wine: wne, wyne and etc. Therefore, you have to either update the list or performs some typo checking on your training dataset with the hope that the accuracy will increase.", "However, this is not the end of the story. The accuracy did increase, but you are still not satisfied with the result. Again, you eyeballing on the misclassified data and find out this interesting item name:", "\u201cPinot Noir which made from fermented grape juice\u201d", "The keyword you extracted from the title is \u201cjuice\u201d and thus your model classified it into class juice, which is wrong! Pinot Noir is red wine and hence it should be classified into wine!", "Text can be fun and disgusting at the same time. Hence, most of the time, an NLP data scientist will be looking at the data, scratching your head, trying to think a way to make your model understand the context.", "Therefore, if you think NLP data scientist is just calling .fit() in sklearn, you should change your direction right now.", "If you have to take away only one thing from this article, this is the one.", "You should expect 80% of your time, no matter whether you are performing analysis, feature engineering, model improvement, looking at the text data. Thus, make sure you understand your data well and can foresee some potential cases that could happen in the future.", "Congratulations! You read until the end of the article. I hope I did not reduce your interest in becoming an NLP data scientist. My aim in creating this article is just to help you have a better understanding of some important information before you enter the NLP field.", "Of course, this is just my 2 cents and I welcome you to comment below to share your personal experience as an NLP data scientist as well!\ud83e\udd17", "Let me end this article with a quote.", "I know you\u2019ve heard it a thousand times before. But it\u2019s true \u2014 hard work pays off. If you want to be good, you have to practice, practice, practice. If you don\u2019t love something, then don\u2019t do it. \u2014 Ray Bradbury", "Low Wei Hong is a Data Scientist at Shopee.
