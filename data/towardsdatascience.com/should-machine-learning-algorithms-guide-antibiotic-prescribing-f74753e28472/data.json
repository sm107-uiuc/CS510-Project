By 2050 its estimated 10 million people will die from of antimicrobial resistant infections.", "A lot of infections are treated \u201cempirically\u201d, meaning that if the doctor has an idea of what bacteria you\u2019re infected with, they will prescribe a standard antibiotic to treat it. This means that if you have an infection that\u2019s resistant to the standard antibiotic, while you\u2019re taking your course of antibiotics, the bacteria are still living and replicating inside you. This can lead to a rise in the prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria over time.", "There\u2019s growing interest in testing for antibiotic resistance before a patient begins treatment. The image below is a bit complicated, but it shows the potential long-term impact of prescribing the right antibiotic the first time.", "Panel A shows the effect of prescribing a combination of two antibiotics to everyone. You get an increase in the number of infections that are resistant to the treatment over the course of a few decades.", "Panels B-D show what would happen if you scale up testing of patients for resistance to just one of the drugs before prescribing from 10\u201350%. Resistance to three of the available antibiotics actually goes up, an even worse situation.", "But panels E-G show the impact of testing for all three available antibiotics in 10\u201350% of the population. As coverage of testing increases, resistance to antibiotics stops increasing, with most infections being susceptible to all antibiotics.", "Testing for resistance to antibiotics before prescribing seems like a great approach. However, there are some practical limitations that get in the way of doing this routinely. A major problem is that when people go to their doctor or to the hospital for treatment, they expect to be given antibiotics to treat their infection straight away. Laboratory testing for resistance can take between 24 hours for infections like MRSA, to months for tuberculosis.", "Whole genome sequencing is becoming cheaper over time, making it a more practical approach for detecting antibiotic resistance. Sequencing can, in theory, give you results in a matter of hours, rather than days. The mechanisms that drive resistance in these bacteria are coded in their DNA, meaning that a single test could tell us about resistance to a panel of antibiotics, and also give us other useful information, like whether the strain you\u2019re infected with is on the rise, or is related to one that\u2019s circulating in the hospital or community at the time.", "We know that the information we need to find is in the DNA of these bacteria, but we don\u2019t always know how to find it. That\u2019s where machine learning could come in.", "Promising machine learning studies have been coming out over the last few years, all claiming high accuracy in predicting resistance. But, it\u2019s easier to achieve high accuracy under the controlled conditions of a scientific study than it is in the real world, so there\u2019s still uncertainty around how well these algorithms will perform when challenged with clinical data.", "This is a problem my colleagues and I are really interested in, and in a new paper out this month, we begin to explore the topic. The study looks at three machine learning approaches:", "We are looking into seven different collections of genome sequence data from N. gonorrhoeae, the bacteria that cause gonorrhoea, each collected in different locations with different sampling strategies. This study looked at resistance to ciprofloxacin (which has quite a simple mechanism of resistance) and azithromycin (where the mechanism of resistance is more complicated and less well understood). To process the genome sequence data into something the models could use, the genome sequences were broken up into 31-mers, chunks of the DNA that were 31 letters long. Hyper-parameters were tuned using 5-fold cross-validation.", "While the ML methods did well with the simple resistance mechanism driving ciprofloxacin resistance, they didn\u2019t do as well with the more complicated azithromycin resistance. This is a shame, since we can predict ciprofloxacin resistance with very high accuracy by looking for a single mutation (>98% sensitivity and >99% specificity). We were hoping ML could shed more light on azithromycin resistance. I\u2019ve also found a similar thing with genome-wide association studies, an older technique more explicitly designed for figuring out what in the genome drives resistance \u2014 these methods are great at telling us what we already know, but not so great at shedding light on what we didn\u2019t already know. In other words, if it\u2019s historically been hard for humans to understand the genetics of a trait, it\u2019s also difficult for these algorithms.", "We see a lot of variability across antibiotics, species and methods in terms of model performance, and the major take-away from this project was that one approach does not suit all problems, even within this narrow problem space. This means that it\u2019s not going to be straightforward to design a pipeline that we can send all of our clinical data through \u2014 a process needs to be in place to choose the right model for each problem.", "A major factor we\u2019re looking into is sampling bias. This can come in the form of only sampling from a particular patient group, or a particular time period, or a particular geographic region. Sampling bias presents a major challenge in any predictive modelling. In resistance prediction, sampling from specific patient demographics or during limited time periods can affect the number of examples of resistance and the diversity of resistance mechanisms you capture.", "Across the different gonorrhoea datasets, some were collected locally, some were from a global collection, some were from a single year and some spanned more than 20 years. We found that even if you have a large dataset containing samples from all over the world, a model trained on this collection will still do worse on data from a new location than a model trained locally. Sometimes a model trained on a global collection even does worse on new data from a previously sampled location than a model trained just using data from that location, suggesting there were dataset-specific signals (possibly biases or technical artefacts) that were influencing accuracy.", "The study also looked at the performance of ciprofloxacin resistance prediction in K. pneumoniae and A. baumanii, which both have a greater range of genes they can carry than N. gonorrohoeae, so produce more k-mers. For these scenarios the SCM overfit to the training data more than the RF classifier, but the RF classifier was less accurate overall. As with gonorrhoea, looking for a single known mutation gave better or equal balanced accuracy than the ML models.", "An important take-home from the study is to not trust models built in this space that only report their accuracy. The resistance profiles we really care about are the ones where resistance to an antibiotic is currently rare, so we still use the antibiotic. A model can achieve high accuracy for these rare resistances by predicting that everything is not resistant. It\u2019s important to know specifically what proportion and how many resistant isolates were missed by the model, because these would result in treatment failures and selection for resistance in the clinic.", "Your home for data science.
