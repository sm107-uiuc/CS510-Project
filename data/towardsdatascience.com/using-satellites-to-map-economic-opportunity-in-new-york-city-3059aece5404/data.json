In mid-19th century England, a physician named John Snow became known for his work tracing the 1854 London cholera outbreak. Snow is famous for mapping cases of cholera and showing their cluster around a well in the city \u2014 he argued that cholera was transmitted via sources of contaminated water, not through \u2018bad air\u2019 as was the common belief at the time. Public health policy and practice advanced in the detection and mitigation of cholera thanks to Snow\u2019s spatial data work. At a time when COVID-19 exponentially infects millions across the globe, it seems pertinent to remember the canonical work of Snow.", "As a spatial data scientist at The Rockefeller Foundation, I use satellites and geographically referenced datasets to derive insights about patterns and relationships across landscapes, inspired by Snow. One topic of interest to The Rockefeller Foundation and our work in Equity and Economic Opportunity is Opportunity Zones (OZs), officially designated economically distressed communities where investors are given special tax relief as part of the much discussed 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Census tracts are qualified to receive OZ status if they have an individual poverty rate of at least 20 percent and median family income no greater than 80 percent of the area median, and state governments choose OZs from a portion of all qualified tracts.   Earlier this year, our team asked if it would be possible to use satellite imagery to identify opportunity zones in New York City. At the core of this question was an even deeper one: are there unique features and patterns in our built environment that are distinct in areas of high income and low income? In other words, is there a spatially and spectrally distinct signature between high income and low income areas?", "We hypothesized that yes, there do exist distinguishing features and patterns between low and high income areas that will contribute to distinct spectral signatures, and decided to test this hypothesis in New York City. In multiple studies, researchers have found that the economic status (among other socioeconomic factors) of different areas in NYC and in the United States can be estimated with statistical significance using Google Street View images . While satellite imagery is captured from above and have much lower resolution \u2014 pixels that normally capture dozens of meters squared on the ground \u2014 other researchers have found that nightlights measured by satellites can explain up to 75% of economic outcomes in developing regions. We also recognize that satellite data isn\u2019t perfect for capturing opportunity zones because it is a raster type (more or less continuous) data source while census boundaries are vector type (polygons) that capture the mean values of different socioeconomic factors over a designated area; we didn\u2019t expect to find perfect bounding boxes in satellite data, but rather gradients of clusters showing areas more or less likely to be opportunity zones.  As our remote sensing lead, I began by identifying all census tracts from the 2011 -2015 time period qualified to be OZs within NYC using the median family income percentage and individual poverty rate percentage \u2014 a total of 806. For this work, all census tracts qualified to be Opportunity Zones are considered OZs and are visualized below in dark green over the boundary of New York City, in white. Using Google Earth Engine, I then created a single composited, mosaicked image for New York City for2016 using Sentinel-2, a moderate resolution public satellite with a 10-day repeat. Note that 2016 is the closest full year available of Sentinel-2 imagery to the 2011\u20132015 time frame of the census data used. To do this, I pulled all images of the New York City region for all of 2016 (a total of over 500 images), and processed each by filtering for clouds before taking the mean at each pixel for each band across all overlapping images. This process resulted in a set of adjacent images with each pixel in each band containing the mean reflectance value for 2016, which I then stitched together to create a single image. This compositing normalizes the dataset and evens seasonal variations as well as gaps from cloud coverage.", "Again using Earth Engine, I trained both a random forest classifier and maximum entropy classifier using 60,000 points (representing less than 1% of possible pixels) extracted from the composite Sentinel-2 image using the census geometries of OZs and non-OZs. I applied these classifiers to the whole of the composite image to classify each pixel as OZ or non-OZ, and then combined the two into an ensemble using majority vote (unanimous). The resulting classifier is shown below, with dark green showing pixels classified as OZ and white showing non-OZ.", "Broadly speaking, this model is better than random and performs particularly well around in the Bronx and eastern Brooklyn \u2014 clips of these two regions are shown below. The answer to our initial question is yes, there are distinct, shared spectral signatures distinct to high and low income areas across New York City. It is clear that areas with lots of vegetation tend to be classified as not an opportunity one (evidenced by parks being blocks of white), and those with lots of cement and asphalt tend to be classified as opportunity zones (evidenced by major roads showing in dark green).", "It is clear that areas with lots of vegetation tend to be classified as not an OZ (evidenced by parks being blocks of white), and those with lots of cement and asphalt tend to be classified as OZs(evidenced by major roads showing in dark green). However, these are not the only driving factors \u2014 otherwise, the areas around the airports would be wholly classified as opportunity zones due to the runways. Because the spectral bands most important to this classification are red, near infrared and short wave infrared, it is likely that vegetation, types of man-made materials, and water and moisture accumulation played significant roles. It is also likely that certain types of roofs and the width of streets and volume of cars regularly on the streets also had a large impact on the classification as well. As NYC neighborhoods continue to gentrify and buildings are repurposed before a period of new development, it\u2019s probable that areas in transition offer mixed spectral signatures. Lower Manhattan exemplifies this: while the cost of living has skyrocketed over the past decades, new buildings are rare and remodeled older buildings are favored. The classifier performs particularly poorly in Lower Manhattan likely for this reason.", "This work is still early, but it supports the hypothesis that there are spatial patterns of distinct spectral signatures related to economic opportunity observable by satellites. Satellite data could be a valuable tool to understand economic opportunity at high resolution, track certain types of gentrification, and generally understand the landscape of social class throughout a city at low cost and across time. With COVID-19\u2019s devastating impact on New York City, potential uses for this satellite mapping have been forefront. As became clear early in the pandemic, low income families are more likely to get sick, but also more likely to suffer serious medical complications and more likely to be adversely affected in the long run. Other blogs, articles and media sources have delved into this extensively using the public NYC Health Data linking cases to ZIP codes (although many researchers have not normalized ZIP code data by population) and I won\u2019t go into those trends here. Moving forward, high resolution mapping tools could be invaluable in picking testing sites or pop-up clinics as we learn to mitigate COVID-19. In the spirit of John Snow, the Data Science Team at The Rockefeller Foundation is committed to exploring these novel applications of data science to real-world problems for high impact social change.", "Your home for data science.
