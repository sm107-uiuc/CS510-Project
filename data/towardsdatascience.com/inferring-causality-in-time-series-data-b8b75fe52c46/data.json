Familiarity with this theory is required for further reading, as it is the framework upon which statistical notions of causality in time series are built.", "Throughout the years a number of different notions of causality were suggested by scholars of statistics and economics. I give here an overview of the major ones. This part is based, in part, on [Eichler, 2011] and [Runge, 2014]. \ud83d\udcd6", "The earliest concept of causality for time series data was suggested by Granger [1969, 1980], building on a notion from [Wiener, 1956]. It is based on contrasting the ability to predict a stochastic process Y using all the information in the universe, denoted with U, with doing the same using all information in U except for some stochastic process X; this is denoted with U\\X. The core idea is that if discarding X reduces the predictive power regarding Y, then X contains some unique information regarding Y, and we thus say that X Granger-causes Y.", "Definition 2: If X\u21d2Y and Y\u21d2X we say that feedback is occurring, and write X\u21d4Y.", "As noted by Granger himself, the requirement of having access to all the information in the universe is extremely unrealistic. In practice U is replaced by a limited set of observed time series X, with X\u2208X, and the above definition reads X Granger-causes Y with respect to X.", "Finally, this definition does not specify the prediction method used for \u03c3\u00b2, and thus allows for both linear and non-linear models, but the use of the variance to quantify the closeness of prediction restricts this notion of causality to causality in mean.", "This notion is usually referred to as strong Granger causality; other related notions of causality are Granger causality in mean [Granger 1980, 1988] and linear Granger causality [Hosoya 1977, Florens and Mouchart 1985].", "Instantaneous causality: A related kind of causality, modifying Granger causality slightly, is instantaneous causality [Price, 1979]. We say that X and Y has instantaneous causality between them if, at time i, adding X\u1d62 to the information set helps to improve the predicted value of Y\u1d62.", "Note that this type of causality is not directional, but rather symmetric, and it can be shown that if the above definition holds then the symmetric statement \u2014 that \u03c3\u00b2(X\u1d62|\ud835\udcb0\u1d62\u222a{Y\u1d62}) < \u03c3\u00b2(X\u1d62|\ud835\udcb0\u1d62) \u2014 also holds(see [L\u00fctkepohl, 2007] for proof). Thus, we do not say that X instantaneously causes Y, but rather that there is instantaneous causality between X and Y.", "Multi-step causality: In a bivariate system, if the 1-step ahead forecasts of one variable cannot be improved by using the information in the other variable, the same holds for all h-step forecasts for any h=1,2,\u2026, and so the 1-step ahead criteria is sufficient to define Granger causality. This result does not hold anymore if the information set contains additional variables. [L\u00fctkepohl and M\u00fcller, 1994]", "Thus, in a multivariate system, we say that variable X\u1d62 is h-step causal for another variable Y\u1d62 if the information in X\u1d62 helps improve the j-step forecasts of Y\u1d62 for some j=1, 2, \u2026, h.", "In an influential paper, [Sims, 1972] showed \u2014 in the context of covariance stationary processes, and restricted to linear predictors \u2014 that in the bivariate case the definition of Granger causality is equivalent to parameter restrictions of the moving average or distributed lag representations of the processes x[t], y[t]. When the system is covariance stationary it can be represented as:", "where a\u2c7c, b\u2c7c, c\u2c7c and d\u2c7c are constants and u[t] and v[t] are mutually uncorrelated white noise processes. Sims shows that the condition x[t] does not Granger cause y[t+1] is equivalent to c\u2c7c or \u2c7c being chosen identically zero for all j.", "In contrast to Granger\u2019s definition, which considers temporal precedence in the form of a link from the past to the present, Sims\u2019 notion considers temporal precedence in the form of a link from the present to the future. As a consequence, the potential causal relationship considered runs from the dependent variable to future values, or \u2018leads\u2019, of the regressor.", "While at the time of its introduction in [Sims, 1972] it was presented as an equivalent definition to Granger\u2019s, it was since contrasted with it and was shown to be inequivalent when the measure of uncorrelatedness of time series used is independence [Florens and Mouchart, 1982]; rather, it is shown that Granger causality is a stronger condition, and that while Granger causality implies Sims causality, the inverse is not true.", "In spite of this inequivalency, most statistical tests for causal inference in time series data focus on Granger\u2019s definition. However, at least in the case where a vector autoregressive (VAR) model is used, these tests can be modified to test for Sims\u2019 causality (see here for an example highlighting the difference between the tests for the linear case).", "Introduced by White and Lu (2010), structural causality assumes that the data-generating process (DGP) has a recursive dynamic structure in which predecessors structurally determine successors. Specifically, for two processes X \u2014 the potential cause \u2014 and Y \u2014 the response, we assume they are generated by", "for all t\u2208Z. Here, the process Z includes all relevant observed variables while the realizations of U=(U\u2093, U\u1d67) are assumed to be unobserved, and the functions q[x,t] and q[y,t] are assumed to be unknown.", "Observe that this dynamic structure is general, in that the structural relations may be nonlinear and non-monotonic in their arguments and non-separable between observables and unobservables. The unobservables may be countably infinite in number. Finally, this system may generate stationary processes, non-stationary processes, or both.", "A structural notion of causality can then be defined:", "The authors then go on to analyze the relations between Granger causality and this notion of structural causality. Additionally, building on classical notions of Granger causality, they introduce two extensions of it: weak Granger causality and retrospective weak Granger causality.", "Finally, the authors construct practical tests for their two notions of Granger causality. Specifically, weak Granger causality is shown to be detectable by testing for the conditional independence of the response Y and the potential cause X given the history of the response and the near-histories of the observable covariates of the processes.", "The use of intervention as the basis for a statistical theory of causality inference, as championed by Judea Pearl, can be traced back at least to the early 90\u2019s [Pearl and Verma, 1991] [Pearl, 1993].

This include, among other topics, building Financial networks based on Granger causality, examining the effect of different resampling methods for causality testing and causality measures for multivariate analysis.", "Prof. Dimitris Kugiumtzis does incredible work on time series analysis generally, and causality inference in time series data specifically, driven by information theoretic approaches, notably the MIME and PMIME measures.", "Prof. George Sugihara is a theoretical biologist who has worked across a variety of fields, introducing inductive theoretical approaches to understanding complex dynamic systems in nature from observational data. Chief among those is Empirical Dynamic Modeling, a non-parametric approach for the analysis and forecast of complex dynamical systems rooted in chaos theory, represented in this post by the CCM method. His work involves inductive theoretical approaches to understanding nature from observational data.", "Dr. Jakob Runge did substantial work on causality in time series data, mainly in the context of climate research; he is also the creator of tigarmite, a Python library for causal inference in time series data using the PCMCI method.", "Youssef Hmamouche is one of the authors and maintainers of the NlinTS R package for neural network-based time series forecasting and causality detection in time series data, and recently wrote about a Causality-Based Feature Selection Approach For Multivariate Time Series Forecasting.", "Judea Pearl, who is a prominent researcher in the field and who has developed the structural approach to casual inference, recently wrote a very interesting piece on causal inference tools and reflections on machine learning [Pearl, 2018]. He also wrote a thorough overview of the topic of causal inference [Pearl, 2009].", "David Lopez-Paz, a research scientist at Facebook AI Research, leads very interesting research on casual inference in general, and in the context of learning frameworks and deep learning specifically. Highlights include posing causal inference as a learning problem (specifically of classifying probability distributions), causal generative neural networks, incorporation of an adversarial framework for causal discovery and discovering causal signals in images.", "Uri Shalit, Asst. Prof. at the Technion, heads a lab dedicated to machine learning and causal inference in healthcare, and one of his main research interests is the intersection of machine learning and causal inference, with a focus on using deep-learning methods for causal inference.", "Krzysztof Chalupka has done some fascinating research in the intersection of deep learning and causal inference. Highlights include a deep-learning-based conditional independence test, causal feature learning, visual causal feature learning and causal regularization.", "Finally, [Dong et al. 2012] have used Multi-Step Granger Causality Method (MSGCM), a method developed to identify feedback loops embedded in biological networks using time-series experimental measurements, for the identification of feedback loops in neural networks.", "Your home for data science.
