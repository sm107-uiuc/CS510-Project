It is not uncommon to come across MOOCs that provide students with financial support through discounts and payment programs.", "Another advantage MOOCs have over academic institutions is the flexibility to take courses, online classes and exams at a time that suits you as opposed to the constricting structure of a time-table and set exams time allocations.", "\u201cEducation is not about thinning the herd.

In order to transition from a student of machine learning to a professional taking MOOCs to focus on the practical aspect of ML as opposed to the theoretical content taught in Universities can be a time and cost saving decision.", "Do note that there are benefits to taking advanced degrees at Universities, you should conduct your own in-depth research before making career defining decisions.", "Computer Vision as a field encompasses many approaches and techniques to solve common CV problems such as object detection, face recognition, pose estimation etc.", "You are typically not expected to reinvent the wheel or develop novel algorithms to solve trivial computer vision tasks (except you work within research). Many tools you will use during your studies and career are available through ML libraries and frameworks.", "ML Libraries and framework provide a suite of tools at the ready for ML practitioners to implement, train, test and deploy computer vision solutions. There are popular tools and libraries such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, and others like FastAI, Caffe2, Keras, Scikit-Learn, MXnet, Darknet etc.", "The ML industry seems to have settled on TensorFlow(Keras) and PyTorch as the industry standard.

Having cloud services knowledge does put you at the top percentile of CV Engineers in the industry, in terms of skillsets.", "I\u2019m not referring to certificates or accreditations received when taking online courses. There are certifications given to ML practitioners that can show expertise within certain libraries, cloud services and frameworks.", "TensorFlow, AWS, and GCP are all tools and resources that I\u2019ve mentioned in this article. Another piece of information is that the companies and organisations that provide these tools and services also issue recognised certificates.", "A few years ago having a portfolio accompanied by an advanced degree was sufficient enough to secure ML roles.

You will most likely find that Python is the most requested programming language in most machine learning related job roles.", "In 2021, CV Engineers will need to at least have expertise in one language and be at an intermediate level in two or three other languages.", "The reason for this is because Deep Learning models are utilised in different platforms and environments. Each of these environments leverages other core programming languages to perform functionalities and operations.", "I currently integrate deep learning models within mobile environments, which requires that I\u2019m proficient in Python, JavaScript and Swift. In 2021, I\u2019ll be expanding my programming language skillset to include Kotlin and Java.", "The trick here is not to cram all the syntax available in a language and move on to the next. Instead, it\u2019s more important to understand the basic principles of Object-Oriented programming and coding patterns utilised in most programming languages.", "The demand for Computer Vision / Deep Learning Engineer will most likely increase in correlation to the adoption of more camera orientated AI applications.", "The content required for ML practitioners to study to become CV Engineers might be overwhelming, but once you get started, complete a few MOOCs, and pick up core ML libraries, you\u2019ll find that learning tends to get easier.", "In this article, I\u2019ve presented eight methods you can adopt and act upon today to become a CV Engineer in 2021. To recap, here\u2019s a summaries list below:", "1. Take online courses in order to gain domain expertise or improve knowledge.", "4. Be aware of cloud services such as GCP, AWS etc", "5.
