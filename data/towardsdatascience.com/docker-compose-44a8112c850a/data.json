The worker application, written in .NET, then processes this vote and inserts it in the persistent database \u2014 the Postgres container here.", "Finally, the result of the vote is displayed via a web application that is written in NodeJS.", "I highly encourage you to clone this application and play around with it, even if you do not know anything about Docker Compose yet. If you can appreciate the fact that these services are running on 5 different containers you already have your motivation to continue reading.", "Next, we look at the docker-compose file. It is a simple YAML file that starts with the service name and its details, including the image from which it is created, ports to map, other services to link to, etc.", "Here we assume that every image is pre-build and available on the Docker Registry (Dockerhub in our case). To be able to build the services on our Docker Host, which is what we will do for the vote, result, and worker images, we have to replace the image attribute with the build attribute in the docker-compose file.", "There are several versions of the docker-compose file due to its constant and fast development over the years. The change from version 1 to version 2 is moving of services into the services label and adding version label as the first line. Also, you do not need to the links anymore, as by default every container is connected to every other container using the Bridge network. depends_on was added to support the completion of building some containers before others in case of dependencies. Version 2 and version 3, for the limited scope of this tutorial, are largely the same. Just remember several features for Docker Swarm and other Container Orchestration software, like Kubernetes, were added in version 3 of docker-compose.", "If you would like to isolate the traffic of the client-facing applications from the backend applications you can modify the docker-compose file by adding two networks \u2014 front-tier and back-tier and mention which service is on which network.", "Note that this is not a complete docker-compose file and I have left out other details for brevity.", "Running this docker-compose file will result in an application stack shown below.", "If there is any docker-compose command that you need to remember \u2014 it is docker-compose up, as we saw with the voting app example. I am also providing a list of other commands as a reference.", "In conclusion, with docker compose you could package and deliver a multi-container application that your clients can spin-up with a single command.", "In the next section, we will see how we can delete various entities of Docker and reclaim some space.", "[2] Mumshad Mannambeth, Docker for the Absolute Beginners (2020), KodeKloud.com", "Your home for data science.
