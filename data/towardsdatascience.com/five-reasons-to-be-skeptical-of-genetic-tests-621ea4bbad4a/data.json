He had been editing the genes of three unborn embryos to eliminate their risk of developing HIV. Fearing the associations with \u201cdesigner babies,\u201d the scientific community swiftly condemned the experiment and the scientists were ultimately sentenced the to jail.", "The experiment was not stopped before it had begun, however, and the children ended up born with the first ever artificial genetic copy and paste performed on real human families. In just the past year, developments in genetics have attracted biotech\u2019s billions, making headway into the great smartphone frontier with hundreds of apps translating complex genetic science into pleasing infographics. In a year when more than one in twenty-five Americans had their DNA analyzed, scientists can now predict genetic risk for over 10,000 diseases and launched the very first projects to edit human DNA for \u201cprecision health\u201d improvement.", "While consumers seemed to have no problem sending off their DNA for a peek at their genetic ancestry, the new line of genetic products has swiftly crossed the line from party gimmick to science-fiction dilemma. Faced with the very real ability to change genetics according to our ideas of \u201cimprovement,\u201d many are worried the rich and powerful will hoard genetic advancement themselves, while others push for an underground culture of \u201cgene-hacking\u201d accessible to garage scientists. Given the chance, Americans prefer to tune out such troubling possibilities, which is especially easy to do when fun \u201cdiscover yourself\u201d pseudoscience can help bridge the gap. This year saw thousands of products launched, offering unique predictions about customers\u2019 inner workings in exchange for a few hundred dollars and the permanent storage of their DNA. Apps were launched to predict your intelligence, strength, and \u201csuperhero\u201d potential, to help you find the right roommate, skincare, and ideal diet (including which marijuana strain), and even to prioritize which sports your unborn child should consider.", "Many scientists contend that the predictions and suggestions made through these apps are based on bad science shortcuts incentivized by the billions of dollars pouring into the industry. But it is also true that even in a world increasingly viewed in STEM terms, we just don\u2019t yet know how exactly genes control human development. Here are the top five reasons why you should be skeptical of your next DNA report:", "Claims about human health are only as valid as the data behind them. Most scientific advice for humans comes by way of correlation rather than causation, which severely limits the predictive abilities one can make about their future health. At the moment, the major DNA data banks lack the requisite size, diversity in human samples, and longitudinal scope to generate consistent conclusions. Currently, each consumer genetic company will give somewhat different predictions for one\u2019s ancestry, risk of certain diseases, and trait prediction. Ancestry analysis doesn\u2019t work by comparing one\u2019s DNA to the historical strands of a \u201cpure Englishman,\u201d for example \u2014 the \u201cEnglish\u201d DNA is instead estimated from those who have lived in a specific region going back multiple generations.", "As a case in point, one of the most widely used genomic databases even in the United States, the UK Biobank, consists of 95% of samples from European Ancestry, making the resulting tests and research significantly less accurate for Asian, African-American, Middle Eastern and Latino populations. As doctors increasingly rely on these \u201crisk scores\u201d while making consequential health recommendations, the databases must be improved.", "Medical scientists and consumer geneticists both use published research that has correlated certain genes with a biological development in the body. The term \u201cpolygenic risk score\u201d was introduced to represent the probability we have of developing some trait, ranging from heart disease to intelligence, based on the presence of a number of genes. This approach relies on reducing the question of human development to one of electrical wiring and computer programming, minimizing the mysterious combination of biological switches that must \u201cturn on\u201d action in the body. DNA is not an active cause of traits and behaviors, but a source of potentials for the organism \u2014 on its own it does nothing until activated by the rest of the system.", "A simplified \u201crisk score\u201d obscures several necessary actions, including products of many unrelated genes that make behavior possible. A tiny alteration along the way could disrupt the normal process despite what the genetic code has written. As science author Ken Richardson writes, \u201cThe genes are crucial, of course, but nearly all genetic variations are dealt with in the way you can vary your journey from A to B: by constructing alternative routes.\u201d", "Human traits and behaviors, including those that have led some to obsessively monitor an ever-expanding dashboard of health metrics, are formed by a delicate combination of genetic potential and environmental feedback. The environmental changes brought about by the Industrial Revolution, for example, spurred much greater change in whole populations faster than genetic shifts could have. Dutch males, now the world\u2019s tallest people, have gained some eight inches in average height over the last 150 years. While there does seem to be some natural selection effects for taller Dutch, environmental factors such as diet and lifestyle have contributed to a much greater extent. In many cases, environmental changes would alter health outcomes much more than genetic potentials, making \u201crisk scores\u201d for education or height, for example, a mere expensive misdirection.", "With millions of data points analyzed under statistical manipulation, there are millions of opportunities for false positives, a problem that plagues fields heavily reliant on \u201cBig Data\u201d methodologies. Large databases can contain many meaningless correlations while statistical significance can be inflated by invalid assumptions.", "One of the most infamous examples comes from a neuroscience experiment looking for various changes in brain activity. The stunt was that scientists decided to include a 4-lb Atlantic Salmon which \u201cwas not alive at the time of scanning.\u201d Ultimately, of the eight thousand sites tested in the expired salmon, sixteen reported a statistically significant response. As automatic computations are increasingly picked up by supercomputers with black-box statistical scripts, such errors will be harder to spot before creating a cascade of misapplications.", "Many human traits and diseases are well defined and mapped by solid medical science. Angelina Jolie famously underwent a preventative mastectomy after discovering her DNA is associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Some of these diseases, such as cancer or schizophrenia have clear and reliable biomarkers, but thousands of others\u2019 origins remain mysterious. For example, while height is thought to be highly genetically determined, currently only ~20% of one\u2019s height can be predicted from genes alone. More complex traits, such as homosexuality, or even social isolation range from just 1\u201311% predictability.", "One of the results celebrated as a victory in genetic prediction is an analysis designed to predict one\u2019s future level of education achievement. Why clans of the highly educated are fixated on reproducing their own genetic material remains an eternal recurrence. However, while genetic profiles were found to be part of future successes, many people with high genetic scores dropped out of high school and many with low scores went on to get PhDs, indicating that, practically, these predictions are hardly better than guessing at random.", "The obvious risk is that we rely on these sleek genetic dashboards that ultimately grade our genetics according to shoddy correlation science. Of course, it is the animal kingdom that suffers the first wave of man\u2019s advancements in science technology. While mice have been subjected to laboratory experiments, the cattle industry has already applied cutting-edge knowledge for years. With aggressive gene selection in place, farmers have ultimately doubled the rate of milk production compared to gains from standard breeding techniques. In these milk producing dairy queens, though, \u201coff-target effects\u201d have begun to disrupt health in other ways: they are less fertile and have weaker immune systems. And imagine how they must feel when they\u2019re told that they can\u2019t get sick \u2014 they\u2019re part of the Super Cow race, borne by Man, without the limits of nature.", "Your home for data science.
