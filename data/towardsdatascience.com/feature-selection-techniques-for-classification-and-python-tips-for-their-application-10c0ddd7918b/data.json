In this article, I review the most common types of feature selection techniques used in practice for classification problems, dividing them into 6 major categories. I provide tips on how to use them in a machine learning project and give examples in Python code whenever possible. Are you ready?", "The main methods are summarised in the table below and discussed in the following sections.", "Two of the biggest problems in Machine Learning are overfitting (fitting aspects of data that are not generalizable outside the dataset) and the curse of dimensionality (the unintuitive and sparse properties of data in high dimensions).", "Feature selection helps to avoid both of these problems by reducing the number of features in the model, trying to optimize the model performance. In doing so, feature selection also provides an extra benefit: Model interpretation. With fewer features, the output model becomes simpler and easier to interpret, and it becomes more likely for a human to trust future predictions made by the model.", "One simple method to reduce the number of features consists of applying a Dimensionality Reduction technique to the data. This is often done in an unsupervised way, i.e., without using the labels themselves.", "Dimensionality reduction does not actually select a subset of features but instead produces a new set of features in a lower dimension space. This new set can be used in the classification process itself.", "The example below uses the features on reduced dimensions to do classification. More precisely, it uses the first 2 components of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) as the new set of features.", "Another use of dimensionality reduction in the context of evaluating features is for visualization: in a lower-dimensional space, it is easier to visually verify if the data is potentially separable, which helps to set expectations on the classification accuracy. In practice, we perform dimensionality reduction (e.g. PCA) over a subset of features and check how the labels are distributed in the reduced space. If they appear to be separate, this is a clear sign that high classification performance is expected when using this set of features.", "In the example below, in a reduced space with 2 dimensions, the different labels are shown to be fairly separable. This signs to the fact that one could expect high performance when training and testing a classifier.", "In addition to that, I also plot the correlation circle, which tells the correlations between each of the original dimension and the new PCA dimensions. Intuitively, this graph tells about how much each original feature contributes to the newly created PCA components. In the example above, petal length and width show high correlation with the first PCA dimension and sepal width highly contributes to the second dimension.", "Filter methods aim at ranking the importance of the features without making use of any type of classification algorithm.", "Univariate filter methods evaluate each feature individually and do not consider feature interactions. These methods consist of providing a score to each feature, often based on statistical tests.", "The scores usually either measure the dependency between the dependent variable and the features (e.g. Chi2 and, for regression, Pearls correlation coefficient), or the difference between the distributions of the features given the class label (F-test and T-test).", "The scores often make assumptions about the statistical properties of the underlying data. Understanding these assumptions is important to decide which test to use, even though some of them are robust to violations of the assumptions.", "Scores based on statistical tests provide a p-value, that may be used to rule out some features. This is done if the p-value is above a certain threshold (typically 0.01 or 0.05).", "The package sklearn implements some filter methods. However, as most of them are based on statistical tests, statistics packages (such asstatsmodels) could also be used.", "Boxplots / Violin plots may help to visualize the distribution of the feature given the class. For the Iris dataset, an example is shown below.", "This is useful in that statistical tests often only evaluate the difference between the mean of such distributions. These plots, therefore, provide more information about the quality of the features", "The ROC curve may be used to rank features in importance order, which gives a visual way to rank features performances.", "This technique is most suitable for binary classification tasks. To apply in problems with multiple classes this, one could use micro or macro averages or multiple comparison based criteria (similarly to the pairwise Tukey\u2019s range test).", "The example below plots the ROC curve of various features.", "These methods take into account the correlations between variables and do so without considering any type of classification algorithm.", "mRMR (minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance) is a heuristic algorithm to find a close to optimal subset of features by considering both the features importances and the correlations between them.", "The idea is that, even if two features are highly relevant, it may not be a good idea to add both of them to the feature set if they are highly correlated. In that case, adding both features would increase the model complexity (increasing the possibility of overfitting) but would not add significant information, due to the correlation between the features.", "In a set S of N features, the relevance of the features (D) is computed as follows:", "where I is the mutual information operator.", "The redundancy of the features is denoted as follows:", "The mRMR score for the set S is defined as (D - R). The goal is to find the subset of features with a maximum value of (D-R). In practice, however, we perform an incremental search (aka forward selection) in which, at each step, we add the feature that yields the greatest mRMR.", "The algorithm is implemented in C by the authors of the algorithm themselves. You can find the source code of the package, as well as the original paper here.", "A (not maintained) python wrapper was created on the name pymrmr. In case of issues with pymrmr, I advise calling the C \u2014 level function directly.", "The code below exemplifies the use of pymrmr . Note that the columns of the pandas data-frame should be formatted as described in the C level package (here).", "The main idea behind a wrapper method is to search which set of features works best for a specific classifier. The methods can be summarised as follows, and differ in regards to the search algorithm used.", "Step three leaves unspecified the type which search method will be used. Testing all possible subsets of features is prohibitive (Brute Force selection) in virtually any situation since it would require performing step 3 an exponential number of times (2 to the power of the number of features). Besides the time complexity, with such a large number of possibilities, it would be likely that a certain combination of features performs best simply by random chance, which makes the brute force solution more prone to overfitting.", "Search algorithms tend to work well in practice to solve this issue. They tend to achieve a performance close to the brute force solution, with much less time complexity and less chance of overfitting.", "Forward selection and Backward selection (aka pruning) are much used in practice, as well as some small variations of their search process.", "Backward selection consists of starting with a model with the full number of features and, at each step, removing the feature without which the model has the highest score. Forward selection goes on the opposite way: it starts with an empty set of features and adds the feature that best improves the current score.", "Forward/Backward selection are still prone to overfitting, as, usually, scores tend to improve by adding more features. One way to avoid such situation is to use scores that penalize the complexity of the model, such as AIC or BIC.", "An illustration of a wrapper method structure is shown below. It is important to note that the feature set is (1) found through a search method and (2) cross-validated on the same classifier it is intended to be used for.", "Step three also leaves open the cross-validation parameters. Usually, a k-fold procedure is used. Using a large k, however, introduces extra complexity to the overall wrapper method.", "mlxtend (http://rasbt.github.io/mlxtend/) is a useful package for diverse data science-related tasks. The wrapper methods on this package can be found on SequentialFeatureSelector. It provides Forward and Backward feature selection with some variations.", "The package also provides a way to visualize the score as a function of the number of features through the function plot_sequential_feature_selection.", "The example below was extracted from the package\u2019s main page.", "Training a classifier boils down to an optimization problem, where we try to minimize a function of its parameters (noted here as \ud835\udf03). This function is known loss function (noted as \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udf03)).", "In a more general framework, we usually want to minimize an objective function that takes into account both the loss function and a penalty (or regularisation)(\u03a9(\ud835\udf03)) to the complexity of the model:", "For linear classifiers (e.g. Linear SVM, Logistic Regression), the loss function is noted as :", "Where each x\u02b2 corresponds to one data sample and W\u1d40x\u02b2 denotes the inner product of the coefficient vector (w\u2081,w\u2082,\u2026w_n) with the features in each sample.", "For Linear SVM and Logistic Regression the hinge and logistic losses are, respectively:", "The two most common penalties for linear classifiers are the L-1 and L-2 penalties:", "The higher the value of \u03bb, the stronger the penalty and the optimal objective function will tend to end up in shrinking more and more the coefficients w_i.", "The \u201cL1\u201d penalty is known to create sparse models, which simply means that, it tends to select some features out of the model by making some of the coefficients equal zero during the optimization process.", "Another common penalty is L-2. While L-2 shrinks the coefficients and therefore helps avoid overfitting, it does not create sparse models, so it is not suitable as a feature selection technique.", "For some linear classifiers (Linear SVM, Logistic Regression), the L-1 penalty can be efficiently used, meaning that there are efficient numerical methods to optimize the resulting objective function. The same is not true for several other classifiers (various Kernel SVM methods, Decision Trees,\u2026). Therefore, different regularisation methods should be used for different classifiers.", "An example of Logistic regression with regularisation is shown below, and we can see that the algorithms rule out some of the features as C decreases (think if C as 1/\u03bb).", "Another common feature selection technique consists in extracting a feature importance rank from tree base models.", "The feature importances are essentially the mean of the individual trees\u2019 improvement in the splitting criterion produced by each variable. In other words, it is how much the score (so-called \u201cimpurity\u201d on the decision tree notation) was improved when splitting the tree using that specific variable.", "They can be used to rank features and then select a subset of them. However, the feature importances should be used with care, as they suffer from biases and, and presents an unexpected behavior regarding highly correlated features regardless of how strong they are.", "As shown in this paper, random forest feature importances are biased towards features with more categories. Besides, if two features are highly correlated, both of their scores largely decrease, regardless of the quality of the features.", "Below is an example of how to extract the feature importances from a random forest. Although a regressor, the process would be the same for a classifier.", "As explained above, the \u201cimpurity\u201d is a score used by the decision tree algorithm when deciding to split a node. There are many decision tree algorithms (IDR3, C4.5, CART,\u2026), but the general rule is that the variable with which we split a node in the tree is the one that generates the highest improvement on the impurity.", "The most common impurities are the Gini Impurity and Entropy. An improvement on the Gini impurity is known as \u201cGini importance\u201d while An improvement on the Entropy is the Information Gain.", "(Thanks to Henrique Gasparini Fiuza do Nascimento for the suggestion!)", "SHAP is actually much more than just that. It is an algorithm to provide model explanation out of any predictive model. For tree based models, however, it is specially useful: the authors developed a high speed and exact (not only local) explanation for such models, compatible with XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost, and scikit-learn tree models.", "I encourage checking out the explanation capabilities provided by SHAP (such as Feature dependance, interaction effects, model monitoring\u2026). Below, I plot (only) the feature importances output by SHAP, which are more reliable than those output by the original tree model when ranking them for feature selection. This example was extracted from their github page.", "Embedded methods are usually very efficient to avoid overfitting and select useful variables. They are also time efficient as they are embedded on the objective function. Their main downside is that they may not be available to the desired classifier.", "Wrapper methods tend to work very well in practice. However, they are computationally expensive, specially when dealing hundreds of features. But if you have the computational resources, they are an excellent way to go.", "If the feature set is very large (on the order of hundreds or thousands), because filter methods are fast, they can work well as a first stage of selection, to rule out some variables. Subsequently another method can be applied to the already reduced feature set. This is particular useful if you want to create combinations of features, multiplying or dividing them, for example.", "An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection", "Bias in random forest
