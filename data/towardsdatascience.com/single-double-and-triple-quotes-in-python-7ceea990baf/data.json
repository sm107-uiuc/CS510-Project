However, not all of us know that there is certain usage involving triple quotes too.", "This brief article reviews the usage of single, double, and triple quotes in Python.", "The most common use of single and double quotes is to represent strings by enclosing a series of characters. As shown in the code below, we create these two strings using single and double quotes, respectively.", "As you notice, the strings created by using single and double quotes are the same. In other words, we can use single and double quotes interchangeably when we declare a string. However, it should be noted that we don\u2019t want to mix them as it\u2019s a syntactical error.", "Like other programming languages, when a string contains special characters like quotes, we need to escape them. An example of failing to escape is shown below.", "How can we fix this error? One is to escape the single quote by placing a backslash before it. The other is to use double quotes instead of single quotes as the enclosing quotes. Both ways are shown below.", "Similarly, if the string contains double quotes, we can use single quotes to represent the string such that we don\u2019t have to escape the double quotes. An example is given below.", "However, if there are both single and double quotes in the string, it\u2019s a syntactical error if you don\u2019t escape the quotes that are the same as the enclosing ones used by the entire string.", "As mentioned at the end of the above section, we need to escape single or double quotes depending on what enclosing quotes the string uses. Actually, we can use triple quotes (i.e., triplet of single quotes or triplet double quotes) to represent the strings containing both single and double quotes to eliminate the need of escaping any.", "It should be noted that when a string starts or ends with a single or double quote and we want to use the triple quotes for the string, we need to use the ones that differ from the starting or ending one. For example, for the string in the above code snippet, using triple double quotes would result in a syntactical error. In this case, we want to use the triple single quotes as above.", "Another use case of the triple quotes is to represent a multi-line string. An example is given below. You can use either triple single or double quotes in this case.", "Although we can achieve the same effect by using the \\n symbols to create multi-line strings as below, using the \\n symbols makes the string harder to read. By contrast, using triple quotes can write the string in the way how it exactly looks like, and thus it has better readability.", "In addition, a useful application of the triple-quote enclosed strings is to specify some comments in a multi-line string, for example, as part of a function definition like below.", "We can clearly tell what are the comments for the function.", "This article reviewed the common usage of single, double, and triple quotes in Python. Here\u2019s a quick summary of these use cases.", "Thanks for reading this article, and happy coding in Python.", "Your home for data science.
