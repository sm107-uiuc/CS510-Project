Question answering is one particular discipline that aims at building systems that automatically answer questions posed that can be answered from information in text. The goal is to answer a full range of questions (facts, lists, definitions, etc.) by returning a corresponding section of text. As you could imagine, having a model that analyzes the semantics of both the question and text is fairly complex. Recent developments language modeling (like BERT) have helped make tasks like this much more accurate and robust.", "One broader paradigm to understand when looking at question answering systems is open-domain vs. closed-domain. As the names imply, open-domain seeks to handle any question and closed-domain focuses on one particular field. Think of the difference of information on Wikipedia, which covers everything, versus Wookiepedia, which is just all of Star Wars. Each has their own utility, it just depends on what your goals are.", "So question answering systems sound pretty amazing, but do note like many other NLP areas, it is still growing and does have shortcomings. I won\u2019t elaborate much here, but if you are interested I encourage reading the article Survey on Challenges of Question Answering in the Semantic Web. It gives a good overview of some challenges these systems still face.", "Creating and supporting a question answering system can be some serious work, so it is important to take a moment to think through why to create them in the first place. One of the most practical uses is to create a chatbot. I know, I know, they are not everyone\u2019s favorite mechanical helper. They do have the potential though to help customers or handle domain-specific questions that would otherwise require people to, as many fear, actually read something.", "You can think of any number of scenarios where you have some information in text form and are hoping to make it easily searchable, so let\u2019s try out an idea. Naturally, my brain goes to the most practical of uses, board game rules!", "I play games often and occasionally dip into some of the more complex strategy games. The problem sometimes with games like this is all the work that goes into actually knowing how to play them. It is really easy to forget the complexities of different rules, the number of cards dealt, or how to know when the game is even ended. There is one other personal pet peeve which is when you want to make a strategic move, but want to make sure it\u2019s legal, so you have to look it up and give that window where others might try to determine what you are up to.", "What if you had a tool where anyone could just ask a question and find the particular rule without having to dig through the text manually? Sounds like a case for a question answering system!", "To do so, we are going to use a Python package called cdQa. It has a robust set of features to build, annotate, and query your own closed-domain question answering system. To start, you import cdQa and a few different tools:", "pdf_converter : extract the text from pdfs (this particular converter takes a folder). In this example, I have a folder of rulebook pdfs for a handful of games called \u201crules\u201d and would implement as follows:", "filter_paragraphs : narrow down to just paragraphs found in our text (looks for a certain length or other parameters in the text essentially). To use, you give it the entire dataframe created:", "download_model : get a pre-trained model. The model we are going to use is a pre-trained BERT model, fine-tuned on SQuAD 1.1, a reading comprehension dataset that is often used to test and benchmark how well a question answering system is performing. To download an store in a folder called \u201cmodels\u201d:", "QAPipeline : create our QA system. This will fit the pipeline on your corpus using the pre-trained model.", "Awesome! we now ready to test our our QA system. To ask and see our results, we use our pipeline instance\u2019s predict method that returns a tuple with the answer, title of document found in, paragraph, and score. Here is an example of a search:", "That looks pretty good! For my further implementation, I actually prefer just returning the paragraph, since with certain rules it is helpful to have that additional context. cdQa has some other really nice features, like being able to manually annotate text and easily exporting your pipeline for use on a website, so I encourage exploring it further.", "I am going to keep working on this myself, but to check out the code shown here and see it demonstrated you can visit my GitHub page here.", "Your home for data science.
