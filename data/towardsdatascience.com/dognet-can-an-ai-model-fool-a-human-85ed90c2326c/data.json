The reason for choosing dogs\u2026 was because dogs are awesome!", "In our current climate, we often hear the term \u2018fake news\u2019, and with ML models becoming more advanced, their ability to create non-human content is only getting better. I therefore thought it was appropriate to give people the chance to test how good they were at spotting \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018fake\u2019 images. The ML model built to create these images was appropriately called DOGNET and comes from a branch of models called GANs (Generative Adversarial Networks).", "Even though DOGNET is mostly a bit of fun, there are real world applications for GANs: they have the ability to generate new content, enhance images, fill in missing content, or even detect entities in medical imaging.", "In a GAN, two Neural Networks compete against each other; let\u2019s call them a Generator and a Discriminator. A good analogy for the Generator is to think of it as a counterfeiter, trying to make fake money. The job of the Discriminator is to act as a policeman, trying to spot the fraud and determine whether the money is counterfeit or real.", "The aim of a GAN, specifically our Generator, is to maximise its ability to create something fake that the Discriminator will classify as real. To make this happen, the Discriminator will be given either the example from the Generator or a real example, and it has to decide whether what it has been presented is \u2018real\u2019 or \u2018fake\u2019.", "The Generator is penalised if it fails to produce an image fake enough, and the same happens to the Discriminator when it says a real example is a fake. It is important to keep the training of both Neural Networks balanced: having a Discriminator that is too good at spotting fakes will prevent the Generator from learning, and vice versa.", "The DOGNET model is a deep convolutional (DC) GAN built using TensorFlow. It was trained for 120,000 iterations using an ml.p2.xlarge GPU instance on AWS SageMaker. The training dataset consisted of 300 Golden Retriever images, with diversity in dog colour, head position, mouth position, and environment. As the model trains, we can view what the Generator component is producing as it learns to create images of dogs:", "Along the way, the model doesn\u2019t always get things right. Here are a couple of my favourite attempts it produced:", "Once the model was generating what I thought were decent images of Golden Retrievers, I wanted to test if people could distinguish those produced by the model from actual examples in the training data. To do this, I put together a short survey, which was filled in by colleagues, family, friends, and other professionals in the Data Science community, and collected a total of 104 survey responses.", "A summary of this data is presented in the following table, where respondents had to first identify the \u2018real\u2019 image from a selection of four and subsequently identify the \u2018fake\u2019 image from a selection of four (correct answers are in green).", "The results highlight that this wasn\u2019t an easy task: only 24.0% of respondents correctly answered Q1, and 29.8% correctly answered Q2 , with only 12.5% being right across both questions.", "Applying binomial tests showed that for both questions, there was no significant difference greater than the expected 25%(Q1 p=0.63 [1 sided]; Q2 p=0.15 [1 sided]). In other words, the participants were no better than someone picking at random at selecting the correct images.", "For Q1, there was not much difference in the correct response rates: of those who were not dog owners, 22% answered correctly, and of those who were dog owners, 26% answered correctly. For Q2, 22% of non-dog owners guessed correctly compared to 38% of dog owners. Despite this increase in accuracy, a chi-square test showed the relationship between these variables to be non-significant (\u03c72 [2, N = 104] = 3.08, p=0.08). In other words, owning a dog did not statistically increase your chances of identifying the \u2018fake\u2019 images produced by DOGNET.", "Whilst DOGNET is designed to be a fun experiment, it did reveal that the outputs it produced were indistinguishable for us to pick out when put alongside real dog images. The resolution of these images is obviously low compared to typical photographs, yet it does raise an interesting question: as these models continue to advance, will we still be able to distinguish \u2018fact\u2019 from \u2018fiction\u2019 in our online content?", "I\u2019ll leave you with a final picture of my dog, Wesley, and I can tell you with some certainty that he\u2019s real :D", "Your home for data science.
