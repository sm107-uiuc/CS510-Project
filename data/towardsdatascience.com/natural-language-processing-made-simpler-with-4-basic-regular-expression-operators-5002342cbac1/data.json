However, before we can start constructing our models, we are encountered with a mostly boring but major issue.", "Immediately after the data collection, and exploratory data analysis step, we have to tackle the boring pre-processing step. Obviously, most of the data available to us does not come clean, and we have to work on it to improve the quality of the dataset to receive a more effective result from the built model.", "Today, we will look at how regular expressions with four of its built-in functions is the best solution. Regular expressions is a standard library module built-in and can be used for cleansing and pre-processing the data. The simple command below can be used to import the regular expression module.", "Before we begin, let us understand the regex or regular expressions module and some of the basic knowledge we need to have to understand the further concepts more intuitively.", "Regular expressions are strings with a syntax that allows them to deal with patterns in other forms of text data. The re module is used for the parsing text data purpose, and no additional installation for the same is required.", "The list of common patterns provided by the regular expressions documentation is humungous. I will provide a more shortened form required for the cleansing of data. These are the only ones I have used. I would have used others way lesser.", "So, some of the common patterns which are used for matching text data which I find is the most useful compared to the other operations are as follows:", "To learn more about each of these common patterns and how they can be matched to detect more patterns and styles, then please visit the official site from here.", "In this section, we will be discussing the four regex methods that can be used to solve most of the common problems of data cleansing and data pre-processing. Regex functions are used along with the regex patterns to perform a specific operation on the text data we have.", "Let us analyze how to use this module now in more detail with the following text sample and how exactly the re module can be used to perform the various operations required for appropriate processing and parsing of the text data. I just made up a random text sample with some random irregular sentences. You can use the same sentence as me or make up your own random sentence and follow along.", "The text sample is as shown below:", "The functions that we will be using for the purpose of data pre-processing are the following four basic regular expressions operations \u2014", "Using the four above functions almost any natural language task and data pre-processing of text data can be done. So, without further ado, let us start analyzing each of these functions and how they can be utilized.", "The above method returns a list of all matches. If no match is found then an empty list is returned.", "Let us try to find out all the words that begin with a capital letter. The code block below can be used for the following process \u2014", "This should give us the following output [\u2018Machine\u2019, \u2018Learning\u2019, \u2018Deep\u2019, \u2018Artificial\u2019, \u2018Intelligence\u2019].", "If you want to find out how many full stops or periods are there in the text data you can use either of the two commands \u2014", "Both of the above commands should give the result as 2 since we have a total of two periods. The backlash \u2018\\\u2019 command is used a breaker to find only period and not perform another regex operation.", "This function can be used to split the text accordingly and whenever there is a match a list of data is returned. Otherwise an empty list is returned.", "Let us perform a split operation to get a bunch of sentences that are separated by periods. The following command below will be this operation.", "This operation will return the following list of sentences.", "If you want to split with both periods and question marks then follow the below command.", "The following function performs a substitution operation when a match is found. If no match is found then the pattern is left unchanged.", "If you want to substitute all the periods and question marks with explanations, then you can make use of the below command \u2014", "The first position in the function takes the items you want to replace. The second position is where you specify what to replace the selections with. The final and third position is where the sentence or the text data on which the replacement operation is to be performed.", "After performing the above operation the below sentence is what you should receive.", "The function finds the first match of a particular word or punctuation or selected item and returns the operation accordingly. If no match is found, then a none type value is returned.", "If I want to find the position of the starting and ending characters of the word \u201cfun.\u201d in the text, then I can run the below command.", "The above code block will return an output of 20 and 24. This result tells us that the position of \u2018f\u2019 is 20 and position of \u2018.\u2019 is 24. There are a lot more operations you can try out with this function which I would highly recommend.", "With this, we have reached the end of the major operations for regular operations. Keep experimenting with this module to learn more about the more intricate details related to this topic.", "In this article, we have covered most of the important patterns that are required for the pre-processing of most of the datasets found for machine learning. We can also use the knowledge learned from this post for web scraping as well as other activities that requires the cleaning of the data. Using the regular expressions module in python simplifies this boring process to a lesser extent.", "Making use of all the provided patterns and the four specific functions should usually be sufficient to perform almost any pre-processing operation but feel free to check out more of these operations from the regular expressions official website from here.", "Check out some of my other articles that you might enjoy reading as well.", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope all of you enjoyed reading this article. I wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science.
