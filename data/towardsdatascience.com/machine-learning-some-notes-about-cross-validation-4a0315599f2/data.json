This way is called cross-validation. Cross-validation is a statistical technique of evaluating generalization performance that is more stable than using a split into a training and a test set.", "In this article, we will take a look at some cross-validation methods like the k-fold cross-validation, stratified K fold cross-validation and the leave-one-out cross-validation.", "K-fold cross-validation is one of the most used cross-validation methods. In this method, k represents the number of experiments(or fold) that I want to try in order to test and train my data.", "For example, suppose that we want to make 5 experiments(or performance) with our data composed of 1000 records. So during the first experiment, we test or validate the first 200 records and then we train the remaining 800 records. When the first experiment is finished I obtain a certain accuracy. Then we make a second experiment where we test the 200 records that follow the previous records that I have tested and we train the remain 800 records.", "I continue the experiment with a group of 200 records until I complete all the 5 experiments. Remember that we test always the next 200 records of the previous ones and train the remains records until the end.", "At the end of my 5 experiments, I will obtain 5 accuracies and the final accuracy will be the mean of all accuracies.", "Below you can see a visual example.", "Cross-validation is implemented in scikit-learn using the cross_val_score function from the model_selecion module. The parameters of the cross_val_score functions are the model we want to evaluate, the training data, and the target. Below an example with Logistic Regression:", "Part II: Stratified K fold cross-validation", "By considering the previous example of 1000 records, sometimes starting with a test of the first 200 records might not always a good idea. In fact, in a dataset, we could find that the first third of the data refer to the same class.", "Imagine we have three classes (0,1 and 2) as you can see below:", "As you can see, the first third class is 0, the second 1 and the third is 2. Now imagine to make 3 experiments (k=3). In our first experiment, The test set would be only in class 0, and the training set would be only classes 1 and 2. So, you can recognize that the accuracy will be 0.", "To deal with this problem we can use the stratified k-fold cross-validation. In stratified cross-validation, we split the data such that the proportions between classes are the same in each fold as they are in the whole dataset, as you can observe in the following image. In the image there is a comparison between the k-fold cross-validation and the stratified cross-validation:", "Scikit-learn helps us with StratifiedkFold. So:", "Another interesting cross-validation method is leave-one-out. This method is similar to the k-fold that we have seen previously but for each experiment(or performance) we take only one sample for testing and not 200 records as before.", "Below, we can find the implementation in scikit-learn with LeaveOneOut.", "In this article, you have seen the most common cross-validation methods that are used in machine learning to evaluate the accuracy of a model. Anyway, there are some other methods like shuffle-split cross-validation, the cross-validation with groups and the cross-validation for time series that are very useful in some situation.", "Thanks for reading this.
