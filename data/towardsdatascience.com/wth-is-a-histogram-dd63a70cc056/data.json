Each bar represents how many days fell into the specified 5 degree temperature buckets.", "We can see from this that London\u2019s weather is pretty evenly distributed, which follows it\u2019s reputation for being very mild.", "If we compare this to the same data from Miami, we can learn even more:", "Looking at a histogram, it can be easy to identify the points that don\u2019t seem to fit with the others. These are often referred to as outliers, and, if not treated carefully, can heavily impact your analysis and results.", "In this example, we\u2019re using data from Zillow on the median listing price of houses across ~700 metro areas in the US in 2019 only.", "Each bar represents how many metro areas had a median housing price in the specified range.

(I hope you said Miami :) )", "The main benefit (IMO) is that histograms are such a rich source of context. By more intimately understanding the data, your intuition about the world is improved.", "If you stumble upon a house in Santa Cruz selling for $200, you should get a funny sense about that now.
