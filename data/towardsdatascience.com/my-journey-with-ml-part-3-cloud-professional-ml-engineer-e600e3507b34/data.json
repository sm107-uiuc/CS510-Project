These services provide clients (independent users and organizations) with access to a robust infrastructure, serverless tools, and enterprise-grade software, with minimal overhead time in installation and management. GCP provides competition to Microsoft\u2019s Azure and Amazon\u2019s AWS platforms.", "While GCP has a ton of functionality that may power many different industrial applications, the use-case we are concerned with is Artificial Intelligence. As such, we will look at the AI-related tools offered by the platform in this article.", "Furthermore, Google Cloud provides various certification paths for developers, engineers, and architects to showcase their prowess with building on the cloud. In August, Google released the Cloud Professional Machine Learning Engineer (PMLE) exam, in beta mode, that I took and successfully cleared. As of October 15th, 2020, the exam is no longer in beta; i.e., it is available to everyone. This article will cover preparing for the exam, the costs associated with training and certification, and the pros and cons of getting certified.", "While one may showcase their skills with TensorFlow in the form of projects, it is nearly impossible to demonstrate the same competence when working with the cloud; after all, how does one demonstrate their ability to use a tool? Therefore, I strongly urge you to consider taking this exam, even if you may not have wanted to take the TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam.", "According to Google, only 5% of a production ML system consists of the ML code. Building and training a model is essential, but there is a multitude of other processes that make up an ML pipeline. These may include but are not limited to Data Collection, Data Verification, Feature Extraction, Model Validation, Model Deployment, and Model Automation.", "If you\u2019ve followed along with the series so far, you will now realize that there is a lot more to ML than building a Keras model and training it on your laptop.", "This is the difference between being an ML Developer and an ML Engineer.", "You cannot call yourself an ML Engineer until you are thorough with every stage in the ML pipeline, not just the model building. These skills matter because there\u2019s no use in having a trained Keras model on your laptop if nobody can do anything with it.", "So what tools does GCP offer to alleviate these concerns? Let\u2019s take a look at some of them below, particularly from the perspective of an ML Engineer:", "GCP also provides solutions that let you work with AI without requiring you to write any code. These allow you to effortlessly create ML systems, which are quite powerful but may not have the custom functionality you need.", "One of the best things about GCP is how well unified the entire ecosystem is. Every service works beautifully with the others, thereby allowing you to easily string a chain of services together when building a pipeline.", "The details of the exam are entirely confidential. The content below is not to hint at what\u2019s coming in the exam but to guide you towards learning the material you need to succeed as an ML Engineer. This so happens to be what the exam is testing you on.", "Please note that I am in no way sponsored by or affiliated with anyone; everything I recommend here is from my research and experience. Also, I am in no way responsible for your performance in the exam, and following the steps below is at your own risk.", "According to the PMLE page, the exam\u2019s recommended training is the GCP Big Data and Machine Learning Fundamentals course from Coursera, the Machine Learning with TensorFlow on GCP Specialization from Coursera, and the Advanced Machine Learning with TensorFlow on GCP Specialization from Coursera.", "At the time of this writing, portions of the above courses are outdated. These Specializations were initially released in 2018, and a lot has changed since then. If my observations are correct, they will be revamped in the coming months/years. Until then, here\u2019s what you need to know:", "If you want the Course and Specialization Certificates from Coursera, however, you cannot skip anything.", "You get a certificate that proves your competence at using Google Cloud products to build effective ML solutions.", "You also get added to the Google Cloud Credential Holder Directory.", "You can read about all the other benefits here and here.", "Please, however, note that the certificate, by itself, may not be enough to help you stand out; projects, internships, and work experience are for that. Furthermore, the credential expires within two years of your receiving it, and you will have to pay and recertify to retain the title. Is it worth it? You now have what you need to decide. Do note that Microsoft\u2019s Azure and Amazon\u2019s AWS platforms also offer similar certification exams.", "In the next and final part of this series, we will take a look at why AI is so important, how to make a difference with it, and how it can get frustrating at times.", "\u25c0 Part I: A Humble Beginning With AI", "\u25c0 Part II: The TensorFlow Developer Certificate", "Part III: Cloud Professional ML Engineer", "Part IV: The Machine Learning Journey \u25b6", "If you liked what you read, please share this piece.
