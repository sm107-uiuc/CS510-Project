Atmospheric pressure varies with both weather and altitude.", "The definition of atmospheric pressure is a force that the air around you is exerting on everything. The weight of the gasses in the atmosphere creates atmospheric pressure. A common unit of pressure is \u201cpounds per square inch\u201d or psi. We will use here the international notation, that is newtons per square meter, which are called pascals (Pa).", "If you took 1 cm wide column of air would weigh about 1 kg", "This weight, pressing down on the footprint of that column, creates the atmospheric pressure that we can measure with sensors like the BMP180. Because that cm-wide column of air weighs about 1Kg, it follows that the average sea level pressure is about 101325 pascals, or better, 1013.25 hPa (1 hPa is also known as milibar \u2014 mbar). This will drop by about 4% for every 300 meters you ascend. The higher you get, the less pressure you\u2019ll see, because the column to the top of the atmosphere is that much shorter and therefore weighs less. This is useful to know because by measuring the pressure and doing some math, you can determine your altitude.", "The air pressure at 3, 810 meters is only half of that at sea level.", "The BMP180 outputs absolute pressure in pascals (Pa). One pascal is a very small amount of pressure, approximately the amount that a sheet of paper will exert resting on a table. You will more often see measurements in hectopascals (1 hPa = 100 Pa). The library used here provides outputs floating-point values in hPa, which also happens to equal one millibar (mbar).", "Here are some conversions to other pressure units:", "Because temperature affects the density of a gas, and density affects the mass of a gas, and mass affects the pressure (whew), atmospheric pressure will change dramatically with temperature. Pilots know this as \u201cdensity altitude\u201d, which makes it easier to take off on a cold day than a hot one because the air is denser and has a greater aerodynamic effect. To compensate for temperature, the BMP180 includes a rather good temperature sensor as well as a pressure sensor.", "To perform a pressure reading, you first take a temperature reading, then combine that with a raw pressure reading to come up with a final temperature-compensated pressure measurement. (The library makes all of this very easy.)", "If your application requires measuring absolute pressure, all you have to do is get a temperature reading, then perform a pressure reading (see the example sketch for details). The final pressure reading will be in hPa = mbar. If you wish, you can convert this to a different unit using the above conversion factors.", "Note that the absolute pressure of the atmosphere will vary with both your altitude and the current weather patterns, both of which are useful things to measure.", "The atmospheric pressure at any given location on earth (or anywhere with an atmosphere) isn\u2019t constant. The complex interaction between the earth\u2019s spin, axis tilt, and many other factors result in moving areas of higher and lower pressure, which in turn cause the variations in weather we see every day. By watching for changes in pressure, you can predict short-term changes in the weather. For example, dropping pressure usually means wet weather or a storm is approaching (a low-pressure system is moving in). Rising pressure usually means that clear weather is approaching (a high-pressure system is moving through). But remember that atmospheric pressure also varies with altitude. The absolute pressure in my house, Lo Barnechea in Chile (altitude 950m) will always be lower than the absolute pressure in San Francisco for example (less than 2 meters, almost sea level). If weather stations just reported their absolute pressure, it would be difficult to directly compare pressure measurements from one location to another (and large-scale weather predictions depend on measurements from as many stations as possible).", "To solve this problem, weather stations always remove the effects of altitude from their reported pressure readings by mathematically adding the equivalent fixed pressure to make it appear as if the reading was taken at sea level. When you do this, a higher reading in San Francisco than Lo Barnechea will always be because of weather patterns, and not because of altitude.", "To do this, there is a function in the library called sea level(P, A). This takes the absolute pressure (P) in hPa, and the station\u2019s current altitude (A) in meters, and removes the effects of the altitude from the pressure. You can use the output of this function to directly compare your weather readings to other stations around the world.", "Since pressure varies with altitude, you can use a pressure sensor to measure altitude (with a few caveats). The average pressure of the atmosphere at sea level is 1013.25 hPa (or mbar). This drops off to zero as you climb towards the vacuum of space. Because the curve of this drop-off is well understood, you can compute the altitude difference between two pressure measurements (p and p0) by using a specific equation.", "If you use sea level pressure (1013.25 hPa) as the baseline pressure (p0), the output of the equation will be your current altitude above sea level. There\u2019s a function in the library called altitude(P, P0) that lets you get the \u201ccalculated altitude\u201d.", "The above explanation was extracted from BMP 180 Sparkfun tutorial.", "As we could learn on the previous step, it is important to have on hand the Sea Level pressure, that is calculated once we have the real altitude where we are measuring the absolute pressure. The below function will help us with that:", "On my case, I have the BMP180 installed on a real measured altitude of 957 meters, so we can have the following updated data from sensors:", "On the next step, we will discuss how to get UV data from a very simple, but good analog sensor. The problem here is that the Raspberry Pi does not have analog input pins as an Arduino or NodeMCU, but we can overcome this problem by using an analog to digital (A/D) converter which will help in interfacing the analog sensors with the Raspberry Pi. The A/D converter that we will use on this project is the popular MCP3008.", "MCP3008 is a 10bit 8-channel ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) which use the SPI bus protocol for interfacing with Raspberry Pi. It is cheap and doesn\u2019t require any additional components with it. It gives you 8 analog inputs and it uses just four GPIOs of Raspberry Pi, plus power and ground pins. MCP3008 output will be a range from 0\u20131,023 where 0 means 0V and 1,023 means 3.3V.", "The pin\u2019s numbering of the MCP3008 starts from the top/left (Pin 1: CH0), having the half circle on top as you can see in the above pinout diagram. MCP3008 ADC has a total of 16 pins out of which 8 pins are for taking the analog input. The analog input pins are from CH0-CH7 (Pins 1\u20138). On the other side (pins 9\u201316), we have different functions as follows:", "On this project, we will use Channel 0 (Pin 1) as the analog input.", "The Raspberry Pi is equipped with one SPI bus that has 2 chip selects. The SPI master driver is disabled by default on Raspbian. To enable it, use raspi-config to confirm that SPI bus is enabled (the same procedure that was done before with 1-Wire).", "As a start, import spidev, a Linux driver to access the SPI bus:", "And open and configure the bus:", "From there, you can access any of the analog channels of our ADC. For testing write the below function:", "This UV sensor generates an analog output proportional to Ultra-Violet radiation found on the light-sensing spectrum. It uses a UV photodiode (based on Gallium Nitride), which can detect the 240\u2013370nm range of light (which covers UVB and most of UVA spectrum). The signal level from the photodiode is very small, in the nano-ampere level, so the module has embedded an operational amplifier to amplify the signal to a more readable volt-level (0 to 1V).", "The sensor and op-amp can be powered, by connecting VCC to 3.3VDC and GND to power ground. The analog signal can be gotten from the OUT pin. Its output will be in millivolts and will be read by Analog Input (CH0) of ADC connected to our RPi.", "Using the same code shown in the last step, we can see the \u201craw data\u201d generated by our UV sensor (in this case \u201c43\u201d):", "Having the raw sensor data, we should \u201cconvert\u201d (or \u201c map\u201d) it for values to be better handled by the code.

What we will do is consider a range, having the Vout shown at the above table as the start point, with a range of 110mV. For example, UV measurements between 227mV and 337mv will be considered Index 1.", "So, for the previous measurement (128mV), the index should be 0.", "At this point, we have all the sensors installed and tested.
