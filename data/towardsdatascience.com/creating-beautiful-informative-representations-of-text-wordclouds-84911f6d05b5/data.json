In reality, they can be elegant and creative communication methods of text, both as exploratory analysis but also in presentation. Additionally, they\u2019re very easy to create in Python \u2014so let\u2019s get into it!", "Let\u2019s copy-paste the content from this COVID-19 article and paste it into a text file named covid_article.txt. The content of this text file will be stored into a variable named content.", "In order to make sure one word the same as another, we need to remove punctuation and capitalization, such that \u2018hello\u2019 is the same as \u2018Hello\u2019, which is the same as \u2018hello!\u2019. We will also need to make sure that the characters are all alphabetic \u2014 we can accomplish this with list comprehension (alternatively with regular expressions).", "There are noticeably some small things that need to be fixed, but generally this is just a string of words and we\u2019ll go ahead for now. We\u2019ll need to import the wordcloud module (install using pip install wordcloud) and the matplotlib library to display the image.", "We can construct a wordcloud with simple parameters using WordCloud. Three parameters are used \u2014 max_font_size, which indicates the maximum size of a word; max_words, which is the maximum number of words displayed; and background_color, which sets the color of the background. Matplotlib can be used to set the figure size, to display the wordcloud, and to not display the axes.", "It doesn\u2019t look great, but it has lots of information we would expect to see, with each word\u2019s size determined by the number of times it occurs in the text. Note that so-called \u2018stop-words\u2019, or common words like \u2018a\u2019, \u2018I\u2019, or \u2018and\u2019 are excluded from the wordcloud by default. You can write additional filters to remove other words.", "Let\u2019s try to change the color. We need to create a function, color_func(), which returns a HSL color, which is another method of representing a color (next to RGB). This one returns a random color somewhere between gray and red.", "You can get familiar with HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) here. For reference, this is the value of hsl(0,50,50).", "To apply the color function, use the following code to convert the wordcloud into an array and apply the recoloring functions.", "Alternatively, we can redefine the color_func function to take in a word parameter and check if it is in a list of the most common words, top_words. In this case, top_words is a collection of all words in the text that occur more than twenty times. If the word is a top word, a random red value is returned. Otherwise, the word is colored as gray-black.", "Let\u2019s make this word cloud in the shape of a virus. First, we\u2019ll need to find an image of the virus \u2014 you can find this on any search engine. Ideally, the image will have a white background to create a \u2018mask\u2019.", "The mask needs to be read through PIL (Python Imaging Library) and converted into an array through NumPy. We\u2019ll need to import these.", "Once the mask has been created, it can be used in the WordCloud with the inclusion of a parameter mask=mask. This example also uses coloring functions from the example above.", "Nice! Wordcloud does most of the heavy lifting for us in adapting to the mask. With our particular image, larger words are pushed towards the center and smaller ones pushed to the outside, which provides a nice hierarchy-style visualization.", "Alternatively, we can change the background to \u2018black\u2019 and the color of the text to gray-white for an alternative visualization.", "Images created by author unless otherwise stated.", "Your home for data science.
