The motivating question was \u2014", "Can you predict a person\u2019s gender from his or her name?", "Strangely simple isn\u2019t it? Yet, it is not as easy as it seems. Cultural and linguistic differences make the task difficult.", "And that motivated me to build a bare bones machine learning model and see if it could predict a person\u2019s gender any better than me.", "The entire code can be found on my GitHub repository.", "So where can a machine get a ton of life experience? Through historic, meticulously collated data of course! One such source is the catalogue of baby names in the US, available at data.gov.", "This data is freely available and published by the Social Security Administration. It contains first names and their frequency of occurrence in Social Security Card applications in each State since 1919 and up to 2018.", "I downloaded this data and it is a collection of text files for each state. Each text file contains all the first names which have occurred at least 5 times in a given year. I cleaned up the data a little and the final concatenated dataset takes up nearly 320 MB of memory!", "(Note: The gender assigned here against each name is as per the data present in the text file. A helpful README file is also present in the downloadable zip file and it explains certain features about the dataset)", "I wanted to explore the data a little and visualise some summary stats.", "There are certain names which are favoured by parents every year and a wordcloud helps to visually represent this phenomenon.", "As an example, girls have been popularly named as Elizabeth or Katherine or Margaret (to name a few) while James or William or John have been popular names for boys. Apart from common names, it is also interesting to know a little bit about the uncommon names.", "Some really interesting and uncommon names for girls have been Baelyn, Selda and Demani, while for boys, it has been Rodarius, Jamaul and Kelvon!", "The top 5 names for 2018 were Emma, Olivia, Ava, Isabella and Sophia among girls. Liam, Noah, William, James and Oliver were top ranked boys names.", "To know the past popularity of these names, I plotted the time series of each of the top 5 names of 2018. It is interesting to see that Emma and Olivia have been historically popular names for girls, while Ava, Isabell and Sophia gained popularity after the 1980s.", "A similar trend is also observable among boys names. James and William have been consistently popular over the years and ranked in the top 10 names. Liam, Noah and Oliver have become increasingly popular after 1980.", "I also wanted to visualise the State-wise popularity of the top 10 ranked names of 2018 and an easy way is to create a choropleth of the ranks.", "(This also gave me chance to play with Imageio, a simple library to create gifs. This post by Yong Cui, Ph.D. was really helpful)", "I wanted to know if boys are given shorter name than girls. So I plotted the name lengths as a histogram. It seems that girls tend to have slightly longer names than boys and most of the names would be about 5 letters long.", "I had this strange feeling that girls ten to have names that end in vowels, while boys didn\u2019t. To test this I plotted a pie chart. I was correct in my assumption. Names of girls largely tend to end in vowels, especially \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018e\u2019, while names of boys predominantly end in \u2018e\u2019 or \u2018o\u2019.", "Alright, now let\u2019s get to the interesting stuff. Can a machine predict a gender from a name? To help it, I engineered a few features based on the insights I got from the data exploration.", "Names are proper nouns and I really didn\u2019t want to follow a semantic approach. Instead, I converted each letter in a name to it\u2019s ASCII value and calculated the average ASCII value for each name.", "I created a new feature that contained the length of each name, ie, the total number of letters in each name.", "I assumed that, in general, girls have more vowels in their names, while boys have more consonants. To quantify this assumption, I created two additional features \u2014 Number of vowels and Number of consonants in a name", "The assumption was that the name of a girl is more likely to end in a vowel as compared to the name of a boy. To quantify this belief, I created a feature that had binary values \u2014 1 if the last letter in a name is a vowel and 0 if not.", "With these 4 features, I wanted my binary classifier to classify the name into either a \u2018Male\u2019 class or a \u2018Female\u2019 class.", "(This is a 2 class problem, purely on grounds of data availability. The dataset has only these 2 genders identified)", "I built two very simple models \u2014 A Logistic Regression Classifier and a Support Vector Classifier. I split the data into a training set (24245 names) and a testing set (10392 names) by a 70:30 split.", "I was interested in building a no frills, back of the napkin, model without too much hyper-parameter tuning. So I avoided creating a validation set altogether. The intent was to make fun, non-serious, predictions!", "The logistic regression model has a sensitivity (or recall) of 67.8% and specificity of about 68.3%, which is relatively better than a random prediction. The precision for predicting Female is 76% while for predicting Male is 58%.", "What this means, is that although the model can correctly predict the gender about 68% of the time, it makes a lot less mistake in predicting Females than Males.", "The SVC with a linear kernel gives a lower sensitivity (64.5%) than the logistic regression model. The specificity, 72.5%, is better than the previous model. The precision for predicting Female is nearly 78% while for predicting Male is 57%.", "In other words, the SVC can correctly predict that a name belongs to a Male, much better than it can predict a name as Female. But, it makes a lot less mistake in predicting a name as Female, than it does in predicting Males.", "Now comes the real test \u2014 can I predict a gender better than the machine I built??", "To find out, I randomly selected 10 names from the dataset (masking their gender of course) and pitted myself against the trained machines.", "The results of the game are shown below \u2014", "The performances of the players can be understood by a series of questions \u2014", "Q1: When the names actually belonged to Females, how often is the player correct (in technical terms: recall or sensitivity)?", "Q2: When the player predicts a name as Female, how often is the player correct (in technical terms: precision)?", "Q3: When the names actually belonged to Males, how often is the player correct (in technical terms: recall or sensitivity)?", "Q4: When the player predicts a name as Male, how often is the player correct (in technical terms: precision)?", "This was a quick and fun project for me and allowed me to learn a bunch of interesting concepts.
