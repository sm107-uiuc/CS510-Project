I recommend to create three projects:", "If you\u2019re more advanced then you definitely should play around with latest machine learning algorithms. For example you can:", "You have endless opportunities here. You definitely should show that you\u2019re well-versed in neural networks and their fundamentals like Keras, PyTorch, TensorFlow.", "Even if that sounds obvious you should be able to answer questions about your knowledge, particular technicalities or problems.", "Actually the most important question you\u2019ll be asked is what was the hardest in a given project. If you were struggling with a particular technical issue, why and what it was. How did you overcome it? Those are the basic kind of questions that you should be prepared to answer.", "Be ready to talk about algorithms in more detail, different methods you have used in the past. Be open and share also what was problematic for you. This can only help during a job interview.", "The last thing which is often overlooked by data scientists is putting up a coherent LinkedIn profile with explanation of what you did in the past and where you\u2019re at currently. If you have any gaps in your career be sure to be asked about them \u2014 there\u2019s nothing wrong with 6-months stay on Bali surfing, you should just be honest about what motivated you back then and what you wanted to achieve. I imagine that a good argument would be you wanted to have a break from your screen, wanted a restart, wanting to work as a digital nomads \u2014 there are plenty of reasons to explain why this option was the best also for your career.", "You should also ask for recommendations from your past employers. They can write it directly on LinkedIn \u2014 just a couple of sentences is enough. If your last departure wasn\u2019t really planned and you feel bitter about, try to explain why and what you expect from your next employer.", "You should be able to say precisely why you want to change your job. Is it because you\u2019re looking for new challenges? If yes, why you can\u2019t have them at your current job? Speaking clearly about your previous work experiences is a huge asset.", "Summing up there are 3 things you should do to really master a job interview for a data scientist position:", "Finally, if you want to have an overview of what it means to be a Data Scientist, then have a look at my book Data Science Job: How to become a Data Scientist which will guide you through the process.", "And if you want to know more, read my other articles about becoming a Data Scientist:", "Your home for data science.
