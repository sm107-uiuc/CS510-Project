This, however, has not hampered the development of some exciting solutions in the area. Examples include object recognition from computer vision and speech recognition from a natural language processing perspective.", "Many of the existing AI solutions have a cloud computing or storage as an essential component of the architecture. This makes it hard for certain sectors to adopt the technology for practical use cases because of issues related to privacy, latency, reliability, and bandwidth. Edge computing while limited with resources can mitigate these issues to some extend. The argument is not mutual exclusiveness of edge and cloud computing, rather edge computing complement cloud computing.", "The emerging technology trends as shown by the Gartner hype cycle 2019 and 2018 [1] suggest that the edge AI and edge analytics have peak inflated expectations. However as the field is still in the infancy stage, the software frameworks and hardware platforms will evolve over time to create value in a cost-effective way.", "Three of the major players in the field of AI; Intel, Google, and Nvidia are supporting the edge AI by offering hardware platforms/accelerators in small form factors. While all the three have both weaknesses and strengths, it all depends on the application, budget, and availability of skill sets.", "In this blog, I will provide a brief comparison of the three edge AI hardware accelerators; Intel Movidius NCS stick, Google Coral USB stick, and Nvidia Jetson Nano.", "To perform the detection comparison, consideration was given to the same environment settings. The test objects included a person, bus, and a car. The same lighting conditions were ensured. The link to the Getting Started tutorials to set up each of the experiment is given at the end of this discussion. In the experiment, the hardware components include NVIDIA Jetson Nano Developer Kit, 32GB Scandisk Ultra SDcard, Microsoft USB LifeCam 1080p HD (Webcam), Raspberry Pi Official Universal Power Supply 2.5A, Raspberry Pi Camera, Google Coral USB and Intel NCS.", "The resource utilization is measured with the top command of Linux. Inference time is the time of objects being detected in a single frame and the CPU usage represents the co-processor utilization. Intel NCS has a lower frame rate however the second generation, Intel NCS2 is claimed to offer up to 8X faster performance [2]. Detection results represent the confidence score of the detection.", "Figure 01 depicts the detection results of Nvidia Jetson Nano, Figure 02 represents Google Coral and Figure 03 shows the detection results from Intel NCS. It is visible that NVIDIA and Intel NCS offer better confidence scores and the Google Coral has a relatively low confidence score. One of the reasons is the infrared camera being used for google coral, therefore the detection performance is not fully scientific because of the mismatch of the camera sensors. However, this provides an indication of how many objects were used for estimation of the processing load, memory usage, and inference time calculation.", "The cost of hardware accelerators together with the required components is given in the following table. It is worth mentioning that Nvidia Jetson Nano is a developing board and works as a standalone device. However, Google Coral USB and Intel NCS require a host computer for handling the data streams. The host computer could be a single board computer such as Raspberry Pi or any other x86 computer with either Windows or Linux operating systems. The cost in the following table is calculated with Raspberry Pi 3 B+.", "The cost is estimated for the prototype system and each of the accelerator providers has production-ready hardware. The cost of production-ready accelerators will depend on volume and third-party offerings as these modules need to be integrated into the host computer.", "The production-ready hardware accelerators: Jetson nano, Google Coral, Intel NCS.", "The answer depends on the end goal.", "For PoC, the cost is relatively same and it all depends on the application requirement, availability of skills to select any of the three choices. None the less it is recommended to evaluate different models and evaluate if the accelerator supports a particular model. The flexibility of each of the hardware accelerators will be discussed briefly in the next paragraph.", "The generality could be perceived from both hardware and software perspectives. Flexibility from the hardware perspective could be; how easy it is to integrate/utilize the particular accelerator in the System-on-Chip or host computer. It all depends on the application and interface availability. The flexibility from a software perspective could be defined from the point of view of how many detection and classification models are supported by a particular accelerator. The model zoo of the three accelerators are listed here", "It is evident from the latency point of view, Nvidia Jetson Nano is performing better ~25 fps as compared to ~9 fps of google coral and ~4 fps of Intel NCS. For some applications, more than 4 fps could also be a good performance metric, considering the cost difference. Nvidia Jetson Nano is an evaluation board whereas Intel NCS and Google Coral are more of the add-on devices that can be attached to existing hardware. The PoC could be rapidly developed using the aforementioned hardware. It is also worth mentioning that all three have the production-ready hardware accelerators with better temperature ratings and performance modes e.g. google coral has dynamic frequency scaling and adjusts the load depending on the temperature of the accelerator. The cost of these prototypes hardware accelerators is relatively small and in the same range, making them suitable for different low-cost applications.", "Your home for data science.
