And for good reason; art is a powerful form of expressionism and a unique manifestation of creativity. As such, visual works, and the creators thereof, came to be valued highly in society.", "In recent years, the amelioration of computational power has allowed machines to begin imitating human behavior. Due to the importance of art, it is no surprise that researchers have begun developing algorithms striving to produce unseen creative content. This is both controversial and fascinating. In this article, I will be focusing exclusively on the technological component of this creative revolution, rather than the ethical debate.", "A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style (N.A.A.S.), invented primarily by Leon A. Gatys, is one of the most interesting, yet accessible pokes at artificial artwork I\u2019ve seen to date.", "N.A.A.S. uses two images to create an output piece: the content image, and the style image. As is implied by their labels, the style of the style image is woven into the content of the content image. This is carried out using a clever technique which allows the computer to distinguish between the content and style of a picture, using a convolutional neural network (conv net or CNN). The output image (initially a random set of pixels) is compared to the specified content and style, and is incrementally tweaked until it mathematically resembles the desired result.", "To elaborate, the comparison to style and content mentioned above is done using a cost function specialized for this algorithm. The function is minimized by altering the pixel information of the optimization image. The pixel values are the parameters for this technique, meaning that their values will be changed so as to minimize the N.A.A.S. cost function. If you don\u2019t understand what a parameter or loss function is, I strongly recommend skimming through my article about linear regression to get an introduction to the machine learning process before moving on.", "This is not to say that you should understand what is going on beneath the hood quite yet. It\u2019s just important to have the basics in place.", "Seeing as convolutional neural networks are the underlying concept for the entirety of N.A.A.S., it is important to have a clear idea of what they do. If you already know about CNNs, that\u2019s great. Move on to the next section.", "Conv nets are a type of artificial neural networks which lever a couple of special techniques to allow them to be especially good at breaking images down into their foundational content. This process is done in steps, each step a new layer in the network. A layer is as simple as a filing cabinet for data; it organizes information. Layer x is comprised of a representation of the input data which has been undergone x mathematical manipulations, in this case convolutions. These unique sets of computations are what form every neural network and move data from layer to layer. Each bit of information contained within a layer is stored in what is called a neuron. Neurons should be thought of as the files stored in each virtual cabinet, as they contain information about the content of the input image. The information stored in a neuron is called and activation or output. Activations are scalar values.", "That\u2019s how information is stored in CNNs. Now let\u2019s get right into the grime and have a look at what goes on inside an image-dissecting network. For conv nets, there are a total of three transformations used to break down pictures: convolutions, pooling, and activation functions.", "We\u2019ll begin with the most important mutation, the convolution. A convolution is fundamentally a series of filters which move across an image. These filters are matrices, commonly three-dimensional sets of values forming a square prism. Both the height and width of these structures are frequently of sizes 3 or 5. The depth of a filter will match the number of channels of the image. Three color channels (RBG) means a depth of three.", "As a filter is moved around the image, each value in the filter is multiplied by the pixel value it currently \u2018sits on top of\u2019. These products are summed to produce a scalar output which is stored in a neuron. The holdings of a neuron may not mean much to a human, but this information is valuable for the computer. The filter is then moved around the image in increments specified by the user (the size of increment is called the step size). Once the filter has passed over every position in the image and has created an entire matrix full of output values, the process is repeated with another filter.", "The outputs from a filter represent the extent to which the given region on the image matches what the filter is searching. A large value means a high correlation between the region and desired feature.", "Said outputs from a convolution are stored in what is called a feature map. This sounds complex, but it is simply a matrix of all the values produced during the filtering process. An important quality to note about the feature maps is that they are organized such that they are spatially correlated to the image. This means that an output value of a filter looking at the top left of an image will also be in the top left of the feature map matrix.", "Seeing as filters provide scalar outputs and are moved around the image, a single filter ends up producing a two-dimensional output. Every new filter used on an image will add a channel to the feature map, making it a three-dimensional matrix.", "Note: A channel is a 2-d layer of the feature map, taken as a cross section from the depth.", "What is described above is only one convolution. Most neural networks consist of many layers of convolutions. How you ask?", "Well it\u2019s as easy as running another set of filters over the feature map, to create a new feature map. The filters in this case would have the same depth of the map they are working to analyse. Otherwise, the process is the same as the one depicted above.", "Slide, multiply, sum, rinse, and repeat.", "If you\u2019re wondering where these magical filters are birthed from, you pose a very valid question. Each number in every filter is called a parameter. This means that it is learned by the network over time through back-propagation. If you don\u2019t know what back prop is, fret not. Just know that the machine learning aspect of conv nets is that the computer progressively tweaks its filters until they are searching for and representing meaningful information.", "Now that\u2019s all good and well in theory, but let\u2019s examine how this is used in practice.", "Let\u2019s say we\u2019re trying to build a network to visually understand and then classify cars. A conv net would be used for the understanding aspect of the build. It would break down the image\u2019s information such that a dense neural network could readily classify the image as \u2018car\u2019 or \u2018not car\u2019.", "At the beginning of the training process, when we begin feeding vehicular images to the youthful network, it would be using filters containing random values. As time progressed, and the network began to learn, it would develop a unique set of filters for recognizing cars. In the first layers of the network, due to how conv nets learn, it is likely that the filters would search for very basic structures such as vertical or horizontal lines. Over time, progression through the hierarchy of the network would mean progression in the complexity of the data presented. In higher layers, the network might learn how to see shapes and near the final layers, filters may be searching for mirrors, windows, or perhaps tires.", "Don\u2019t forget that only the first set of filters are looking directly at the input image\u2019s pixel information. Beyond that, filters are looking at the layer before them, and analyzing the data there within.", "Note: A layer in a neural network is a series of neurons, each holding a value. When I describe a pooling layer or convolution layer, it refers to a section of the network which performs the specified task (be it pooling, convolutions, or otherwise). A convolutional layer is a layer which takes in values and performs convolutions to create a feature map, rather than a layer consisting of a feature map.", "A final thing I must emphasize before moving on: by far the most important thing to take away from this section is that the layers of convolutional networks represent the content of the input image.", "So that\u2019s that for convolutions! Let\u2019s have a look at the other two parts of a convolutional network, next up being pooling layers.", "A pooling layer is a relatively simple concept. Its purpose is to shrink the size of feature maps. The pooling process can be performed proceeding any convolutional layer. Pooling is used for two reasons, the first being to reduce the number of computations carried out in the network, which in turn increases the network\u2019s speed. The second reason, which I urge you not to concern yourself with (but should still be acknowledged) is to prevent over fitting through minimizing the number of dimensions of the data and in turn reducing the complexity of the data\u2019s distribution. In human talk, this causes the network to perform better on a more diverse data set.", "For the purpose of this article, only the max pooling layer will be explained. There are other types of pooling, but maximum pooling is by far the most common.", "On every channel of a given input, max pooling moves about, looking at sections of a specified size (commonly a 2x2 square). It takes the maximum value in the area, meaning the most active neuron, and then alters the feature map by discarding all other values in the region. It too maintains the spatial representation of the neurons.", "This process helps discard a large amount of meaningless information, keeping only the most valuable content.", "Alas, the activation function. This is a staple for most every neural network. It introduces non-linearity to the network, readily allowing it to learn almost any possible distribution.", "Activation functions alter every value in a feature map by putting them through a desired function (as is implied by their name). It is common practice to perform the activation alteration after every convolutional layer.", "Convolutional neural networks perform best with the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU), or Leaky ReLU activation function.", "ReLU grounds every negative value to zero. This is logical, seeing as negative pixel values are meaningless.", "The purpose of a ReLU variation (leaky or parametric) is to allow gradient flow during back propagation. In other words, leaky ReLU helps the network learn its parameters more steadily.", "Those are the three parts of a conv net! Here are a couple examples of what a simple network architecture may be:", "Convolution -> ReLU -> Pooling -> Convolution -> ReLU -> Pooling", "Convolution -> ReLU -> Convolution -> ReLU -> Pooling -> Convolution -> ReLU -> Convolution -> ReLU -> Pooling", "And finally, now that all the parts are in place, let\u2019s examine a visualization of a proper network.", "Here is the graph above broken down into stages:", "Stage 1: 6 filters of size 5x5x1 are used on the input image, producing a feature map of size 28x28x6 (Layer 1).", "Note: The width and height of the data changes due to the fact that some pixels at the edge of the image cannot be convolved over, as the filter is not programmed to account for the absence of pixels which presents itself at the perimeter of the image.", "Stage 2: Max pooling is performed, shrinking the map to a size of 14x14x6 (Layer 2).", "Stage 3: 16 filters of size 5x5x6 (containing 6 channels each) convolve over layer 2, producing a feature map of size 10x10x16 (Layer 3).", "Stage 4: Max pooling is carried out on layer 3, shrinking the feature map to size 5x5x16 (Layer 4).", "Stage 5: The final section of this network does not pertain to Neural Style Transfer. After layer 4, the feature map is fed into a series of fully connected layers which classify the image. Again, this is not relevant to the concept at hand, but may be of interest to some.", "And that\u2019s it! You have a good grasp on what it means to be a convolutional neural network! Let\u2019s move on to what you came for: A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style.", "The neural style research paper recommends the use of a pre-trained, very competent CNN called VGG 16. VGG 16 includes a classification section, but only its convolutional components are used for N.A.A.S. The network\u2019s architecture is as follows:", "Note: After every convolution listed, the ReLU activation function is applied. All filters in the network are of size 3x3. Pooling in the network is of size 2x2.", "As you can see, the VGG 16 network has a rather complex architecture. It is not a network to be trained on an everyday laptop. Instead, previously acquired weights for the filters can be downloaded from online. This optimizes our results and saves a massive amount of time.", "Now we\u2019r getting into the meat of the algorithm!", "The first part of the research paper presented by Gatys describes a method of transferring the content of the content image to the optimization image. This is done by representing the difference between the content of two images mathematically and minimizing said representation. This part of the cost function is relatively straight forward, now that an understanding of conv nets has been established.", "When we pass an image into a conv net, its content is represented by neurons throughout the net. Notice that I say content, not pixel values. The content of a photo of a cat face is very similar to the content of all other cat face images. Despite the color or facial structure of the cats changing slightly, a conv net can still understand that it is looking at a cat. This is an important detail, as it allows content to be numerically retained, despite the image\u2019s style being altered.", "That being said, to represent the desired content for the optimization image, we use the values from a VGG layer (specifically layer conv4_2, after performing ReLU) after passing our content image through it.", "As for the math to it:", "For those of you familiar with the mean squared error cost function, this should look very similar. This expression says the following:", "The content loss generated at layer l of a conv net, with regards to a content image p and an optimization image x, is the average square difference between each content representation, or activation, of p and x at layer l.", "Here, F denotes the representation of the optimization image at layer l of a conv net. F(i, j) is a single neuron from F at layer l. P and P(i, j) denote the content image representation at layer l, and an activation thereof. So, for every value pair of i and j, add the squared difference between activation F(i, j) and P(i, j) to a running sum. Upon completion of this process, divide the sum by the total number of iterations in the summation (equal to the number of neurons in F or P). Divide again by 2.", "Let\u2019s think of this logically. The objective of the entire style transfer process is to minimize the N.A.A.S. cost function, the content loss making up one half of the function. In order to minimize the loss, the optimization image must be changed such that its content representation F is similar to the content image\u2019s representation P. This would transfer the content of p onto x, preserving all the important details of the specified image.", "And there you have it, one half of Neural Style Transfer. Not so bad is it?", "Here we go, onto the more inventive half of N.A.A.S: style representation. The proposed method of differentiating style from content is to use gram matrices to compute the correlation between features. Have a look at what that means, shall we?", "To compute a gram matrix, we take the content representation at a layer \u2113 and convert the data into a two-dimensional matrix. Each row of the matrix is the entire output of a filter which analyzed layer \u2113 \u20131. Seeing as every filter is looking to pick up on a specific feature, one could also say that every row in the matrix is a representation of a given feature at different positions on the input image.", "Now that the values have been properly structured, the matrix can be computed using the following equation:", "This equation explicitly states that element (i, j) of the gram matrix is equal to the sum of the product of elements from two distinct rows in the content matrix.", "To break it down, element 1 of row i is multiplied by element 1 of row j. Element 2 times element 2 and so on, up until element k. Finally, these products are summed to produce a single element of the gram matrix.", "So, to compute the gram matrix in its entirety, this is computation is carried out for every combination of rows in the matrix.", "This was the part of the paper which stumped me the most. How could simple matrix multiplication represent the style of an image?", "Remember that every row of the matrix was an unrolled feature map, containing spatial information regarding the presence of features. By multiplying elements together, we are checking if these elements overlap at their location in the image. This is done for every location in the image and with every possible pairing of features. Summation is then performed, discarding all of the information\u2019s spatial relevance.", "And this overlap or correlation between elements, regardless of their whereabouts, is exactly what style is. How often to blue circles overlap with horizontal hatches? Do small dots cross paths with spirals throughout the image? These features, weaving together in intricate, unnoticeable ways, are ultimately the style of an image.", "And that\u2019s the representation of style.", "Now, the MSE Loss is put to use once again.", "Here, we are iterating over the gram matrix of the optimization image (G) and the gram matrix of the style image (A). We sum the square difference between all elements of these two matrices. Here, N represents the number of feature maps in layer l and M represents the number of elements in these N feature maps. The sum is then scaled by 4 times N\u00b2 * M\u00b2 for a final style loss for layer l.", "Gatys\u2019s paper stated that the best results are obtained when comparing the style of images at multiple layers. The total style loss is therefore:", "Where w(l) represents a weight for the loss at layer l, and E(l) is the loss at layer l.", "Seeing as the object of the algorithm is to minimize the cost function, the optimization image\u2019s style will slowly change to resemble that of the style image. This will increase the similarity of their gram matrices, ultimately decreasing the cost.", "Style! That\u2019s all there is to it!", "You\u2019ve seen all the parts. Let\u2019s put them together in an IKEA instruction booklet.", "The first thing to do is specify a style image and a content image. The path to these images is provided for the computer. A tensor of random values with the same size as the content image is then created. This is the optimization image. The random values in it are the parameters for this algorithm. They will be changed by the computer over time to become the output image.", "The loss function or optimization target is set to be the content loss using representation from VGG layer conv4_2 plus the style loss using representation from VGG layers conv1_1, conv2_1, conv3_1, conv4_1, and conv5_1. These layers, as presented by Gatys, were found to yield the best results.", "Hyper-parameters alpha and beta are used to adjust the balance between content and style for the output.", "Now, machine learning magic is put to work. Seeing as some of you may not be well versed in optimization algorithms, and this topic is not to be taught in a short article, I\u2019ll keep this section concise. The optimization image is backpropagated through the VGG network to get its gradients with respect to the cost function. Using a minimization algorithm (in this case L-BFGS), the values of the random noise tensor are changed to lower the output of the cost function. Slowly, noise turns into an amalgamation of the style and content images.", "The result is then up-scaled to a higher resolution using another technique proposed by Gatys. The concept, despite its simplicity, is beyond the scope of this article. It is also less interesting (in my eyes) than the style transfer algorithm itself.", "And that\u2019s all. An incredible artwork is birthed by machine learning. Truly an amazing process.", "As more neural art algorithms are developed, the creative process will be further accelerated and ameliorated. I\u2019m extremely excited to see the unique works created by machines in the near future.", "Thanks for reading! Before you go:", "Your home for data science.
