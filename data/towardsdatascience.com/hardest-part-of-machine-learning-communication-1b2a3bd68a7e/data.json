And, as with most models, we realized communication was key.", "Ok, so first of all, communication is never an afterthought. In reality, you want to be communicating your model to the stakeholders from the start. The thing is, building productionized machine learning models is a very time-intensive process. And, you need 100% buy-in from the stakeholders. Otherwise, believe me, your model idea, akin to baby turtle devoured by pelican, will die a quick death.", "It takes a couple of months to build a strong model with acceptable error metrics. Guess what? \u2014 That is a mighty long time to ask for. The stakeholders will grill you on progress and wonder if your time could be put to better use.", "First things first \u2014 make sure to first have a very solid pitch and use case for the model. There is this concept of MVP \u2014 it stands for \u201cminimum value proposition.\u201d In terms of models, an MVP is a basic model that is trained and spits out some predictions in some data format.", "So, make sure to deliver your model in increments. Please, don\u2019t build out a complicated automated pipeline for an algorithm until you have delivered something more basic. Don\u2019t seek perfection. Put tangible data in front of stakeholders and thus give them a taste of all the things they can do with that data. This gets you more and more buy-in for the next steps.", "Alternatively, the stakeholders might realize the data is useless to them and they rightfully pull the plug on the project. This would ensure that you don\u2019t work on a model that no one cares about \u2014 it might be fun to do, but it will tank your career at a company.", "Please, please, please \u2014 make sure to do cost-benefit analysis of making a model. I know that as data scientists, we are excited by the complexities and learning involved in executing a machine learning project. But, do realize that the gains of the machine learning model must be huge enough to justify the long amount of time it takes to build a full machine learning model. So, do seek the simplest solution. Avoid machine learning solutions at first and see if a much simpler solution would suffice. Only if the problem is important and can\u2019t be solved without machine learning, do you embark on a machine learning project.", "As stakeholders listen to you \u2014 they have one thing on their mind \u201chow does this affect or concern my business?\u201d So, tailor your information accordingly. Also, business stakeholders don\u2019t have the technical background that you have, so here is what your detailed explanation of a random forest algorithm sounds like \u2014 \u201cbla bla lalala bla bla bla blaa lala bla\u201d.", "So, does this mean not talking about the model at all and just stating the error of the model? Well, no. The goal is to abstract away from the model to the point that it is understandable by anyone. There are 2 ways of explaining gravity, for example \u2014 you can write out all the physics equations or say \u201cit\u2019s a force that makes things fall when we drop them\u201d. Choose the easier one.", "Ok, so enough of me preaching what to do or not to do. Here is what we did.", "We realized that stakeholders did not quite care all that much about nitty gritty of the algorithms we were using. So, we spared the details and talked about the model in general abstracted terms.", "The error metric we used internally as a team was RMSE. However, the RMSE idea was a bit complex and intangible for stakeholders. Also, we built the model on user level but then we rolled it up into really granular cohorts. So, we picked a different, more fitting metric for stakeholders.", "The metric we picked was the percentage difference of rolled up actual vs predicted values. Then, we would look at distribution of that error across cohorts. Internally, as a team, however, when we were tuning the model, we were using RMSE as a metric we were trying to minimize. But, when we talked to stakeholders we showed a much less intimidating, and more fitting percentage difference metric.", "And, because RMSE is a much more sensitive error measure, whatever we did to decrease RMSE would also decrease the more downstream metric of cohort percentage difference.", "Your home for data science.
