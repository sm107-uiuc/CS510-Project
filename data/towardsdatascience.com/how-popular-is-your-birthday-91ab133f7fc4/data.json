And in many a class, students were asked to compute the probability that two of them had the same birthday.", "To do this computation, students typically make the default assumption that everybody is equally likely to be born on any given day (the uniform distribution). Without this assumption, the problem becomes hard to do by hand. On the other hand, you will often see visualizations floating around the Internet similar to the below.", "I\u2019ll discuss the data used to generate the figures and values in this article more below. This chart shows the relative likelihood of someone having a birthday on a given day.", "Note that for February 29th, which occurs approximately\u00b9 every 4 years, the uniform distribution would imply that one is one-fourth as likely to be born on February 29th as on February 28th. This is accounted for in the chart above (without the correction, a Feb 29 birthday has a relative frequency of 0.92/4 = 0.23 compared to the probability of being born on any other day of the year assuming the uniform distribution).", "The unpopularity of July 4th, a major holiday in the United States, should tip you off that this data is for the US only.", "In the first part of this article, we will focus on the probability question, namely: what are the odds that two people in a room have the same birthday? First, we will compute the solution to the birthday problem using the assumption that birthdays are uniformly distributed through the year. Second we will use Monte Carlo methods to compute the solution given the observed distribution.", "The results will be that the answer is unchanged even considering the empirical distribution (though it gets close!). For each version of the problem we consider, the answer is that 23 is just enough to make the probability of two people having the same birthday 50%.", "In the second part of the article, we\u2019ll explore the distribution of birthdays a little bit more and build a simple model to understand the variation in births.", "In school, the question could be given as follows:", "Suppose there are n people in a room. Assume that nobody has a birthday on February 29th and that their birthdays are random variables uniformly distributed across the other 365 days of the year. Find the minimum value of n such that the probability of at least two students sharing a birthday is at least 50%.", "To solve this problem, we instead compute the probability that no two students share a birthday. We number the students 1 to n. The probability of the first student not sharing a birthday with any previous student is 365/365=1. For the second student, there are 364 days not overlapping with previous students, so the probability is 364/365 that they don\u2019t share a birthday with a previous student. The next student is 363/365 and so on.", "The result is the following quantity which we will denote q. The goal is to find the minimal n such that q \u22640.5.", "At this point most people reach for their calculator. But we can continue to estimate by hand by taking a logarithm and a Taylor expansion:", "In the first line, we take the logarithm, changing the product into a sum. We also rewrite each fraction in the form of 1\u2013x. The first order Taylor Expansion is a good approximation when x is small, ln(1\u2013x) = \u2013x. This is what we apply in the second line. The third line uses the formulas for the sum of an arithmetic series (we are just adding up 1 + 2 + 3 + \u22ef + (n\u20131) in the numerator). ln(2) is famously 0.69. Multiplying 0.69\u2a09365\u2248252 (round up). n should be a bit over the square root of 2\u2a09252 = 504, so n = 23 is our guess based on these approximations (yielding 253 in the numerator of the ln q approximation). This is in fact the correct answer as the following chart (computed exactly/to numerical precision) shows. Code is linked at the end.", "Now we turn to solving the birthday problem using real data. The data in question is provided by FiveThirtyEight and is based on Social Security Administration (government) data giving birth counts on each day from Jan 1, 2000 to Dec 31, 2014. It\u2019s reasonable to assume this covers nearly every birth in the United States during that time frame.", "Taking the data as given, we turn to estimating the probability of two people having the same birthday. We assume the birthdays of our n people are iid distributed according to the empirical distribution of our data. There isn\u2019t a feasible direct way to compute this from the data so, we turn to Monte Carlo methods.", "Specifically, for each n, we will sample from the distribution and observe if any birthdays are shared. Again, code (and test cases) are in the repo linked at the end. Somewhat surprisingly, the results are substantively unchanged. The results are graphed below, with the values for the uniform birthday problem plotted as well. The empirical result also has a 99% confidence interval, which is so small you cannot see it (using 100,000 simulations per n).", "This distribution is close enough to uniform that the result n=23 continues to hold for the empirical case! In a sense, this was, in hindsight, an unnecessary analysis. The difference between the two curves is graphed below, and you can see that they are statistically indistinguishable.", "To be clear, the distributions are not the same. However, this simulation was run with 100,000 draws per value of n, not enough statistical power to reveal the differences. Larger numbers of simulations would reveal statistically significant (but substantively small) differences.\u00b2 For example, running 5,000,000 draws just for n=23 finally yields enough statistical power to distinguish. The empirical distribution has P=50.786%\u00b10.022%, while the uniform distribution has P=50.730%. (The margin of error is 1 standard deviation, not a 95% confidence interval).", "Now, the deviation of the birth distribution from uniform in any fixed year should be higher than the overall. Much of the variation that we would expect to see in any given year will be smoothed out. For example:", "Going back to the Birthday problem, this might make us worry. If you ask a typical class of 4th graders in fall 2020, most will be born between September 2010 and August 2011. We would expect higher variability than in the empirical distribution because each of them is much less likely to have been born on a date that, say, happened to be Labor Day in the fall of 2010. This could lead to a different solution (perhaps n=22?) of the Birthday problem.", "To explore this, we can proceed as follows.", "For the first one, we confirm what we expected in the chart below. The divergence from uniform is about 10 times higher on an annual basis (0.021\u00b1.006) than on an overall basis (.002). There also appears to be an interesting trend to the data. The only possible explanation I can think of is the gradual cycling of the calendar through the 7 possible start dates of the year. The cycle is messed up by leap years, but roughly speaking we expect, for example, July 4th to move around from Monday to Tuesday to Wednesday etc. on a 6\u20137 year period.", "In terms of re-estimating the birthday problem with annual data, we can do so (using a smaller simulation size of 10000 runs per n). The curves are slightly higher than the uniform distribution (shown in blue). The solution almost changes, but in fact, n=23 still holds up for a room full of people all born in the same year. For n=22, the probability creeps up to as much as 49.1%\u00b1.05% for people born in 2009, compared to 47.6% for the uniform distribution.", "So, it turns out that the uniform assumption is good enough for this problem and there\u2019s no need to fret.", "Since we\u2019re here, let\u2019s see what other insights we can get from the data.", "You might be surprised to learn that weekends are not a popular time to give birth. The figure below shows the mean number of births on any given day of the week in our dataset. The 95% confidence intervals are shown and are tight, indicating a statistically significant\u00b3 difference between the weekend and weekdays, as well as a noticeably smaller number of births on Mondays.", "Two hypotheses you might want to keep in mind. Let\u2019s call them the negative and positive hypotheses (for how you might feel about the reasons)", "You can read a bit more about this in that FiveThirtyEight article.", "Overall, the general question that you might want to ask about this data is: what explains the variability in births on any given day? Stated this way, we have a classic regression problem. We want to model the data and see what we learn.", "My goal here is to do a very quick and simple model. For example, we could use sophisticated time-series/forecasting tools like Facebook\u2019s Prophet keep track of a variety of holidays and the run-up to them, each of which could be entered as a regressor. I don\u2019t want to get this fancy, so for covariates we\u2019ll use:", "Again, a more sophisticated analysis would use geographically disaggregated data and consider a variety of factors like the weather, local sports teams\u2019 performance\u2074, the (local) economy, and just about anything that broadly affects people and makes them and their partner (or surrogates, I guess) decide to get pregnant (or do so accidentally).", "The resulting model is pretty good with an R\u00b2 of 94%.\u2075 This means that 94% of the variation in births is explained by the model. Here are the coefficients:", "Each coefficient represents the expected change in number of births holding everything else constant. You can find the exact coefficients in the GitHub repo linked at the end. The orange bars show 95% confidence intervals. For example, on Christmas, the coefficient of approximately \u20135300 means that about 5300 fewer babies are born on Christmas in our dataset than we would otherwise expect after accounting for the month (December), day of the week (varying), and year.", "For the Months table, the coefficient represents the change relative to January. Thus if we took a day in September versus January in the same year and held everything else constant (day of week, holidays), we would expect to see about 1140 more births on a given day in September. Likewise, for the day of the week, everything is compared to a Monday.", "The intercept (not shown) is the number of births on a regular Monday in January, approximately 12,000 per day. There is also a slight decrease over time, with about 33 fewer births per day for each year after 2000, though further examination (not shown) shows the effect isn\u2019t linear and shouldn\u2019t be over-interpreted.", "Valentines is popular for giving birth, while Memorial day weekend seems just as good as any other weekend. For the remaining holidays, Thanksgiving, Christmas, Labor Day, and Memorial day are quite unpopular. We see substantial but smaller effects for the other days around major holidays.", "In terms of months, we see a clear trend for births starting in the spring and going into late summer early/fall, peaking in September. Presumably, this represents what parents were choosing to do with their time the previous winter. The day-of-week analysis is substantively similar to what we saw earlier.", "The next question we want to ask is, are there any other days we missed? Displayed below are the residuals of the model, averaged over dates. You should interpret this as the relative popularity of a day after accounting for day of the week, month, and a limited selection of holidays.", "Specifically, it shows the mean anomalous number of babies born/not born on each day. These residuals are all rounded to the nearest 10.", "A few things jump out immediately. Halloween (October 31) is an unpopular day to give birth that we forgot to include. July 5 is unpopular. In my quick-and-dirty coding of holidays, the Monday after a weekend July 4th (which is often when the day is observed) would not have been included, likely explaining this. December 23rd is also unpopular.", "The vertical blue stripe on the 13th indicates that, all other things equal, people also don\u2019t like giving birth on the 13th! Nor (since 2001 at least) do they like giving birth on September 11. Looking at the month of December, we see that people prefer to give birth towards the later end of the month: either the week before Christmas or the week between it and New Years.", "It\u2019s pretty fascinating that people can somehow control when they give birth. It\u2019s hard to say immediately whether it\u2019s a subconscious phenomenon, something about the differing levels of stress, or a deliberate medical intervention, or something else.", "We\u2019ve seen that overall, the distribution of births is pretty close to uniform (close enough that the solution to the birthday problem is still n=23). On the other hand, we saw major variation on smaller time scales: in days of the week and when examined on an annual basis. But, even looking on an annual basis, it still wasn\u2019t sufficient to change the solution to the birthday problem.", "Finally, we looked into modeling the variation in births and saw that it is mostly explained by holidays, months, and days of the week. To the remaining unexplained variance, we can point to a few days we forgot to model: the 13th, Halloween, July 4 weekend, Sep 11, and the days around Christmas.", "There are a total of 17 covariates introduced by holidays. For each, if any associated weekend days are included, all weekend days are coded as the same. For example, there is two indicator variable for Labor Day: one for Labor Day itself, and one for Labor Day Weekend.", "All figures and computations my own, though the first figure is not original in its concept. Data provided FiveThirtyEight and based on Social Security Administration data. Code to reproduce figures and computations is available on Github.", "[1] It is a sometimes forgotten fact that leap years occur every 4th year unless the year is divisible by 100 but with the caveat that the exception does not apply if the year is divisible by 400. That means that 1900 and 2100 are not leap years, but 2000 is alongside the usual ones: 1996, 2004, 2008 etc. There is no one currently known to be alive that has not experienced a leap year every 4th year during their life (and the data is from 2000\u20132014), so we can safely treat a leap year as occurring every 4 years for the purpose of our analysis. We will definitely ignore esoteric things like leap seconds which would not substantively affect our analysis.", "[2] I am not going to give a formal proof that a non-uniform distribution should give a different curve. But, intuitively, the uniform distribution minimizes the probability of two people having the same birthday across all distributions supported on the days of the year. Any deviation from this (quantified by the Kullback\u2013Leibler-divergence) must necessarily cause the probability of two people having the same birthday to go up. In the repo, you can find an example where we keep skewing the data more and more and the difference eventually becomes visible to the naked eye.", "[3] Technically we should account for multiple comparisons when assigning p-values. However, it is quite clear that the results will be statistically significant just from looking at the data.", "[4] Personally speaking I was born in Minneapolis 252 days after the Minnesota Twins won the world series (the standard gestation time for a human is 280 days).", "[5] For more data about the goodness of fit, see the Github repo. The RMSE of the fit is about 550 births per day though the distribution has fat tails.", "Your home for data science.
