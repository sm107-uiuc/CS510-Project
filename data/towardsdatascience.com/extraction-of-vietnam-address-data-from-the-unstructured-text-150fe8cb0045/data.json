We buy and sell many things on these platforms, and Vietnam is no exception; in the country is more than 94 million people, Facebook (Messenger) and Zalo are the two largest social networks. Besides, many merchants use these platforms to sell various things. Therefore, chat applications are the main channel to communicate about goods they want to buy, such as price, warranty period, the receiver address, phone number, and what time it will be delivered to (Ahamove and GHN are the largest delivery company in Vietnam), etc. Thus, at Ahamove, we have developed an application that quickly helps merchants detect buyer information such as address and phone number. We have two challenges:", "These problems and how we can solve them are shown in the following sections.", "Firstly, Vietnamese is a language that relies heavily on diacritical marks. These many diacritics, often two on the same vowel, make written Vietnamese easily recognizable among Latin alphabets' localized variants. There are 9 diacritical marks, such as an acute (d\u1ea5u s\u1eafc), a grave (d\u1ea5u huy\u1ec1n), a circumflex (d\u1ea5u \u00e1), a breve (d\u1ea5u \u1edb), a horn (\u01b0 or \u01a1,) a hook above (d\u1ea5u h\u1ecfi), a tilde (d\u1ea5u ng\u00e3), an underdot (d\u1ea5u n\u1eb7ng), a dyet \u2014 something like \u0111 or \u0110.", "Ideal world is one where people of any language that uses Latin diacritics can typeset their language with ease and produce high quality typography.", "However, when we message each other, we can message with diacritical marks or not, but the other sides can understand well. For example, we can message something like:", "It is fine if we message like this:", "All the literacy people in Vietnam can understand without any difficulties.", "Secondly, people usually tend to use abbreviations in conversations. They usually abbreviate the message above like these bellow examples with the same meaning:", "Thirdly, they can use the wrong diacritical marks position, and they also understand well as usually. For instance, there are not have a different meaning when we message, but you have an F score if you make a Vietnamese dictation test ;D", "Finally, when they message together, the customer's message usually does not follow the Vietnamese structure. It means that the text does not have a structure like the subject + verb + object. For example, when they order something, a conversation usually like this:", "In conclusion, there are many different ways to message in the chat application. Some of them can not be predicted by statistical models easily or compare between two synonym words. To solve this problem, we need to clarify the Vietnam address structure firstly. In the next section, we will explain more about it.", "As mentioned above, we only focus on Vietnam addresses, but it is possible to develop in other countries and languages. The administrative units of Vietnam are divided into fourth levels. On the first tier, Vietnam is divided into 58 provinces and 5 municipalities. Municipalities are the highest-ranked, centrally-controlled cities and have special status equal to the province. Municipalities are divided into urban districts, towns, rural districts as the second tier units. After that, the urban districts are divided into wards, towns are divided into wards and communes, while rural districts are divided into townships and communes. Finally, the last tier units are hamlets, villages, and neighborhoods. There are many tiers units, but we only use one unit to represent each tier unit.", "We bypassed the fourth-tier because we do not usually use it in the address, and we also can not find any knowledge sources about the fourth-tier.", "First of all, the place unit has three possible suffixes: street names, country names, and city/province names. After the place unit, we often use a locality name, county name, and city/province name can be followed to clear up the place unit between two ward/county or city/province. For the street number, the suffix is given, such as street names. After the street name, it often is followed by the same structure as the street name in the place unit.", "There are several different ways to show address numbers in Vietnam. It will be explained below:", "The streets' names can be of various structures. In some case, they have the prefix \u201c\u0111\u01b0\u1eddng\u201d or \u201cph\u1ed1\u201d \u2014 more usual in the Northside \u2014 that means \u201cstreet.\u201d However, a big fraction of the streets does not start with these prefixes. The street can be named in different ways, and the abbreviation is used commonly. For the common street in Vietnam is \u201cC\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng th\u00e1ng T\u00e1m,\u201d can be abbreviated in various ways:", "We also have some street named such as \u201c\u0110\u01b0\u1eddng s\u1ed1 76\u201d means \u201cnumber 76 street\u201d. Houses with the same number and street name in the address. This happens quite often in H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh City. The difference would lie in the ward or district part\u2014for example, the street like \u201cC\u00e1ch m\u1ea1ng th\u00e1ng T\u00e1m\u201d which traverse District 1 and 3. So the ward name or district name is required here to clarify.", "This does not have any specific cases; it often prefixed by \u201cph\u01b0\u1eddng,\u201d \u201cx\u00e3,\u201d and \u201cth\u1ecb tr\u1ea5n.\u201d However, in some cases, the locality names in some counties can be the street name or the county name in other counties or cities/provinces.", "Similar issues as described for locality names, the county name can be the street name or the locality in other regions. An indicator for the recognition of county names is prefixed like \u201cqu\u1eadn,\u201d \u201chuy\u1ec7n,\u201d or \u201cth\u1ecb x\u00e3.\u201d", "As described in the street name above, the city or province usually use in various ways, e.g., the terms \u201cTh\u00e0nh ph\u1ed1 H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh,\u201d \u201cTP. H\u1ed3 Ch\u00ed Minh,\u201d \u201ctp.hcm,\u201d \u201ctp hcm,\u201d \u201chcmc\u201d are all synonyms for the same city. However, this way has a drawback. In some city or province, the name can be tough to recognize, e.g., the terms \u201c\u0110\u00e0 N\u1eb5ng\u201d or \u201c\u0110\u1ed3ng Nai\u201d is \u201c\u0110N\u201d when it is abbreviated.", "Currently, we only focus on Vietnam, so the country name only has Vietnam ;D We also bypass the country name when extraction information because if it does not have valid these steps that I have explained above, then it is absolutely wrong.", "In general, the place names do not follow any specific pattern. It can use This is the hardest part to recognize and changing frequently. So we only focus on malls, buildings, and departments because they seldom change.", "We aim to identify address data related to specific place units and addresses. Therefore, place units such as malls, buildings, departments, and addresses must be identified. The reasons that we focus on these kinds are:", "We are currently only focusing on Vietnam addresses because an address's structure is very different in each country. However, we have planned to develop in other countries and languages. We have developed a hybrid approach that makes both manually developed heuristics and freely data available trust resources.", "There are many different approaches out there. Nevertheless, in general, information extraction can be roughly classified into two classes. There are two approaches: Rule-based matching and Training statical model.", "By combining the statical model and rule-based components that we can improve the accuracy of the statical model. By presenting tags, entities, or sentence boundaries for specific tokens. We also use rule-based components after the statical model to correct common errors. To make more abstract logic, rule-based components can reference the attributes set by statical models.", "By doing so, we also detect attributes independent of other attributes that normally succeed or precede them. In the end, we combine candidates found into one or more complete addresses.", "Initially, we remove all diacritical marks by using Regular expression on the data we want to obtain address data. After having done so, some cleaning of the data is committed, e.g., removing non-Unicode characters or the postcode \u2014 because Vietnamese rarely use the postcode. If these pre-processing steps are not done, the tokenization might yield wrong results since. The last preprocessing step comprises a part-of-speech (POS). The POS tags obtained in this step are later on used for the identification of the single attributes.", "Each attribute of an address is identified separately and almost independent of other attributes so that variants in the structure of the address format within our data do only have a minor influence on the overall result. In some cases, the sequential of two attributes that regularly succeed each other is exploited to identify the attributes. This causes the ordering of the single steps to consider the previous step's information for the next steps. During the identification of single attributes, all token sequences that might contain address attributes are annotated as candidates. Besides, some attribute candidates are annotated with the heuristic, which had lead to this candidate.", "We take the county candidates as a seed to aggregate results because the address\u2019s name and locality can be duplicated, but the county doesn\u2019t in different cities or provinces. Based on this, we try to assign addresses to each county candidate. For this, the following steps are executed:", "We faced some important challenges that are interesting for further work. Examining the extracted addresses, we realized mainly the reason for an incorrectly identified address name:", "We have presented an approach for the identification of the Vietnam address in unstructured text. For this, we have developed a hybrid approach that makes use of patterns and gazetteers of information that can be obtained from OpenStreetMaps, Wikipedia, General Statistics Office, and other sources.", "Along with AhaMove\u2019s regional expansion, we will adapt and evaluate the approach's feasibility in other languages and other countries. For this, patterns for identifying the single address attributes need to be defined, and country-specific gazetteers need to be assembled.", "Your home for data science.
