Looking at other communities, Towards Data Science gets 20 million monthly views. AI researcher Andrew Ng has 4 million learners across his Coursera courses.", "In the meantime, there are just 17,100 ML Engineers worldwide. As of writing this article, there are 2,100 open Machine Learning Engineer roles on LinkedIn, worldwide. Of those, around 80 are at the FAANGs.", "To be fair, if we include general data science and AI researcher roles, there are 86,000 total open positions worldwide. Nonetheless, calling data science \u201ccompetitive\u201d would be the understatement of the year.", "In business, a competitive field is referred to as a \u201cred ocean,\u201d where sharks are battling it out in a crowded space. In contrast, a \u201cblue ocean\u201d refers to unexplored, competitor-free market spaces.", "As a prospective data scientist, your goal is to compete in the blue ocean. Here are four ways to do so.", "I\u2019m a LinkedIn superfan. In fact, I\u2019ve been featured by LinkedIn after taking 100+ LinkedIn learning courses, I\u2019ve made posts with over 10,000 comments, and I have over 20,000 connections. That being said, relying solely on LinkedIn is a red ocean strategy (\u26a0\ufe0f).", "LinkedIn boasts around two-thirds of a billion users. That means if you solely network on LinkedIn, and apply for jobs through LinkedIn, you\u2019re competing with an incredible amount of people.", "As someone who has used LinkedIn to hire people, good job postings can get flooded with so many applicants, so quickly, that it\u2019s hard to even skim through all the applications, let alone give feedback to everyone.", "That\u2019s why, in addition to LinkedIn, I\u2019d recommend that you also use niche platforms, like Shapr, Y Combinator\u2019s Work At A Startup, Lunchclub.AI (note: this is my own invite link, but I don\u2019t get paid), Slack communities like Wizards, as well as offline communities on Meetup or Eventbrite.", "Tight-knit communities make it far easier to stand out. Shapr and Lunchclub, for instance, are professional networks completely focused on creating one-on-one connections.", "I once met a conference-goer who joked that \u201cnetworking is the new way of saying not-working.\u201d As amusing as that was, I also met a new client at that event.", "Networking is similar to the first point, but here I\u2019m referring explicitly to when it\u2019s time to apply for a job.", "You\u2019ve probably heard stories of people submitting hundreds of job applications and not getting a peep back. Maybe you\u2019ve been a victim of that phenomenon yourself.", "While some people do land jobs this way, it\u2019s increasingly likely that submitting your CV on some job portal means you\u2019ll never get a reply back. As I mentioned, hiring managers are getting absolutely flooded with applicants.", "It\u2019s like tossing your CV in a black hole.", "Ask yourself: If you had to decide who to hire, between a complete stranger, and someone who you were introduced to, who would you pick?", "As a result, hiring managers and executives almost always go with the applicant that they have some connection with, even if it\u2019s just an introduction by a mutual acquaintance.", "The more you network, the more mutual connections you\u2019ll have with potential employers, and the easier it\u2019ll be to get an introduction.", "Here\u2019s a super simple template you could use to ask a mutual connection for an intro:", "First, engage with their latest posts, then message.", "I hope you\u2019re doing well. Since we\u2019re in the same industry, and have a mutual connection with [@name] at [@company], I was hoping you could introduce me over LinkedIn. I recently applied for their [job posting title].", "I wrote a draft message you can copy/paste to them for an easy intro:", "I noticed you\u2019re hiring for a [job posting title].", "I\u2019d like introduce you to [@ Frederik Bussler] as a potential candidate, who has [achievement_1] and [achievement_2] in the space. Frederik\u2019s interested in speaking with you about the position. Would you like a quick intro?", "Data science is a multidisciplinary field, and a large component is domain expertise.", "For example, Walmart uses predictive models to anticipate demand at certain hours. If a hiring manager for a data scientist role had to choose between a \u201cPython expert\u201d and an \u201cexpert in predictive modeling for retail,\u201d obviously the more specialized candidate would win, all else being equal.", "Amazon\u2019s recommendation engine is responsible for up to 35% of Amazon\u2019s revenue, and they\u2019re constantly hiring data science talent to grow this golden goose. If you\u2019ve worked on recommendation engines \u2014 even just as a side project \u2014 that\u2019d give you an edge over a more generalist applicant.", "Learning specialized skills \u2014 which specialty depends on your personal interests \u2014 is a game-changer.", "Certificates are all the rage in 2020. If you use LinkedIn, you\u2019ve surely noticed the infamous \u201ccertification post.\u201d", "Users show off their certificates from Coursera, EdX, online-learning portals, LinkedIn Learning, and a million other sources. I\u2019m guilty of this as well \u2014 as I mentioned, I\u2019ve taken 100+ LinkedIn Learning courses, and received certificates from almost every Ivy League.", "That being said, relying on certificates is a red ocean strategy (\u26a0\ufe0f). When millions of people have the same certificates as you, then you need differentiators.", "Practical projects, where you analyze data that you\u2019re interested in, will give you a massive edge.", "For inspiration, you can look to the data science career trends dashboard mentioned above and other public workspaces.", "Data Science is an increasingly competitive field, but you can stand out by using niche platforms, growing your professional network, specializing in an area that interests you, and sharing unique projects with the world.", "Your home for data science.
