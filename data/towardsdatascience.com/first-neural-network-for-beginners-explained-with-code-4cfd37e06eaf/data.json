Based on nature\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["So you want to create your first artificial neural network, or simply discover this subject, but have no idea where to begin ? Follow this quick guide to understand all the steps !", "Based on nature, neural networks are the usual representation we make of the brain : neurons interconnected to other neurons which forms a network. A simple information transits in a lot of them before becoming an actual thing, like \u201cmove the hand to pick up this pencil\u201d.", "The operation of a complete neural network is straightforward : one enter variables as inputs (for example an image if the neural network is supposed to tell what is on an image), and after some calculations, an output is returned (following the first example, giving an image of a cat should return the word \u201ccat\u201d).", "Now, you should know that artificial neural network are usually put on columns, so that a neuron of the column n can only be connected to neurons from columns n-1 and n+1. There are few types of networks that use a different architecture, but we will focus on the simplest for now.", "So, we can represent an artificial neural network like that :", "Neural networks can usually be read from left to right. Here, the first layer is the layer in which inputs are entered. There are 2 internals layers (called hidden layers) that do some math, and one last layer that contains all the possible outputs. Don\u2019t bother with the \u201c+1\u201ds at the bottom of every columns. It is something called \u201cbias\u201d and we\u2019ll talk about that later.", "By the way, the term \u201cdeep learning\u201d comes from neural networks that contains several hidden layers, also called \u201cdeep neural networks\u201d . The Figure 1 can be considered as one.", "The operations done by each neurons are pretty simple :", "First, it adds up the value of every neurons from the previous column it is connected to. On the Figure 2, there are 3 inputs (x1, x2, x3) coming to the neuron, so 3 neurons of the previous column are connected to our neuron.", "This value is multiplied, before being added, by another variable called \u201cweight\u201d (w1, w2, w3) which determines the connection between the two neurons. Each connection of neurons has its own weight, and those are the only values that will be modified during the learning process.", "Moreover, a bias value may be added to the total value calculated. It is not a value coming from a specific neuron and is chosen before the learning phase, but can be useful for the network.", "After all those summations, the neuron finally applies a function called \u201cactivation function\u201d to the obtained value.", "The so-called activation function usually serves to turn the total value calculated before to a number between 0 and 1 (done for example by a sigmoid function shown by Figure 3). Other function exist and may change the limits of our function, but keeps the same aim of limiting the value.", "That\u2019s all a neuron does ! Take all values from connected neurons multiplied by their respective weight, add them, and apply an activation function. Then, the neuron is ready to send its new value to other neurons.", "After every neurons of a column did it, the neural network passes to the next column. In the end, the last values obtained should be one usable to determine the desired output.", "Now that we understand what a neuron does, we could possibly create any network we want. However, there are other operations to implement to make a neural network learn.", "Yep, creating variables and making them interact with each other is great, but that is not enough to make the whole neural network learn by itself. We need to prepare a lot of data to give to our network. Those data include the inputs and the output expected from the neural network.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how the learning process works :", "First of all, remember that when an input is given to the neural network, it returns an output. On the first try, it can\u2019t get the right output by its own (except with luck) and that is why, during the learning phase, every inputs come with its label, explaining what output the neural network should have guessed. If the choice is the good one, actual parameters are kept and the next input is given. However, if the obtained output doesn\u2019t match the label, weights are changed. Those are the only variables that can be changed during the learning phase. This process may be imagined as multiple buttons, that are turned into different possibilities every times an input isn\u2019t guessed correctly.", "To determine which weight is better to modify, a particular process, called \u201cbackpropagation\u201d is done. We won\u2019t linger too much on that, since the neural network we will build doesn\u2019t use this exact process, but it consists on going back on the neural network and inspect every connection to check how the output would behave according to a change on the weight.", "Finally, there is a last parameter to know to be able to control the way the neural network learns : the \u201clearning rate\u201d. The name says it all, this new value determines on what speed the neural network will learn, or more specifically how it will modify a weight, little by little or by bigger steps. 1 is generally a good value for that parameter.", "Okay, we know the basics, let\u2019s check about the neural network we will create. The one explained here is called a Perceptron and is the first neural network ever created. It consists on 2 neurons in the inputs column and 1 neuron in the output column. This configuration allows to create a simple classifier to distinguish 2 groups. To better understand the possibilities and the limitations, let\u2019s see a quick example (which doesn\u2019t have much interest except to understand) :", "Let\u2019s say you want your neural network to be able to return outputs according to the rules of the \u201cinclusive or\u201d. Reminder :", "If you replace the \u201ctrue\u201ds by 1 and the \u201cfalse\u201ds by 0 and put the 4 possibilities as points with coordinates on a plan, then you realize the two final groups \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201ctrue\u201d may be separated by a single line. This is what a Perceptron can do.", "On the other hand, if we check the case of the \u201cexclusive or\u201d (in which the case \u201ctrue or true\u201d (the point (1,1)) is false), then we can see that a simple line cannot separate the two groups, and a Perceptron isn\u2019t able to deal with this problem.", "So, the Perceptron is indeed not a very efficient neural network, but it is simple to create and may still be useful as a classifier.", "Let\u2019s create a neural network from scratch with Python (3.x in the example below).", "The beginning of the program just defines libraries and the values of the parameters, and creates a list which contains the values of the weights that will be modified (those are generated randomly).", "Here we create a function which defines the work of the output neuron. It takes 3 parameters (the 2 values of the neurons and the expected output). \u201coutputP\u201d is the variable corresponding to the output given by the Perceptron. Then we calculate the error, used to modify the weights of every connections to the output neuron right after.", "We create a loop that makes the neural network repeat every situation several times. This part is the learning phase. The number of iteration is chosen according to the precision we want. However, be aware that too much iterations could lead the network to over-fitting, which causes it to focus too much on the treated examples, so it couldn\u2019t get a right output on case it didn\u2019t see during its learning phase.", "However, our case here is a bit special, since there are only 4 possibilities, and we give the neural network all of them during its learning phase. A Perceptron is supposed to give a correct output without having ever seen the case it is treating.", "Finally, we can ask the user to enter himself the values to check if the Perceptron is working. This is the testing phase.", "The activation function Heaviside is interesting to use in this case, since it takes back all values to exactly 0 or 1, since we are looking for a false or true result. We could try with a sigmoid function and obtain a decimal number between 0 and 1, normally very close to one of those limits.", "We could also save the weights that the neural network just calculated in a file, to use it later without making another learning phase. It is done for way bigger project, in which that phase can last days or weeks.", "That\u2019s it ! You\u2019ve done your own complete neural network. You created it, made it learn, and checked its capacities. Your Perceptron can now be modified to use it on another problem. Just change the points given during the iterations, adjust the number of loop if your case is more complex, and just let your Perceptron do the classification.", "Do you want to list 2 types of trees in the nearest forest and be able to determine if a new tree is type A or B ? Chose 2 features that can dissociate both types (for example height and width), and create some points for the Perceptron to place on the plan. Let it deduct a way to separate the 2 groups, and enter any new tree\u2019s point to know which type it is.", "You could later expand your knowledge and see about bigger and deeper neural network, that are very powerful !", "There are multiple aspects we didn\u2019t treat, or just enough for you to get the basics, so don\u2019t hesitate to go further. I would love to write about more complex neural networks so stay tuned !", "I hope this little guide was useful, if you have any question and/or suggestion, let me know in the comments.", "Your home for data science.
