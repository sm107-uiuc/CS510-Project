Instagram is probably one of the best examples in our daily lives. We open the app and see dozens of stories and swipe through them. We do not even spend the time to watch the stories of the people we follow from beginning to end, we just click through them. When we are finished, the dull feeling remains that what others do is simply greater than what we do. And this happens day after day, hour after hour, even minute after minute.", "The wheel that forces us to process more information in less time spins also faster in our data science careers. I think most of you will agree that we are required to process new content day in day out. In a standard workday, we start with a team meeting, where we allocate the work that needs to be done during the day. Next, we review the code of one of our coworkers, which we need to understand in order to identify possible bugs. Afterwards, we spend some time coding and need to develop a brief understanding of the architecture of whatever we are currently implementing. We get stuck in what we tried to develop and come across an interesting paper, which might solve our problem. Further, we are supposed to document each commit or product update, such that we know even after months, which output change was caused by adding, deleting or modifying which line of code.", "All this is a lot of information to deal with and a lot of possible headaches, if we are not able to structure the content well. In order to keep up with the above circumstances, I developed a minimalistic note taking system, which really made my life less stressful. I strongly propose that structuring different incentives that arrive in our daily lives will make us more productive as data scientists and more relaxed in our overall lives, since all the information that our brains tried to keep is in the location where it belongs. And our brain can then continue to do this what it is actually supposed to be doing, since \u201cyour mind is for having ideas, not holding them\u201d (David Allen).", "Therefore, I want to share my fairly simple note taking system with you in the next sections.", "A few years ago as a student, I had lots of notebooks each one for a different purpose. Although I had lots of space where I wanted to write down my ideas and memories, I ended up writing down nothing because the pressure that everything is stored such as it should be was way too high. And I felt almost a little angry, if I thought in the retrospective that some notes were actually supposed to be in different notebooks. Therefore, I made a cut and decided to radically simplify my note taking. Now, I am using only one notebook and when it is full, I\u2019ll use the next one. I only make sure that I list dates carefully. By this, I will hopefully know afterwards when I started and when I finished the notebook. I tend to keep my current notebook as well as the last one and I throw away the ones before. That turned out to be the best for me. However, using one notebook for data science purposes instead of a dozen in parallel really simplified my daily work a lot.", "For simplification reasons I also use a classic paper notebook rather than an iPad for my daily notes. I want to have my notebook as easily accessible as possible. Using an iPad always caused delay through technical problems like that there was no internet connection to access my cloud to see the last notes or my Apple pencil was out of battery. Now, I always have my one notebook and a single pen next to me and write down everything that comes to my mind. Further, I also have a stack of post-its ready to write down some to-dos. I try to separate them from my remaining notes, because sometimes to-dos take longer than they should initially and I can easily move the post-it to the next side of my notebook if I need to. So I make sure that I do not forget anything.", "As you know by now, I own an iPad. For a long period I thought it would be a black or white decision, whether to use pen and paper or Apple pencil and iPad. But now I try to make the best out of both worlds. Whereas I described in the last section that one of my key requirements for note taking is to be very flexible and I therefore prefer a classic paper notebook over an iPad, I want to describe in this section when I prefer iPads over classic notebooks.", "I think the best way to learn is to create something on your own. What do I mean with that? If you read an interesting paper or attend a conference, there will be some important take-aways. The longest period in my life, I stored everything I have ever read (mostly physically) and while I was reading I marked certain sentences that appeared important or interesting to me. But the problem was that I never looked at it again and practically I overlooked most of the important key messages. When I now read a paper, I mostly read it simply on the computer. I use Adobe Reader to highlight certain parts and comment on them. When I am finished, I take out my iPad and use my highlights and comments to create a summary. It does not matter how complex the subject was, I always make sure that I get all the information I want to remember on one single page. Afterwards, I save this page in my cloud. By the way, I do the same for every book I read.", "There are three reasons why I use this technique:", "First, I want to make sure that I actively revise everything that I have read. By condensing everything to one page I must ensure that I understand the key concepts. Although I have a mathematical background and derivations lie in my particular interest, I tend to include them only if it is really necessary. I rather make sure that I understand everything and that I am able to explain it in my own words.", "The second reason is: by only having one page per paper or book my inner threshold of revision a few days later is smaller than having tons of pages to go through or even read the whole paper again, in case I have only marked a few sections while reading it the first time. If I revise my one-pager and miss some particular concept I am still willing to open up the paper again but then only the particular section. I wish I did the same thing during my master thesis. At this time, I wrote down everything in my lab book. But to be honest, after finishing my thesis, I never looked in there again. After a few months creating one-pagers, I find myself remembering a lot more and have less resilience to access the information again.", "This brings me directly to the third reason: It is important for me to access my reading information from anywhere. Therefore, the digital approach with iPad and Apple pencil is the dominant approach for me here. Another pro using an iPad in general is that at least my notes look a little cleaner than handwritten notes, since I can rearrange different sections afterwards. This feature is very handy, especially if you are very limited to space.", "Maybe a last little digression on why I only use handwriting for my note taking instead of for example LaTeX. First of all, I feel like I remember more if I write things down by hand and second, I am simply faster with handwriting and more flexible than with TeX. Although, if you are pretty sure to reuse your concepts in your thesis or articles, it might be useful to directly write them on your computer.", "To end up today\u2019s article, I\u2019ll save you the time to summarize it by giving you the key concepts I\u2019d like to emphasize:", "Your home for data science.
