Getting its name from the DevOps movement that emerged a decade ago, ML Ops attempts to provide a continual improvement process to Machine Learning. As Dev Ops is now fairly well established by early adopters, and the evidence of the business value it delivers grows clearer, it is tempting to apply the solutions from DevOps directly to Machine Learning teams.", "For successful implementation of this approach, however, it is necessary to have an understanding of the early lessons from DevOps and the nature of the problem it sought to solve.", "Prior to the DevOps movement, development traditionally consisted of development teams working on features independently before delivering changes in large packages for operations teams to test and deploy.", "The two teams were self-isolated with separate goals and skill sets; Development teams were working on new features, whereas Operations teams were working to improve the performance of the system as a whole.", "Visualizing the teams as separate entities with distinct goals and activities created a metaphorical wall between them, preventing each one from having an understanding of the other team\u2019s frustrations and blocks. What you cannot see, you cannot understand or seek to remedy.", "In order to transform this approach and enable the more cohesive method of operation we know as DevOps, a change of mindset was required. Common points of reference were recognised on both sides of the wall. Despite differences in working practices and skill sets, both teams share a desire for a more smooth deployment and release procedure and a feeling of being more connected to the business goals through improved feedback.", "Establishing this common ground between both teams led to the changes in practice with which DevOps is synonymous.", "The removal of the wall between teams allowed a greater understanding of the entirety of systems, as well as allowing for feedback and improvements to be easily disseminated between teams. Users, too, benefited from this change as employees across both teams were now more responsive to their needs.", "For example, a feature that made a database run more slowly would previously have been seen as an operations problem, but with a DevOps mindset, it became everyone\u2019s problem and is solved collaboratively.", "The Dev Ops report from 2018 and 2019 shows that a change to a DevOps mindset directly provides measurable business value since it gives equal importance to internal and external requirements. The skill set between the two teams now has a huge amount of overlap with development, test and production environments becoming considered almost the same.", "In the field of Machine Learning, where currently only about 10% of projects actually deliver business value, there is clearly a need for a similar revolution. The term MLOps, has only been in wide usage since 2017, and so is not as well documented or defined as DevOps, but essentially, the aim of MLOps is to deliver the same kind of value to Machine Learning as DevOps did to Development and Operations.", "For those of us working in Machine Learning, we may aspire to a harmonious future in which we have a fully automated CI/CD system for machine learning, where we have multi-skilled staff who understand each other\u2019s needs and goals and treat them equally.", "More importantly, we would like Machine Learning to be able to drive business value, by adapting to the needs quickly, and to catch issues quickly. In our vision of the future, it should be easy for a well-equipped MLOps team to identify and fix issues in data/algorithms/models as well as quickly adapting to both business needs and data skew through an easy to use ML Platform.", "In order to get there, teams need to appreciate the journey towards mutual understanding that DevOps involved, and resist trying to skip to the happy ending outlined above. There are bigger hurdles to overcome in the meantime, and jumping straight to a solution without taking the time to understand the true nature of the \u2018wall\u2019 will fail to resolve the fundamental issues. First, we need to identify the existing problems so that we can avoid the potential pitfalls and deliver.", "Generally in Machine Learning projects, a number of teams and skills are required. We can broadly split this into two groups of people, each having different requirements and goals, in the same way as we split Developers and Operations Experts earlier.", "Researchers & Data Scientists want to leverage the Data gathered by the business to solve a complex problem. Their concern is the performance of the solution, with metrics like Precision and Recall, model size or training costs.", "Developers & Engineers are more traditional and generally, work according to the DevOps principles we laid out earlier. Their main focus will be on goals like throughput, latency reduction, cost reduction, feature enhancements.", "The wall above can exist in a number of different forms. Anything which stops integration between Research interests and Development/Operational interests can contribute to this wall. For example:", "Code Forks / Repositories for Engineers", "Generally, the business goal for each of these two teams will be the same. As with DevOps, both teams wanted less frustration with developing and deploying solutions to the business. I.e. more time working on items which deliver business value, less time with the frustrating overhead.", "The common ground in Machine Learning generally comes down to two things: data and code.", "Data is by far the most important asset which any company trying to harness Machine Learning needs to get a good handle on. Entire companies can be lost simply by how they handled data. Using data as a common ground is a tricky process, usually requiring monolithic data lakes or complex schema which can be difficult to understand.", "However, not having this unification creates a wall between the Research and Engineering teams. If data from production systems cannot easily flow, in the same format into training data, then fully realizing MLOps will be increasingly more complicated.", "Similarly, codebase can be a wall which can threaten to hamper the progress towards an MLOps solution. Having separated repositories for \u201clive\u201d and \u201cresearch\u201d, separate forks for repositories, all cause more issues in fully adopting MLOps than they solve in the short term. A lot of this comes down to differing standards between Researchers and Engineers. Where Researchers need to iterate quickly, test hypothesis, and create minimal solutions, Engineers want to see robust, scalable, well tested and organized code.", "You must find a middle ground, which all members of the company can agree on, universally, so that standards are consistent across the company. This has the added benefit of saving on frustration between teams, as they will undoubtedly see their own standards as \u201cbetter\u201d than those of the code they are handed. This creates animosity between teams, which can reinforce the wall.", "Frequently, we hear that Researchers are not allowed to access Engineering resources, participate in discussions or have access to production driven data in its entirety. Similarly, Engineers are not enabled to participate in the conceptual discussions, or access training systems, and so have no buy-in when presented with the decided solution. Ultimately, this comes down to trust. Do you trust your staff members and your fellow teams to do the right thing? Do they feel able to ask questions without being berated or ignored?", "I will go over a few of these in greater detail in future articles, but for now, we can sum up the vital steps necessary for an easier transition into MLOps.", "Your home for data science.
