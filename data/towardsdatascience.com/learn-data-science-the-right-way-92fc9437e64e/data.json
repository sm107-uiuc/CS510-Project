As the \u201csexiest job of the 21st century\u201d and stirring up images of AI, machine learning, magic and more, data science is revolutionizing the ways in which we interact with information. For the casual technologist, seasoned data professional, or anyone in-between, adding data science skills to your repertoire can be very lucrative. But where should you begin?", "If you\u2019re like me, asking Google \u201chow to learn data science\u201d will send you into a tailspin. Articles boasting data science mastery in \u201c8 easy steps\u201d contradict entire PhD programs devoted to the art. Python enthusiasts and R fanatics battle it out for \u201cbest computing language for data science\u201d, while Julia makes a foray. Database technologies tout efficient storage and retrieval methods like MySQL, Postgres, MongoDB and Cassandra to interact with bits/bytes, but differ by application. Tableau was recently purchased by SalesForce for almost $16 billion dollars, yet embedded plotting libraries and front-end frameworks make data visualization free and easy.", "Because there are so many opinionated, insightful voices reverberating throughout the realm of data science, I don\u2019t feel guilty adding just one more instrument to the orchestra.

I\u2019ll discuss my favorite open source resources, platforms and frameworks (oh my!) that can jumpstart your journey or keep the embers burning. If this time in COVID-19 quarantine has taught us anything, it\u2019s that online education and e-learning tools have limitless potential for elevating the average technologist. There\u2019s literally no better time to pickup a new skill or hone your hobby.", "Before diving in, let\u2019s quickly define what \u2018data science\u2019 really is:", "Data Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician. \u2014 Josh Wills via Twitter", "Regardless of how you feel about this definition, it illustrates the aura of ambiguity that surrounds data science. How much statistics does the average software engineer really know? How many engineering projects has the average statistician worked on? Personally, I don\u2019t think it matters. The field is constantly shifting to include new technologies, obsoleting outdated ones, and encouraging burgeoning domains to join the party. So as long as you are committed to the pursuit of learning and building, I believe you\u2019re well on your way.", "Still don\u2019t believe me? Take a look at any number of job postings for data science, and you\u2019ll find basic requirements ranging from PhD in advanced algorithm design to anyone with a HS diploma and relevant experience. 10 years of project-based work using specific technology combats another posting for an entry level, college graduate with a degree in mathematics. Fluency in Python, R, Scala, COBOL, etc. versus anyone with experience embracing ambiguity using code.", "I recently went to a conference where the brilliant Dick De Veaux used this diagram (or one similar) to convey his definition for data science.", "Professor De Veaux used terms like \u2018predictive analytics\u2019, \u2018machine learning\u2019, \u2018data science\u2019 and \u2018artificial intelligence\u2019 interchangeably, justifying his loose nomenclature with funny examples that prove just how nebulous the subject can be. I like this diagram because it leaves room for agility and movement: if you\u2019re comfortable with one subject, simply delve into another.", "I definitely don\u2019t mean to nullify the awesome accomplishments of those data scientists out there with advanced degrees and relevant experience.

A colleague of mine recently suggested the Internet Archive to fill up some quarantine time, and I haven\u2019t looked back! You can download and/or checkout high caliber ML / AI textbooks to continue your research or dive into new topics.", "Python is by far my favorite programming language, due to its simplicity and boundless community support, and I\u2019m always surprised by the quality Python resources offered for free. Python is a great language to introduce programming concepts if you\u2019re new to the field; if you\u2019re a veteran, learning or refreshing the Python fundamentals will only improve your marketability.", "Although I haven\u2019t stepped through all of the free courses listed below (and neither should you!), these are some of the most popular and highly rated resources deserving of your attention \ud83d\udcda.", "I keep a 1TB external hard drive with me at all times, chock full of programming textbooks, PDF\u2019s, cheat sheets, and more.

Swirl teaches you R programming and data science interactively, at your own pace, and right in the R console. All you need to do is download R, setup RStudio, install swirl, and get started! As someone infinitely more comfortable with Python, this tool has really helped me expand my horizons and comfortability with RStudio (a preferred IDE for R developers).", "If you haven\u2019t used GitHub before, git started \ud83d\ude09! For those independent data scientists out there building cool automation scripts / ML projects, GitHub offers a great place to store and share your code. If you work on a team, chances are you\u2019ve used similar tools to collaborate and manage production code. GitHub is the online platform (although a desktop application can be downloaded) for creating repositories and sharing code; git lives in your terminal and communicates with GitHub much more efficiently.", "For newcomers I recommend Git Started with GitHub for a crash-course into the basics, including installation. If you\u2019re familiar with GitHub but want to get more acquainted with the terminal, checkout this Bash Shell Tutorial to learn more efficient command-line essentials.

Regardless on your language(s) of choice, your IDE really sets the mood for any professional or personal code development and should be customized to fit your unique coding needs. Data science projects rely on multiple languages, frameworks and platforms working together seamlessly; I recommend Visual Studio Code to streamline your operation. They have a fantastic how-to guide for effective data science set-up \ud83d\udc47.", "You may also be interested in Docker for containerizing development environments. If you plan on building and sharing code, but Docker isn\u2019t quite what you\u2019re looking for, I highly recommend software like Kubernetes or Anaconda Cloud.", "Pro-tip: if you have a few minutes to spare, spend 12 minutes learning Docker basics and level-up your next project.", "Data visualization is a critical component of any data science deployment, responsible for converting data insights into consumable observations. All your hard work extracting, cleaning and modeling data might be wasted with a bad visualization; conversely, a great viz can catalyze actionable insights and build trust, invoke curiosity, invigorate projects, and so much more.", "Tableau makes it easy to arrange beautiful metrics, limited only by your imagination.

I literally recommend this book to every non-technical Manager / Director / VP I work with for an immediate boost.", "Once you feel more comfortable flexing your data science muscles, you\u2019ll probably want to communicate and share with other like-minded technologists. GitHub, Medium, StackOverflow and others are fantastic places to start connecting with people, but might leave you craving more professional, curated content. Enter ACM, or the Association for Computing Machinery, offering membership to \u201cthe world\u2019s largest educational and scientific computing society\u201d. It\u2019s like the Toastmasters for data science.", "You can also visit their digital library, which is included in the cost of membership, to search for relevant resources in any computing subject.", "This is at the top-end of paid resources, so if you\u2019re new to data science or can keep busy with the other courses and textbooks I\u2019ve referenced, it\u2019s probably in your best interest to hold off. That being said, if you\u2019re an academic or desperate for cutting-edge references \u2014 this is definitely for you!", "Pro-tip: Safari Online Learning is included as a perk of ACM membership! So if you\u2019re looking to maximize your dollar, ACM membership is the way to go.", "Expedited programming bootcamps boasting saturated curricula are taking the world by storm. Chances are, if you\u2019ve been researching data science and perusing online courses, you\u2019ve come across a bootcamp or two that offer to quickly boost your data science status from zero to hero. But are bootcamps worth the price-tag?", "I argue it\u2019s more about the journey than the destination, but I\u2019m biased. I work as a Teaching Assistant (T.A) for a prominent Data Analytics / Data Science Bootcamp here in Minneapolis, MN, focused on empowering students with bleeding-edge technical skills. It\u2019s definitely a \u201cmile-wide, meter-thick\u201d approach to the multi-faceted world of data science. We cover so many relevant topics along the way (6 month cycles) that it forces each student to embrace ambiguity and focus on their problem-solving approach instead of finding the \u201cperfect\u201d solution. And that\u2019s because there are no perfect solutions for problems that are constantly shifting, only solutions that work efficiently, beautifully and sustainably with room to grow.", "It\u2019s not for everyone. But if you put in the effort and commit yourself to learning, you\u2019ll gain invaluable skills, a dedicated project portfolio, open-source tools to tackle any problem, and confidence to boot. Pretty awesome stuff in my opinion.", "I\u2019ll step off my soapbox and recommend Trilogy Education: they offer an array of bootcamp options that can be completed part-time or full-time. Before you spend any money \u2014 ask to audit a class, check out the full curriculum, speak with a past student and/or professor, etc. to get a better idea of what ROI you can expect.", "To re-iterate: these bootcamps make money because most of us don\u2019t have the resources to build and vet our own immersive curriculum. If you want an expedited journey, chock full of supplemental resources and support to keep you motivated, then a bootcamp might be the right option.", "Since you\u2019re reading this article, you\u2019re already well acquainted with Medium. Give yourself a pat on the back! I found Medium somewhat serendipitously and was *shocked* by the breadth and depth of publications. If you haven\u2019t already, become a member and update your preferences so that Medium can provide you with great custom content.", "My favorite publication on Medium is Towards Data Science. It\u2019s been a personal goal of mine to get published @here, so I\u2019m quite proud to have been vetted their publication staff and approved. If you have something interesting to say or simply too much time on your hands, put pen to paper\u2026or fingers to keyboard?
