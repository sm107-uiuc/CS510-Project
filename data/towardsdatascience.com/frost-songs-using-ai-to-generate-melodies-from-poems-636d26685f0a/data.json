In this article, I\u2019ll show how his poems can be used to improve the structure, phrasing, and emotional content of computer-generated music. For example, here is the first verse from one of Frost\u2019s more famous poems from his book, New Hampshire [2].", "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening (excerpted)Whose woods these are I think I know.His house is in the village, though;He will not see me stopping hereTo watch his woods fill up with snow.\u2026- Robert Frost", "And here\u2019s an AI-generated song based on the first four lines of the poem.", "In this article, I will start with a little background on recent developments in AI-based music generation, then I\u2019ll describe the system I created and discuss the components, including the Lyrics-to-Melody AI model from Yi Yu, et al. [6] and Google\u2019s Music Transformer model [7]. I\u2019ll then walk through an example of generating a song from a Frost poem, and present a collection of other generated songs.", "For the last five months, I have been looking at the ways Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) can be used for creative endeavors. For example, I showed how Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be used to create new abstract paintings, here. And I showed how Transformer models can be used to generate new plot summaries for novels, here.", "Although the state-of-the-art AI models can generate excellent pictures and words, so far, AI models have not been as good when it comes to composing songs. Some of the music generating models are OK, like the various Magenta models from Google [3], the MuseNet model from OpenAI [4], and the commercial offering from AIVA [5]. But the output from most music generating AI models is often rambling and incoherent. What seems to be lacking is an overall structure for the songs. Let\u2019s see if we can remedy this with an infusion of lyrical poetry.", "The first of two major systems I used is the Lyrics-to-Melody AI model which was designed and trained by Yi Yu and her associates. They call it the Conditional LSTM-GAN for Melody Generation from Lyrics [6].", "The system was trained with ~12K MIDI songs with lyrics. It uses the words and their syllables as inputs and is trained to predict the notes, durations, and rest durations of the music as the outputs. Here is the analysis of five bars of \u201cI\u2019ve Been Working on the Railroad\u201d to show the inputs in yellow and the expected outputs in blue. Notice how the rest after the word \u201cday\u201d is associated with the next syllable, \u201cI\u2019ve\u201d.", "The second major system I used is the Music Transformer [7] that is part of Google\u2019s Magenta suite of trained AI models. The model automatically generates musical accompaniment for a given melody. It was trained on ~400 chorales by Johann Sebastian Bach and 1,100 performances captured by expert pianists as part of Yamaha\u2019s annual e-Piano Competition [8].", "Here\u2019s a component diagram that shows the flow through the system, starting with a poem as text on the left, and producing a new song as a MIDI file on the right.", "Each line of a selected poem is fed into the system, one line at a time. It uses a module named Pyphen to break each word in the line into syllables using the Hunspell hyphenation dictionary [9]. The results are fed into the Lyrics-to-Melody model. The model is a hybrid between a GAN and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model which generates notes in MIDI format.", "The resulting musical phrase is analyzed using MIT\u2019s Music21 library [10] to determine which key it is in. The phrase is then transposed to C major (or A Minor) and quantized to sixteenth notes using Music21. After all of the lines of music are generated, the resulting MIDI file is fed into the Music Transformer model, which adds an accompanying musical part and creates a human feel with expressive keyboard velocity and timing.", "Finally, Google\u2019s Magenta library [11] is used to do some post-processing on the final MIDI file, like assigning instrument voices.", "In the next section, I will walk through the steps in more detail and will show the Python code I wrote for the custom processing.", "For the walkthrough, we\u2019ll use a short, complete poem by Frost, called \u201cPlowmen\u201d [12]. I\u2019ll show the key snippets of Python code used to turn this poem into a song.", "The first step in processing involves breaking each word into syllables and creating word embeddings to be fed into the LSTM-GAN.", "PlowmenA plow, they say, to plow the snow.They cannot mean to plant it, no\u2013Unless in bitterness to mockAt having cultivated rock.- Robert Frost", "Here is the code snippet that breaks up each word into syllables, and feeds them into the LSTM-GAN. You can see that it creates and sends in embeddings for both the words and syllables using Word2Vec [13]. According to Google, \u201cEmbeddings learned through Word2Vec have proven to be successful on a variety of downstream natural language processing tasks.\u201d", "You can also see how I deal with words that are not in the dictionary for the embeddings. If a word is not in the dictionary, I simply substitute the correct number of syllables with \u201cla\u201d. This is a tradition for songwriters when they haven\u2019t written all the lyrics, yet.", "Here are the sets of syllables for the lines in the poem.", "You can see that the words \u201cmock\u201d and \u201ccultivated\u201d got turned into \u201cla\u201ds.", "Once the embeddings are set up for the words and syllables, it\u2019s fairly easy to generate a melody. Here\u2019s the code.", "The length_song variable is set to the number of syllables being passed in for the line of text. The model is hard-coded to take in 20 syllables, so the code will limit the input, and, if necessary, pad the input by repeating the last syllable. Note that this padding will be ignored by the model, and we will get out a vector of notes that equals the number of syllables in the line. Here is the melody.", "The output from the LSTM-GAN is pretty good, but there are some issues: the music is not quantized and the key changes on every line. The original code for the LSTM-GAN system has functions to \u201cdiscretize\u201d the melodies and transpose them to a uniform key. But I chose to use the Music21 library to perform these functions.", "The code below shows how I quantize each note to sixteenth notes (lines 12 and 13) and extend the last note to the end of a measure (line 22).", "You can also see how I transpose each line to be in the key of C using Music21 (line 27 calling the function at line 3). Here is the generated melody.", "The next step is to pass the melody into the Music Transformer to create an accompanying track, and to give the melody a more human feel. Here\u2019s the code.", "The first 11 lines of code will set up the transformer. The rest of the code takes in a note sequence called melody_ns and generates an accompanying track with the original melody merged into accompaniment_ns.", "The final steps of processing are to assign the musical instruments and create an ending by holding the last notes for an extra measure. Here\u2019s the code for the final steps.", "Because the timing of the original melody gets changed in the transformer, I had to write a little function to map the closest notes between the two sequences. I then use the function to find the changed notes to set the instrument to guitar. The last block of code holds the last five notes for an extra measure. This is a little trick to signal the end of the song.", "The accompaniment from the Music Transformer really adds depth and color to the piece. The model also gives the piece a more human feel by varying the start times and velocity of the MIDI notes.", "In general, this approach to music generation produces decent results.", "After transposing and fixing up the timing of the lines of melody, the LSTM-GAN seems to produce good melodies for the poems. Poetry has qualities that make good music, like meter, structure, and lyrical flow. The LSTM-GAN gets both the syllables for the meter and the words for the meaning as inputs. Qualities from both of the inputs lead to good melodies. Note that this model is very consistent, in that it will generate nearly the same melody given the same input text.", "The Music Transformer, however, is a bit hit-and-miss. The output for the same input melody varies a lot. Some of the resulting accompaniment is not good at all; most of it is OK; but occasionally it creates a musical part that is very creative and quite excellent!", "There are more finished songs in the appendix, so be sure to check them out.", "In this post, I explained how I created an AI system to generate songs based on the poetry of Robert Frost. The system is based largely on other people\u2019s work, primarily the LSTM-GAN by Yi Yu and associates and the Music Transformer by researchers at Google.", "All source code for this project is available on GitHub, here. You can experiment with the code using this Google Colab. The sources are released under the CC BY-SA license.", "I would like to thank Yi Yu, Jennifer Lim, and Oliver Strimpel for their help with this project.", "Future work would include using the initial key determined by the LSTM-GAN, and not forcing everything into C maj / A min. Also, the tempo could be determined using something like the median line length of the poem, e.g. more syllables = faster tempo.", "And there is an entire world of poetry that could be fed into the system to see what types of songs the system would create.", "[5] AIVA, \u201cThe Artificial Intelligence composing emotional soundtrack music\u201d, 2016, www.aiva.ai", "[13] T.
