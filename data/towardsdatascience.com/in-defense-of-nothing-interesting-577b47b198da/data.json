The presentation went fine and the work was well-received, but I could tell the group was a little underwhelmed. Towards the end of the presentation, one co-worker asked, \u201cDid you find anything that surprised you? Anything we didn\u2019t already know?\u201d", "I had uncovered some new information, but most of what I\u2019d found was well-aligned with what we already thought to be true. Still, I understood their sentiment. Any Data Scientist or Researcher will tell you that the most common thing we find when analyzing a dataset is\u2026 nothing interesting. It happens constantly. Many of our findings corroborate what we and our business partners already thought to be true, even when we\u2019ve asked the right question. This can be frustrating for Data Scientists, Researchers, and our partners, but finding \u201cnothing interesting\u201d is very different from finding \u201cnothing useful,\u201d and I\u2019m a strong believer that finding nothing interesting after asking the right question is still worthy of celebration.", "Before diving in, I want to emphasize the difference between a result being interesting and a result being useful. All analytical results (and the questions that spawned them) will fall somewhere in the Utility-Interest plane.", "A. Useful results that are also interesting are the holy grail. Findings from these analyses drum up tons of excitement with stakeholders and have the potential to create a huge impact.", "B. Useful results that aren\u2019t too interesting are less exciting, but are equally valuable! These are the only types of uninteresting results that are still defensible (the main topic of this post!). Useful, yet uninteresting results often arise when evaluating a hypothesis that everyone had assumed to be true, or when tackling a question that\u2019d been answered through other methods in the past.", "C. Useless results that aren\u2019t very interesting are just a poor use of time. These come from asking the wrong question, and a question to which everyone already knew the answer. These won\u2019t gain much traction with stakeholders, and the primary downside is just wasting your own time.", "D. Useless, but interesting results are dangerous. Very dangerous! Useless, yet interesting results arise when finding an exciting answer to the wrong question. Stakeholders can latch onto these findings and invest their own time into addressing a topic that should be lower priority.", "By finding \u201cnothing interesting\u201d in the data (i.e., a result in quadrant B) and presenting it to your stakeholders, you\u2019re able to make decisions with more confidence, ask meaningful follow-up questions, and increase stakeholders\u2019 trust in using data in the future.", "Asking a question of the data means you\u2019re unsure about something: maybe a course of action to take, the reason behind something happening, or something else. Exploring a dataset and finding no surprises just means that, in this case, your intuition wasn\u2019t too far off.", "Even when you and your business partners have some intuition about a problem area, evaluating your hypotheses with data will let you know, without a doubt, if your hypotheses were true. Knowing when you\u2019re right is just as important as knowing when you\u2019re not, and by evaluating your hypotheses you\u2019ve learned to either maintain or change course.", "Assuming you asked a worthwhile question of the data, finding \u201cnothing interesting\u201d will help inform what questions you should ask in the future. Any useful finding \u2014 whether interesting or not \u2014 gives you more confidence in the problem area and refines your area of focus, helping you to ask better questions going forward.", "Findings that contradict our intuition can be hard to accept \u2014 especially when the findings tell us that not only was our intuition wrong, but that our actions or plans were too. By finding and presenting \u201cnothing interesting,\u201d you help build trust between your stakeholders and the data, making it easier for them to accept information from you in the future, especially when it\u2019s counter to some of their beliefs.", "Ask the right questions of your data. Of course, the points above only hold true if you\u2019ve asked the right question in the first place. Poor questions can sometimes lead to interesting answers, but the usefulness of these answers will be limited. My favorite way to refine a research question is to brainstorm with a cross-functional group of stakeholders (plus with this approach, you get stakeholder buy-in at the same time).", "Celebrate \u201cnothing interesting.\u201d A finding doesn\u2019t have to be interesting in order to be useful. Next time you find \u201cnothing interesting,\u201d remember to celebrate it.", "For resources on asking good questions, I really like Asking Great Questions as a Data Scientist by Kristen Kehrer, and How to solve a business problem using data by Laura Ellis.
