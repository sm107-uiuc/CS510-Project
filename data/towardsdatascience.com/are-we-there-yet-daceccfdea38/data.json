I\u2019d love to hear everyone\u2019s thoughts here as well, especially if you have your own tricks for dealing with project risk. The reddit post can be found here. My (lightly edited) response is below.", "These are great questions, and I think people don\u2019t ask them enough, which is one of the main reasons I wrote Think Like a Data Scientist. One full chapter is dedicated to project planning and another full chapter is about project execution in various contexts. I think it takes a lot of thought and consideration to run projects well, and I don\u2019t think I can do it justice here, but I\u2019ll see if I can point out a few things that help out in this case:", "First of all, I constantly talk about the concept of \u201cawareness of uncertainty\u201d because data science and statistical tasks are far more uncertain than software development, for example, in terms of how long a task might take and even whether that task is even possible.", "Consider a basic example of a data science project in which you might see a phrase like, \u201cOur goal is to be able to predict Business Outcome X with an accuracy of 95%.\u201d Not only are we not sure, at the beginning of the project, how much time and effort it might take to get to 95%, but we don\u2019t even know if the data supports getting to 95% at all!", "So, one thing I love to stress is the need to formally acknowledge which parts of your project have the most uncertainty and to make plans to mitigate it. One way to mitigate the above example is to discuss with the product/business/customer folks whether it\u2019s \u201c95% or BUST\u201d or if 80% would be OK for the first version of the product, or something like that.", "Thinking in this way allows you to make a project plan that includes parts that are \u201cslam dunks\u201d in terms of certainty, and then for the uncertain parts you can plan to make them \u201cas good as we can in 2 weeks\u201d or something similar.", "If you do that, you will have a a data science product built in the same sort of time it would take an equivalent \u2014 and more predictable \u2014 software engineering product. The main disadvantage is that the accuracy/quality of results won\u2019t be as high as you would like, but at least you have a full result and product to show. Improving results later can be a follow-up project.", "This might not be ideal in every situation, but I\u2019ve found it very helpful.", "One conceptual planning tool I like to use is a flowchart that shows project steps, and I include my uncertainties in the flowchart. I do this by including blocks in the flowchart that ask questions like \u201cAre these results good enough?\u201d and the path leads one way if YES and another way if NO. You can also place time limits on certain steps in the project. I like formalizing these ideas so everyone on the team knows how it\u2019s going to work.", "Here are a couple of examples of flowcharts from the book:", "If you enjoyed this, have a look at some of my other posts:", "Brian Godsey, Ph.D., is a mathematician, entrepreneur, investor, and data scientist, whose book Think Like a Data Scientist is available in print and eBook now. \u2014 briangodsey.com", "For more, download the free first chapter of Think Like a Data Scientist and see this Slideshare presentation for more info and a discount code.", "Your home for data science.
