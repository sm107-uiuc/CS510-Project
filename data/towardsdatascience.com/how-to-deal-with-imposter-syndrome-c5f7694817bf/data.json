A difference between the first time and the 20th time.", "Aside from experience in the field, I\u2019d had practice. I\u2019d been to a number of events, I knew the feeling would be there and I got better at dealing with it. I used it as motivation. Motivation to improve myself.", "I realised everyone else is probably feeling the same thing.

Now I see it as one of my greatest strengths.", "Often, value comes from flipping a perceived weakness on it\u2019s head and figuring out its opposite.", "Imposter syndrome can be your greatest strength because it means you\u2019re conscious of your ability. It means you\u2019re aware you could improve. And because you\u2019re aware of it, if you act on it in the right way, you will improve.", "Imposter syndrome may never go away.
