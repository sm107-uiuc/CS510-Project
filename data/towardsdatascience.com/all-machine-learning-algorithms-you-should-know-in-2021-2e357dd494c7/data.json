I\u2019m also going to try to minimize the amount of math in this article because I know it can be pretty daunting for those who aren\u2019t mathematically savvy. Instead, I\u2019ll try to give a concise summary of each and point out some of the key features.", "With that in mind, I\u2019m going to start with some of the more fundamental algorithms and then dive into some newer algorithms like CatBoost, Gradient Boost, and XGBoost.", "Linear Regression is one of the most fundamental algorithms used to model relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simpler terms, it involves finding the \u2018line of best fit\u2019 that represents two or more variables.", "The line of best fit is found by minimizing the squared distances between the points and the line of best fit \u2014 this is known as minimizing the sum of squared residuals. A residual is simply equal to the predicted value minus the actual value.", "In case it doesn\u2019t make sense yet, consider the image above. Comparing the green line of best fit to the red line, notice how the vertical lines (the residuals) are much bigger for the green line than the red line. This makes sense because the green line is so far away from the points that it isn\u2019t a good representation of the data at all!", "If you want to learn more about the math behind linear regression, I would start off with Brilliant\u2019s explanation.", "Be sure to subscribe here or to my exclusive newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "Logistic regression is similar to linear regression but is used to model the probability of a discrete number of outcomes, typically two. At a glance, logistic regression sounds much more complicated than linear regression, but really only has one extra step.", "First, you calculate a score using an equation similar to the equation for the line of best fit for linear regression.", "The extra step is feeding the score that you previously calculated in the sigmoid function below so that you get a probability in return. This probability can then be converted to a binary output, either 1 or 0.", "To find the weights of the initial equation to calculate the score, methods like gradient descent or maximum likelihood are used. Since it\u2019s beyond the scope of this article, I won\u2019t go into much more detail, but now you know how it works!", "K-nearest neighbors is a simple idea. First, you start off with data that is already classified (i.e. the red and blue data points). Then when you add a new data point, you classify it by looking at the k nearest classified points. Whichever class gets the most votes determines what the new point gets classified as.", "In this case, if we set k=1, we can see that the first nearest point to the grey sample is a red data point. Therefore, the point would be classified as red.", "Something to keep in mind is that if the value of k is set too low, it can be subject to outliers. On the other hand, if the value of k is set too high then it might overlook classes with only a few samples.", "Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm. This means that Naive Bayes is used when the output variable is discrete.", "Naive Bayes can seem like a daunting algorithm because it requires preliminary mathematical knowledge in conditional probability and Bayes Theorem, but it\u2019s an extremely simple and \u2018naive\u2019 concept, which I\u2019ll do my best to explain with an example:", "Suppose we have input data on the characteristics of the weather (outlook, temperature, humidity, windy) and whether you played golf or not (i.e. last column).", "What Naive Bayes essentially does is compare the proportion between each input variable and the categories in the output variable. This can be shown in the table below.", "To give an example to help you read this, in the temperature section, it was hot for two days out of the nine days that you played golf (i.e. yes).", "In mathematical terms, you can write this as the probability of it being hot GIVEN that you played golf. The mathematical notation is P(hot|yes). This is known as conditional probability and is essential to understand the rest of what I\u2019m about to say.", "Once you have this, then you can predict whether you\u2019ll play golf or not for any combination of weather characteristics.", "Imagine that we have a new day with the following characteristics:", "First, we\u2019ll calculate the probability that you will play golf given X, P(yes|X) followed by the probability that you won\u2019t play golf given X, P(no|X).", "Using the chart above, we can get the following information:", "Now we can simply input this information into the following formula:", "Similarly, you would complete the same sequence of steps for P(no|X).", "Since P(yes|X) > P(no|X), then you can predict that this person would play golf given that the outlook is sunny, the temperature is mild, the humidity is normal and it\u2019s not windy.", "This is the essence of Naive Bayes!", "A Support Vector Machine is a supervised classification technique that can actually get pretty complicated but is pretty intuitive at the most fundamental level.

Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree (bagging). What\u2019s the point of this? By relying on a \u201cmajority wins\u201d model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.", "For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests!", "AdaBoost, or Adaptive Boost, is also an ensemble algorithm that leverages bagging and boosting methods to develop an enhanced predictor.", "AdaBoost is similar to Random Forests in the sense that the predictions are taken from many decision trees. However, there are three main differences that make AdaBoost unique:", "In essence, AdaBoost takes a more iterative approach in the sense that it seeks to iteratively improve from the mistakes that the previous stump(s) made.", "If you want to learn more about the underlying math behind AdaBoost, check out my article \u2018A Mathematical Explanation of AdaBoost in 5 Minutes\u2019.", "It\u2019s no surprise that Gradient Boost is also an ensemble algorithm that uses boosting methods to develop an enhanced predictor. In many ways, Gradient Boost is similar to AdaBoost, but there are a couple of key differences:", "While the last point may have been confusing, all that you need to know is that Gradient Boost starts by building one tree to try to fit the data, and the subsequent trees built after aim to reduce the residuals (error). It does this by concentrating on the areas where the existing learners performed poorly, similar to AdaBoost.", "XGBoost is one of the most popular and widely used algorithms today because it is simply so powerful. It is similar to Gradient Boost but has a few extra features that make it that much stronger including\u2026", "I strongly recommend that you watch StatQuest\u2019s video to understand how the algorithm works in greater detail.", "If you thought XGBoost was the best algorithm out there, think again. LightGBM is another type of boosting algorithm that has shown to be faster and sometimes more accurate than XGBoost.", "What makes LightGBM different is that it uses a unique technique called Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) to filter out the data instances to find a split value. This is different than XGBoost which uses pre-sorted and histogram-based algorithms to find the best split.", "Read more about Light GBM vs XGBoost here!", "CatBoost is another algorithm based on Gradient Descent that has a few subtle differences that make it unique:", "Overall, what makes CatBoost so powerful is its low latency requirements which translates to it being around eight times faster than XGBoost.", "If you want to read about CatBoost in greater detail, check out this article.", "If you enjoyed this be sure to subscribe here or to my exclusive newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "If you made it to the end, congrats! You should now have a better idea of all of the different machine learning algorithms out there.", "Don\u2019t feel discouraged if you had a harder time understanding the last few algorithms \u2014 not only are they more complex but they\u2019re also relatively new!
