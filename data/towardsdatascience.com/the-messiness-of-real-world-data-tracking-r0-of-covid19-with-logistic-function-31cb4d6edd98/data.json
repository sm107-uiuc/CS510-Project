So might as well fit a good old logistic curve. And given my complete lack of any competence in epidemiology, I am under-qualified and over-opinionated in writing this. And I have proof for this: Errata: I mistaken R0 with growth factor, and I can\u2019t be bothered to fixed the figures. And if that\u2019s not enough of a disclaimer, here is a boilerplate version from the editor:", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning. We are not health professionals or epidemiologists, and the opinions of this article should not be interpreted as professional advice. To learn more about the coronavirus pandemic, you can click here.", "Parts 1 to 3 are easy. Part 4 works in theory:", "The confirmed case (black) forms a nice s-shaped (or sigmoid, if you want to be fancy) logistic curve. The 1st derivative (new daily cases in red) forms a nice bell curve (not normal/Gaussian as far as I am aware). The growth factor (blue, use the right axis) is smoothly descending. The number of new cases starts to fall when growth factor hits the growth factor=1 mark (horizontal blue dotted line). We could divide the logistic curve into 4 quarters, demarcated by the 3 vertical green lines, which are marking the maximum, inflection, and minimum respectively.", "Yes there are some discontinuity here and there because I\u2019m using a discrete method (because the real data will be discrete anyway). But generally speaking, this works in theory. (The curves are vertically normalized, because we don\u2019t really care about the actual values, but more on the shape of the curve instead.)", "Even when fitting the logistic model using the Chinese data, and up to the 1st derivative, everything is still pretty great:", "This looks very promising! (Except for the fact that after day 50, it seems that the new daily cases is slowly increasing! Is this the beginning of the feared 2nd wave?).", "(There is also another concerns. The data fits too perfectly. There are some major interventions, but everything looks like noise (except the sudden spike at around day 22 due to changes in diagnostic definitions). China did a lot of interventions, but why do these disappear into the noise, and didn\u2019t materialize into a sudden drop or anything like that? Was the intervention useless? That\u2019s a weird conclusion. Anyway, this is a food for thought, and not just for this data, and I have a blog on this before which draws from many different fields. I guess here is just another example: DOES REALITY DRIVE STRAIGHT LINES ON GRAPHS, OR DO STRAIGHT LINES ON GRAPHS DRIVE REALITY?)", "Unfortunately, when get the full blown model, it is very disappointing.", "There is no clear smooth descent of growth factor. When is growth factor=1? Looks like all the time! Looking for landmarks in the 2nd derivative is even more hopeless. Maybe we need some smoothing? So let us drive these values not from the original data, but from our logistic model instead.", "If you squint really hard, you can kinda see that the logistic model has some sort of fit. For example, at the end of the 1st quarter (1st vertical green dashed line), aligns very nicely with the 25th percentile of the final confirmed case (solid black). The 2nd quarter (2nd vertical green dashed line) also aligns very nicely with the 50th percentile of the final confirmed case, and also coincide with when the logistic growth factor dipped below 1. Due to the anomaly in day 22 (new diagnostic definition), the 3rd quarter misaligned, under-predicting at around 12.5 percentile.", "In for a penny, in for a pound. Failed at step 5, might as well finish it. Since the simple logistic model is kinda suspect, let\u2019s see the curves for the world.", "As expected, the data is noisy. In any case, things are not looking good. The 1st derivative is still rising, especially since day 30. That means, we are still in the first half of the pandemic. As a rough calculation, we could be expecting at least doubling of the current confirmed case, and deaths as well. Although further intervention might change things. And I\u2019m really glad that people all over the world have been working hard at this. Let\u2019s focus on that red curve.", "I think we can suspect that growth factor is slowing down and flattening. If this is true, at least we are around quarter of the way, if not just passed it. Note that this is not quarter when it comes to days or number of confirmed cases / death. It is only quarter in terms of curve shapes. (This is a weird way to smooth a curve and visualize it, but I think it is kinda neat, so it is here.)", "It seems that the 2nd derivative is also telling the same story. It is flattening. (The log looks near identical.)", "Finally, the growth factor. Generally it is going down. It is definitely lower now than when it was at day 35 to 45. It has not touched the growth factor=1 mark yet, which suggests that we are not yet past the 2nd quarter.", "Usually, I would put this at the TLDR. But since these data are extremely noisy, and my methods extremely simplistic, I think it would be rash to pull out any kind of meaningful conclusion without screaming: \u201cTHIS IS JUST FOR FUN!\u201d. So I\u2019m just going to put here, just for the read-till-the-end club. Disclaimer: \u201cDO NOT, BY ALL MEANS, MAKES ANY SOCIAL/MEDICAL/FINANCIAL/WHATEVER DECISION BASED ON THIS\u201d. There are many more qualified people out there, listen to them.", "If we are truly at around, or just before, the first quarter, then we can expect things to get really bad really soon. It will looks like there is an explosion in the number of cases, everyday there will be a new record. This is bad, because, to the uninformed, things just simply look and feel out of control, with no end in sight. Just an exponential growth waiting to infect 100% on earth. It is important that we survive this stage as a society.", "I love how people are spreading \u201cflatten the curve\u201d, which also doubly works as setting the expectation. COVID19 is a catastrophe by any measure. It will feel worse if we, as a society, walks into it blind folded. And feeling is important, because feel determines whether riots and breakdown of social structures, and law and order will take place. But if we know what\u2019s coming, even if it is a catastrophe, we could at least brace ourselves.", "After a while, maybe few weeks, maybe few months, we will see the 2nd quarter, where new cases starts to be falling down. It is hard to be sure if it is truly the case, or just a temporary dip in the data. Only after few more weeks, the noise will smooth out, and we will can confirm that things are getting better, records are no longer broken. The death tolls lags for few weeks, but it will soon follow.", "Emotionally, it it will feel like it is nearly over, even though we are only halfway there, because things are getting better, there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel. It is important that things will only continue to get better, if we keep up our vigilance. If we relax ourselves at that time, things will get worse again.", "Even with all of that being said. That might only be the 1st wave. 2nd wave might be coming, as it was the case with Spanish flu. On top of it, I have heard experts purposefully designing multiple waves, because the alternative is to stay locked down forever, and never building herd immunity with a plan return to normalcy.", "This is going to be a long ride, buckle up.", "For China, I assume that L = the latest figure+1, so we won\u2019t have log(0) issues. I don\u2019t know what is a good way to assume L for the world.", "All images belong to me unless otherwise mentioned in the caption.", "Your home for data science.
