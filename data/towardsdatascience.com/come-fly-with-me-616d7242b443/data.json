It was tough to decide a project that can not only relate and interest individuals at a science fair, but also relate to a companies case analysis. We needed to collect available data online which was my struggle. It was a challenge to find marking data involving the airline industry, but it was achieved all thanks to text and NLP!", "The overview of this final project included analyzing twitter data of the top 8 domestic airlines and use NLP (natural language processing) to identify areas of improvement per airline! I always read reviews on what is the best airline out there and this way I was able to see and analyze what people are actually tweeting about. Two main questions I wanted to solve as my \u201cminimal viable project.\u201d", "My process was pretty basic and clearly laid out. I first gathered my data using the Twint web scraping tool. I gathered data of for 8 domestic airlines as listed below:", "I then cleaned my data using pandas and python to clean all punctuation and misspelled words. Evaluated the twitter data with length of tweets and performed a sentiment analysis on the data. Vader was the tool I used to recognize positive and negative tweets with ratings. View the {} ratings after each tweet below.", "The next step with the airline project was to use topic modeling to evaluate what most people were talking about both positively and negatively. I used an LDA Model and Visualization which stands for Latent Dirichlet Allocation.", "In natural language processing, LDA is a generative statistical model that allows sets of observations to be explained by unobserved groups that explain why some parts of the data are similar.", "I ran a coherence score test to assess the quality of the learned topics. You can see that our highest coherence score was 0.44 at 3 topics.", "Above is an LDA Visualization in order to see the separation of each topic.", "View each word cloud of each topic. I surprised to see a cluster of negative words in Topic 0, neutral/timing words in Topic 1, and positive words in Topic 2. This means we can clearly distinguish different areas of these tweets. So now lets see which airlines how the dominance per topic!", "*I renamed topics based on heavily weighted words", "You can clearly see that most people tweet negatively about airlines. So take bias into account that it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean they all have bad customer service\u2026. It\u2019s just most frequently tweeted about. But you can see that the ultra low cost carriers have been ranked the worst customer service by over 50%. United Airlines tweets are the highest for timing and delays and I was shocked to see that Delta\u2019s customer service tweets were greater than American and United.", "Your home for data science.
