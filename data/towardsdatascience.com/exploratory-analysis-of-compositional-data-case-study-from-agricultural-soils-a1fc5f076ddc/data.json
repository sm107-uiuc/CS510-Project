For instance, precision agriculture which encompasses a wide range of monitoring technologies including inter-disciplinary fields such as data science, geostatistics, and predictive analytics is providing farmers, agronomist, soil scientist, and all other stakeholders with a wealth of information, the likes of which we have never seen before, to accurately monitor soil and crop conditions and analyze treatment options.", "In this regard, among the many monitoring technologies currently available on the market, laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS), using benchtop or handheld devices, has gained increased popularity primarily because of its speed, minimal sample preparation and, relatively low cost. Like near-infrared spectroscopy which is widely used in the agriculture and food industry, LIBS provides an estimate of the chemical composition of soil that can be used to asses its fertility \u2014 i.e mineral nutrients available in the soil, which is the basis for fertilizer recommendations for field crops.", "However, whether in lab or in field, measurement accuracy and precision are very sensitive on the soil type that is being analyzed: fine-textured, medium-textured, and coarse-textured soils. To overcome these drawbacks, one could sieve the soils to a fine or medium texture which will remove any effect that large grains have on the analysis. Another option would be to break off large grains. A third option would be to adjust the device parameter depending on the soil texture and perform separate analyses. The latter is the one adopted by the NASA\u2019s LIBS instrument named ChemCam, which has a camera on board to inform about the texture and is equipped with a focused laser beam of 300-550 \u03bcm in diameter enabling elemental analysis of the Martian rock and soil of large and very fine grains size.", "Here on planet Earth, the question that still lingers is how these choices will affect the analyses \u2014 for instance, plant nutrient availability is influenced by many factors including soil grains size \u2014 or how they will impact LIBS appealing features such as rapid response and low invasiveness. For the most part, this article will set aside the details on these issues. Instead, the main topic is to provide an overview of exploratory analysis, showing how soil grains size influence LIBS measurements or any laser-based spectroscopic measurements, in order to scope the challenge ahead and help determine the most effective solutions.", "For anyone involved in agriculture endeavours, at small or big scale, knowing the texture of the soil is very important since it greatly influences soil nutrient and water holding capacity. Soil texture is typically determine by sedimentation methods \u2014 using a pipette or a hydrometer \u2014 , which provide the relative proportion of soil mineral particles, called soil particle size separates: sand (2.0\u20130.05 mm), silt (0.05\u20130.002 mm) and clay (<0.002 mm). Sandy soils are often referred to as coarse-textured soils whilst clayey soils are referred to as fine-textured soils. The term \u201ccoarse\u201d is used because sandy soils are mostly made up of larger or coarse particles. Clayey soils are mainly composed of fine flaky-shape particles. The term \u201cmedium\u201d is used for silty and loamy soils. The latter represents soil that does not have a dominant particle size fraction.", "It is well understood that soil particle-size fractions constitute what is called compositional data, which has great implications regarding their statistical analysis. In fact, since the early 1980s, following the work of John Aitchison \u2014 The Statistical Analysis of Compositional Data \u2014 , compositional data are well known to geologists and statisticians, among others, as vectors where the components are strictly positive numbers that are part of a whole, which means that each component carries only a relative part of information. Such data are usually referred to as closed data since they sum up to a constant \u2014 e.g. 1 or 100%. Mathematically this means that a D-part compositional data occupies a restricted space, geometrically represented in the (D-1)-simplex, where for instance components can vary only from 0% to 100% as it is the case for the soil mineral fractions.", "Thus, a D-part compositional data set, \ud835\udc17, is expressed by:", "where the components xj \u2200 j \u2208 {1, 2, \u2026, D} are subject to the following constraints:", "As an example, for D = 2 or 1-simplex, data can be represented as a line segment, and for D = 3 or 2-simplex, as a triangle (the so-called ternary diagram, which is used to represent soil textural classes as a function of sand, silt, and clay percent).", "In the following sections, I will take several steps to get a better idea on the dataset. These steps will consist in: (1) gather information about the nature of the analyzed samples, (2) compute descriptive statistics for soil particle size fractions, (3) analyze the influence of soil texture on LIBS signal, and (4) visualization of the PCA biplot to discover patterns.", "Our dataset contains 172 soil samples of LIBS analysis, with information about soil texture \u2014 percentage of sand, silt, and clay.", "Our first step is to gather information about the analyzed samples to understand the nature and distribution of the dataset. The figure below shows a ternary diagram \u2014 or soil texture triangle \u2014 that inform us about the textural classes assign to each sample and how they are distributed among the different classes.", "We can then identify the different textural classes assigned to the soil samples based on their name. There are 12 soil textural classes, according to the USDA classification system \u2014 see the table below for soil texture classes symbols.", "We can also check the number of different textural classes assigned to soil samples. It\u2019s turn out that we have 11 soil textural classes \u2014 we do not have sandy clay. As the figure below shows, the most abundant are clay loam, loam and sandy loam, and to a lesser extent silty clay loam, silty loam, and clay.", "Each class can be grouped according to their texture such as coarse, medium, or fine, which will be useful for principal component analysis.", "Moreover, we can also see from the ternary diagram below that most of our soil samples have approximately equal proportions of sand, silt and clay-size particles, which explains the predominance of the different loam type texture among the textural classes.", "There is an inherent dependence in soil particles data, due to its compositional nature. Applying a standard statistical approach \u2014 e.g. arithmetic mean, standard deviation, etc\u2026 \u2014 fails to account for this constrained property of data. That\u2019s why, like exploratory data analysis (EDA), a set of procedures referred to as compositional data analysis (CoDA) has been developed to analyze such data. In CoDA, log-ratio transformations are applied to the compositional data so that data are not constrained and can take any value in the real space, and can be analyzed using any standard statistical method. The different types of log-ratio transformations include:", "\u2022 Additive log-ratio transform (alr)\u2022 Centered log-ratio transform (clr)\u2022 Isometric log-ratio transform (ilr)", "For D = 3 parts compositional data, the additive, centered, and isometric log-ratio transformations are given by", "Thus, descriptive statistics of the soil particle size fractions are summarized below by a matrix of boxplots, where each boxplot is a pairwise log ratio.", "Or, we can compute some descriptive statistics.", "After reviewing our soil samples and their textural data, I will now take into account the LIBS spectral data. Here, the two most important parameters to consider are the overall intensity of the spectra and their relative standard deviation based on replicate measurements \u2014 we have 24 replicate measurements for each analyzed sample.", "The figure below illustrates the averaged intensity obtained from the different soil textural class, and is grouped with respect to the type of soil texture.", "Similarly, variability of the signal is compared.", "PCA is performed on the spectroscopic data, which clearly shows that the samples are clustered by texture type, although it is less obvious by textural class.", "I have provided a quick overview of how the accuracy of the elemental composition analysis of soil samples, using a LIBS device, can be affected by different types of soil texture. Our prior belief was that special care of the heterogeneity of soil grain sizes would yield a better measurement accuracy. One of the reasons for LIBS popularity is its speed and versatility, so grounding the samples is thus an optimal but perhaps more theoretical alternative.", "Your home for data science.
