For example:", "We need to get information about different people identified by certain ids.", "A naive approach to solve this problem would be the use of nested loops:", "Considering that \u201crecords\u201d has n elements and \u201cids\u201d has m elements, we are dealing with a solution of O(m\u00b7n) time complexity. Moreover, assuming that \u201cids\u201d presents a subset of the IDs available in \u201crecords\u201d (i.e., m <= n), we obtain a worst-case time complexity of O(n\u00b2).", "This solution can be vastly improved to O(n) + O(m) = O(n) time complexity using the following approach:", "The proposed solution makes a single iteration through the list of records in order to create a dictionary that will allow us to retrieve our data in O(1) time.", "Another common situation is presented to us when we want to check whether an element belongs to a list. For instance, we want to check whether 70 is included in \u201cids\u201d. The common way to solve this in Python is in the following way:", "This solution, beautiful in its conciseness, is not too efficient. The time complexity of this solution is O(n), as it makes a linear search over the list. We can achieve O(1) time complexity in membership checks by transforming the list into a set.", "Note that converting the list into a set takes O(n) time, so you may not benefit from it if you only need to perform one membership check. However, if you need to perform this operation for multiple elements, you will get an immediate benefit, considering that each of the subsequent operations will take O(1) time.", "A third situation that we may commonly find is the need to count, in a list of records, the number of occurrences of one of the fields. For instance, we may take the list of records of the first performance tip, and attempt to count the number of people of every country.", "The most intuitive approach would be something like the following:", "All in all, we\u2019d check whether the current country has already been included in the counting dictionary and, if not, include it and initialize it with 0. Then, we would always add 1 to the counter of the current country.", "However, note that the if statement will be evaluated to True only once per country. In other words, this condition will always be evaluated and most often not be of any use. Therefore, we may apply the following strategy:", "In the second approach we are trying to directly add 1 to the country counter. However, if it\u2019s the first time that we find such country a KeyError will be raised, as it was not present in the counter dictionary, executing the instruction of the except block. In this case, we have given priority to the most common situation, reducing the total number of executed instructions.", "Your home for data science.
