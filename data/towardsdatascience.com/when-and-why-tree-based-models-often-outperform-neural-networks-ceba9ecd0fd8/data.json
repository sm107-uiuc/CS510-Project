Tree-based methods, on the other hand, are not treated with the same awe and hype, primarily because they seem simple. While they seem so different, they are simply two sides of the same coin.", "Tree-based methods routinely outperform neural networks. Any Kaggler knows that XGBoost is by far the most popular choice for top-performing competition submissions. In essence, what puts tree-based methods and neural networks in the same category is that they approach problems by deconstructing them piece-by-piece, instead of finding one complex boundary that can separate the entire dataset, like SVM or Logistic Regression.", "Very obviously, tree-based methods progressively split the feature space along various features to optimize the information gain. What is less obvious is that neural networks approaches the task similarly. Each neuron watches over a specific section of the feature space (with various overlapping). If an input falls into that space, certain neurons are activated.", "Neural networks take a probabilistic view towards this piece-by-piece model fitting, whereas trees a deterministic one. Regardless, both rely on the depth of their model for their performance because their components correlate with sections of the feature space.", "A model with too many components \u2014 nodes in the case of trees, neurons in the case of networks \u2014 overfits, and a model with too little cannot give meaningful predictions at all. (Both begin to memorize data points instead of actually learning generalizations.)", "For more intuition on how neural networks split down the feature space, look into the Universal Approximation Theorem.", "Although there are many powerful variants of decision trees like random forests, gradient boosting, adaptive boosting, and deep forests, in general tree-based methods are essentially simplified versions of neural networks.", "Of course, this is an abstract and perhaps even controversial claim to make. There are admittedly many mental hurdles to building this connection. Regardless, it\u2019s an important piece in understanding when and why tree-based methods outperform neural networks.", "Tabular, or structured data that comes in the form of a table, is natural for a decision tree. Most everyone agrees a neural network is overkill for tabular data regression and prediction, so we make a few simplifications. We choose ones and zeroes opposed to probabilities, which is the primary root of differences between the two algorithms. Hence, trees succeed in cases where the nuances of probability are not necessary, like structured data.", "Tree-based methods perform well enough on, for example, the MNIST dataset because each digit has several defining features. Probabilities are simply not a necessary calculation. It\u2019s not a very complex problem at all, which is why well-designed tree ensembles perform at the same level or even better than a modern convolutional neural network.", "Often, people will be inclined to say that \u2018trees simply memorize rules\u2019, which is true. It\u2019s the same with neural networks, which memorize more complex, probability-based rules. Instead of explicitly yielding a True/False to a condition like x>3, neural networks will blow an input up to a high value to yield a sigmoid value of 1 or to produce some continuous expression.", "On the other hand, because neural networks are so complex, there\u2019s lots that can be done with them. The convolution and the recurrent layers are all brilliant adaptations of neural networks that work well because they operate on data that often requires the nuance of probabilistic calculation.", "Few images can be modelled with 1s and 0s. A decision tree value cannot handle datasets with many intermediate values (e.g. 0.5), which is why it works well on MNIST, in which pixel values are almost all either black or white, but not others (i.e. ImageNet). Similarly, text has too much information and too many exceptions to express in only deterministic terms.", "This is also why neural networks are predominantly used in these areas, and why neural network research stagnated earlier (<2000s) when massive quantities of image and text data were not available. Other common use cases of neural networks are limited to massive predictions, like YouTube\u2019s video recommendation algorithm, in which the scale is so large that probabilities must be involved.", "Go to any data science team in a company and they likely use a tree-based model rather than a neural network. Unless they\u2019re building a heavy-duty appliance, like blurring the background of a video in Zoom, the deterministic nature of trees makes tasks of everyday business classification lightweight, with the same general approach as a neural network.", "It\u2019s also arguable that deterministic modelling is, in many real-world cases, more natural than probabilistic modelling. For instance, a tree would be a good choice to predict if a user purchases an item or not from an ecommerce site, since users naturally follow a rule-based decision process. It may look something like this:", "Humans, in general, follow very rule-based and structured decision making processes. In these cases, probabilistic modelling is not necessary.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "ML enthusiast.
