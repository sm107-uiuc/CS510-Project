Unlucky randomness can also make you cry or make you live the most difficult time of your life.", "\u201cThe world is governed by chance. Randomness stalks us every day of our lives.\u201d", "Randomness is synonymous with unknown, unexpected. Yet is it real? Can anything be truly random? Is it simply a faith, an idea, or is randomness just an illusion?", "Why don\u2019t we put our knowledge aside for five minutes and try to answer that question?", "Let\u2019s see what the dictionary is hiding. Random means:", "The interesting thing is that the word \u201crandom\u201d inspires two main ideas.", "On the one hand, it is synonymous with an event that cannot be predicted in advance: By rolling a die several times, you cannot tell what the result will be. On the other hand, it is a statistical property of a sequence with no pattern: When rolling a die several times, there is no logic between two results.", "It\u2019s true, the distinction is subtle. At this point, you may even think it makes no difference. And yet the difference is huge.", "Some algorithms can compute random numbers. They are called the Pseudo-Random Number Generator (PRNG). These random numbers are the basis of many encryption systems to secure wireless communications or even your passwords on web applications.", "To better understand ofwhat randomness is, it is interesting to look at how it is generated in our PRNGs. Yes, we are going to talk about algorithmic methods. No, you won\u2019t get lost in the details.", "The PRNG I am going to introduce to you is an old classic: the Linear Congruential Generator [1]. Let\u2019s make it simple:", "Let\u2019s say we have a=13, c=7, m=24, and our seed is a 0. It is easy to calculate the next random number. We multiply 0 by 13. We still have 0 and then we add 7. Finally, the mod m means \u201chow much is remaining when we split it into m equal parts\u201d. Let\u2019s imagine that we have 30 coins to share between 8 people. Then we can give 3 coins to each person. There will be 6 remaining coins. In other words 30 mod 8 = 6.", "You understand the process. It is simple. Really simple. From one seed and three other numbers, we can generate a random sequence. Randomness in 10 lines of code.", "\u201cRandom numbers should not be generated with a method chosen at random.\u201d", "The sequence seems perfectly random from an observer\u2019s point of view. And yet the Linear Congruential Generator I presented to you is very simple. Of course, there are more complex ones. With python random.random() and numpy.random.random() are both based on the PRNG Mersenne Twister [2].", "We saw the random numbers we generate are not random! They are even perfectly deterministic. If we know the algorithm that makes it work and the seed then we know in advance the generated sequence.", "So let\u2019s go back to our dictionary definitions and see what still fits :", "Are we generating random numbers? Technically, the answer is no.", "Moreover, the numbers generated are often periodic. This is the case for the two PRNGs presented. The sequenced are infinitely repeated.", "PRNGs do not generate random numbers. However, they should not be automatically discredited. Computers are finite spaces. We must be pragmatic. We can try to quantify their suitability.", "Kolmogorov\u2019s complexity [3] is thus defined as the shortest program that generates the pseudo-random sequence. We can, therefore, estimate the complexity of a random number generation.", "But in reality, a true random sequence is an infinite sequence so we cannot find the smaller program to generating it. Random is by definition incompressible since it does not contain a pattern.", "\u201cComputers are only capable of a certain kind of randomness because computers are finite devices.\u201d", "This is why there are statistical tests to measure how close the generated randomness is to the conceptual randomness. We can note, for example, the DieHard test [4] and the NIST test [5].", "We will not go into the details of these statistical tests. But they allow us to have an idea of the predictability of the random sequences. Our example of a Linear Congruential Generator does not pass these tests [6].", "Random number generators do not generate random numbers. They generate chaos.", "\u201cAny one who considers arithmetical methods of producing random digits is, of course, in a state of sin.\u201d", "Chaos is a general confusion of the elements. In our case, the general confusion of our sequences. Chaos is a deterministic system, sure, but highly dependent on its initial conditions.", "Let\u2019s take the example of the double pendulum. If we drop the same double pendulum then gravity, the mass of its components, and the starting angle of the pendulum will define how the pendulum reacts when dropped. If it is released two times under the exact same conditions, then it will have the exact same behavior.", "However, if you drop it the second time by changing the starting angle by a very small degree, then the behavior will be completely different. And yet still determinable by its initial conditions.", "\u201cWhile in theory randomness is an intrinsic property, in practice, randomness is incomplete information.\u201d", "This is called the butterfly effect. For infinitesimal differences in the initial conditions, the results are totally different, generally making any prediction impossible over time.", "For some scientists and mathematicians, there is undoubtedly pure randomness. Sequences having effects but no cause. They are called True Random Number Generator (TRNG) and must be based on random physical sources.", "It is in quantum physics, we are familiar with true random phenomena. What was thought to be a vacuum in space is actually composed of subatomic particles that are magically appearing and disappearing. These particles generate random noise. The sound of silence.", "\u201cNature itself doesn\u2019t know through which hole the electron will pass\u201d.", "Its non-reproducible aspect has been proven by quantum theory [7]. We then have a True Random Number Generator. Until maybe a physical theory will contradict quantum physics. It will show once again\u00a0that what was believed to be random, is not.", "Theorized in statistical mathematics, the notion of randomness exists as a concept. But the definition of random models assumes that different events can be observed following identical initial circumstances. Such a form of randomness cannot exist in a world governed by determinism under the laws of physics. Determinism can imitate randomness.", "But quantum physics has proven its effectiveness where the great principles of today have failed. This introduces a new paradigm. Statistical physics, which at the same time explains the possibility of predictions and the residual gap between predictions and observations. Randomness can imitate determinism.", "\u201cReal randomness requires an infinite amount of information.\u201d", "Is deterministic physics or statistical physics the correct position? It also might be a game between more than only two rivals.", "Is it even possible to prove that a system is truly random? Since it is by definition incompressible, it requires an infinite amount of information to be considered as a random system.", "Randomness exists as a concept. But as an observation, we can\u2019t say anything at this stage. What we call random can be:", "Does that mean we should be restrained from calling random what is not random? No, it doesn\u2019t. I am considering by default that a system is what it appears to be. If I can\u2019t distinguish that the random system is actually deterministic, then I would consider it as random.", "\u201cWhat we call randomness is and can only be the unknown cause of a known effect.\u201d", "After all, we don\u2019t know what feelings are. It is just a concept.
