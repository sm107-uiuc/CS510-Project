The standard VST Digital Refractometer costs ~$700, and even a lower priced one is still a few $100. Eventually, I bought a $20 Brix meter, and later, I finally decided to get a more expensive one (Atago). I collected data to help understand how well the Atago works as well as how it compares to a cheaper tool.", "Long story short: the cheap meter is as accurate as the digital one, just less convenient.", "I wasn\u2019t sure Total Dissolves Solids (TDS) would correlate to taste. It was a good metric for sure, but I wasn\u2019t sold on the cost. I published a work on the Staccato Espresso shot, and the main critique was that I didn\u2019t use TDS as has been the standard in the barista world. Instead, I use a scorecard of 7 metrics (Sharp, Rich, Syrup, Sweet, Sour, Bitter, and Aftertaste) resulting in a final score. These scores were subjective of course, but they were calibrated to my tastes and helped me improve my shots.", "Eventually, I caved, and I bought a cheap Brix refractometer. I had a lot of fun examining the TDS over the time of the shot, but of course, some weren\u2019t convinced because it was done by eye-sight. So I decided I would get a $100 refractometer until I read the reviews were bad, and as chance would have it, I found someone selling an Atago for $200. Normally, an Atago would cost $300 or more, and an Atago can be difficult to find in the USA.", "To convert Brix to TDS is done using a simple formula:", "Some have argued that this metric is too simple, and this question would be resolved in comparing Brix to Atago as I have below.", "First, I wanted to test how well the Atago handled changes in temperature as the shot cooled. I pulled a shot from my trusty old Odea Giro Superautomatic because I wasn\u2019t concerned about a high TDS shot.", "I also wanted to test filtering the sample before measuring TDS. Some have claimed you should filter samples before measuring TDS, but a study showed concluded that the filters lowered TDS. They did find that filtered samples have less variability in measurement. I also wanted to do what scientist do and see if I could quickly verify their results without buying expensive VST syringe filters. To test filtration, I used an Aeropress paper filter.", "At first, I tested a single sample and took multiple readings, which seemed to suggest a wide variance, but close to the Atago spec of +/- 0.03 TDS.", "Then I took 10 samples unfiltered and filtered, and the results seems follow the idea that filtered samples gives more repeatable measurements.", "Then I took measurements over time as the shot cooled. I put one sample on the Atago, and I took multiple measurements to eliminate the variable of pulling a different sample. TDS continued to go up as the temperature went down until it maxed out at 22.5. After a discussion online about the results, I was able to isolate the cause with a few more tests. Over time, the sample was slowly evaporating causing TDS to climb until it maxed out.", "Overall, the Atago was very easy to use especially compared to a Brix meter. Usually, to get a good Brix reading, I have to hold a flash light (usually from my phone) up to the other end to make sure enough light is coming through. Brix has lines for every 0.2 reading, and with a lot of use, the best you can resolve is 0.1 or 0.085 TDS.", "The Brix meter is not great for multiple samples either because you have to open the top, wipe it down, add another sample, close it, and then hold it up to the light as opposed to just adding three drops to the Atago.", "I took Brix and Atago measurements across 35 shots over the past month. I usually stop the shot around a 1:1 output to input ratio, but due to my experiments of extraction over time, I started measuring the rest of the shot (what I call Seconds). This results in 35 more readings. Additionally, I calculated what the TDS would be if I pulled a 3:1 shot by combining the 1:1 shot and the seconds.", "When I sample using the Atago, I use three drops each time. I aimed to keep the process as repeatable as possible.", "From these results, it seems like the Atago and Brix meters give similar results. The error isn\u2019t even that much ignoring a few outliers.", "Looking at Output to Input ratio, there seems to be a trend related to TDS which is normal considering that TDS starts very high for a smaller shot and decreases over time. There is not a connection to ratio and the difference between Atago and Brix.", "Another metric Atago provides is temperature, so we can take a look at temperature and TDS, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be much correlation. Nor does temperature seem to affect the the comparison of Brix and TDS.", "Finally, since we have more than 30 samples, we can do a paired t-test to determine if the distributions are statistically different, which means the p-value from the test is less than 0.05. In the table below, one can see that the distributions are not statistically different because all the p-values are greater than 0.05.", "These tests were very helpful in trusting the Atago meter but also trusting my previous results using Brix (over 200 previous samples). The Atago meter has become key for me in my experiments to understand the shot better, and I hope these results help those without as much money to buy tools to help measure and improve their espresso as well as other forms of coffee.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
