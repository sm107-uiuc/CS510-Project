Looking back over the past half-year (11/2019\u201305/2020), it was one of the most uncertain periods of my life, forwent a 3-year postdoc contract, relocated from Brisbane to Sydney, determined for a career change and caught by the COVID downtime.", "In total, I applied for 41 jobs as either data analyst or junior data scientist each with a tailored resume/cover letter. Among these applications, there were 21 non-responses, 18 rejections, and 2 interview invitations eventually coming in late April. As you can see, it wasn\u2019t an encouraging journey. But, I came out from the other side of the dark tunnel.", "In this post, I would like to share with you how I completed the transition from a postdoctoral research fellow to a data analyst and the lessons I learned along the way. Although the process may be different based on personal situations, I hope my experience provides one possible pathway for those early-career researchers (ECRs), especially those in science, who are looking for conversion but still uncertain about how to get started.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong. I enjoy doing research or I should say \u2018solving problems\u2019. I learned systematically how to read literature, dissect problems, design experiments, test hypothesis, analyse data, and write articles through my whole research training. However, after 3-year postdoc research together with a 4-year PhD, I found myself gradually delved into a very specific research niche, which was not what I expect. Instead, I am eager to explore more possibilities for my future and I would like to utilise all these skill sets gained in academia for more real problems. This is the first reason that drove me to leave academia.", "In addition, there are already quite a few discussions about the endemic in academia for ECRs. Among all those downsides (e.g. job insecurity, abnormal working hours (especially for wet-lab researchers in life science), position availability, \u2018publish or perish dilemma\u2019), the fixed-term contract is the one held my nerve all the time.", "I do understand the significance of academic hiring system. It is designed to foster the next generation of researchers via multiple rounds of postdoctoral fellowships in different labs until they are able to take charge of a research topic/area independently. In other words, an ECR is highly unlikely to stay in one lab for the whole of her/his academic career. However, from a realistic view, with short-term research contracts, most postdocs, including me, could not even commit to a mortgage as we don\u2019t know if we will have a job after one contract and where the next job is located. This issue could get even more complicated when involved in our partner or family. For example, we may need to separate with them for staying in a \u2018prestigious lab\u2019 that locates in another city or country.", "Here my purpose is by no means to discredit academia. The point I want to deliver is that keeping the options open. At this stage in my career, I need a job that would optimally align with my goal and is worth giving up what I have built these many years in academia.", "Moving into data science was a careful consideration made based on two aspects, skillset and passion.", "As a postdoc in biological science, I have been analysing data using multivariate analysis, regression, networking analysis, and significance tests. All these knowledge are readily transferable to data science. Additionally, owing to the large magnitude of the data (high throughput DNA sequencing) I normally processed, I acquired familiarity with Python, R, bash scripts, and SQL, which are well in line with those tools required in data science as well.", "Besides the necessary skills and scientific mindset, I think passion is an integral part when setting a career goal. We don\u2019t want to get out of a dead-end and move into another one. Thus it is of significance to identify our passion and it is not that hard. My tip is when we are led merely by our curiosity and excitement for doing something, that\u2019s where our passion is.", "For me, my passion is to apply data insights to tell stories and solve problems. I am enthusiastic about leveraging methods of modern statistics and data visualisation to extract patterns from intertwined datasets.", "With the aforementioned foundations, I have a clear view that data science will be the optimal fit for my next career goal. Having said that, I was still not quite ready for the job market back then. I needed to transfer what I know into more marketable skills, which led to the following parts.", "Although I am quite familiar with some skills required in data science, they weren\u2019t coherently learned. I still need help by googling now and then when analysing data. This is totally fine for daily work, however, I don\u2019t want to be stuck by simple questions (e.g. Bayes\u2019 theorem, Central limit theorem, t-test, groupby in pandas, JOIN in SQL, and so on) during the interview. It is thus necessary to go over these bits of knowledge systematically.", "Here I listed online courses and materials I used for statistics, python and SQL:", "Nowadays resume should not be the only way we present our skills and experiences. It is highly likely that the recruiter or the people who are going to interview us want to peruse our Linkedin, Github, personal blog, and project website. I think this is particularly true for data science roles owing to its nature. All contents displayed on our websites could be proofs for \u201cthe beautiful numbers\u201d stated in our resumes.", "Moreover, as a candidate from academia without any industry/commercial experiences, enriching our portfolios via online learning experiences, personal projects and blogs are the most cost-effective way and could hence help us stand out among other applicants. Our portfolios should deliver at least two messages: 1) we are passionate about data science, 2) we are proactive, persistent, and professional at what we are doing in data science.", "Here are the steps I took to enrich my portfolio:", "There is no question about the importance of networking in seeking new jobs. Mindful networking could generate information, advice, and opportunities. As postdocs, we may stay within labs all the time and have limited time to socialize with people outside our research topic. Nevertheless, if we really want a change, we need to step outside our comfort zone and reach out for new connections. But we should remember that networking is a reciprocal and long-term investment.", "Below are some of my suggestions:", "As you can see, all the above components are dependent on each other, which require us to have a comprehensive plan and stick to it (just like implementing an experiment in the lab). There will be hard and frustrating. But we just need to keep trying, accept failure, and make improvements, the turning point will eventually come.", "That\u2019s all folks. As always, I welcome feedback, constructive criticism, and hearing about your data science projects/stories. I can be reached on Linkedin, and also on my website.", "Your home for data science.
