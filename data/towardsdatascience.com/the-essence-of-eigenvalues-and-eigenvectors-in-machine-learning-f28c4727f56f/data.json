So when we talk about Eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a Matrix, we\u2019re talking about finding the characteristics of the matrix.", "Before diving deep into Eigenvectors, let's understand what is a matrix except being a rectangular array of numbers, What does it represent?", "So a matrix is simply a linear transformation applied to a vector. There can be different types of transformation applied to a vector, for example-", "What does this matrix M do with the image? It introduced a horizontal shear to every vector in the image.", "So what has the matrix M has done to the images? So this linear transformation M rotates every vector in the image by 45 degrees.", "It translates the image in both horizontal and vertical directions.", "The rotation has no eigenevector[except the case of 180-degree rotation]. For pure shear, the horizontal vector is an eigenvector. The factor by which the length of vector changes is called eigenvalue.", "The concept of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is used in many practical applications. I will discuss only a few of these.", "PCA is a very popular classical dimensionality reduction technique which uses this concept to compress your data by reducing its dimensionality since curse of dimensionality has been very critical issue in classical Computer Vision to deal with images and even in Machine Learning, features with high dimensionality increase model capacity which in turn requires a large amount of data to train.", "It is a method that uses simple matrix operations and statistics to calculate a projection of the original data into the same number or fewer dimensions.", "Let the data matrix \ud835\udc17 be of \ud835\udc5b\u00d7\ud835\udc5d size, where n is the number of samples and p is the dimensionality of each sample. In PCA, essentially we diagonalize the covariance matrix of X by eigenvalue decomposition since the covariance matrix is symmetric-", "where \ud835\udc15 is a matrix of eigenvectors (each column is an eigenvector) and \ud835\udc0b is a diagonal matrix with eigenvalues \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc56 in the decreasing order on the diagonal.", "Eigenvectors of a symmetric matrix, covariance matrix here, are real and orthogonal.", "The eigenvectors are called principal axes or principal directions of the data. Projections of the data on the principal axes are called principal components.", "We reduce the dimensionality of data by projecting it in fewer principal directions than its original dimensionality.", "K-Means is the most popular algorithm for clustering but it has several issues associated with it such as dependence upon cluster initialization and dimensionality of features. Also, it faces problems if your clusters are not spherical as seen below-", "Spectral clustering is a family of methods to find K clusters using the eigenvectors of a matrix. It handles these issues and easily outperforms other algorithms for clustering.", "Here data is represented in the form of a graph. Now clustering can be thought of making graph cuts where Cut(A,B) between 2 clusters A and B is defined as the sum of weight connections between two clusters. For example-", "To find optimum clusters, we need MinCut and the objective of a MinCut method is to find two clusters A and B which have the minimum weight sum connections.", "In spectral clustering, this min-cut objective is approximated using the Graph Laplacian matrix computed from the Adjacency and degree matrix of the graph. For proof, see this", "Given: A graph with \ud835\udc5b vertices and edge weights \ud835\udc4a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 , number of desired clusters \ud835\udc58", "Now, use \ud835\udc58-means to find \ud835\udc58 clusters \ud835\udc36 letting \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 be the rows of eigvec. Finally to assign data points into clusters, assign \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 to the \ud835\udc57\u2019th cluster if \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 was assigned to cluster j.", "The second smallest eigenvector , also called Fiedler vector is used to recursively bi-partition the graph by finding the optimal splitting point.", "Variants of spectral clustering are used in Region Proposal based Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation in Computer Vision.", "At last, I will discuss my favorite field under AI, which is Computer Vision. In Computer Vision, Interest points in an image are the points which are unique in their neighborhood. Such points play a significant role in classical Computer Vision where these are used as features.", "Corners are useful interest points along with other more complex image features such as SIFT, SURF, and HOG, etc. I would discuss one such method of corner detection.", "Corners are easily recognized by looking through a small window.", "Shifting the window should give a large change in intensity E if the window has a corner inside it.", "Harris described a way for a faster approximation \u2014 Avoid computing the eigenvalues, just compute Trace and Determinant. Combing these 2 properties, we calculate a measure of cornerness-R", "Determinant of a matrix = Product of eigen values", "Trace of a matrix = Sum of eigen values", "If either eigenvalue is close to 0, then this is not a corner, so look for locations where both are large.
