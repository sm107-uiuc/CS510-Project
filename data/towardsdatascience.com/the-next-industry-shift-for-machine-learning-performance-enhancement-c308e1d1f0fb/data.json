Decision makers don\u2019t need to be Statisticians to understand the value of increasing revenue or decreasing costs.", "Thousands of companies around the world, from small startups to global corporations, find great value in improving the performance of their supervised or unsupervised ML models, whether it\u2019s a sales or demand forecast, a market basket analysis recommender, a customer classifier, a sales optimizer, a chatbot, an algorithmic trading pipeline, a document labeler, an elections forecast, a spam filter, a medical diagnosis solution, a route optimizer, a face recognizer or a self-driving car.

Every 6 hours, one quintillion bytes of data are generated globally. You can\u2019t come up with an intuitive reference for how much that is without recurring to stars or atoms and still, that figure will seem laughable in a couple of years.", "On the other side, we have broad access to cutting-edge systems, like neural networks with genetic algorithms, that are remarkable at explaining one variable with other variables on the same dataframe (once they are in a tidy, numerical format).", "So the question isn\u2019t IF the two worlds are going to meet, the question is WHEN, and the answer is starting to look like NOW.", "With so many sudden changes impacting this highly uncertain and socially-distanced way of life, it is especially challenging to generate accurate predictions relying solely on internal data. Therefore, it is now more relevant (and feasible) than ever to enhance ML models with external data that can provide a more complete view of the problem at hand.", "\u201cGood data scientists are looking to find good, clean influencing data to blend with their own data to make more accurate predictions.\u201d", "\u20184 Ways to Differentiate Your Analytics Product by Including External Datasets\u2019 Gartner research report by Kevin Quinn and Emil Berthelsen, 24 July 2020.", "Data Scientists tend to be discouraged to add external data to their models as they believe there is a low benefit/effort ratio because it\u2019s a lot of work to gather, process, profile and join unstructured data in a completely different formats.
