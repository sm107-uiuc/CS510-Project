The predictive model uses a handful of employment, inflation, interest rate, and market indicators.", "Can one predict the timing of future U.S. recessions by looking for clues in economic and market data?", "Several interesting attributes of this problem include:", "This is a timely problem as the current bull market grows old. Armed with a good sense of recession likelihood:", "There are 2 main theoretical assumptions at play:", "1) U.S. recessions exhibit markers / early warning signs.", "There exist plenty of recession \u201csignals\u201d in the form of individual economic or market data series. While individually, these signals have limited information value, they may become more useful when combined together.", "2) Future recessions will be similar to historical recessions.", "This assumption is a lot more shaky, but can be mitigated by choosing features that maintain significance despite the changing economic landscape. For example, focusing on manufacturing data may have been relevant historically, but may be less relevant going forward as the world goes digital.", "Ideally, I would compare my model performance to each of the alternatives above. Currently, I cannot do this for the following reasons:", "Some things I had to consider when getting the data:", "For practical reasons, I used public domain data available through FRED and Yahoo Finance. I did not use potentially useful data that is stuck behind a paywall, such as The Conference Board Leading Economic Index.", "Some project-specific considerations for feature selection:", "First, a sneak peek at the final feature list. Note how small it is:", "I considered the 3-month change in nonfarm payrolls (%), 12-month change in nonfarm payrolls (%), and the difference between the 3-month change and 12-month change. Turns out that the difference between the 3-month change and 12-month change was the best predictor (out of the 3 candidates) in the exploratory data set, so I picked this as my employment feature.", "Setting bounds for the Fed Funds Rate is one of the main monetary tools used by the Federal Reserve. I considered the Real Fed Funds Rate, as well as the 12-month change in Fed Funds Rate. The 12-month change in Fed Funds Rate was the best out of the 2 candidates, so I picked this as my Monetary Policy feature.", "Some people believe that the Fed can influence economic activity via setting bounds for the Fed Funds Rate.", "Inflation has a more complex relationship with business cycles, as it can occur during periods of rapid expansion, as well as periods of contraction (stagflation). But there may be higher-order effects between inflation and other features, so it is worth including regardless.", "The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a commonly-used proxy for inflation. I considered the 3-month change in CPI (%), 12-month change in CPI (%), and the difference between the 3-month change and 12-month change. All candidates had low correlations to the Employment feature and Monetary Policy feature, so I picked the 3-month change in CPI as my Inflation feature since it had a slightly higher correlation to the output labels in the exploratory data set.", "I would have loved to use a credit spread index of some type (investment grade or high yield) here, but could not find a credit spread index with data going back to 1955.", "So instead I started looking at treasury rates. Treasuries, as a \u201crisk-free\u201d asset class, play an important role in the global asset allocation framework. Shifts in treasury rates can indicate shifting expectations about economic opportunity and market risk.", "I grandfathered-in the spread between 10-year and 3-month treasury rates, since the yield curve slope has a decent historical track record for predicting recessions in advance. There are several theoretical explanations for this phenomenon. One of these explanations is that if investors perceive \u201cbad times\u201d on the horizon, they allocate money away from risky assets, and towards longer-term treasuries to lock-in a \u201crisk-free\u201d return over a longer time frame.", "After picking the 10-year vs. 3-month treasury spread as my first indicator, I considered the 3-month treasury rate (12-month change), the 12-month change in the 10-year vs. 3-month treasury spread, and the 10-year treasury rate (12-month change). I rejected the first two candidates since there were extremely correlated (90%) to the Monetary Policy feature. I decided to pick the 10-year treasury rate (12-month change) as my second Bond Market feature since it can be a gauge for long-term growth expectations.", "Stock markets are driven by present-day discounting of future expectations, so they are considered to be leading indicators. I considered the 3-month change in the S&P 500 Index, 12-month change in the S&P 500 Index, and the difference between the 3-month change and 12-month change in the S&P 500 Index. The latter 2 candidates both had high correlations to the output labels, but I picked the 12-month change in the S&P 500 Index since it is easier to interpret.", "Some things I had to consider when designing the tests:", "Since the underlying prediction is a time series, one must conduct model cross-validation and prediction in real-time (i.e. only using data that was available at each point in time!). K-Fold cross-validation would violate this principle.", "The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) Business Cycle Dating Committee names \u201cPeak\u201d and \u201cTrough\u201d dates for business cycles. I treated the months between an NBER-defined peak and trough as recessionary months for the United States. But there is a huge problem here:", "NBER declares \u201cPeak\u201d and \u201cTrough\u201d dates several months (sometimes years) after the fact!", "This means one cannot label outputs one period at a time! So to deploy a recession predictor of any sort, one must re-train the model at each formal NBER \u201ctrough\u201d announcement (after each recession end). Therefore, one must also take this same approach during backtesting!", "If one follows this approach, there are 5 possible tests to run (peak-trough pairs), each with NBER announcement dates:", "For each test, the training set starts at August 1955 and gets longer with each subsequent test. Similarly, each cross-validation set starts at January 1972 and gets longer with each subsequent test.", "At first, this seems easy: Recession = 1, No Recession = 0. That is true, but is insufficient as it pertains to the desired model scope. To determine the labeling process, one must figure out the question being answered.", "What is the probability that the U.S. will be in a recession X months from now?", "If one wants to answer this question, one must forecast both the start and end of a recession. The model-predicted probabilities should start to drop before the recession actually ends. Needless to say, this is a pretty heroic task.", "Another question one could ask is:", "What is the probability that the U.S. will be in a recession within the next X months?", "This question forecasts the start of a recession, but only \u201cnow-casts\u201d a recession end. The model-predicted probabilities should start to drop only after the recession ends. This task is less idealistic, but it still allows market participants to prepare for market tops.", "Thus all months that are in a recessionary period will receive a label of \u201c1\u201d. Additionally, the X months (where X = 6 for the 6-month-ahead predictor, X = 12 for the 12-month-ahead predictor, etc.) preceding each recession start will also receive a \u201c1\u201d label. All other months will receive a label of \u201c0\u201d.", "I considered a handful of models and ran the aforementioned 5 tests on each model. As stated before, all cross-validation and prediction was carried out in real-time (no cheating!), only using data that was available at each historical point in time.", "I considered the following 6 individual models: K Nearest Neighbors, regularized Linear Regression (Elastic Net), Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Gaussian Process, and XGBoost. I tuned hyperparameters via grid-search on cross-validation error. As mentioned earlier:", "For each test, the training set starts at August 1955 and gets longer with each subsequent test. Similarly, each cross-validation set starts at January 1972 and gets longer with each subsequent test.", "Additionally, I tested 2 ensemble models out of the 6 individual models above:", "I also tested a Stacked ensemble by training a linear regression model on each individual model\u2019s cross-validation predictions. This approach produced atrocious results. My intuitive explanation is that the data set is too small to train a powerful Stacked ensemble. There are simply not enough cross-validation predictions available!", "Which error metric should I use to quantify prediction error? Since this is a classification problem, metrics such as accuracy, prediction/recall, and F1 score come to mind (read about all of these here). However, none of these metrics are well-suited for this particular problem, because the predicted output class (\u201c0\u201d or \u201c1\u201d) is not as relevant as the predicted probability of being in each class!", "Instead, I used weighted log-loss as my error metric. It considers the distance between the predicted probability of class = \u201c1\u201d and the actual class value (\u201c1\u201d or \u201c0\u201d). Log-loss assigns an exponentially heavier penalty to larger discrepancies between predicted probabilities and actual class output.", "During model training: for some of the models (Elastic Net, Support Vector Machines, and XGBoost), there are built-in parameters to set class weights. I set these parameters such that both classes have an equal effect on the loss function for model training.", "During model cross-validation: Using scikit-learn\u2019s implementation of log-loss, I can adjust for sample class imbalance (using the \u201csample_weight\u201d argument) such that both classes have an equal effect on overall log-loss values for model cross-validation.", "Raw probability predictions tend to be volatile, like this:", "Therefore, I applied exponential smoothing to the raw probability predictions. I chose the weighting factor (for the exponential smoother) such that the half-life of each prediction is 3 periods:", "I ended up selecting the Support Vector Machine as the final deployment model. Log-loss for the 8 models (6 individual models and 2 ensembles), across 3 time frames, are below:", "Astute readers may notice that the Support Vector Machine (SVM) does not score the best across all 3 time frames.", "Why did I not choose the \u201cbest performing\u201d model?", "To elaborate, observe the side-by-side comparison of the Elastic Net, Weighted Average, and Support Vector Machine predictions, for the 6-month time frame:", "The Elastic Net and Weighted Average models score better than the SVM (on a weighted log-loss basis) because they predict higher probabilities of recession in general! Essentially, they have a higher \u201cfalse positive\u201d tendency than the SVM, while having a marginally lower \u201cfalse negative\u201d tendency than the SVM.", "This asymmetry is the key to not selecting the \u201cbest performing\u201d model. Models (Elastic Net, Weighted Average) that indicate higher near-term recession probabilities, even during long periods of economic growth, are easier to discredit as \u201calarmist\u201d and will be harder to sell. On the other hand, a model (SVM) that indicates recession odds closer to 0% during good times, but can also spike to high levels (albeit not as high as the \u201calarmist\u201d models) during periods of recession, will be harder to discredit.", "To receive periodic updates on the model predictions via email, click here.", "Special thanks to Jason Brownlee for his article on the Applied Machine Learning Process.", "Your home for data science.
