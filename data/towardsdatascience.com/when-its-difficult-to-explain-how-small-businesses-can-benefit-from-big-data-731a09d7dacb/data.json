In the midst of this pandemic, my employer does not oblige me to come to the office. Instead of working from home, as they suggested, I went to another city where my partner lived. There, my partner met me with the community of indie publishers and online booksellers.", "\u201cCan you hold a session about Big Data to this community?\u201d", "I didn\u2019t say yes right away. Previously, when I was active on campus, I worked as a Big Data lab assistant, helping lecturers to teach other students. I once gave training on sentiment analysis for a government agency. Teaching isn\u2019t too scary for me, actually. But, I think this time I am facing a completely different audience: this community is not just anyone, they are book enthusiasts, devout readers, and have a significant role in the intellectual and cultural development of my country. Besides, many of them are not very familiar with data and information technology.", "BEFORE THE CLASS TOOK PLACE, I met with some of them to find out what exactly they needed. What they had been doing to their data and a little about their business strategy.", "Most booksellers do their business on social media and online marketplaces. Marketing efforts are carried out on social media, and further transactions are carried out via chat on WhatsApp. Some have started their own websites. Then I asked about how they store data, both customer data and transactions.", "As I imagined before this conversation happened, most of them do it manually with Excel. And it shouldn\u2019t be forgotten, though not all, most small businesses only have one or two people who are good at using Excel. Memorizing functions, pivoting, and visualizing data. Only one business that uses a POS service that is quite costly.", "I discussed with them the obstacles that exist when selling through online marketplaces. They face off in a discount war against original book publishers (usually larger publishers) who are also selling on marketplaces. Say, these friends put up a 15% discount and advertise the page on social media. The page was visited by many people. But, there were not many transactions. This happens because the original publisher places a higher discount and that original publisher\u2019s page appears on the seller\u2019s page as a product recommended by the marketplace. The original publisher is the one who eats the fruit even though they don\u2019t have to bother paying for advertising.", "When discussing with indie publishers in this community, they ask questions about how to use big data to conduct market research, find capable new writers, and how to predict what kind of books will be in demand and will sell well.", "After a lengthy discussion, I left with the big question to myself, \u201cWhen the financial and technological capabilities are limited, is it essential to hold an introductory session of Big Data? Concepts like the 5 V\u2019s of Big Data, for small businesses? Isn\u2019t that too abstract and impractical?\u201d", "I may be wrong or still lack the experience to be able to explain Big Data questions for small businesses. But the fact that I know, the volume of data that exists is indeed huge, can be obtained very quickly, with a large variety of data types. But all of that belongs to other people, especially large companies: very little can be accessed easily and cheap.", "From there, I decided not to focus too much on the grandiose concepts of Big Data, but instead put more emphasis on how to make the data they had so far more useful, and suggested a few ways to better collect, organize, and analyze it.", "As I told you before, they mostly use Excel. The social media admin must rewrite book orders that occur in social media chats into sheets. Data obtained from social media besides transaction details are customer data such as name, address, telephone number, and sometimes gender. The bonus is data about what books customers ask but are out of stock.", "The main task for me regarding this problem is to provide an idea of \u200b\u200bhow to make the process easier and to make the data stored in a more organized manner.", "At this point, unfortunately, I cannot provide a concrete answer on how the record-keeping process can be simplified and automated to reduce manual work. (It would be helpful if the readers of this post had suggestions regarding that.)", "But for the matter of data storage, I suggest that instead of saving it into several excel files, it\u2019s better to use a database. The easiest and cheapest way I could think of at that time was to use a product like Open Source Point of Sale, or a platform more familiar to them like WooCommerce. Both examples can easily be hosted on a computer with a local network, or on the internet if needed. These platforms are suitable for storing order data, transactions, customer info, stock or inventory of goods available in the warehouse, and even incomes and revenues.", "Over the years, I\u2019ve learned that asking the right questions, determining what to measure, extracting insights and suggesting action are the main tasks of the data analyst. In general, it boils down to creating and managing dashboards for monitoring business performance and doing in-depth analysis of an issue. I gave them an example of what a good company monthly report looks like, just to give a simple idea of \u200b\u200bwhat data analysts do.", "Before talking about Big Data, I emphasize the importance of how to analyze the data we already have. I ask them to think statistically.", "I explained how data can be viewed from multiple angles. If the data has a time dimension, then it can be visualized with a line chart to see trends \u2014 for example, the sales trend for the last three years. From the visualization, it can be seen whether there are certain times in the three years that have similar trends so that they can know, for example, in what month sales tend to be high. In the data they have, there are also dimensions of the city and province of the buyer. Combining with the time dimension, we can see how the trends are in the regions. The area with the highest sales in the last three years may be actually declining, and other areas are on the rise.", "From the example of book sales data, we can also see what percentage of sales are generated from books with the fiction or non-fiction genre. On a deeper level, what kinds of non-fiction are selling well? History, biography, essay collection or philosophy? And again we can see the trends of each of the genres.", "Their data can also be analyzed by examining, for example, the five highest-selling regions and dividing them by gender and age, then book genre. Identifying the buyers by looking at their age, are they workers or students? This way, we can find out what genre certain ages are interested in. It could also be the author or publisher. Or physical things like thickness and weight of a book, because, hey, that affects the shipping cost!", "I got a perfect reference on why we should examine the data in more detailed dimensions on Allan Rossman\u2019s blog.", "Sales data can also be analyzed by conducting a market basket analysis. This analysis can be used to help booksellers determine bundling promos. This could be used to win the discount war. Here\u2019s a useful reference.", "Data is readily available everywhere, but it takes a little technical skill to simply retrieve it.", "During the discussion, the publisher realized that the market was growing in Eastern Indonesia. They want to know which areas have a high reading interest and the level of education there. This data is provided by an API from the government. So it\u2019s not a simple .xlsx or .csv file. This is just an example case of how data is not readily available to most.", "I told them that we need a skill to create a program that could extract the data. I also demonstrated how to create a simple program to take that data with R and visualize it for them.", "Then came more specific questions about marketing:", "\u201cAs a social media admin, how can I see what competitors are posting and how are their engagement rates? Of course, it\u2019s interesting if we don\u2019t have to open their profiles one by one and record their followers and the number of likes and comments on their posts.\u201d", "There are lots of great tools for doing this. But to view several accounts and compare them, users are required to pay. With limited financial capacity, again, the available data cannot be accessed easily.", "I don\u2019t want to spoil people\u2019s imaginations about how useful data is. So I created a simple tool to address the questions asked about competitor research.", "As the name suggests, it is very simple indeed. But at least this tool can make it easier to analyze the performance of your business profile and compare it to competitor profiles. Could also help to understand how the performance of the recent posts of selected profiles.", "If the embed doesn\u2019t work well, you can access it here.", "The whole process with this community has provided great experiences and good lessons for me when holding knowledge sharing sessions. Here are some of what I should do if I was going to do it again:", "THIS BRINGS ME TO THE END OF THIS POST. I may not be very successful in explaining the benefits of Big Data, but hopefully, it can provide an example of the benefits of data for small businesses.", "Your home for data science.
