So we will include this feature for model training.", "Using One way ANOVA we can check only single predictor vs response and determine the relationship but what if you have two predictors? we will use Two way ANOVA and if there are more than two features we will go for multi-factor ANOVA.", "Using two-way or multi-factor ANOVA we can check the relationship on a response like", "Drawing above conclusions doing one test is always interesting right ??
