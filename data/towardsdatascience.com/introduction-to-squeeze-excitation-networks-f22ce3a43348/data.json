SENets introduced a key architectural unit \u2014 Squeeze-and-Excitation Block (SE Block) which was crucial to the gains in performance. SE Blocks can also be easily added to other architectures with low additional overhead.", "Typically, CNNs work by extracting information from the spatial dimensions and storing them in the channel dimensions. This is why the spatial dimensions of feature maps shrink while the channels grow as we go deeper in a CNN. All channels are weighted equally when considering the output feature map of one particular CNN layer.", "We know that earlier layers in a CNN are responsible for capturing basic features like edges, corners and lines, while later layers capture higher level features such as faces and text. Thus, there is a case to be made for", "The main idea of an SE Block is: Assign each channel of a feature map a different weightage (excitation) based on how important each channel is (squeeze).", "SE Blocks can be split into 3 main parts \u2014 Squeeze, Computation, Excitation. Here I will go through them in more detail.", "Global Average Pooling is performed on the output feature map of the CNN layer. This is essentially taking the average value over all activations in the spatial dimension (H x W), giving one activation per-channel. The result of this is a vector of shape (1 x 1 x C).", "Vector from the previous operation is passed through two successive Fully-Connected Layers. This serves the purpose of fully capturing channel-wise dependencies that were aggregated from the spatial maps. A ReLU activation is performed after the first FC layer, while the sigmoid activation is used after the second FC layer. In the paper, there is also a reduction ratio such that the intermediate output of the first FC layer is of a smaller dimension. The final output of this step also has a shape (1 x 1 x C).", "Lastly, the output of the computation step is used as a per-channel weight modulation vector. It is simply multiplied with the original input feature map of size ( H x W x C ). This scales the spatial maps for each channel according to their \u2018importance\u2019.", "SE Blocks can be easily integrated with many existing CNNs. In the paper, architectures such as ResNets ,VGG and Inception had their accuracy boosted significantly, yet at a low additional computational cost.", "Here is a sample code snippet that you can experiment with. Written in PyTorch. As you can see, it is really simple to add in the functionality of Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks! In about 10 lines of code, we have a modular implementation from moskomule that can be easily implemented to most Deep CNNs.", "The main appeal of SE Blocks would be their simplicity. Just from the figure alone, we can understand the functionality and steps involved in the Squeeze-Excite process. Furthermore, they can be added into models without much increase in computational cost, so everyone should experiment with integrating this into their deep learning architectures!", "Your home for data science.
