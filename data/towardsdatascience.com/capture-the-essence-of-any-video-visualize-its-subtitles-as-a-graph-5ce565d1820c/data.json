It\u2019s a great way to get an overview of a subject, before getting into a more in-depth research. The only problem is the time. I love the 1.5x speed feature, but it still wastes a lot of minutes and exposes me to the information I don\u2019t necessarily need.", "You will be guaranteed to have a pretty good overview of the subject in just 3 minutes. And if you want to get deeper, you can always watch the rest at your favorite speed (although in a much more efficient way as you already know the main topics).", "Interested? Let me demonstrate how it works\u2026", "First, you need to find a video that you\u2019re interested in. It can be a MOOC lecture, a TED talk, or a YouTube video. In the example below I will use one of the most popular TED talks of Ken Robinson on how \u201cschools kill creativity\u201d.", "You will then need to get the subtitles of this video: these can be downloaded as a file or simply extracted from YouTube (as it provides automatic captions to most uploads in many different languages).", "The subtitles can then be visualized using a text to network transformation algorithm. In this example I use InfraNodus open-source software, which can automatically extract the subtitles file from any YouTube video and visualize them as a network graph. If your video is not on YouTube, you can simply copy and paste the subtitles from the file into a new graph in InfraNodus.", "This is the result (click here for the interactive version):", "The words are normalized (using a lemmatization algorithm), the stopwords are excluded (these can be adjusted), the main topical clusters are identified (indicated with different colors), the words that link those clusters together are shown bigger on the graph (the nodes with a higher betweenness centrality). As a result we obtain a pretty good representation of what the video is about in just a few seconds:", "We can see that the main topics are:education \u2014 system \u2014 ideapeople \u2014 talk \u2014 humanhear \u2014 happen \u2014 womanchild \u2014 dance \u2014 future", "The most influential words in this talk areeducation \u2014 people \u2014 year \u2014 talk", "Which gives a pretty good idea of what the talk is about.", "Now that we have an overview, we might want to have a more precise idea and to put these keywords and topics that we extracted in context.", "The best way to do that is to select the topic or the keywords we\u2019re interested in, for example:education | creativity | important", "And perform a search on the subtitles to find the part of the text that contains the highest concentration of these terms. If you click these nodes in InfraNodus, you\u2019ll be able to get to the relevant parts of the text:", "On this graph I see the excerpt from the subtitles file of the video, where the speaker is just talking about \u201ceducation\u201d, \u201ccreativity\u201d and \u201cimportant\u201d.", "Click on the video link in that excerpt and you will get directly to the part of the video (timecoded) where Ken Robinson is talking about these topics: http://youtu.be/iG9CE55wbtY?t=185", "You can then select some other part of the video, for example:", "This offers a new way to watch videos in a non-linear way, focusing on the important concepts, which can be a huge time-saver in the context of informational overload.", "If you don\u2019t feel like interacting with a graph, you can also get to the most essential parts of the video if you select the topics that have the highest concentration of the main words for each topics.", "In InfraNodus this feature is realized using the Essence tab, which is essentially a summarization tool. It aligns the excerpts that contain the main topics chronologically, so after you watch 4 of them (15 seconds each), you can get a pretty good idea of the video\u2019s content.", "This data can of course be also streamed to another application using an API, which could then have a more user-friendly interface to play the video (not everyone likes the graphs). Let me know if you\u2019d like to build an app like that :)", "This feature is pretty cool, because instead of watching a 20-minute long video or skimming through it randomly, you can now skim in a much more efficient way in a matter of seconds. The algorithm chooses the main junctions for meaning circulation and helps you get to the parts of the video, which are most relevant for the discourse formation.", "You can try this with several popular TED talk videos we visualized below to see how it works. Just open the page and click on the \u201cEssence\u201d tab at the top left corner and then follow the timecoded YouTube links from each statement to get to the relevant parts of the videos:", "\u2022 What makes a good life? Lessons from the longest study on happiness by Robert Waldinger (video)", "\u2022 The Power of Introverts by Susan Cain (video)", "Most recommender systems work on the basis of similarity \u2014 \u201cpeople who liked the video you like also like\u2026\u201d This method works pretty well, but it suffers from popularity bias and may lock viewers into filter bubbles.", "A solution for this is to develop recommender systems that work on a different basis: helping to generate insight from text using network analysis.", "The basic idea is very simple: in social sciences there\u2019s a well-known concept of \u201cstructural gaps\u201d \u2014 the parts of the graph which are not connected. This is the place where innovation occurs. If we use this metaphor when we study text, structural gaps are the places where the new ideas are born. If you connect two different topics that were disconnected before, you\u2019ll generate an insight. This can be done both within a graph that describes a certain narrative, but also between different graphs.", "In the context of our graph the structural gaps between the most prominent clusters indicate the parts of the discourse, which are underdeveloped.", "In InfraNodus can get to those structural gaps if you click the \u201cInsight\u201d pane at the top left of the graph:", "As you can see it shows the parts of the graph and the statements within the discourse that are prominent enough but are not really connected. So asking a question that links the two statements (or the two sets of keywords) together may lead to a novel idea that will still be relevant to the whole discourse.", "This article was written by Dmitry Paranyushkin from Nodus Labs.
