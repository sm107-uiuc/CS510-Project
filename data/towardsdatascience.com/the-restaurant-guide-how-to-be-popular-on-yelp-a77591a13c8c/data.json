So for the love of food, I wanted to discover significant predictors of popularity, as signaled by count of reviews on Yelp. Specifically, I set out to answer the questions for restaurants:", "To answer these questions, I merged a few of Yelps\u2019 datasets and scraped Yelp\u2019s Browse page to get information on the business, reviews and photos posted. I focused on just one city, Las Vegas because I wanted to analyze the impact of neighborhoods within a city. This yielded 1,165 unique restaurants in my dataset.", "The data was highly skewed with most restaurants having fewer than 1,000 reviews and a few of them having up to 10,000 reviews. To improve interpretability, the dataset was reduced to only include restaurants between 20 and 800 reviews. This reduced the size to 82% of the original collected data for final model fitting.", "The image above roughly models the steps taken to model review count prediction, albeit it was more iterative than linear. In a nutshell, I used simple Linear Regression to provide information about predictors while performing feature engineering. Regularization techniques helped in managing non-significant and collinear features. The thought process and code are detailed below.", "Simple Linear Regression with feature standardization gave insights during the feature engineering process. Since I\u2019ll be running this frequently, it made sense to create a function:", "This following section deep dives to just three inferences we can obtain from the model, but I will expound on individual coefficients in the Take-Away section.", "A restaurant may have more than one food category as labeled by Yelp. Within the 1165 restaurants that were being analyzed, there were 146 different cuisines.", "Using Python\u2019s Word Cloud, you can see that a few categories appear at many times (Mexican restaurants appear at least 135 times) while many cuisines seem so exotic, such as Live/Raw or Malaysian food appear only one time (sadly!).", "There were two ways to include cuisines as features:", "How to determine N: run cross-validation model for each N. The left image below graphs each N for the one feature method and the right image graphs each N for the many features method. Using this visualization, I selected the many features method creating 21 dummy variable for each of the popular cuisines.", "That is still a lot of features, but since I was running a Lasso model I expected to remove some of those 21 cuisines.", "10 cuisines were selected in the final model (see table). Note on coefficient values: since the target variable was logged, you can read the values as percent change in count of reviews if your restaurant included the cuisine as a category on Yelp.", "Mexican, American (New), Sandwiches and Fast Food were negative predictors while the rest were positive predictors.", "Unsurprisingly defining your restaurant as Fast Food would result in 11.9% lower predicted review counts. However, I was disappointed that Mexican food would result in 9.7% lower review counts \u2014 there can never be enough Mexican restaurants in the city!", "Using the same technique as above in Cuisines to determine if neighborhoods matter, I was disappointed to find that it did not at all improve the models\u2019 R-square significantly. Although the null hypothesis was not rejected, I thought this was an interesting point to make. While it would have been nice to recommend a neighborhood to a restaurant owner, my only recommendation here is: worry about other things, location does not matter!", "Yelp\u2019s photo dataset has photo label information with the following labels:", "I found these labels helpful as an indicator to learn whether the aesthetics of food/drink or ambience (the inside /outside labels) matter more to a restaurant\u2019s success. I set this indicator for restaurants with more than 10 photos for the sake of relevancy (a restaurant with 20 ambience photos and 10 food photo conveys stronger information about aesthetics than a restaurant with 2 ambience photos and 1 food photo).", "In general, restaurants have more photos of food posted than ambience photos:", "Hence, I create a dummy variable called food_70 to indicate if the restaurant had a food/drink ratio of at least a 70:100.", "The next feature is the count of photos. While there might be a feedback loop relationship between number of photos and review count (more popular restaurants have more photos), I believed there would be a weaker feedback loop relationship for restaurants with fewer photos (less than 10).", "Hence, three dummy variables were created: restaurants with zero photos, 1\u20135 photos and 6\u201310 photos.", "Before throwing the features into the model, some simple Exploratory Analysis reveals that restaurants with more reviews have, on average a more balanced food: ambience ratio (close to 1.5:1 than 3:0 for restaurants with fewer than 50 reviews).", "If your restaurant has no photos, your odds of having fewer reviews increase significantly.", "And unsurprisingly, having zero photos will not help your case in getting more than even 50 reviews.", "I used R Square to select my final model and achieved a 0.50 score. When plotting predicted reviews against actual reviews, the model still does a bad job at predicting restaurants with review count on the higher range", "Some additional takeaways, from the Beta coefficient table:", "Given the R Square score of 0.5, Linear Regression might not be the best model to predict count of reviews. However, the model does give strong suggestions on what restaurants should consider when opening in a new city.", "In future work, it would be worth extending the analysis to include more cities since we know that neighborhoods do not matter.
