I walked in bright-eyed and bushy-tailed. I was expecting all the buzz words \u2014 neural networks, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and more. And the first lecture was the most disappointing 75 minutes of my Duke experience. Instead of cool-sound buzz words, I got depth-first search and recursion.", "It ended up being one of my favorite classes and my professor knew exactly what he was doing. We had to learn the basics before we could take on the big stuff. We didn\u2019t stand a fighting chance against deep learning if we didn\u2019t know the fundamentals inside and out. Mr. Miyagi was teaching us to wax cars. Path search on, path search off\u2026", "Even so, as I learned more, I remember looking down my nose at path search algorithms. They didn\u2019t seem intelligent at all. You\u2019re telling me you just generate all possible paths, take a guess at whichever one is best, then explore that path? Human beings are way more intelligent than this. We are at the top of the food chain for a reason!", "But then I had to run some errands after that lecture. I had to get lunch, buy a textbook, and get to another class. So, I thought \u201cI can get lunch then go to class then get my textbook. Ah, but wait, the store will be closed by then. Maybe I\u2019ll get the book, then lunch, then class. But, no, I\u2019m hungry now. Okay, I\u2019ll get lunch, get the book, then go to class.\u201d If you missed the irony here, read it again.", "Either computers are incredibly smart, or humans aren\u2019t as smart as we think we are. I lean largely towards the latter.", "In this article, we are going to cover four search algorithms to tackle the following problem. Say you are given a two-dimensional grid. You start at the top left and can only move down or to the right. Each cell in the grid has a point value. You collect all the point values of the cells on your path. Your goal is to collect as many points as possible.", "We first try a recursive approach. Recursion is simple and easy. Our base case is reaching the cell in the bottom right. Otherwise, we are going to make recursive calls for moving down and to the right. We then take the maximum value of these two calls at each step. This allows us to decompose our problem into smaller subproblems. The implementation of this approach is below.", "This approach works but recursive calls are expensive. As the size of our grid grows, we may run into a stack overflow. This happens when we make more recursive calls than our stack in memory can handle. So, we move to a depth-first search (DFS) approach.", "In DFS, we fully explore a path before moving to another. We use a stack to keep track of our paths. We move down as far as we can and then we move to the right. We are still exploring as many paths as in the recursive solution but we are using less memory and preventing a stack overflow. For a two-dimensional grid of length 2, our stack is shown below.", "We have to do a little legwork to write our DFS algorithm. We\u2019ll define a GridCell class. For each cell, we\u2019ll record if we\u2019ve gone down or to the right from this cell. For each full path, we\u2019ll keep track of the score. If it is larger than the score of our current path, we\u2019ll update our maximum value and our optimal path to the current value and path. This is shown in the code below.", "We still haven\u2019t addressed a major problem within our algorithm. We repeatedly calculate all paths from the same cell. This leads to many overlapping subproblems. For example, consider the grid below of size n = 5. There are roughly n ways to get to the middle cell. From the middle cell, there are about n more ways to get to the bottom-right cell. This means we are doing n\u00b2 calculations for this path and all other paths. This is very inefficient.", "What if we could begin at the corners? What if we worked from the top left and the bottom right and met in the middle? We could then take the optimal path from the top-half and the optimal path from the bottom-half and pair them together. We now only do n computations rather than n\u00b2. This is a huge improvement, especially for large n. This is referred to as bidirectional search and is illustrated below. Note the direction of the arrows.", "But, we can do more. We can leverage the processing power of modern-day computers. When your Python code runs, it is broken down into code that your CPU can execute. Out of the box, Python code does not support parallelism. For our purposes, we consider parallelism as the simultaneous execution of functions. Right now, our code runs linearly. If funcA() precedes funcB(), funcA() needs to terminate before funcB() begins.", "However, this doesn\u2019t have to be the case. If funcA() and funcB() are independent, we can run them at the same time. We can leverage parallelism using multiprocessing in Python. This means we can calculate the paths from the top left and the bottom right simultaneously.", "We perform bidirectional search in parallel and see considerable improvements in runtime. This code for this implementation can be found here. However, for very large n, this problem still takes a while. To solve this problem, we turn to heuristic search.", "Our next algorithm leverages a critical concept in search and in artificial intelligence. The idea of a heuristic. A heuristic is an evaluative function that helps us estimate the optimal path to the goal. At each iteration, we apply the heuristic to all possible future states. Then we explore the path of whichever state has the highest heuristic value.", "We need to define a heuristic for our problem. Suppose we are at the top-left cell in our grid. All of the cells in the gray are accessible whether we move right or down. However, we lose the orange cells if we move down and we lose the blue cells if we move to the right. So, we can look at the average cell value for the orange cells and the blue cells. We\u2019ll move in the direction of the higher average cell value. We can do this for every cell.", "This solution is not exact. But, it is incredibly fast. We also see relatively optimal solutions. If our cell values range from 1 to 5, we see solutions that are 90% optimal for a grid size of n = 13. As the range of our cells increases, we see less optimal solutions. For example, with a range of 1 to 100, we see solutions that are 85% optimal for n = 13. This may not get you a path to the moon but it\u2019ll get you a path to the grocery store.", "The implementation of this heuristic search algorithm is below. If you\u2019re interested, feel free to clone the repository and play around with the heuristic. A more accurate heuristic leads to more optimal solutions.", "There are many real-world applications for this problem. One obvious example is a GPS application planning a route. We could assign values to roads corresponding to their speed limit divided by the distance. Finding a solution here allows us to find a quick route. But if we can assign point values to states that represent a problem, we can use any of these algorithms. We could just as easily use these exact same algorithms to find the optimal marketing strategy for the release of a new iPhone.", "This also highlights the problem with many search problems. As these problems grow, it takes too long to find the optimal solution. So, we have to make tradeoffs between speed and optimality, as we have done here.", "Questions? Comments?
