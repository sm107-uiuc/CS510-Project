Each decade, we\u2019ve embraced a new way to interact with technology. We\u2019ve evolved from character mode to a graphical user interface, to the web, to mobile.", "Voice now offers a faster and easier way to communicate and accomplish tasks than mobile apps.", "We can either tell Alexa what we need (turn off the lights, adjust the thermostat, and set an alarm \u2014 or all of the above using a single utterance like \u201cAlexa, good night\u201d), or you can pull your phone, unlock it, open the right app, and perform the task or tasks.", "When you consider habitual use cases \u2014 those that keep customers coming back over time \u2014 the efficiency gained through voice adds up over time.", "\u201cTexting will decline in the future because of Alexa\u201d", "Therefore, that made me very interested in embarking on a new project to build a simple speech recognition with Python.", "And of course, I won\u2019t build the code from scratch as that would require massive training data and computing resources to make the speech recognition model accurate in a decent manner.", "Instead, I used Google Speech Recognition API to perform the speech-to-text tasks with Python (check out the demo below which I showed you how the speech recognition worked \u2014 LIVE!).", "By the end of this article, I hope you\u2019ll have better understanding of how speech recognition works in general and most importantly, how to implement that using Google Speech Recognition API with Python.", "Feel free to check out the source code here if you\u2019re interested.", "You may be wondering, \u201cIs this the only API available given the growing demand and popularity of speech recognition?\u201d", "The answer is that there are also other APIs available either for free or paid services as below:", "At the end, I chose Google Web Speech API from the SpeechRecognition library as it has a default API key that is hard-coded into the SpeechRecognition library.", "That means you can get started right away without having to get authentication with either an API key or a username/password combination for other APIs.", "However, the convenience of Google Web Speech API also comes with certain limitations: The API quota for your own keys is 50 requests per day, and there is currently no way to raise this limit.", "This fits our use case if we just want to use this API for experimentation purposes.
