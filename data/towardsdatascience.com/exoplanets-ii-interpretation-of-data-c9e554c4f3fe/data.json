By plotting graphs of the data, we can visually see the correlations with theories or laws of physics established several centuries ago by renowned physicists such as Newton and Kepler.", "To fully understand the science behind the field of exoplanets, one must look at the actual research data which is often made public. Several teams have compiled all the information into large databases available for public viewing through the Internet, such as the NASA Exoplanet Archive or the Extrasolar Planets Encyclopaedia. The most useful tool in these websites is the graph plotter, which allows one to visually explore, comprehend and analyze the data in several different ways.", "In the following pages we will analyse a set of interesting graphs generated using the data from www.exoplanets.org, a site maintained by the California Planet Survey consortium which displays the list of confirmed exoplanets (i.e. no candidates), along with their characteristics.", "The above graph shows the number of exoplanets detected in relation to their orbital periods i.e. the number of days they take to complete a full orbit around their parent star.", "At a quick glance, there are a few features that stand out in this graph. First of all, there are two big peaks, one between 3 and 4 orbital period days which is narrow but long, and the other, short but wide, which peaks at approximately 400 orbital period days. The other noticeable feature is the deep dip between the two peaks.", "Now if we were to put the orbital periods of our solar system\u2019s planets, five out of the eight planets would fit in the second peak. Yet, we seem to find as many exoplanets within the parameters of the first peak. Furthermore, it seems that no planets have been detected that have more than 5000 days as their orbital period, which is just a bit more than Jupiter\u2019s orbital period. Even though many of the planets detected don\u2019t seem to have Jupiter\u2019s orbital period, a large number of them do have Jupiter\u2019s mass.", "The graph shows two coloured sections. The smaller, yellow section represents the Jupiter- Analogs i.e. the exoplanets that are like our own Jupiter in terms of mass and orbital period. The bigger, red section represents the Hot Jupiters, which are also similar to Jupiter in terms of mass, but they have a much smaller orbital period, meaning they orbit very close to their parent star, hence receiving a lot of light and heat, making them, as their name suggests, hot. As the (second) graph shows, the orbits of these Hot Jupiters are smaller than that of Mercury, the planet closest to its host star in our own solar system. There are 125 Hot Jupiters shown in the graph, but only 11 Jupiter-Analogs. And therein lays the biggest surprise in the search for exoplanets.", "Researchers have found many such intriguing patterns which have confounded expectations. What makes the findings of Hot Jupiters unusual to us, is that before we started discovering many planets, the general consensus was that the smaller sized planets would orbit closer to the star and perhaps the massive ones remained on the outskirts of the planetary systems. However, many of the newfound planets orbit their stars at relatively tiny distances, less than one-sixth of the distance from sun to Mercury, the innermost planet in our solar system. No one anticipated that Jupiter-like planets could exist so close to their stars. With this new data, what we thought was basic knowledge of solar systems is now no longer up-to-date. We must now also re-evaluate our place in the universe: how common is our solar-system type? Is it unique? Are we a rare type or are we typical? How much do we really know and understand?", "Currently, exoplanets are detected by using their parent stars as a tool. In other words, we are discovering new extrasolar planetary systems, and already have enough to come up with the following statistic: at least 50% of the exoplanets discovered so far are not like our solar system in terms of the planetary positioning. This implies that our kind of solar system makes up at best only half of the all the planetary systems in the universe. Essentially, when we look at the stars, we see that only one out of every two stars have terrestrial planets. This suggests that systems like ours are not the majority in the universe! Even the terrestrial planets that have been found are several times more massive than Earth, and thus called \u201cSuper Earths\u201d.", "One of the theories put forward to explain the mystery of Hot Jupiters is the Theory of Migration, which says that the planets migrated inwards with time, and we are therefore seeing them at a later stage of formation. Indeed, these massive planets must have started out a hundred times further away and with time migrated inwards to reach their present distances from their stars.", "This of course begs the question as to how and, more importantly, why would they migrate, assuming they did? Were their original orbits unstable? What generated the energy to give momentum to these massive bodies? Perhaps the truth will never be clear to us, but the Theory of Planetary Migration does provide us with some explanation for occurrence of Hot Jupiters.", "The following graph is a good illustration of Hot-Jupiters:", "The X-Axis of this graph represents the semi-major axis, which is the distance from the star to its orbiting planet. The Y-Axis represents the mass of the exoplanets, which is measured in relation to Jupiter\u2019s mass to make the scale more relevant to the issue of Hot Jupiters.", "Finally, a colour scale is added, as shown on the right side of the graph, to represent the Orbital Eccentricity of each planet. The Orbital Eccentricity is the amount by which the planet\u2019s orbit deviates from a proper circle. At zero, the orbit of a planet is perfectly circular, represented in blue. As the eccentricity increases, the orbit becomes more parabolic, seen in red in Graph 3 above.", "In Graph 3, one can clearly see two main concentrated clusters of planets. As mentioned before, the majority have the same mass as Jupiter. The top left hand side clump consists of planets that are hotter, since they are much closer to their star. These are the typical Hot Jupiters, and most were detected using the Transit Method. We can also see that almost all of these planets are represented in blue, meaning their orbital eccentricity is close to zero, implying a circular orbit.", "However, the other clump of planets is in a much colder region, being much further away from its star. The semi-major axis is approximately 1 AU. Unlike the previous cluster, this clump has a mixed orbital eccentricity: they range from 0 to 0.8, meaning they tend to have a more eccentric orbit. These seem to be the typical gas giants, also called Jupiter-Analogs, and are mostly detected by the Radial Velocity method, as illustrated in Graph 4 below.", "The difference in eccentricities between the two clumps is striking. Most planets in the left clump have perfectly circular orbits, while those in the right clump are more varied and tend to be eccentric. It is the difference in the semi-major axis between the two clumps that causes this dissimilitude. The planets of the left clump have a smaller semi-major axis, meaning they are closer to their star, and thus tidally locked by its huge gravitational pull. A tidally locked astronomical body takes just as long to rotate around its own axis as it does to revolve around its partner. This causes one side to constantly face the partner body. A prime example illustrating this phenomenon is the Moon, which is tidally locked to the Earth, as it is always showing us the same hemisphere. However, the planets on the right hand side clump are not tidally locked, because they are too far away from their stars and therefore receive a weaker gravitational pull. At 1 AU, they mirror the Earth: they have the necessary angular momentum to continuously orbit their parent stars, but are not tidally locked by it.", "Graph 3 also raises an interesting question: could two planets from the two different clumps exist in the same planetary system? In other words, could a planetary system possibly contain both a Hot Jupiter and a Jupiter Analog? So far, only one has been found, and it is considered a rare configuration.", "However, to properly answer this question we need to improve our knowledge of the formation of Hot Jupiters. Recall that these types of planets have been mostly found using the Transit method. When a planet passes in front of its star, we can effectively measure its orbital inclination angle. When we look at the statistics, we see that most of the Hot Jupiters do not have an orbit perpendicular to the axe of rotation of the star, which is strange because it is unlike any planet in our solar system. For the planets to be orbiting their stars at an inclined plane, it is believed that some violent event or mechanism took place. So, the Hot Jupiters were probably formed by some unknown dramatic and dynamic phenomenon that \u201cbroke up\u201d whole systems of these planets. This also implies that the theory of migration does not explain everything about the formation of Hot Jupiters, as they themselves cannot be the catalysts of the violent mechanisms. Therefore the probability of only one planet turning into a Hot Jupiter, while another planet in the same system remains untouched, is very low and would be considered odd. Most of the confirmed Hot Jupiters are isolated, meaning they are the single planet orbiting their stars. They live a lonely life indeed.", "But perhaps the most noticeable feature in this graph is the presence of gaps. The fact that we don\u2019t seem to be finding any planets in the lower right corner and in the lower range, between to 0.01 Jupiter Mass, which is where the rocky terrestrial planets should be, is surprising. If we put in the data of our own planets, Venus and Earth would find themselves in the lonely and isolated bottom of the chart. None of our planets would be placed in the left hand-side clump.", "Furthermore, there is also a large gap between the two clumps. Is this how the actual universe is? Are Earth-like planets really so rare, or is what we are seeing actually a selection effect, biased by our methods of detection?", "In truth, the reason why we are not detecting planets in the lower right corner is not because of a selection effect, but because we are at the threshold of our current detection capacities. Let us consider a small mass on the graph, say 0.03 Jupiter mass. For this given mass, we can see that we are being able to detect exoplanets relatively easily at a short distance. However, when we increase the distance i.e. the semi-major axis, the planets become much harder to detect. In fact, for our chosen mass, we seem to be finding no planets at all after 0.4 AU. This is due to the weakening of the amplitude signal the Radial Velocity method requires to detect planets. The weakening occurs because the required signal is directly dependent on the orbital period of the exoplanet.", "The following equation of the RV method relates, for any exoplanet, its amplitude and orbital period (and therefore the semi-major axis, as both are directly related):", "Since the mass and the inclination of the exoplanet are fixed, we can simplify the original equation and see that the product of the amplitude and the orbital period equals a constant. This implies an inversely proportional relationship between the two variables. We can see that as the orbital period p increases, the amplitude k decreases. Conversely, as the orbital period decreases, the amplitude increases. The radial velocity method is unable to detect planets with a high value of semi-major axis (i.e. a large orbital period), because the amplitude of the signal becomes very low. Thus, with reference to Graph 3, we cannot detect any planets in the region from which signals of low amplitude are emitted. This is why many planets have been detected in the top left corner, but none in the lower right corner.", "To be able to detect planets in the lower right corner area of the graph, we have to improve the sensitivity of our instruments of measure, so that the amplitude of the signal can be detected more accurately. We have already made significant progress since the detection of 51 Pegasi b, and will continue to do so. The progress is depicted on Graph 5 which also shows the detection lines. The detection lines correspond to the amplitude k of the signal. We see that we are effectively moving diagonally from the top left corner to the lower right corner. The upper left diagonal detection lines have larger amplitudes, while the lower ones have smaller ones, the smallest being approximately 1 meter per second.", "Graph 6 clearly shows a striking relationship between the semi-major axis and the orbital period of exoplanets. Unlike the previous graphs, we can see that there is a tight correlation between the time taken by the planet to go once around its orbit, and the distance from its star. We have simply changed the parameter of the Y-Axis, and we get an entirely different view. This time if we put in our own planets, they would fit in perfectly.", "This graph is perhaps a special one, as it proves the universal application of one of physics\u2019 fundamental laws: Kepler\u2019s Third Law of Planetary Motion, put in place long before the discovery of an exoplanet. It is important for the search of exoplanets as it can effectively be used to calculate the distance between an exoplanet and its star, and determine if it resides within the habitable zone.", "According to this Law, the ratio between the cube of the semi-major axis a^3 and the square of the orbital period p^2 is constant i.e.:", "However, in Graph 6 based on values drawn from exoplanets, we note that that the line represents the same ratio. If In the logarithmic scale of the above graph, we choose two points on the x axis (a1;a2) and the corresponding points on the y axis (p1;p2), then:", "This proves that for any given point on the line i.e. for the values of any planet, the ratio of the two parameters is constant. This is consistent with Kepler\u2019s Third law. The law that Kepler derived by observing the planets of our solar system holds true for the extrasolar planets that are being discovered now, some three or four hundred years later. We can see that the slope of the line in Figure 5 and Graph 6 are the same. This certifies that gravity functions the same across planetary systems. Kepler\u2019s law illustrates that all planets across different systems and diverse environments obey gravity in exactly the same way.", "We can also observe that the line is straight for most of the data, except for the lower left corner, where the data appears to be more scattered. The planets in this region are the same as those in the left hand side clump in the Graph 3. We can see that there are more planets above the orbital period of 1 day, than below it. This begs the question as to why the scatter is only one-sided. One possible explanation is that our current scientific technology is not advanced enough to correctly measure planets that orbit in less than a day. By checking the data of the 11 planets that are in the lower left column, we see that seven of these planets were detected using the Transit method, and the other four through the Radial Velocity method.", "Another question is why the scatter is only present in the area where the semi-major axis is small. Why is there no scatter in the top right corner instead? The reason is the closeness of the planets to their stars. At small distances, the planets are subject to a stronger gravitational force by the host star, making their orbits more circular. As shown in Graph 8, the blue colour indicates a low orbital eccentricity, meaning a more circular orbit.", "They effectively become like the moon is to the earth: they get tidally locked and rotate in a circular motion. The orbits become more elliptical as the eccentricity increases. At low orbital eccentricity, it is harder to determine the Semi-major axis correctly. The blue points therefore have a larger margin of error than the other points. Hence we can assume that these planets are either not exactly following Kepler\u2019s law due to their low eccentricity and extreme closeness to their star, or else they are indeed following the law but we\u2019ve made marginal errors in our measurement of the orbital period.", "To conclude, we can see that plotting the data on graphs helps to not only visually represent all the discovered exoplanets, but also serves to categorize and differentiate between them. By interpreting the graphs, we can question the reasons for different phenomena, such as Hot Jupiters, and attempt to explain them by elaborating theories such as that of Planetary Migration. On the other hand, we can also note how all exoplanets are similar in terms of obeying the same laws of gravity and motion, leading us to conclude that certain rules of physics apply to every element in the universe.", "Furthermore, by interpreting these graphs we also realise the current limitations of the astronomical instrumentation, and attempt to improve on these in order to detect a wider range of exoplanets. By trying to further refine the technology, we can focus on reaching the goal of finding habitable terrestrial planets in the unexplored regions of these graphs.", "References: This research has made use of the Exoplanet Orbit Databaseand the Exoplanet Data Explorer at www.exoplanets.org", "Machine Learning Researcher at Idiap.
