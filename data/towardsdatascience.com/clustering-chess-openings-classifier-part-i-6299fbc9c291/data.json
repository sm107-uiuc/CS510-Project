Clustering applications are many, and the algorithms we choose are dependent on the kind of problem we need to solve. In this series, I will explain how to find among thousands of samples (chess matches) the most popular openings among professionals.", "One of the most exciting things to do for a beginner analyst is to work on data of any sort. Why not working on chess matches data? This data is open source, can be found in big volumes without too much trouble, and is available from multiple sources.", "In chess theory, the initial stages of a match have already been studied and conceptualized. Instead of improvising, champions are used to study the development of games starting with openings: Grandmasters have given name to thousand of predefined sequences for chess gameplay. Professional chess players study those sequences to have a competitive advantage against their enemies.", "One of the best websites for players to play free chess and improve their skills is called lichess.org. This website allows developers to download all the data they want for free, only with a small data flow limitation.", "I found what are the top 50 players in lichess.org by their tags, and saved their names into a python list. This is one of the few pieces of information I need to start downloading data from the server. In this tutorial, I will simply use 3 nametags, but in my code (in my repository) you will find all the 50 nametags of the top chess players.", "I will begin setting the main variables that will store all the main information through our algorithm.", "When we will run our algorithm, player_completed, and game_dataset, in case of successful queries, will be filled with information that we can export.", "Now I need to create a function that can perform a single request. Because to download information, I will need to access a specific link, I will use a function that can create the right string that allows me to perform a GET request. I will run this function multiple times so that I will create one link for every single player on my list, and I will download 200 games for each player at a single time.", "Unfortunately, the data is in ndjson format. I have not able to decode it with any known library because of a bug: I will need to improvise an algorithm that can extract every single game and add it in a list.", "Now it is time to run the algorithm. As usual, we cannot stress the online databases too much, otherwise, they might cut us out from making queries for a few minutes. If we have to restart manually our downloading algorithm every time something goes wrong, it would be more comfortable to use our browser to download these data manually (what we want to avoid).", "To solve this problem, I will be attempting to send a query (a GET request) to the database every 140 seconds.", "***In case we are not running the algorithm for the first time and some matches (but not all the ones in the tag list) have been already stored in our variables (in a few words, our previous attempt has been partially complete) I added a workaround. The function will find out that it is attempting to download tags already in the list: it will return 0 as an output, and the algorithm will pass it as a measure to avoid making identical queries. You can add exit cases for errors, to make it more smooth.", "As we can see, after running and waiting for the necessary time for every single request, the algorithm should output the state of every request.", "I have stored the successfully downloaded tags in a specific list.", "All the matches have been stored in a single DataFrame called final_dataset.", "To extract every move played in matches, every row has to be in the same format. Every row (at least apparently) has the following pattern:", "However, I will need to check for rows that have a problem and may create bugs in the analysis of our data. Therefore, I will signal all the rows that do not begin by 1.", "***This seems like a very approximate method of finding anomalies, but after testing the dataset with a clustering algorithm it turned out to be enough", "Rows 106 and 107 do not have the identical pattern, let us see more closely:", "Because rows 106 and 107 have anomalies, we are just going to delete them. If you were to download thousands of more matches, the rows that contain anomalies would have probably been more.", "We are ready to export our dataset to use it for analysis purposes:", "Your home for data science.
