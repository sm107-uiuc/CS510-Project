Being uncomfortable and exhausted is pretty much the definition of the third trimester.", "But Eve knew something was not right. When the itching started, sleeping gave way to nocturnal scratching\u2014and Googling. At first what she found online was reassuring\u2014pregnancy does have a way of making you itchy due to increased blood flow to the skin\u2014but her itching seemed different. Much more intense and widespread. Then she read about a relatively rare condition of the liver that can cause severe itching in pregnancy. This disorder is associated with some pretty bad outcomes for babies, so Eve decided to ask her OB. The doc thought the chances were pretty small it was anything serious, but she ordered the tests just to be safe.", "The liver functioning results came back first because the samples were run locally. Only a few labs in the country evaluate bile acid levels, so Eve\u2019s samples had to be shipped out, a process that took 3 to 7 days. As a reward for our patience, we were told her numbers looked fine.\u00b9 Nothing to worry about it seemed.", "Another two weeks passed. I traveled to Kenya and Liberia for work. Eve went to a conference in DC. Her itch tagged along and shared a room. But lying awake in those late-night scratch-fests, she could not shake the feeling that something was wrong.", "She repeated the tests and received her diagnosis on June 8 (Week 31): Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy, or ICP.", "The liver (of the Greek hepato) is a pretty neat organ. When you scarf down a burger at Five Guys, your liver produces bile to breakdown the fat. For reasons that are not fully understood, ICP interrupts this process and creates a buildup of bile acids in the blood (cholestasis). If not managed, ICP is associated with an increased risk of stillbirth and respiratory issues at birth. Whether excess bile acid in the blood causes these problems or is just a marker of some other disease process is not clear.", "The only \u201ccure\u201d for ICP is delivery; most women see their liver functioning return to normal when no longer pregnant. \u201cManaging\u201d ICP during pregnancy typically involves planning for an early delivery and use of the medication Ursodeoxycholic acid (a.k.a., UDCA, Ursodiol, Actigall) that may ease the itching and reduce the amount of toxic bile acids in the blood. Serum bile acid levels greater than 10 \u00b5mol/L mark the onset of ICP, and 40 \u00b5mol/L is the threshold for \u201csevere\u201d ICP.", "When Eve\u2019s results came back pointing to ICP, we tried to learn everything we could about the condition. I landed on the website for ICP Care on June 9, which happened to be the day before ICP Awareness Day. Here\u2019s what grabbed my attention:", "Without active management the risk of stillbirth during an Intrahepatic Cholestasis of Pregnancy can be as high as 15%. However, with active management, including the medication Ursodeoxycholic Acid and early delivery (typically by 36\u201337 weeks gestation), the risk is thought to be about the same as an uncomplicated pregnancy, meaning less than 1%. The mechanisms that lead to stillbirth are not fully understood, and it is impossible to predict which pregnancies are at risk. While studies have found that higher bile acid levels appear to bring higher risk of certain complications such as respiratory distress and fetal distress, studies have not been able to identify the same relationship for stillbirth. Therefore, all ICP pregnancies are recommended to be delivered early.", "We were confident that the overall risk of stillbirth should be low since Eve was being \u201cactively managed\u201d with UDCA and had tentative plans to deliver at 37 weeks, but two questions led us to start digging into the research:", "When it comes to ICP, the \u201coptimal timing\u201d for delivery is the point at which the risk of doing something is less than the risk of doing nothing. Wait too long to give birth, and you risk stillbirth. Act too soon, and you risk infant death or complications following a live birth.", "It should give you some insight into our risk calculation that we started our research journey by looking for studies that estimated the risk of stillbirth by week. The largest study we found on stillbirth rates was a retrospective cohort of 1.6 million pregnancies of women with and without ICP from the state of California.", "In a cohort study, researchers identify people who meet certain criteria and follow them over time to see who develops the outcome of interest. In this particular study, Puljic and colleagues selected women from a vital statistics registry based on their exposure\u2014ICP or no ICP\u2014and extracted linked data on maternal, fetal, and infant outcomes. This is considered a retrospective (or nonconcurrent or historical) cohort design because the pregnancies and outcomes had already happened by the time the authors started their investigation.", "In their dataset of 1.6 million pregnancies, the researchers found 5,545 cases of ICP, an incidence of 0.35%. This is lower than what other studies have found, meaning it\u2019s possible that some proportion of actual ICP pregnancies were not coded correctly. Or maybe the other studies overestimated the incidence of ICP and this study got it right. It\u2019s hard to know.", "The authors present some results in tabular form that I think are better represented as figures, so I attempted a few plots (code is here). The following graphic charts the risk of stillbirth by week for women with and without ICP. It shows that women with ICP have a higher risk of stillbirth at every week compared to women without ICP, but the weekly numbers for the ICP group are so small that the estimates are very uncertain (the yellow band is the 95% confidence interval for ICP, and it includes all of the purple control values which are very precisely estimated). The clearest finding is a substantial increase in the risk of stillbirth for women with ICP at the end of term. By definition these cases were not being fully \u201cmanaged\u201d with early delivery since they did not deliver before 38 weeks, but we don\u2019t know from the data what percentage were taking UDCA.", "This retrospective cohort study by Puljic and colleagues also offers partial data on the risks of delivering early. Among the group of women with ICP, the authors calculated the weekly risk of infant death associated with delivery\u2014a.k.a. doing something\u2014and compared it to what they call the composite mortality risk of expectant management\u2014a.k.a. waiting and doing nothing. The composite risk is the combined risk of stillbirth in a given week plus the risk of infant death if delivery occurs the following week. In other words, they compared the risk of delivering in a given week compared to the risk of waiting one more week.", "Here\u2019s my attempt to plot their data. The authors also plot the point estimates in the paper but not the uncertainty, and I think we need to see both elements. The lines cross at Week 36, suggesting that this could be the optimal point at which the risks of acting are lower than the risks of waiting.", "Of course what\u2019s missing from this risk profile is perinatal morbidity\u2014bad outcomes for moms and babies that stop short of mortality. These can include conditions like cerebral palsy and respiratory distress syndrome, outcomes that are more likely with premature deliveries. It\u2019s not possible to get a true evaluation of the risks of early delivery without considering morbidity.", "Lo and colleagues help us out in this respect with their decision-analytic model. In this study, the authors simulated outcomes for a hypothetical cohort of 10,000 women with ICP based on (a) maternal and neonatal life expectancies, (b) maternal and neonatal utility values for several bad outcomes found in the literature, and (c) published probabilities of neonatal and maternal morbidities, stillbirth with ICP, and neonatal death at 35\u201338 weeks gestation for four different delivery strategies:", "The primary outcome was total quality-adjusted life years, or QALYs. One year of good health is equal to 1 QALY, so the more projected QALYs per person the better. The main results of the simulation are shown here. Delivering immediately at 36 weeks without amniocentesis or steroids appears to maximize QALYs relative to all other strategies.", "When considering the tradeoffs, while there is a higher association of neonatal morbidity with delivery at 36 versus at 37 weeks gestation or later, there is a decreased risk of [stillbirth].", "The following plots show the trends behind the QALY calculations and this conclusion. The risk of outcomes like cerebral palsy and respiratory distress syndrome are highest before 37 weeks, but this is offset by an increased risk of stillbirth in weeks 37 and 38.", "While not a slam dunk, these two studies made us lean toward delivering at 36 weeks instead of 37 weeks as planned. We were further convinced of this when Eve\u2019s next bile acid test came back at 85 \u00b5mol/L the following week.", "When we got this result, I was reading a newly published 2018 review of ICP care published by Dr. Elizabeth Livingston and her colleagues at the Division of Maternal Fetal Medicine in Duke\u2019s OB/GYN Department. In this review, Livingston and colleagues write:", "Given the increased risk of stillbirth in the setting of ICP, induction of labor is often recommended at 37 weeks of gestation to balance the risk of iatrogenic preterm delivery against the risk of fetal mortality. As there is a markedly increased risk of stillbirth when bile acid levels reach 100 \u03bcmol/L or greater, delivery in these cases may be considered at an earlier gestational age, such as 35 to 37 weeks; however, these decisions should be individualized with careful patient counseling.", "Eve was a patient in the Duke Health system, so we met with Dr. Livingston to review our options. Livingston felt comfortable with delivery at 36 weeks given Eve\u2019s high result. But what if her levels crossed the 100 \u00b5mol/L mark?", "The paper by Livingston and colleagues reviews the latest evidence about this relationship and summarizes the main hypotheses about how bile acids might cause stillbirth. One idea is that excess bile acids constrict the blood vessels in the placenta. This might be one reason why stillbirth in ICP seems to be the result of an acute event leading to a lack of oxygen and death, not a chronic deterioration of fetal wellbeing. If so, it helps to explain why fetal monitoring\u2014which Eve did twice weekly\u2014does not reduce the risk of stillbirth in ICP (but is still recommended).", "Right now, high bile acid levels may be the best diagnostic indicator of increased risk for stillbirth, but this is still a matter of some debate. A key piece of evidence comes from a prospective cohort study of women with severe ICP conducted in the UK and published in 2014 in the journal Hepatology. In this study, the cohort was made of up 669 women with severe ICP (defined as bile acid levels \u2265 40 \u00b5mol/L at any time during pregnancy) and the outcome of interest was stillbirth.", "Here are some notable findings from the severe ICP cohort:", "The authors also looked at stillbirth outcomes in two national comparison groups of women without ICP. At 1.5%, the incidence of stillbirth among the severe ICP cohort was about 3 times as high as the incidence of stillbirth among the non-ICP comparison groups.", "Ultimately, Eve\u2019s bile acid levels would never cross the 100 \u00b5mol/L mark. Her peak level was 85.6 \u00b5mol/L. The final test result prior to delivery was 38.4 \u00b5mol/L.", "After a stressful few weeks, Annie Grace was born on July 9, Eve\u2019s birthday. 36 weeks and 1 day. We felt incredibly fortunate. If you\u2019ve been diagnosed with ICP, the available evidence suggests that chances are great that you will have a good outcome too, especially if your doctor prescribes UDCA and schedules your delivery at 36 or 37 weeks (or sooner if it makes sense given your situation).", "Unfortunately, not everyone is so lucky. Early in our journey I read Donna Benavides\u2019s story. She was diagnosed with ICP at 36 weeks and scheduled to be induced at 38 weeks.", "I was confused and scared, this being my first pregnancy. I read more about cholestasis of pregnancy online and printed out some information to discuss with my husband because the statistics on the article I read noted a small percentage of loss of the baby due to ICP. The day after my reactive [non-stress test] \u2014 just two days from being induced \u2014 we lost our son Jorden.", "Donna would go on to found ICP Care and help countless families make sense of a frightening diagnosis. Now she tells other women to fight the itch.", "Donna\u2019s doctor did not know to prescribe UDCA. While ICP is better understood today, it\u2019s still common to read stories on ICP Care\u2019s Itchy Moms Facebook group of women who struggle to get their providers to test for ICP and take their symptoms seriously.", "Be empowered to get tested. Prepare for your appointment with this Dr. Discussion Guide, and share these resources with your provider.", "[1] Eve\u2019s first bile acid level was actually 11.5 \u00b5mol/L, which is above the cutoff that the Wood et al. (2018) recommend for diagnosing ICP. Her result was classified as \u201cnormal\u201d, possibly because the reference range in Duke MyChart for pregnant women ages 15 to 45 was 3.7\u201314.5 \u00b5mol/L.", "Your home for data science.
