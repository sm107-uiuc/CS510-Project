Since the knowledge about the novel coronavirus remains limited, it is imperative to understand the outbreak trends in every region, to open up and broaden the research space. This study is an attempt to add to this exploration by analyzing the COVID-19 outbreak data for Kashmir and gain a better understanding of where Kashmir stands globally.", "Our limited ability to estimate the accuracy and reliability of the data brings unquantifiable uncertainty to COVID-19 data analysis and modeling. As with all surveillance data, there are limitations due to reporting bias and ascertainment bias. Further, the lack of access and quality of diagnostics could also impact the data. So doing a one on one data analysis for various regions may not be an apples-to-apples comparison.", "Nonetheless, exploratory data analysis across different regions with limited reliable data could still help put the situation in perspective and may also contribute to answering some key questions.", "Kashmir, like the rest of the world, is impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and is under lockdown. THE first COVID-19 positive case in Kashmir was reported on Mar 18, 2020. Lockdown was imposed in many parts of Kashmir on Mar 19, 2020.", "As per the latest information by the Govt. of J&K, there are 844 confirmed cases, 400 recoveries, and 9 deaths of the coronavirus disease as of May 12, 2020, in Kashmir valley.", "A rapidly expanding epidemic is demonstrated by a steep increase in the number of cases per day. Efforts to decrease the spread of the epidemic, by slowing transmission, results in a slower rise in the number of cases, a plateau phase, and eventually a decrease in the number of cases reported daily.", "The capacity of the health system can be overwhelmed if too many people seek healthcare at the same time. Hence, it is important to realize that every single one of us has a role to play in flattening the curve.", "Many countries like the US, Italy, Spain have gone through the world\u2019s worst COVID-19 outbreaks.", "South Korea stands out as an exemplar. Being a country with one of the world\u2019s largest initial outbreaks outside China, it managed to bring the spread under control resulting in a decline in the number of cases reported daily.", "Comparing Italy to South Korea shows how dramatic the differences can be. On Mar 1, 2020, Italy had only 1694 cases, while South Korea had 3736 cases. Three weeks later, on March 22, Italy\u2019s caseload had exploded to 59138, while South Korea\u2019s total caseload had merely doubled to 8961 (Source: The Johns Hopkins University of Medicine COVID-19 data repository).", "The key to South Korea\u2019s success has been early and aggressive use of mass testing along with novel digital technologies for contact tracing\u00b9 and isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts.", "Given these experiences from around the globe, it is worth exploring where Kashmir stands in the COVID-19 outbreak.", "Below is the graph comparing Kashmir with some of the countries that lead in COVID-19 positive cases. Since every region faces a different distribution in the outbreak the below graph only helps us look at the situation from a broader view, and does not provide any information about one region being at a higher risk than others.", "This chart uses daily new COVID-19 cases to visualize the outbreak trend in different regions. For each region, the data point starts from the day total COVID-19 positive cases per million crossed 5 and goes all the way to the latest data available. For example, for Kashmir, the data starts from March 30, 2020 (first recorded date for COVID-19 positive cases per million > 5) and ends on May 12, 2020 (the day this article is written).", "However, a higher number of cases alone for any region does not necessarily equate to a higher risk. More likely, it means the testing is more accessible, or reporting is more complete. The key instead is for the infection rate (Ro) to decrease, leading to a plateau phase, and eventually, a decrease in the number of cases reported daily.", "Note: Testing data for Kashmir valley alone is not available. So for this section, the numbers reported are for Jammu & Kashmir collectively, unless stated otherwise.", "The Director-General of WHO in the opening speech at the media briefing on COVID-19 held on 16 March 2020 said, along with a rapid escalation in social distancing, testing, isolation and contact tracing is the backbone of the COVID-19 response.", "Not testing and not knowing who is infected would allow for infections to spread undetected, later on, spelling catastrophe for the health care system.", "Is the available testing data comparable across different regions?", "As stated before, the inconsistency and unreliability of the data may not give us an accurate picture of the epidemic spread or testing situation. The analysis in this section is done only to better understand the testing numbers for Jammu and Kashmir alone, as well as with respect to the rest of the world. The analysis may also lead us to understand whether J&K took appropriate measures in testing and if there\u2019s an immediate need to ramp up the testing.", "Taking South Korea, New Zealand, and Iceland as exemplary regions that have managed to successfully flatten their curves, this analysis attempts to draw attention towards an interesting correlation \u2014 how does J&K compare to these regions, in terms of positive cases detected so far, and the amount of testing?", "One important point that the above plot doesn\u2019t reveal is the number of the tests being conducted. Especially those in the early phase of the outbreak (since the spread is exponential, and once the initial window of mass testing and isolation is lost, the outbreak numbers rise in no time).", "Let\u2019s look at how many tests were South Korea, New Zealand, and Iceland performing early in the outbreak (COVID-19 positive cases detected per million were roughly less than 50).", "For less than 50 positive COVID-19 cases per million, both SK and NZ were testing roughly 2 and 4 times more than J&K respectively. So maybe J&K missed that early window of increased testing, leading to an increase in the number of undetected and unreported cases. However, the region has done a commendable job recently, by increasing the testing capacity to nearly 3000 tests per day.", "But a higher number for the tests conducted in a region may not necessarily lead to lower risk or decrease in the infection rate (Ro). Rather, the precision with which the tests are hitting the correct population (those that actually have the disease) is more important.", "For example, South Korea\u2019s testing was based on surveillance apps and advanced technology. So even with comparable or fewer tests per capita, South Korea was able to identify the population with the disease more accurately.", "New Zealand and Iceland both continued to increase their testing capacity by several folds every day, which contributed to containing the spread of the novel coronavirus in these regions.", "Tests per thousand while an important metric in containing the spread of the virus in a given region, still is not enough to understand the complete picture.", "As per the latest data from the Govt. of J&K, a total of 53726 samples have been collected, out of which 52792 are negative and 934 are positive in J&K.", "In other words, nearly one in 57 people who were tested for the novel coronavirus till May 12, 2020, in J&K was found to have it.", "As the testing in J&K has ramped up, the true positivity rate (TPR) has consistently been falling down. 1.74% true positivity rate on May 12, 2020, is fairly low and suggests either:", "- Low level of COVID-19 outbreak", "- The wrong people are being tested", "- The test is not of good quality (or the sampling technique)", "However, the true positivity rate is not the same as the proportion of the COVID-19 positive cases in any area. The actual no of cases is tracked by a metric called prevalence.", "CDC defines prevalence (sometimes referred to as prevalence rate) as the proportion of persons in a population who have a particular disease or attribute at a specified point in time or over a specified period of time.", "Due to various factors such as limited testing, asymptomatic cases, lack of awareness or even resistance to exposing oneself for medical help due to social stigma could contribute to undocumented and undetected cases. These missed and undocumented cases contribute to the difference between prevalence and true positives.", "The fraction of undocumented but infectious cases is a critical epidemiological characteristic that modulates the pandemic potential of an emergent respiratory virus[2\u20135]. These undocumented infections depending on their contagiousness and numbers can expose a far greater portion of the population to the virus than would otherwise occur.", "Like other infectious diseases, the true prevalence of COVID-19 remains unknown. Public health scientists at Columbia University studied the travel data and the latest information on the incubation period and infection rate of the novel coronavirus in Wuhan\u2076. They developed a mathematical model to simulate the outbreak during its early days in the city and estimated that 86% of all infections were undocumented prior to 23 January 2020 travel restrictions, and these undocumented infections were the infection source for 79% of documented cases. These key findings could shift in other countries with different control, surveillance, and reporting practices. However, they lay strong evidence for increased mass testing and accurate reporting to be able to determine the actual number of COVID-19 positive cases.", "Known challenges such as lack of infrastructure, lack of preparedness for the disease, economic factors, or political concerns could lead to a lag in upscaling widespread testing. Previously for other infectious diseases such as Hepatitis C mathematical models were also studied to approximately estimate the full prevalence of the disease\u2077. Similar scientific advances are under research for COVID-19 as well.", "While the reported cases in J&K are 934 as of May 12, 2020, like every other place, the true prevalence for the same time frame remains unknown. Ideally, if there were a way to estimate the prevalence of the disease, the testing capacity could be upscaled to that level (in other words if the trend for the virus spread is exponential, then ideally testing should also be increased exponentially to detect all infected cases). This increased testing then if deployed on the correct targeted population by use of contact tracing and other means could lead to the detection of maximum prevalent cases. This is perhaps how South Korea was able to contain the virus.", "Since testing isn\u2019t able to keep up with the spread of the virus, many positive cases remain undetected and continue to be active carriers. More people get infected from these undetected active cases and as a result, the prevalent population in itself keeps increasing.", "As of May 12, 2020, J&K has conducted 4.77 tests per thousand of the population with a true positivity rate of 1.74%. If the population tested is a good representation of the prevalence, and if these assumptions and trends continue to be true for future testing, then the region will be able to contain the spread of the virus quickly. But if the population tested is missing active carriers, then the daily new cases will keep rising.", "To summarize, a high number for the metrics like total detected cases, total detected cases per million, total tests, total tests per million or test positivity rate at a given time may not necessarily indicate a region being at a high/low risk or indicate a good/bad response to the virus. Rather the testing pool at a given time targeting the prevalence corresponding to the same time, in a given region is a better indicator of a good response to the virus.", "The outbreak of COVID-19 is a threat to the general population and healthcare workers worldwide. However, knowledge about this novel virus remains limited but there are great advances in science currently happening worldwide.", "As of May 12, 2020, J&K has 82.90 COVID-19 positive cases per million of the population, while Kashmir valley has 122.52 COVID-19 positive cases per million of the population.", "Testing capacity is increasing every day and the true positivity rate is decreasing consistently. But the total number of new positive cases reported has not seen a downward trend yet, which is important in order to flatten the curve.", "For the population reported and tested as of May 12, 2020, it looks like Kashmir has done a decent job of containing the spread of the novel coronavirus. But each day is a new battle and the curve can surge any time. So increased testing, upcoming efforts for continued social distancing, and lockdown will determine the situation in the coming weeks for shifting the paradigm to a sustainable flattening of the curve, with a reasonable decline in the number of new/active cases.", "I would like to provide my deepest gratitude to Dr. Francisco Averhoff, Associate Director for Global Health \u2014 Division of Viral Hepatitis, CDC, for reviewing and providing expertise and insights that greatly improved the manuscript.", "I would like to thank Dr. Saleem Kamili, Chief, Laboratory Branch Division of Viral Hepatitis, CDC, and the Kashmiri American Society for Healthcare Medical Education & Research (KASHMER) for supporting this project and helping in establishing connections with experts from CDC.", "I also thank Dr. Parvaiz Koul, Professor & Head, Department of Internal & Pulmonary Medicine, Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS), Soura, Srinagar, for providing expertise about COVID-19 outbreak in Kashmir.", "Thank you, the Johns Hopkins University of Medicine for making available the Covid-19 data.
