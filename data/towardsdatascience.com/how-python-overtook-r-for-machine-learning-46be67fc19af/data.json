Among the most popular of the languages used for statistics at the time\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Roughly a decade ago, the idea of Pythonic machine-learning was only a glint and glimmer in the eye of many Data Scientists. Among the most popular of the languages used for statistics at the time was R, which was showing promise on the front of machine-learning as well. However, as you are most likely aware, this is no longer the case, and Python has taken the crown as not only the most popular language for machine learning, but also the most popular language in general.", "While Python and R are both approachable, high-level languages, they certainly have their differences. Some of these differences might have attributed to the uprising of Python as the Data Science language of the future.", "One factor that definitely contributed to the transition from R to Python for Data Science is probably the usability of both languages. R is a primarily functional language that was created almost exclusively for scientific computing. And while to some extent it is capable in many aspects, R is certainly not considered to be a general-purpose programming language.", "Python, on the other hand, is primarily an object-oriented programming language. This attributes to the conviviality of Python over R because in a lot of ways programmers might find using objects with easy functions a lot easier than methodized functionality with polymorphism. On top of that, Python wasn\u2019t originally created with statistical computing in mind and as a result, is much more suited for general-purpose programming.", "While these differences might mean little to those who only do statistical computing, it likely means a lot to those who wish to approach machine-learning from a more technical and less scientific standpoint. In other words, Python is certainly a language that is more geared towards every programmer than just statisticians.", "The differences in usability don\u2019t stop with uses and paradigms, either. Let\u2019s face it,", "Pip is superior to R\u2019s \u2018package manager\u2019", "In R\u2019s defense, package managers certainly weren\u2019t a flavor of its time. Despite this, even if R were to come out with a fantastic package manager right now it would likely not be able to compete with the convenience of Pip. Pip makes managing all of your Python libraries incredibly easy, which in turn makes learning how to use packages in Python a lot simpler. There have been attempts at creating a better package manager for R, like PackRat \u2014 which is a tool that you should probably pick up if you enjoy programming in R.", "In a way, Packrat is like the QuickLisp of R package managers. Certainly in this aspect, R falls victim to the time in which it was released.", "It\u2019s incredibly difficult to talk about machine-learning without discussing performance. There is a reason that deep-learning computers are typically decked out with multiple graphics cards and server processors, after-all. Python might not have the greatest performance in the world, but certainly takes a step up from R. Here are some micro-benchmarks done by Julia computing that shows just how big the disparity between these languages can be in a lot of operations:", "Although there certainly are situations where R outpaces Python, for the most part, Python is certainly the better performer of the two. This, of course, attributes to less viability in terms of machine-learning inside of the R programming language. While R, like Python, can certainly draw benefits from calling on other languages like C, and C++, Python\u2019s close integration and ease-of-access with the Python.h header makes it a clear choice for those wishing to create a high-level interface with C.", "As discussed earlier, Python is certainly a language that is more likely to appeal to the average programmer. That is likely why Python was the language in which packages like Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow were developed to be used by. The Pythonic ecosystem for machine-learning is absolutely stellar, and can\u2019t be beaten!", "On the other side of the pond with R, though there certainly are some standout packages, when they are compared with all of the versatile options that Python has there is simply no question. Part of the reason for this is that many developers that already knew Python and wanted to get into machine-learning of course decided to just use that language rather than switching to R. And with Python\u2019s partnership with C, it is easy to see why the packages were developed for Python instead of R.", "Although R has definitely taken the back-seat to Python at this point, R is still very widely used for statistical analysis, bioinformatics, and even machine-learning. However, it seems that R tends to be more popular among the scientific and medical community whereas Python tends to be used by the more technologically-influenced crowd.", "This is something I find very interesting. Why is it that R is more widely used among Biologists, Medical Doctors, and other disciplines than normal developers, Data Scientists, and computer-scientists dipping their toes into machine-learning? One plausible explanation for this is that R has had a foothold in those industries for such an extended period of time that it has become rather hard to replace. As I talked about before, computer-scientists and people from the programming world as opposed to the general science world would likely prefer to use Python over picking up a statistical language from the 70s. Of course, it wasn\u2019t R but S that was created in the 70s, but S is widely considered to be the predecessor to R\u2014 so keep that in mind.", "I think the statistical computing\u2019s shift from using R and MATLAB to Python is certainly justified. There are a host of advantages to using Python that you simply can\u2019t get anywhere else. Python has superior performance, is more accessible for new developers, and is also the most popular programming language in the world. All of these factors certainly contributed to the rise of Python and its now fantastic foothold in the realm of analytics, statistics, and most of all, machine-learning.", "Although R is certainly less popular than Python, it seems to have found its home with the more scientific, less computer-centric crowd. It is pretty amazing to see how certain languages can be cycled out in a short period of a few years, and a new language\u2019s capabilities can be realized and taken advantage of in such a short period of time as well.", "Your home for data science.
