For many, this view is based on the few introductory accounting classes they took in high school or college. While learning debits and credits isn't fun, the actual career is a little more complicated than that. Like many jobs, a career in accounting requires a combination of repetitive and creative tasks. Accountants follow routine checklists and procedures but also apply judgement to navigate different options, persuade clients to take a course of action, and build relationships stakeholders. In reality, senior-level auditors and accountants, including controllers and CFOs, actually work more like lawyers.", "There is considerable uncertainty about how the accounting industry will be impacted by advancement in AI. Those who have a dystopian view of AI argue that most tasks can be automated, and accountants will become obsolete. In fact, in 2018, Forbes predicted that accounting tasks, including tax, payroll, audits, banking, etc., would be fully automated by 2020. The reality is that even now, years later, we are still nowhere near automation. In fact, there are several reasons why we may never be.", "I argue that, in the short term, AI automation will enable accountants to be more efficient rather than replace them. AI will improve efficiencies of accountants at the employee, firm, and macro levels. In the long run, AI will not replace accountants due to powerful forces such as entrenched professional jurisdictions, cost/benefit tradeoffs of automation, and nature of the work itself. In this article, I will analyze the impact of AI on the accounting industry which will also serve as a framework for many other industries as well.", "How AI will impact accountants at the employee level", "All AI advancement to date has really been classified as Narrow AI \u2014 AI that can only solve specific tasks. In the near term, AI will automate certain repetitive tasks for accountants. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) is already automating several tasks such as exporting data, performing reconciliations, and identifying outliers for investigation, while tools such as Tableau, Power BI, and Beautiful.ai help accountants visualize and communicate information quicker and more clearly. Previously, these tasks cost companies thousands of labor hours to complete while simultaneously being unenjoyable for workers. In this domain, AI tools present a clear win-win for both parties involved.", "Powerful analytics tools will allow accountants to focus their attention to higher risk and complex transactions, ensuring that their efforts are placed where it is most needed. For example, consider an AI tool that can monitor sales transactions for a retailer and identify changes in patterns of customer returns. The system can develop expectations based on historical results and industry data and flag outliers to accountants, causing them to revisit how they account for allowance for customer returns (an important input in calculating revenues in retail companies).", "The above examples illustrate two important takeaways about the short term. First, accountants will have to remain involved in each of these technologies, but AI will make things faster. Second, AI bots are not the magic bullet to solve all issues. Instead, these technologies only solve specific aspect of the job because significant time and expense are required to perfect the application of AI for each of these use cases.", "When we consider the long-term impacts of AI, I believe a similar trend will continue. Accountants will have an arsenal of AI tools to free themselves from many repetitive tasks, shifting their attention to complex tasks such as building the AI models themselves (software engineers cannot build these on their own), client relationship building, and analyzing new types transactions.", "The skills required to become a successful accountant will drastically change. Accountants will need to develop omniscience: an understanding of many different competencies including data science, computers and networking, a deeper understanding of their clients, and most of all, a stronger foundation of ethics and transparency \u2014 all things a computer may never replicate. With increased automation, accountants will have to make tough decisions on how to train models, how to apply analytics, and how to protect the interests of stakeholders.", "How AI will impact accounting organizations", "Implementation of AI technologies will impact organizations in several ways in the short run. First, it will greatly improve the efficiency of hiring accounting talent. Large accounting firms will use AI screening tools by LinkedIn and Ziprecruiter to screen resumes and evaluate candidates through video interviews.", "Second, AI tools will also be valuable in scaling teams to meet client demands through tools like flash teams, which is particularly valuable in the accounting industry where the work is seasonal, extremely busy during the winter year-end period and lighter during the summer period.", "Third, firms will execute extensive corporate training programs to upskill workers with leading-edge technologies and AI-based risk assessment tools. Firms will continue to explore new avenues to improve the effectiveness of training programs through partnerships with MOOCs and other third-party upskilling programs. As an unfortunate result of this, workers who do not keep up may be let go if they cannot retrain appropriately.", "Each of the cases above illustrates meaningful changes to accounting organizations around the world. It is important to note however, these tools still require humans to remain in the loop and are still enabling technologies rather than replacing technologies in the short term.", "In the long run AI will radically change how accounting firms scale and grow teams. Flash teams may become even more of an integral part of the firm, blurring the boundaries of firms and third parties such as SMEs. For example, if working with a mining company, accountants may need detailed evaluations of prospective sites along with the associated projections in order to properly value the assets on the books. These reports are sometimes provided by third-party firms with deeper expertise in particular topics. Flash teams can help streamline this process and reduce the cost of hiring individuals as well.", "Additionally, in the long term, organizations will resemble adhocracies rather than bureaucracies. Accounting firms are currently structured with well-defined layers of employees and follow a strict bureaucratic protocol. Once workers are free from repetitive tasks, they will be expected to take on greater ownership of client relationships and opine on strategic issues for clients and firms at an earlier point in their career. Therefore, it is inevitable that accounting firms will have to steer away from the strict bureaucracies that currently exist and adopt an adhocracy approach. This will likely mean that the number of layers of advancement will be greatly reduced and the pathway to partnership at these firms may be quicker.", "How AI will impact the accounting industry at a macro level", "At the macro level, AI is limited by several powerful forces that will prevent it from replacing workers. First, AI automation will be bounded due to the extensive power of accounting professional jurisdictions. In North America, the CPA association and its members have powerful lobbying bodies with close ties to regulatory agencies such as the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) and Securities Exchange Commission (SEC). In fact, many have observed the revolving door of regulators moving to accounting firms and vice versa, potentially reducing the independence between firms and regulators (a separate topic altogether). With respect to AI adoption, it is safe to say that even if AI could replace accountants, such developments will be met with tough regulatory scrutiny and backlash due to the power of these professional jurisdictions.", "Second, there is an absence of data about how accountants divide their time between repetitive tasks and creative tasks. From my personal experience, much of my job required obtaining client data, cleaning and processing it, and supporting transactions using evidence and analytics. While some aspects could be automated, most required me to exercise professional judgement and knowledge of my client\u2019s business. These insights could not be gained through rote data analysis and required interfacing with several stakeholders to understand processes and biases in the flow of transactions throughout the organization.", "Third, with a starting salary of $45,000-$60,000 for entry-level roles, it could be the case that accounting labor is too cheap to automate for firms. Further, starting salaries for entry-level accounting roles in the Big 4 firms have experienced little growth over the past 10 years. As AI enables more and more of the tasks of accountants, I suspect that wages will remain flat or experience downward pressure in the future.", "I believe these trends will continue to persist in the long term. It is unlikely that AI will achieve the ability to fully replace accountants, and instead will remain narrow and enable them to work more effectively.", "In the short term, it is clear that AI has been and will continue to be an enabling technology rather than a replacing technology. Narrow AI will improve worker efficiency and free up time for creative tasks and client relationship building. At the organization level, firms will undertake massive upskilling programs and fundamentally change the way they hire talent.", "In the long run, employees will have to significantly shift their mix of skills before entering the workforce. Omniscience and ethics will be a stronger requirement for jobs in this industry. Organizations will radically shift their hierarchies and resemble adhocracies where workers are empowered to take on greater stakes in strategic decisions. At the macro level, AI will fail to replace accountants due to powerful professional jurisdictions and important cost-benefit tradeoffs between developing AI and hiring people. Each of these presents important bounds to the limits of automation.", "I write about strategy and marketing | Kellogg MBA | University of Waterloo | Opinions are my own"], "all_outgoing_urls":
