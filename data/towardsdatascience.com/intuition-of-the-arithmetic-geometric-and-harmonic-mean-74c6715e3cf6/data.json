Formulas teach you how to calculate, but not how to understand. Forget the formulas - and get better at math."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rate_(mathematics)", "anchor_text": "rates", "paragraph_index": 20}], "all_paragraphs": ["When people teach you about statistical concepts, you usually get a equation which is a formula for some quantity, like the arithmetic mean. Formulas are fine, but they are designed with calculation in mind. Usually, the equation will put the unknown on one side, and all known quantities on the other.", "Unfortunately, this view does not help students develop a good understanding of concepts like the \u201caverage\u201d. And as a result, it is not difficult to find people misapplying statistics, for example, using the arithmetic mean on financial returns data when the geometric mean makes more sense.", "By rearranging the equation, you can get an alternative perspective which makes the concept of \u201caverage\u201d clearer and more generalisable for different types of data.", "For example, if we have quantities which we add to produce a total outcome (eg. getting $3 today, and $5 tomorrow gives 3+5 = $8), then we can use an arithmetic mean to tell us the quantity that, when added together repeatedly, gives us the same total outcome.", "And if we have quantities to multiply to produce the final figure (eg. monthly returns on a stock portfolio), then it should become clear that the geometric mean is more appropriate.", "For example, if you have $1, and one day it doubles to $2, and the next day, it grows by a multiple of 8 to $16, it would be the same if it grew at the geometric mean for 2 days. The geometric mean g satisfies g*g=2*8=16, so g=4.", "It is important to know that the appropriate \u201caverage\u201d only make sense in context. If you were asked to \u201cfind the average\u201d of 2 and 8, it should not make sense to you. The average of 2 and 8 might be 5 if its the average number of dollars received on two days, since 2+8 = 5+5. But it could also be 4 if it\u2019s day-on-day growth rate, since 2 * 8 = 4 * 4. We don\u2019t know which one is correct if we don\u2019t know where these numbers are coming from.", "What is the harmonic mean, and when is it used?", "Two people are driving across the country. Since long-distance driving can be tiring, the two agree to take turns driving.", "The two tables below indicate two possible trips, with different ways of splitting distances and times. The question: what is the average speed of travel?", "(1) The two drivers drive an equal distance, but for different periods of time.", "To figure out the average speed, we see that the speed of driver one and two are 100 and 66.666 km/h. We take the average of this figure and get 83.333 km/h. Right?", "But maybe you\u2019ve read something about how to average rates. You know that the arithmetic mean is incorrect, and that the harmonic mean needs to be used. (You can read the Wikipedia page on the harmonic mean to confirm this). You recall the formula for the harmonic mean\u2026", "(2) The two drivers drive different distances, for an equal amount of time.", "After seeing the last example, you know not to use the arithmetic mean, because the \u201charmonic mean is correct for calculating average rates.\u201d", "But you will soon find out that this is actually incorrect. This is why you should not blindly follow formulas.", "To figure out the average speed, I take the same approach as I took for the arithmetic and geometric mean. I construct a parallel world, where everyone is identical and acts identically, and I want the action in this parallel world to produce the same outcome that I have in my data. If we construct two imaginary drivers who both drive at the average speed, at what speed would they have to drive so that they would travel the same distance in the same period of time?", "(1) They need to cover 1000 km in 12.5 hours, so this is 1000/12.5= 80 km/h. Note that this is the harmonic mean that we calculated earlier, and also note that the two drivers cover the same distance.", "(2) They need to cover 1020 km in 12 hours, so 1020/12 = 85 km/h. Note that this is NOT the harmonic mean that was calculated earlier. This is the arithmetic mean of 80 and 90, and note that the two drivers drive for the same duration of time.", "Average speed = arithmetic mean (?)", "It is commonly said that the harmonic mean is appropriate for finding the average of rates. Even Wikipedia states that \u201cit is appropriate for situations when the average of rates is desired.\u201d But the example I give above has rates in both scenarios, and the harmonic mean is not appropriate for the second example.", "I claim that the harmonic mean is equivalent to a weighted arithmetic mean, and the key issue to averaging rates is how the different rates are weighted.", "Basing the following derivations on the road trip example, consider the following equations.", "The first line is just the intuitive view of average speed.", "In the second line, the numerator is the sum of distances for each driver. You can confirm this with dimensional analysis (L = length, T = time): speed has dimension L/T and time has dimension T, so the multiplication of speed and time is giving a quantity with dimension L. So far so good?", "If we now separate out the terms, we can get the third line. The time fractions are dimensionless (T/T) and are giving the proportion of time spent at the speed of the i\u1d57\u02b0 driver. It is a weighted arithmetic mean of speeds, weighted by time! And if the time spent at each speed is equal, then it is the arithmetic mean of speeds. Note that example (2) had equal times for both drivers, and this is why the arithmetic mean was correct.", "We now do a second derivation, but we first take the reciprocal of all speeds, so that the units are inverted (hours per kilometre).", "The first line is from the intuitive view of average speed.", "Second line, we split the numerator, but this time we need to make sure that the unit is time. The reciprocal of speed has units of hours per km, and multiplying this by distance gives us a unit of hours.", "We split up the fraction to get the third line. This time, it is a weighted average of reciprocal speeds, weighted by the proportion of the total distance traveled at that reciprocal speed.", "If we now let all n distances be the same length\u2026", "\u2026then the reciprocal average speed becomes the arithmetic mean of the reciprocal speeds. Taking the reciprocal again to restore the units to L/T, we get the harmonic mean.", "Back to the original question: What is the harmonic mean, and when is it used?", "The harmonic mean is the arithmetic mean of rate data with inverted units. When is it used? See below.", "I hope my thoughts have helped you think more critically about maths and data.", "Your home for data science.
