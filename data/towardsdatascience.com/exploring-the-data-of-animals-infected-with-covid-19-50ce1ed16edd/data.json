Despite the massive amount of attention, a topic that has remained mostly untouched (some exceptions being the reports of farm and domestic animals getting infected) by the mainstream media is how animals are hit by the disease too. To cite the information provided by the government of Canada\u00b9 \u201cThere is currently limited information on animals and COVID-19, especially on whether an animal can spread the virus if they become infected. \u201c", "There have been admirable efforts by the scientific community to understand how the virus develops, both in animal and human hosts and the research about it grows by the day. Open data regarding animal infections is, however, not so easy to find.", "To that effect, the World Organisation for Animal Health frequently publishes a report of new cases in animals around the world at this page\u00b2. However, compiling information from this source is hard work, and not everyone is willing/has the time to extract the data from each statement and make a dataset out of them. One of the few sources of data open to the public is the one in the United States Department of Agriculture website\u00b3. The table lists cases of SAR-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19 in humans) in animals that have been confirmed by the United States Department of Agriculture\u2019s National Veterinary Services Laboratories. Though in each case, only the first animal of a species reported in a facility or home makes it to the table, and it is, therefore, a rough estimate of how many animals have the virus in the US.", "Despite its small size (around 30 data points) For each case, the table notes the type of animal infected, where and when it got infected, the method used to detect the virus and whether or not it was in contact with a human infected. The table is not available to download, but it is easy enough to either copy or scrape if you want it. To make things more interesting, I decided to scrap it instead of copying it into an Excel file using the following code:", "While this is, admittedly a pretty long snip of code for its intended purpose, it does its job and results in a table that you can work with using Python if that\u2019s your choice. Its usability, of course, depends on the table staying just as it is while they add cases (which I doubt will happen as the table should be able to grow in size and complexity with more data coming in). If you\u2019d like to look more closely at the preparation process, you are welcome to visit my Github page and the NBViewer which hosts the whole process.", "Most animals in the data until now (over 90%) had exposure to a confirmed or probable infected human. However, according to the information published in the CDC\u2019s official website\u2074:", "\u201cThe virus that causes COVID-19 spreads mainly from person to person through respiratory droplets from coughing, sneezing, and talking. Recent studies show that people who are infected but do not have symptoms likely also play a role in the spread of COVID-19. At this time, there is no evidence that animals play a significant role in spreading the virus that causes COVID-19. Based on the limited information available to date, the risk of animals spreading COVID-19 to people is considered low\u201d.", "Furthermore, the CDC continues in the same report by adding:", "\u201cWe are still learning about this virus, but it appears that it can spread from people to animals in some situations, especially after close contact with a person sick with COVID-19\u201d.", "Therefore, it is highly likely that the cases in the data had this origin, though it is not the only possible explanation, and it could have other roots too.", "Moving on from the possible origin to the animals that contracted the disease, the species of animals infected are of a relatively small variety, as shown in the graph below:", "Bar a couple of exceptions (notably the tigers and the lions which contracted the disease at the Bronx Zoo\u2075 and a couple of minks), the overwhelming majority of cases recorded belong to cats and dogs. Likewise, the distribution of cases through the United States is limited to a small number of states, with only twelve states out of the fifty have reported cases so far.", "New York with nine cases and Utah with eight are the states with the most cases reported so far, followed by Texas with three. The other nine states only have one contagion each.", "Until now, July is the month with most infections reported, with the current month as a relatively close second despite it not being finished yet, which makes it likely that the trend upward will keep on its course. Lastly, it is worth noting the methods used for diagnosis of the disease so far, as plotted below:", "Most of the conditions were recognised using the PCR-test, which, on the authority of the FDA\u2076, serves to test if there is an active coronavirus infection. The other test administered most regularly detects antibodies (Ab) produced by the immune system to stop the sickness.", "While there is little data to say anything decisive just yet, there are a couple of starting trends that are worth looking at:", "Most of this information depends on what the near future might hold, and the listed trends can either be reversed or proved correct.", "[3]: United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Animals in the United States, (2020)", "[5]: N. Daly, Seven more big cats test positive for coronavirus at Bronx Zoo, National Geographic, (2020)", "Your home for data science.
