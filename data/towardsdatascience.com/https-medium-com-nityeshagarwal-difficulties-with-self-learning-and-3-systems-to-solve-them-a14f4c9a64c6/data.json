Lectures from the world\u2019s best professors brought straight to your hands, no matter what corner of the earth you live in \u2014Isn\u2019t that the recipe for disrupting world-class education and democratizing it to the entire world?", "A 2019 study using data on MOOCs provided by edX (a popular MOOC platform by MIT and Harvard) suggests \u2014 No, it might not be:", "The study can be summarised to say that MOOCs aren\u2019t as disruptive as the world expected when it first got introduced to the idea in 2012.", "MOOCs help the self-learners who need help with finding the resources to learn some subject. Maybe we can democratize education even further, if we take a broader look and address the needs of those self-learners who need help with finding the motivation to learn those subjects.", "I believe that along with teaching themselves the concepts of the subject, self-learners also struggle with things that we take for granted in traditional means of education \u2014 A sense of direction (guided by competition), a learning environment and a peer group.", "Since, these are the very things that drive people to be self-motivated, a lack of them is a very real problem for the self-learners. This problem is especially acute for the ones who come from non-traditional backgrounds and the ones in unfavourable surroundings (like developing countries). They are fighting an uphill battle.", "I aim to bring some structure to it with this article. What follows is my advice on how you can hack your self-learning if online courses don\u2019t seem helpful enough for your situation.", "After 2 years of being a self-learner who taught himself everything he wanted and another year of being lost, unmotivated and kind of depressed, I have come to realize that \u2014", "With all of this in mind, I have been able to come up with 3 systems that will help you learn X when your physical environment won\u2019t \u2014", "Remember they are long-term systems and not one-off tips and tricks. They are regular practices to increase your odds of learning X in the long run.", "Below I describe each of these systems in details, tell you why I think each of them is important and give you some personal suggestions/tips for getting started with each.", "If you love something, you will care about it. And when that happens, learning no longer remains a \u201ctask\u201d; it becomes an adventure. You will be hungry for knowing more about it and you will have the energy to hunt for answers to your doubts.", "But there\u2019s a catch: When you first want to know How to learn X, it isn\u2019t because you love X or even find it exciting. You are probably more excited about the idea of loving X.. maybe, because you have seen a peer go completely nuts talking about X or because you\u2019ve heard/read it enough times that X is a \u201chot\u201d skill to put in your resume.", "Although, these reasons are a good starting point they aren\u2019t enough. If you dive into doing X for these reasons, you\u2019ll just be following the herd. If someone were to ask you \u201cWhy do you care so much about X?\u201d, you will probably not have an answer that can make you proud.", "So, before you go looking for the best courses that teach X, make serious, conscious efforts to find reasons to become obsessed with X.", "Whenever you force yourself into learning something just for the sake of it, you create a very unsatisfying learning experience.", "Working hard for something you are really excited about is passion but working hard for something that you don\u2019t really care about is stress.", "Doing so is likely to drive you into one of the following 3 situations \u2014", "This brings us to the next system.", "We all admire self-motivated people. It\u2019s like a superpower that makes them unstoppable.", "But nobody is born with a self-motivating ability, right? So what gives them that \u201cdrive\u201d? And more importantly, how can we cultivate that in ourselves?", "I believe that what you need to self-motivate yourself is an environment that is filled with people and ideas that inspire you to do more. When you\u2019re around people who value a thing, you\u2019re more likely to value it yourself.", "And you can have a motivating environment too, regardless of your physical whereabouts \u2014 if you leverage the power of the Internet.", "You know how your newsfeed is so great at helping you discover all those pleasing and mouth-watering and unimaginable and insane food videos because it knows that you are a foodie.", "Now imagine, what it would recommend if it knew that you are interested in Machine Learning or blockchain technology or open-source software.", "You can turn, what is perhaps the most negative aspect of social media \u2014 an addictive and infinitely scrollable feed \u2014 and use it to your advantage!", "Remember the saying \u2014 \u201cYou are the average of 5 people you spend the most time with\u201d?", "So, you could skip this step if you are surrounded by a group of people who talk about and regularly share cool things about X with you. But even then, you\u2019ll feel better if you have access to your own sources of new, cool stuff that you can share with them.", "But most of us, self-learners, aren\u2019t surrounded by such people. We are the people who come from non-traditional backgrounds or a not-so-great college or from a developing country where we don\u2019t have access to peers with similar aspirations. This might be the easiest way for us to solve our \u2018personal environment problem\u2019.", "I heavily use Twitter. I would suggest that you join it too. To persuade you further, I would recommend reading this article by Alexey Guzey \u2014 Why (and How) You Should Join Twitter Right Now.", "It\u2019s simple to let its recommender system know that you are into X:", "Do this and see how Twitter\u2019s newsfeed lets you discover all those unimaginable things and helps you with self-motivation.", "\u201cBut if I\u2019m just getting started with Twitter, how will I know whom to follow and whom not to?\u201d", "Yes, that\u2019s a real problem for newcomers to the platform. Therefore, I have created several lists of Twitter accounts if you need help getting into the programming ecosystem. Here are lists of people who love", "You can check out more such lists here.", "A lot of the time self-learning can be really draining despite having all the right reasons for learning. That\u2019s when you might get stuck on some of smaller X\u2019s that comprise our bigger X.", "You need to incentivize yourself so that you can constantly push through this slump.", "A simple way to incentivize yourself is to work on a project on the side while you are going through the tutorials/courses. Building something that seems cool and interesting is a great way to trick yourself into learning X with dedication.", "I know that this is scary. I know there are a few serious insecurities that you might have, especially if you are doing this for the first time:", "Insecurity #1: \u201cI would love to build something by myself but I don\u2019t have ideas for any new interesting projects.\u201d", "Yes, this is perhaps the narrowest bottleneck that prevents most people from doing a project. Even more than the actual difficulty of building the thing.", "I think that browsing through other people\u2019s hackathon projects on devpost.com is a great way to come across such ideas because \u2014", "How cool would it be if you created: \u2014", "Remember your goal is self-improvement. That\u2019s why, I believe, you can simply imitate and reimplement other people\u2019s ideas with a clear conscience. (Although it would be awesome if you could find a way to give the reimplementation your personal touch!)", "Insecurity #2: \u201cBut I don\u2019t have any experience. How will I ever know what to learn, how to build and just, how to go through it all?\u201d", "I believe that you don\u2019t need any of that mysterious \u201creal-world experience\u201d to build something useful. The Internet is quite filled with stories of people who just built what they wanted, picked up the skills that they needed along the way and in the process taught themselves programming.", "I have written more about it here: How (and why) to start building useful, real-world software with no experience.", "\u201cEvery great developer you know got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did it.\u201d", "But even then, I realize that this is easier said than done.", "And that is why I want to help you.", "I have created Build To Learn to help you with your self-learning needs. Here, I am going to create a series of tutorials centered around doing projects and teaching you the necessary programming skills along the way.", "I will pay attention to the need (and the lack) of motivation in learning and keep the above 3 systems in mind and try to help you with them \u2014", "You can sign up for this newsletter so I can send you a more extensive list of project ideas and let you know about the updates with Build To Learn.", "I have also started a Slack group to build a community of people who want to Build To Learn.
