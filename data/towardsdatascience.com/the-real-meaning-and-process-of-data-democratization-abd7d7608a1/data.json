More and more nations, for example, South Africa\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The scene: a small village in rural India. The whole of the village has gathered to listen as public records are being read out. A villager is listed in the public record as having rented out his plough to the government-sponsored irrigation project. \u201cNo,\u201d he says, \u201cI did not do that. I was away in Delhi at my cousin\u2019s wedding at that time.\u201d There is laughter, as well as outrage, as people immediately discover how they have been tricked and how public money has been siphoned away from them and their village. More false information is revealed: Examples such as items for bills for transport of materials for 6km when, in fact, the real distance is just 1km. A worker, employed according to government records on the construction of a new canal, stands up and asks: \u201cWhat canal?\u201d Workers involved in the building of houses confirm that fifty bags of cement, not one hundred, were supplied and used. At the end of the public hearing the chant goes up: \u201cWhat do we want? Information. What do we want? Information: a story told by Dr. Richard Calland", "Over the last fifty years, many states and their governments have formally acknowledged a right of access to information responding to these claims. More and more nations, for example, South Africa, have entrenched a right of access in their constitutions. Formal recognition of access rights is a no-brainer if institutions strive to maintain popular legitimacy. The road to more democracy is the road of data democratization. A very rigid correlation exists between access to information and the existence of democracy. Simply said: to make the right decision and to tick the right box on the voting ballot, the citizen must be informed. Access to information is essential for persons to realize their basic right to participate in the governing of their country and live under a system built on informed consent of the citizenry. In any state, and particularly in states where the policy analysis capabilities of civil society are poorly developed, political participation rights cannot be exercised effectively without access to government information. Sounds obvious? Great: let\u2019s move on since apart from talking about that \u201cambitious ambition\u201d of mine, I would like to cover a little bit of theory on data democratization in general, answering two main questions: why now? and how? in the opposite order.", "Well the solution I found, is building a search engine. It is obviously not the only way to do it \u2014 far from it. But it is one that is flexible and at the same time powerful thanks to the emergence of data science.", "I see three main steps in this process I chose, that I\u2019ll cover one by one:", "Most of the data that could be democratized is available somewhere. But the problem is that \u201csomewhere\u201d is more or less the same as \u201cnowhere\u201d when it comes to data usefulness. If only political campaign managers see the data you cannot call this democratization. The problem lies in the wrong KPIs (key performance indicators) of the people that publish data. Most of them focus on how to push as much data as possible to the internet instead o focusing on how many people will see this data.", "If we finally agree on changing this focus, how will we reach the performance? This needs a good search engine with good search engine optimization. A good search engine is an intelligent one. In opposition to a simple search engine which only looks for keyword matches, intelligent search engines interpret the query by identifying or deducing the nature of the result wanted by the user, identify important parameters such as time and location mentioned in the query and finally take into account the context of the search. Once it is usable it also needs to be used. Reaching users can be done in numerous ways. Statistics show that data is mostly searched through search engines like Google. Thus, decent SEO is a crucial step towards the goal to facilitate data search.", "Once the search engine is working and accessible, the next step is to display the results. This part seems simple, and at its core it is simple. But try to design and build something that looks & feels user-friendly but is complex enough to understand the whole picture and you\u2019ll see that the task isn\u2019t easier done than said. In fact, most of the wannabe solutions for data democratization are far from matching these criteria. Here are the main problems that solutions face in displaying data in the best possible manner:", "An article with a more in-depth overlook of data representation experience is coming soon\u2026", "The third step is the one that gets ignored all the time in two ways.", "Either a solution rushes in, adds all the possible data, and can\u2019t handle it, or in the opposite case \u2014 adds too little data and the users don\u2019t get enough value from the product to use it.", "The first option is the most common one. We see Statista.com that have lots and lots of data pilled up, mismanaged, and thus with poor search functionality and UX. They have data ranging from GDPs per capita, to Fortnite frag counts by esports professionals. And as it is common with almost everything (with a few exceptions): choosing quantity hurts quality.", "Data democratization needs to find it\u2019s speed equilibrium: the intersection between the quality of search & data curve and the quantity necessary to have users.", "This sounds like an absurd question knowing that in the introduction I advocated for data democratization. And, let me assure you, I did not change my mind. I just believe that right now is the best time to accelerate the process of making information spread faster and reaching more eyes.", "First of all, we have an immense amount of data coming out every day, progressively readier to be used. Governments are collecting more data than ever, opening it up to the public, and the quality of this data is increasing, although the speed and extent of this positive trend depends fiercely by country and region. Old-fashioned, corrupt mayors and government officials may create a short-term blockade, but on the long term and on a large scale this does not cause problems.", "Data interpretation is also on the rise thanks to the progress in data science. I will publish an article (in collaboration with a few great data science and open data experts) on how AI can be used to get interesting insights from data.", "Second, we have the resources to make people\u2019s eyes follow this data. The progress in user experience (in its vast definition) makes me believe that it is possible for \u201cboring\u201d, but important for decision-making data to reach large audiences. In the last 10 years, the collaboration of designers and engineers has resulted in the creation of new types and new designs of interfaces that are more convenient, better looking and in general \u2014 they deliver better user experiences. Although attention spans decrease, we learn how to get this attention more frequently. Almost no one spends 2 straight hours on Instagram, yet if you sum up the daily time spent on it \u2014 you might discover a different story. Tell me if I\u2019m naive, but I think that Instagram isn\u2019t privileged by its wonderful user experience and other products, like ones representing statistical information, can deliver equal competitors for attention.", "Last, but probably most importantly, now is the time to do it. Not tomorrow. We have upcoming elections, we have numerous crises and enormous amounts of decisions to be taken. If we follow our gut and not our data, we are going to lose in most of these situations.", "Here\u2019s a question for you. If two candidates are running for reelection. Would the more rational decision be based on new campaign promises or the track record of their participation in sessions during the last mandate and their voting history?", "I would choose the second option. And I believe that if more people chose this second option, the society would be better represented.", "I think that\u2019s a cause worth attention. I even think that\u2019s a cause worth action.", "In a public diary that I recently started writing, I announced the kickoff of a brand new project I needed a team for. At the moment of writing this, I already have a substantial part of the team formed and I\u2019m in the process of clearing the dust of-of my idea in my own and in other\u2019s minds.
