See our Reader Terms for details.", "The recent cyclical changes in the Brazilian economy caused a massive entry of individuals into the stock market. Due to the country\u2019s historical high interest rates, these investors used to invest their money in government bonds or in savings accounts, but, once the inflation seems to be under control since 2016, the returns of lower risk investments began to be compromised as the central bank lowered the basic interest rate (known as SELIC).", "As we can see in the graph below, the return on an LTN bond, which used to have a return above 10% per year, currently yields no more than 6% in nominal terms.", "As Brazilian investors started looking for new alternatives to invest their money, the Ibovespa (the main index in the Brazilian market) started to rise inexorably, until the recent outbreak of Coronavirus. As we can see in the chart below, the Brazilian stock market recovered significantly fast, following the trend in other world markets, after the coronavirus outbreak.", "Although it is not yet clear whether prices will return to the level of December 2019, many fund managers have already raised the possibility that the assets may be already overpriced, because of the movement that involves the reallocation of resources of the Brazilian investors. Anyway, one of these managers recently raised the possibility that the fintwit community in Brazil could potentially trigger what Charles Kindleberger called \u201ceuphoria\u201d\u00b9 \u2014 paving the way for a stock market bubble. Could that really happen?", "The goal of this text is to assess this possibility, firstly providing an overview of the size of that community. Finally, applying a sentiment analysis algorithm, to understand whether opinions in those tweets tend to maintain a balanced trend in general. IMPORTANT: We do not intend to analyze whether these opinions eventually drive the markets, or are influenced by them. But merely to understand whether these opinions are overly positive, in this way, creating an atmosphere of euphoria. In this way, I will use not only tweets but also the retweets, since this gives us a clearer sense of how many people may view that information.", "Our first step is, of course, to collect tweets. I\u2019m not going to go into that too much, since there are countless texts here talking about the different procedures and techniques. For this analysis, I will use R, and the twitteR package. The package has a limitation: we cannot collect tweets older than seven days. Despite this limitation, let\u2019s see what this short time horizon can tell us. The terms I searched for was:", "Thus, our time horizon and the searched terms can be seen below:", "With our df in hand, we can see how many tweets are generated daily with the search terms. First, I will not consider RTs, and as we can see bellow, the chart shows us that each day one can find at least ~1,400 tweets about those terms on Twitter, which I would say is significant, because, despite its recent expansion, the Brazilian stock market is highly concentrated. Thus, the number of users capable of generating content or solely issuing an opinion on Twitter is quite small.", "All of those 22,000 tweets were created by around 5,000 users, which means that during that period each user tweeted about those subjects 4 times. But we\u2019re missing something: how many users actually take part of that community. While it\u2019s impossible to say how many others users saw those tweets, we can assess the engagement with them. We can easily see that bellow. The average for the \u2018favoriteCount\u2019 variable is 14,547 and for the retweetCount is 1,437. That\u2019s why we could argue that engagement is not really significant: each one of the 1,400 daily tweets, gets, in average, no more than 10 Favs and 1 Rt.", "In our sample, this engagement was generated by 11,700 unique users, which represent only 0,44% of the current total number of investors. That\u2019s not really representative, but could we at least argue that there really is a feeling of euphoria in this social network that could eventually affect the stock market? In order to analyze that, we need a function capable of determining a score for each text, based on positive and negative words, which were previously chosen.", "The graph shows us 3 types of categories, which are positive (score> 1), negative (score <1) and neutral. At least in our sample, there is clear evidence that tweets are likely to be more positive than negative. And the proportion changed significantly on August 28th and September 1st. But, since the community is not representative in relation to the market as a whole, it would be an exaggeration to claim that the euphoria on Twitter is impacting the market.", "That doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t something happening in the Brazilian stock market; I really think it is. It just means that, for the moment, there is a little bit of alarmism \u2014 and with some reason. Especially because, when Robert Shiller warned the market about the irrational exuberance that could bring the financial market to a breakdown in his 2005 book, nobody took him seriously. I mean, nowadays you can find several profiles, either on Twitter, YouTube or Instagram talking about investments, for an audience that until the last few years used to see this as something no more than obscurantism.", "\u00b9 You can find Charles Kindleberger\u2019s book in Portuguese (Manias, p\u00e2nicos e crises: Uma hist\u00f3ria das cat\u00e1strofes econ\u00f4micas mundiais) or english (Manias, Panics, and Crashes: A History of Financial Crises).", "Your home for data science.
