Let's look at the distribution of Applicant income first.", "It can be inferred that most of the data in the distribution of applicant income are towards the left which means it is not normally distributed. We will try to make it normal in later sections as algorithms work better if the data is normally distributed.", "The boxplot confirms the presence of a lot of outliers/extreme values. This can be attributed to the income disparity in the society. Part of this can be driven by the fact that we are looking at people with different education levels. Let us segregate them by Education.", "We can see that there are a higher number of graduates with very high incomes, which are appearing to be outliers.", "Let\u2019s look at the Co-applicant income distribution.", "We see a similar distribution as that of the applicant's income. The majority of co-applicants income ranges from 0 to 5000.

But this does not look right. The possible reason behind this may be that most of the applicants don\u2019t have any co-applicant so the co-applicant income for such applicants is 0 and hence the loan approval is not dependent on it. So, we can make a new variable in which we will combine the applicant\u2019s and co-applicants income to visualize the combined effect of income on loan approval.", "Let us combine the Applicant Income and Co-applicant Income and see the combined effect of Total Income on the Loan_Status.", "We can see that Proportion of loans getting approved for applicants having low Total_Income is very less compared to that of applicants with Average, High & Very High Income.", "Let\u2019s visualize the Loan Amount variable.", "It can be seen that the proportion of approved loans is higher for Low and Average Loan Amount as compared to that of High Loan Amount which supports our hypothesis in which we considered that the chances of loan approval will be high when the loan amount is less.", "Let\u2019s drop the bins which we created for the exploration part. We will change the 3+ in dependents variable to 3 to make it a numerical variable. We will also convert the target variable\u2019s categories into 0 and 1 so that we can find its correlation with numerical variables. One more reason to do so is few models like logistic regression takes only numeric values as input. We will replace N with 0 and Y with 1.", "Now let\u2019s look at the correlation between all the numerical variables. We will use the heat map to visualize the correlation. Heatmaps visualize data through variations in coloring. The variables with darker color means their correlation is more.", "We see that the most correlate variables are (ApplicantIncome \u2014 LoanAmount) and (Credit_History \u2014 Loan_Status).

We will look at the value count of the Loan amount term variable.", "It can be seen that in the loan amount term variable, the value of 360 is repeating the most. So we will replace the missing values in this variable using the mode of this variable.", "Now we will see the LoanAmount variable. As it is a numerical variable, we can use mean or median to impute the missing values. We will use the median to fill the null values as earlier we saw that the loan amount has outliers so the mean will not be the proper approach as it is highly affected by the presence of outliers.", "Now let's check whether all the missing values are filled in the dataset.", "As we can see that all the missing values have been filled in the test dataset. Let\u2019s fill all the missing values in the test dataset too with the same approach.", "As we saw earlier in univariate analysis, LoanAmount contains outliers so we have to treat them as the presence of outliers affects the distribution of the data. Let\u2019s examine what can happen to a data set with outliers. For the sample data set:1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4We find the following: mean, median, mode, and standard deviationMean = 2.58Median = 2.5Mode=2Standard Deviation = 1.08If we add an outlier to the data set:1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,400The new values of our statistics are:Mean = 35.38Median = 2.5Mode=2Standard Deviation = 114.74It can be seen that having outliers often has a significant effect on the mean and standard deviation and hence affecting the distribution. We must take steps to remove outliers from our data sets.Due to these outliers bulk of the data in the loan amount is at the left and the right tail is longer. This is called right skewness. One way to remove the skewness is by doing the log transformation. As we take the log transformation, it does not affect the smaller values much but reduces the larger values. So, we get a distribution similar to normal distribution.Let\u2019s visualize the effect of log transformation. We will do similar changes to the test file simultaneously.", "Now the distribution looks much closer to normal and the effect of extreme values has been significantly subsided. Let\u2019s build a logistic regression model and make predictions for the test dataset.", "Let us make our first model predict the target variable. We will start with Logistic Regression which is used for predicting binary outcome.", "To learn further on logistic regression, refer to this article: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/10/basics-logistic-regression/Let's drop the Loan_ID variable as it does not have any effect on the loan status. We will do the same changes to the test dataset which we did for the training dataset.", "We will use scikit-learn (sklearn) for making different models which is an open source library for Python. It is one of the most efcient tools which contains many inbuilt functions that can be used for modeling in Python.", "Sklearn requires the target variable in a separate dataset. So, we will drop our target variable from the training dataset and save it in another dataset.", "Now we will make dummy variables for the categorical variables. The dummy variable turns categorical variables into a series of 0 and 1, making them a lot easier to quantify and compare. Let us understand the process of dummies first:", "Now we will train the model on the training dataset and make predictions for the test dataset. But can we validate these predictions? One way of doing this is we can divide our train dataset into two parts: train and validation. We can train the model on this training part and using that make predictions for the validation part. In this way, we can validate our predictions as we have the true predictions for the validation part (which we do not have for the test dataset).", "We will use the train_test_split function from sklearn to divide our train dataset. So, first, let us import train_test_split.", "The dataset has been divided into training and validation part. Let us import LogisticRegression and accuracy_score from sklearn and fit the logistic regression model.", "Here the C parameter represents the inverse of regularization strength. Regularization is applying a penalty to increasing the magnitude of parameter values in order to reduce overfitting. Smaller values of C specify stronger regularization.

Let us understand how it works:", "Let\u2019s import StratifiedKFold from sklearn and fit the model.", "Now let\u2019s make a cross-validation logistic model with stratified 5 folds and make predictions for the test dataset.", "The mean validation accuracy for this model turns out to be 0.80. Let us visualize the roc curve.", "We got an auc value of 0.70", "Remember we need predictions in Y and N. So let\u2019s convert 1 and 0 to Y and N.", "Based on the domain knowledge, we can come up with new features that might affect the target variable. We will create the following three new features:", "Let\u2019s check the distribution of Total Income.", "We can see it is shifted towards left, i.e., the distribution is right-skewed. So, let\u2019s take the log transformation to make the distribution normal.", "Now the distribution looks much closer to normal and the effect of extreme values has been significantly subsided. Let\u2019s create the EMI feature now.", "Let\u2019s check the distribution of the EMI variable.", "Let us now drop the variables which we used to create these new features. The reason for doing this is, the correlation between those old features and these new features will be very high, and logistic regression assumes that the variables are not highly correlated. We also want to remove the noise from the dataset, so removing correlated features will help in reducing the noise too.", "After creating new features, we can continue the model building process. So we will start with the logistic regression model and then move over to more complex models like RandomForest and XGBoost. We will build the following models in this section.", "Let\u2019s prepare the data for feeding into the models.", "Decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm(having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets(or sub-populations) based on the most significant splitter/differentiator in input variables.", "Decision trees use multiple algorithms to decide to split a node into two or more sub-nodes. The creation of sub-nodes increases the homogeneity of resultant sub-nodes. In other words, we can say that purity of the node increases with respect to the target variable.", "Let\u2019s fit the decision tree model with 5 folds of cross-validation.", "We will try to improve the accuracy by tuning the hyperparameters for this model.
