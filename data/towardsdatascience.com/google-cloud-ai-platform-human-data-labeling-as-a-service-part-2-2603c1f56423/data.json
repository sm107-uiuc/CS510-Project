We include a hands-on example for you to follow along.", "Google AI Platform is a suite of services on Google Cloud specifically targeted at the building, deploying, and managing of machine learning models in the cloud.", "If you are not familiar with Google AI Platform, you may want to read our first article in the series, where we present an overview of what\u2019s available on the platform.", "Labelling is a data science activity to support the training of supervised machine learning models. The term supervised is a direct reference to how these models rely on accurately labelled training data in order for them to learn.", "Labelling can be applied to many different types of training media; from images and video to audio and free-text.", "Unsupervised models, such as a K-means clustering, do not require labelling because, in a sense, unsupervised models discover (i.e. learn) these labels for themselves.", "When training supervised machine learning models, labelling is one of the first activities we carry out, and therefore, takes place very early on in the ML development lifecycle.", "As a data science team, when training ML models we often revert back to this mantra:", "\u201cThe accuracy of a machine learning model is only as good as it\u2019s (training) data.\u201d", "Google\u2019s Data Labelling Service provides access to human labellers to generate highly accurate labels for training data.", "Currently in public-beta, the service formed part of the original AI Platform launch in April 2019.", "The labelling service currently supports 3 media types:", "We will now explore video labelling, including an easy to follow, technical walkthrough.", "Training machine learning models to analyse video is a common use-case we see in the field. Google\u2019s Data Labelling Service supports four of the common labelling tasks we encounter:", "This is probably the simplest and a good place to start out if you want to try the service for the first time. With video classification, you provide one or more labels that you wish the human labellers to apply to your training set of videos.", "Here is a simple example that we will use to showcase video classification. We are fed a series of short video-clips from various garden bird feeders. Our task \u2014 classify the videos as containing birds feeding, or not.", "Tip: Your video format must be MP4, with H.264, H.265, or MPEG4 codec. The current video size limit for the service is 2GB.", "Tip: This applies to any video labelling. Make sure your training videos are as close as possible to the videos the model will be predicting on. For example, think about resolution, colour/black and white, avoid commonalities in backgrounds that can introduce bias into the model. We often analyse CCTV footage and this is often very low resolution, and often has unusual colour balance, especially if filmed at night.", "2. Next you need to create a .csv file that contains the URIs to your videos in your GCS bucket. So, in my example, my CSV just contains two lines:", "Upload this .csv file to the same storage bucket that contains your video files.", "Tip: Make sure to give your csv file a lowercase file extension of .csv (not .CSV), otherwise the next step will fail.", "3. Next we need to create data labelling dataset. This dataset is simply a resource that the human labellers will refer to for your lablleing request. It contains your videos, video .CSV file and your instructions (I\u2019ll cover instructions shortly).", "To create a dataset, first, navigate to the Data Labelling Service UI in the Google Cloud console. You should see a screen like this (enable the API if you are prompted).", "Click the CREATE button. Then, enter the details of your new dataset in the panel, shown below. Note I have to choose the CSV file in my birds-feeding GCS bucket. Finally, click CREATE.", "You should now see an entry for your dataset, as shown here. Note the status which indicates my videos are being uploaded.", "Once complete, you should receive an email notification from Google Cloud. Here\u2019s my email:", "I now see my dataset with both of my videos imported.", "4. Next we create a label set, to define the label options we want the human labels to label our videos with. In our example, we need two labels: \u201cBirds Feeding\u201d and \u201cNo Birds Feeding\u201d.", "To do this, from the Data Labelling UI click Label Sets from the menu on the left and then click CREATE at the top of the screen. Then, in the panel on the right, simply define your labels. Here are mine:", "Tip #1. We always include a clear, unambiguous description with each label. Labellers will see these, and therefore these supplement your instructions!", "Tip #2. For multi-classification use-cases (such as looking for birds or squirrels) we always include a label for \u201cBoth\u201d (video has a bird and a squirrel at the feeder) and \u201cNone\u201d (video has no birds or squirrel). As well as, of course, \u201cBirds feeding\u201d and \u201cSquirrels feeding\u201d :)", "5. The penultimate step is to create an instruction document. This is a PDF document that helps human labellers to understand what you want them to label. Now, for our classification task this is really simple and just requires a few example videos (positive and negative) under each of our labels. I would highlight in here any possible ambiguities \u2014 for my bird feeding example, I\u2019d make it clear that a bird at the feeder (and not necessarily actually feeding) constitutes a positive classification of \u201cBirds Feeding\u201d.", "I\u2019d include some examples of some edge cases, just to make sure this is clear. For example, a bird flying past in a video, but not landing on the feeder, would be classified as \u201cNo Birds Feeding\u201d.", "Google has a lot of detailed guidance on writing good instruction documents. We would recommend reading this, as if these instructions aren\u2019t clear, your labellers may not do what you want them to do!", "Once your PDF document is ready, upload it to your GCS bucket that contains your videos and .CSV file. Next, click Instructions in the UI and in the panel on the right just navigate to your instructions document. Here\u2019s what mine looks like:", "Click CREATE INSTRUCTIONS and wait for an email confirmation before continuing (it usually only takes a few seconds).", "6. We are now ready to submit our labelling task! This is really straightforward \u2014 navigate to your dataset (see step 3) and click on the dataset name. You will see your dataset contents. Here are mine:", "Click on CREATE LABELLING TASK at the top. In the panel that\u2019s displayed enter:", "Congratulations! Your videos will now be labelled by skilled human labellers. Pretty cool, hey?", "Once the labelling process is complete, you will receive an email confirmation. To review your labelled videos, first, navigate to your dataset. Here is mine:", "Click on the LABELLED DATA SETS link and you will see your labelled videos. Exporting labelled videos is a really useful feature, especially if your video training set is large. Options are to exports as a CSV or json file. To export your videos:", "Tip: Both CSV and json exports can easily be viewed in BigQuery (via a federated external table) for further analysis.", "This is a common question we are asked. Typically we aim for circa 1,000 videos per label, and this will achieve a model with an excellent degree of accuracy. Try and balance your training sets \u2014 ideally having a similar number of videos for each label.", "Note that Google enforces a minimum of 10 videos for classification (we wouldn't recommend so few unless the use-case is very simplistic).", "As well as classification, Google\u2019s Data Labelling Service covers the following other video labelling tasks:", "With this type of labelling, we want the labellers to draw rectangular boxes around the thing(s) we want labelling in the video, and track how these move throughout the video. For example, we might extend our bird feeding example to perform a second round of labelling to track the birds and how they move in the video.", "Tip. Pay close attention to your instructions document and make sure it\u2019s really clear to labellers what you want (and don\u2019t want) boxed in your videos.", "This is quite different from our first two labelling tasks. In classification and object tracking we define the labels, and provide these to the labellers. With object detection, the labellers themselves define the labels, depending on what they see in the videos. Again, labellers apply these labels as bounded boxes to the video content.", "Say for example, in our bird feeder videos we want to see if there are any other animals (squirrels, cats, mice\u2026) that appear in the video. This could be an object detection candidate. In our instructions document, we would outline that we want any bird or mammal highlighted in the video.", "One further slight variation with object detection is labellers label image frames extracted from your video content \u2014 you just supply your videos with a framerate to indicate how many images they should extract.", "With video event labelling, you provide human labellers with a label (\u201cBirds Feeding\u201d), and they will define a set of start and end time pairs, for in this case, when birds are feeding in each of my videos.", "Pricing is documented really well in the Google Cloud documentation. This describes the overall pricing structure:", "\u201cPrices for the service are computed based on:", "1. The type of labeling task.", "2. The number of annotation units generated.\u201d", "So, let\u2019s look at the pricing for our bird feeding classification example. Here is the definition of annotation units for video classification tasks taken from the pricing documentation:", "For a video classification task, units are determined by the video length (every 5 seconds is a price unit), label set size(for labeling quality concern, every 20 labels is a problem set and a price unit) and the number of human labelers. The price for single-label and multi-label classification is the same. For example, if a video is 20 seconds, the label set size is 22, the number of human labelers is 3, this video will count for 4 * 2 * 3 = 24 units.", "In our example, our label set size was 2; \u201cBirds Feeding\u201d and \u201cNo Birds Feeding\u201d.", "As a price unit covers up to 20 labels, ours constitutes 1 unit.", "Both videos were 60 seconds long \u2014 so each video uses 60/5 = 12 units", "We left the number of human labellers at the default of 1.", "Therefore, our labelling task is priced at 24 units (12 per video).", "At the time of writing, video classification is priced at $86 per 1,000 units for the first 50,000 units per month, and $60 for every 1,000 units thereafter.", "This is equivalent to 8.6 cents per image, reducing to 6 cents.", "The first thing I\u2019d like readers to take away with them is just how important accurate labelling is when training your models. Sometimes it can be tempting to rush this step in the excitement to see your model live, but just to remind you once again of the mantra our team refers back to:", "\u201cThe accuracy of a machine learning model is only as good as it\u2019s (training) data.\u201d", "The second key takeaway is just how many different sub-classes of video labelling there are. Some of these, such as Video Event, I never even knew existed. I hope you found these interesting too.", "My third takeaway is how simple the Data Labelling Service from Google Cloud is to use; Google has done a great job at making this really user friendly and accessible. I feel it follows a logical flow, and I hope this was evident as you followed along with my example. The ability to easily export to GCS and therefore into BigQuery we find super useful too.", "I feel the service offers good value for money, especially for simpler tasks such as classification. I think $1 per video is reasonable, and accessible for most use-cases. Let\u2019s say for my use case I wanted to have 1,000 videos per label \u2014 this should deliver an accurate model when I come to training. Total cost for using this service would be $2,000. This feels reasonable considering the amount of manual work involved, and how many resources this would consume if we did it ourselves!", "Lastly, just keep in mind that labelling is not the silver bullet when training video related models. Be mindful to not allow other bias to creep into the model. Always try and keep your training videos as close to the ones your model will face \u201cin the field\u201d, and you should see great results!", "1.
