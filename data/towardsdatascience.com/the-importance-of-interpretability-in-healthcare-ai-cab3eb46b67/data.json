You were up late last night iterating on your customer churn model, vetting new features, tweaking hyperparameters for your algorithm, and since no one else was in the office, singing along to Taylor Swift at full blast. It was a perfect evening. Several of the new features added lift, and you struck a great balance between performance and avoiding overtraining. You\u2019ve just produced the best ROC curve that anyone on the team has ever made for this problem. You roll into the office, excited to share the good news with the folks that make the calls based on your models-the customer success team. To your surprise, they\u2019re not happy with your model and want you to get back to the drawing board.", "When situations like this occur, it\u2019s easy to think, \u201cThe model is great; they just don\u2019t get it.\u201d Most of us have had this thought before, but it has no place in the mind of a data scientist who wants to succeed. As data scientists, it\u2019s our job to solve problems logically with evidence. Too often, we inadvertently make the most complicated model we can imagine. This approach generally leads to Thursday mornings that feel a lot like the one above. So how can we combat this tendency? I find it\u2019s best to take the opposite approach and start by asking stakeholders simple questions. Here are a few questions I tend to ask:", "Stakeholders tend to favor models that reflect their preexisting insights and are therefore easily interpretable. The best initial model will typically account for a small number of features that reflect the intuitions of the folks on the ground. Once you get buy-in, iterating on the model to add new information should be a journey you take together. Aligning with stakeholder intuition is the sugar that helps the medicine of complexity go down.", "As data scientists, the output of our work has serious ramifications for the work of other human beings. The tools we create often dictate workflows of end users, so it\u2019s essential we have a detailed understanding of how these people are interacting with them. Stakeholders generally lack training in advanced statistics but often rely on the models we create. Because a small design decision on our end may radically impair their ability to leverage predictions, clearly understand intended workflows, connect with the right person, or potentially even perform the core functions of their jobs effectively, we must anticipate both their needs and perspectives to iterate accordingly.", "As models are increasingly used to direct human work, we should aspire to engineer in aspects of an effective, empathetic leader. Your tool must clearly communicate the reasoning behind its predictions and support stakeholder goals. If the people working with it are unable to interpret its decisions or feel constrained by its suggestions, they will inevitably come to resent it as one would a terrible boss. This comparison may seem extreme, but increasingly, human work is being directed by robot supervisors that can set unrealistic goals and workflow patterns in pursuit of optimization. If you\u2019re working on systems like these, aim to make your robot a John Keating , not a Charles Kingsfield . There\u2019s nothing worse than end users regarding the fruit of your labor as an uncaring dictator.", "We need to empathize with the people who use our tools. All too often, these people are overlooked, and AI projects fail to reach a deployed state, stumbling into a common pitfall despite boasting impressive performance metrics. Developing ML models in hermetically sealed environments is simply an anti-pattern that directly contributes to failure and frustration.", "In pursuit of successful deployments predicated on empathy, consider the possibilities of the opposite extreme: spending every waking moment observing firsthand how ML models are impacting decisions. Dr. Chris White put this approach to the test when he dove headfirst into a warzone to improve data-mining tools. In 2010, He deployed to Afghanistan to understand how military personnel in the field were collecting, analyzing, and using data to influence decision making. You might be able to push unclear algorithms onto folks in the white-collared world, but that won\u2019t fly with a Marine unit at a forward outpost.", "Understanding the perspective of the boots on the ground made all the difference. Dr. White\u2019s data-mining tools were purpose-built for warfare and incredibly successful. This experience stuck with Dr. White and informed his approach while he oversaw DARPA\u2019s Memex program . The broad purpose of the Memex program was to produce a search engine that included the dark web, organized search results into logical clusters of information, and stored knowledge across user sessions. In practice, the program was building one of the best tools in the world for combatting human trafficking. Dr. White\u2019s experience overseas drove home the importance of usability. Memex\u2019s tools underwent continual user testing, with a binary evaluation standard: does this tool help-yes or no? The program was ultimately deemed a success, and directly resulted in tools that are still widely used today to bolster human trafficking investigations.", "Healthcare data scientists have it comparatively easy; instead of dodging bullets in a warzone, we merely have to embed with the folks using our tools in an office or hospital setting. Given the COVID-19 Pandemic, this might not be a viable option, but compromises are certainly possible. Before you show stakeholders a set of results, you should be in the habit of interacting with predictions. If a predictive model suggests the opportunity for an intervention with a patient, is it crystal-clear why a caregiver should follow through? If you can\u2019t surface decision logic, it\u2019s highly unlikely that caregivers will be receptive to your model\u2019s predictions.", "You should know how stakeholders interact with your predictions, and if you or your team make the UI for the predictions, you should participate in user testing sessions. It can be exceedingly challenging to swallow your pride in the face of disappointing feedback, but it\u2019s critically important to see this as an opportunity to improve the tool. In the case that your predictions are embedded in a system that you didn\u2019t create, it\u2019s still important to work with users to understand their interactions with scores. While you might not have the same ability to effect change, you should still be on the hunt for opportunities to make your predictions more actionable.", "In a lot of work environments, clear decision logic is a \u201cnice to have\u201d for auditing purposes, but at the end of the day performance reigns supreme. While this paradigm can cause serious headaches for the people using AI and ML tools, it often plays to the strengths of data scientists. Many data scientists get into the field because they are mathematically inclined. We like puzzles, we like challenging optimization problems, and we love arguing about the arcane details of algorithms. It can certainly feel like Interpretability is just a concession made for interacting with the plebeians, but that\u2019s ultimately a naive perspective. When you\u2019re having thoughts like these, it\u2019s a good idea to keep this Einstein quote in mind, \u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough.\u201d", "For a great example of interpretability\u2019s importance, look no further than this study of image classifiers differentiating between dogs and wolves . When the decision logic of these seemingly accurate dog v wolf classifiers was examined, a simple fact was revealed: the neural network had learned to determine the difference between snow and grass. It just so happens that most pictures of wolves are taken in snowy climates. As soon as the decision logic of these algorithms surfaced, it became apparent that the background-not the object itself-was the driving factor. This finding improved image classification on the whole, and it probably wouldn\u2019t have happened without an intimate understanding of how the algorithms worked and the need to explain it.", "As data scientists, we should continue to be the nerds we are. Burn the midnight oil, take risks on tricky math, and keep singing \u201cShake it Off\u201d like no one is listening. But we should also endeavor to be humanists who cherish the opportunity to get new perspectives on our models. In short, learn to love your Thursday mornings, your models will be better for them.", "Your home for data science.
