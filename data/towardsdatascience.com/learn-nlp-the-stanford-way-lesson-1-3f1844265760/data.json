I\u2019ll try my best to avoid getting into the specifics since, for the most part, we will be using Python libraries that already implement most of the structure that we will need. Still, if you are looking to learn more about those topics, I strongly advise you to study the course notes.", "We will use Deepnote to create our Python notebooks and develop the whole course using the cloud.", "Why Deepnote? Deepnote extends the Jupyter notebooks experience with real-time collaboration and offers free compute with no pre-install. You can duplicate my Deepnote notebook here and follow me as I walk through this project for the best experience.", "For the course, we will use a guideline for Stanford\u2019s Winter 2020 CS224N material since it has a comprehensive approach, a Youtube playlist containing the lessons, and other resources made available from Stanford\u2019s students. If you wish to know more about the course, you can access its website.", "We will first start with NLP's basics and work our way to its key methods: RNN, attention, transformers, etc. At the end of the course, we will be able to create some of the following applications:", "\u201cNatural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.\u201d \u2014 Wikipedia", "By this definition, other than seeing that NLP is a vast multidisciplinary field, it leads us to a question: How can we make computer programs analyze natural language data?", "The first step is learning how we can represent words and their meanings in a computational environment.", "For a few years, NLP work was mainly based on modeling the word synonyms and hypernyms. One way to figure out those sets was by looking at the word definition in a dictionary.", "We can do this by using Python, with a library called NLTK.", "\u201cNLTK is a leading platform for building Python programs to work with human language data. It provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as WordNet, along with a suite of text processing libraries for classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning, wrappers for industrial-strength NLP libraries, and an active discussion forum.\u201d \u2014 Nltk.org", "With NLTK, we can search for a word meaning by using a built-in lexical database called WordNet. WordNet presents nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs grouped in sets of cognitive synonyms \u2014 synsets \u2014 with each synset representing a distinct concept.", "To start, first, let\u2019s log in to create a \u201cNew Project\u201d on Deepnote. With the notebook opened, let\u2019s install the NLTK library by typing in a cell and running with Shift+Enter \u2014 for those of you that use different Python notebook platforms, the shortcuts you know should work just fine.", "After this, we need to import the NLTK library and download the WordNet database.", "And with this, we are all set. To get the synsets objects from a word like \u2018language,\u2019 we must import the WordNet database and use the method. synsets().", "It seems the resulting object does not give us all the information needed about the word, just some encrypted-like information about each synset. For better viewing, we can loop over the results and format the synset object using it's pos() and lemmas() With the help of a custom list of objects that will \u201cpretty print\u201d the word representation.", "For more information about the WordNet package in NLTK, you can view this link", "You can see it works properly as a dictionary, but it has a few problems developing NLP applications.", "It\u2019s very subjective; it requires massive amounts of human labor, so it's virtually impossible to maintain the corpus. It also won\u2019t calculate word similarity effectively, which is really important for our applications. That can lead us to write unreliable or easily outdated AI software.", "Another approach was to use discrete vectors (vectors with 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s) to represent different words, but this method also had several pitfalls. For example, it relied mainly on WordNet\u2019s list of synonyms, and that would cause us some problems.", "Due to that, the area move on to another approach that uses Word Vectors to represent words.", "The concept of word vectors enables us to work with words and the context (the words that are nearby) of the central word. That allows us to work the similarity between words in different contexts.", "Word vectors are represented by n-dimensional vectors containing non-zero values, representing words by their relationship to other words. For each word is built a dense vector like the following:", "If you wish to expand your knowledge on the word vectors topic, I recommend this awesome notebook written by Allison Parrish.", "Word vectors can be created with different methods. In Stanford\u2019s CS224N course, the Word2Vec (Mikolov et al. 2013)[1][2] framework is presented:", "This process is mainly implemented by using neural networks to learn the association between words. We won\u2019t be implementing the Word2Vec framework to train a model; instead, we will use the Word2Vec model from the Python library gensim.", "\u201cGensim is a Python library for topic modelling, document indexing and similarity retrieval with large corpora. Target audience is the natural language processing (NLP) and information retrieval (IR) community.\u201d \u2014 Gensim Website", "This example will use gensim\u2019s embedded api and Word2Vec modules to download a corpus of text and create a Word2Vec model to visualize some interesting word vector features. First, we need to install the gensim package.", "Now we need to obtain the corpus that we will use to create our Word2Vec model. To do that, we can use the api module. We will download the text8 corpus, created with text extracted from Wikipedia. After that, we need to use the corpus to create our Word2Vec model, and we do that by importing the Word2Vec model and instantiating it, passing the corpus as a constructor parameter.", "We can already work with the word vectors by performing tasks like finding similar words and selecting words that don\u2019t fit in a group. You can read gensim\u2019s docs to find out more about the available word vector operations.", "Remember that maybe the biggest pitfall from NLTK was not able to calculate the similarity between two words? By using word vectors, we can use this feature to perform even more complex tasks. We can, for instance, find analogies between sets of words.", "We can perform mathematical operations with words and model expressions like: \u201cKing \u2014 Man + Woman = ?\u201d", "To evaluate that expression using gensim, we can use the most_similar() method passing as positive values \u2018woman\u2019 and \u2018king\u2019 and as a negative value \u2018man\u2019 .", "We can also create a analogy function to make it easier to perform this operation:", "Word vectors created the foundation for modern distributed word representation and, consequently, paved the way for NLP advancements.", "In the next post, we will discuss word vectors and word senses, topics of the Stanford course's second lecture.
