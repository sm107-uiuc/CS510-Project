The NBA team has a 28\u20132 record when playing in South Philly, a 93% win percentage, while posting a 9\u201323 record on the road, a win percentage of only 30%. This 63 percentage point home-away split puts them on pace to be the only team in NBA history to win at least 90% of their home games and lose more than 2/3 of their road games.", "What explains such a discrepancy? It\u2019s well-documented that the effect of home-field advantage in the NBA is the largest among the regular season for the big four American pro sports leagues, at a win percentage rate of about 60%. The Sixers\u2019 93% home win rate after 60 games into the season is clearly an outlier, but their abysmal road performance begs the question: why are they so bad on the road?", "On this past week\u2019s episode of the sports analytics podcast Wharton Moneyball, statistics and marketing professors Cade Massey, Shane Jensen, Adi Wyner, and Eric Bradlow discussed potential theories for the Sixers\u2019 drastic home-road splits (starting at 17:35):", "Adi Wyner (AW): This is one of the all-time greatest discrepancies\u2026[their home-road splits are] incredibly different!\u2026over four standard errors, that\u2019s absurd!\u2026I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s actually unprecedented, but in terms of probabilities, I wouldn\u2019t have expected this to happen, maybe once before?\u2026", "Cade Massey (CM): So what does it say about the team?", "CM: When it\u2019s that stark, it can\u2019t be\u2026we can\u2019t have no insight\u2026", "Shane Jensen (SJ): They\u2019re obviously stealing signs guys!..", "AW: I would guess, and this is just a complete, uneducated, but potentially on-target guess that it has to do with construction of who is playing and how they\u2019re actually playing. I think basketball is easily the sport most susceptible to effort\u2026among the big three\u2026in basketball, we can see that when the stars want to put it on, they become different players!\u2026", "SJ: There\u2019s a really interesting article written a couple of weeks ago on the Athletic about load management, and of course in basketball where we just accept it as part of the regular season now that load management is a huge strategy\u2026", "AW: I would guess that load management in some respect has something to do with the Sixers\u2019 home-field advantage because their stars play at home and I bet they\u2019re not playing on the road\u2026", "SJ: That would be something that one could easily at least analyze, is are they doing an kind of extreme version of load management, where they\u2019re only playing their stars disproportionally at home\u2026", "CM: It would be interesting to know what the minutes played is, the home-away split\u2026", "SJ: \u2026this idea that load management is driving us to play our better players at home and not so much on the road\u2026", "In sum, the hosts propose three theories:", "In the rest of this post, I\u2019ll evaluate the first two theories, using data from NBA.com/stats to see if there\u2019s any validity to the theories. Obviously the last theory is a tongue-in-cheek reference to the recent Houston Astros sign stealing scandal that for now I will leave to others to evaluate as desired!", "Instead, I\u2019ll be evaluating a different third theory of my own:", "3. The Sixers\u2019s opponents on the road have been disproportionately stronger than the opponents they\u2019ve faced at home.", "Data used for the following analysis was gathered from NBA.com/stats midday Sunday, March 1st, at a time when the Sixers had a 37\u201323 overall record, 28\u20132 at home and 9\u201323 on the road.", "Historical schedule and strength of schedule data were gathered at the same time from Basketball-Reference.com and FiveThirtyEight, respectively.", "To determine whether the Sixers are deploying an extreme version of load management, resting their star players on the road but playing them at home, I first took a look at the difference between home and away minutes played:", "Among Sixers who have played over 1,000 total minutes, only two players, Joel Embiid and Matisse Thybulle, play noticeably more time at home than on the road. They both play about 55% of their minutes at home versus on the road.", "Other key players, like Ben Simmons and Josh Richardson, actually play more of their minutes on the road, playing home only 48.6% and 46.7% of the time, respectively.", "On average, do the Sixers play their stars more at home and less on the road? To determine the overall effect that home-road playing time differences has on a given team, I calculated a score for each team that adjusts the total fantasy points upward for players who play more at home than on the road. If teams are deploying this form of extreme load management for their stars, we would see a discrepancy in their adjusted fantasy points.", "An example: Joel Embiid has played at home 55.07% of the time, relative to the team\u2019s 49.92% rate of playing at home.* Therefore, Embiid plays at home at a rate of 5.15 percentage points more than might be expected. To weight the effect of his home-road playing time imbalance, I adjusted his 1,963.2 fantasy points scored this year by the extra amount of time he is playing at home. 1,963.2 * (1+5.15%) = an adjusted score of 2,064.3. To determine the absolute effect of that weighting, I subtract his actual fantasy point total (1,963.2) from his adjusted fantasy point total (2,064.3) by to arrive at a difference of 101.1 points.", "*Note: the Sixers have actually played at home 50% of the time, but for some reason, the total of reported player home minutes don\u2019t equal the total away minutes. To account for this discrepancy, when comparing player home-away minutes to team home-away minutes, I sum the minutes of players on the same team rather than use the reported team stats.", "This difference between Embiid\u2019s fantasy point total and his adjusted fantasy point total, what I call his \u201chome bias score\u201d, doesn\u2019t have any significance in reality but does give us a sense of how much weight to give to his imbalance of playing at home if we suspect that a team is resting its star players on the road.", "For each player who has played with the Sixers this season, we can see the effects of resting that player on the road. Embiid stands out as the most beneficiary of road rest, but is somewhat offset by other starters Simmons, Harris, and Richardson, who play less at home than they do on the road:", "By adding up all players\u2019 scores, we see that the Sixers are only marginally weighted toward playing their stars more at home, ranking in the middle of the rest of the teams:", "Of all teams, it looks like the Houston Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers are most likely to be deploying a form of load management for its best players, resting them on the road, although the differences are still small enough to be coincidental.", "For Houston, starters James Harden and Russell Westbrook both play about 52% of their minutes at home versus on the road:", "Due to the fact that both Harden and Westbrook are in the top 15 of all players in fantasy points, it skews the team\u2019s home bias score significantly.", "Four of Portland\u2019s five starters play at home more (between 49\u201360%) than the team as a whole (48%):", "Patrick Beverly, Joel Embiid, and James Harden lead all players in home bias scores, suggesting that they may be taking it easy on the road. Here are the 30 players with the top home bias scores:", "If you\u2019re curious, here\u2019s how the top 35 fantasy point scorers split their time home and away, and their resulting home bias score:", "When comparing a team\u2019s home-away win % discrepancy to their home bias score, we find virtually no correlation:", "Theory #1 Conclusion: On the whole, the Sixers do not seem to be resting their talent on the road significantly more than other teams enough to explain the difference in their home-road win percentage splits. Embiid, with the second-highest home bias score of all players, is certainly a potential outlier, but his relative rest on the road is largely offset by other stars playing more on the road than at home. Overall, teams\u2019 use of top talent at home versus on the road appears to have little correlation with a team\u2019s difference in their win percentage at home versus on the road.", "To measure whether the Sixers \u201ctry less\u201d on the road, we have to turn to a more subjective set of statistics.", "Back in 2016, the NBA started publishing \u201chustle\u201d stats. These include screen assists, deflections, loose balls recovered, charges drawn, and contested shots. Additionally, they\u2019ve since published data on box outs, distance, and speed. These stats are meant to measure the amount of effort that a team or player is expending in a given game.", "For each of the above categories, I gathered per-game home versus away data for each team. I then divided each per-game stat when at home with each per-game stat when on the road, to generate a ratio score; a team who expends as much effort on the road as they do at home would receive a neutral score of 1.00.", "As an example, the Sixers contest an average of 54.8 shots per home game versus an average of 53.9 shots per away game. 54.8 / 53.9 = a score of 1.02, suggesting the possibility (although perhaps more likely coincidental) that the team expends more effort when contesting shots at home than on the road.", "However, they recover slightly fewer loose balls per home game (8.3) compared with road games (8.4), a score of 0.99:", "When comparing all teams on home versus away \u201chustle\u201d, the Sixers don\u2019t stand out by any means; for most of these stats they rank in the middle of the pack:", "Furthermore, I looked at team averages for box outs, distance, and speed, comparing per-game home and away averages. These might be slightly less representative of effort (for example, speed could be an attribute of the team and opponent\u2019s playing style/pace), but might suggest some discrepancy in effort.", "Here, the Sixers once again ranked in the middle or even towards the bottom relative to other teams:", "Theory #2 Conclusion: The Sixers do not seem to be expending more effort when playing at home versus away relative to other teams as measured by screen assists, deflections, loose balls recovered, charges drawn, contested shots, box outs, distance traveled, or speed.", "A third potential explanation of why the Sixers perform better at home could be that they simply play weaker teams, while playing stronger teams on the road.", "To validate this theory, I gathered data on each team\u2019s expected win probability relative to their opponent going into each game of the season. I used FiveThirtyEight\u2019s game forecasts based on their RAPTOR player ratings.", "Due to the known home-court advantage for NBA teams, all teams have higher average opponent win probability when playing on the road than at home. But some teams have a much bigger discrepancy between their opponents\u2019 win probability on the road than at home, suggesting tougher schedules. By this measure, the Sixers rank in the middle of the pack, 14 of 30, in terms of the strongest opponents faced in away games:", "You might wonder if these data are affected by differences in teams\u2019 home-court advantage; for example, the Denver Nuggets (and other Denver professional sports teams) are known to have a greater advantage at home due to the high altitude of where they play, which might explain their relatively high ranking in the above chart. However, FiveThirtyEight\u2019s probabilities account for generic home-court advantage, fatigue, travel, and altitude, likely diminishing these effects. Case in point: Utah, also known as a potentially difficult place to play due to altitude, is ranked right behind the Sixers, suggesting that inherent home-court advantage likely isn\u2019t more of a factor than strength of schedule when playing on the road.", "Surprisingly, when comparing a team\u2019s home-away win % discrepancy to the relative strength of their opponents when on the road, we find no correlation:", "I would have thought that at least some of the discrepancy between winning percentage while at home versus away would have been due to the difference between opponent\u2019s average win probability ahead of the game at home versus on the road.", "Theory #3 Conclusion: The Sixers have not faced disproportionately strong opponents on the road relative to opponents at home.", "As such, we may need to turn to more \u201csquishy\u201d theories to explain the Sixers\u2019 struggles on the road.", "Center Al Horford commented in early February about a vague \u201clack of focus\u201d on the road:", "There\u2019s some stuff going on in our locker room and we\u2019ll keep that internal. We all know we need to be better. We need to step it up, and it\u2019s a great opportunity to do it tomorrow.", "We weren\u2019t focused enough, especially on the road. We were focused in the first half [against the Heat], then in the second they made a little run and for some reason we weren\u2019t able to recover. As a group we need to be more focused. We did a little better on the road, but we\u2019ve fallen back to a bad pattern.", "Coach Brett Brown is less convinced of a cause:", "You look at our record on the road, it\u2019s like, \u2018How can that be?\u2019 You\u2019ve got this at home and this on the road, it\u2019s two different personalities. \u2026 Have we had bad shootarounds? Have we had bad practices? Is the spirit of the group that polluted that we can\u2019t navigate through stuff? And it isn\u2019t.", "[Our road struggles are] a little bit of a mystery\u2026I\u2019ve been doing this long enough to live in the real world. I can\u2019t point to any of [the theories] as being \u2018uh oh.\u2019", "So what explains the Sixers\u2019 road woes? Unfortunately, the answer, for now, is unsatisfying: it\u2019s a mystery.", "If you liked this post, you may also like my other posts about sports and data \u2014 give me a follow to be notified when I post more:", "Your home for data science.
