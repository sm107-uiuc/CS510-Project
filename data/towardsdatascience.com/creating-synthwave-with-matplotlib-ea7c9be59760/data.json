I love it, and I find the art-style it has been partnered with incredibly mesmerizing.", "A quick search for the genre on YouTube can give anyone an appreciation for the retro sci-fi aesthetic the genre brings.", "Now, I would love to create visuals like this. However I work with data day-in and day-out, I\u2019m no animator, graphic designer, or artist.", "Then I thought, \u201cI do create visuals, I visualize data in Matplotlib. Wouldn\u2019t it be fun to create Synthwave visuals in Matplotlib?\u201d.", "The first thing to create is the perspective style vertical grid lines. For this, we set an origin point (0, 5). The lines must reach from here to the bottom of the frame, at y = -50. The only value to change for each line is the final x value in the Numpy linspace function. We do this with a for-loop ranging from x = -500 to x = 500, with steps of 50.", "Now, there\u2019s no horizon, and you can\u2019t have an endless synthwave road without a horizon. So we simply mask all y values above 0 using np.ma.masked_where(y > 0, y).", "Lastly, let's fix the color scheme. We\u2019ll go with a black background and use multiple semi-transparent lines to create the glow effect [1].", "This is a little more tricky. To create the horizontal lines that appear to come towards us, we use Matplotlib animation to continuously update the y position of a horizontal line. We create ten instances of these motion lines, each of which is assigned a modified exponential function, which looks like this:", "Each motion line is assigned the same x-value for each frame. But, as we have shifted each function along the x-axis, we return a different y-value. If we plot all ten motion lines, with this logic in mind we can visualize the y-position of lines (y-axis) through time (x-axis):", "By using an exponential function we blend our motion and perspective lines into one. The illusion of three-dimensional movement is created by increasing the downward velocity as the motion lines get \u2018closer\u2019 to us. This is similar to easing in animation [2].", "Applying this to the y-position of our horizontal grid lines gives us the illusion of endlessly moving forward in a neon purple tron-like world.", "Fortunately for the size of our output file, our motion line movements repeat every tenth of the total time. Meaning we can cut the animation frames by ten in our animation function \u2014 animation.FuncAnimation(fig, animate, frames=int(frames/10)).", "This wouldn\u2019t be Synthwave without an over-sized retro sunset at the end of our endless neon purple road.", "Matplotlib can be a little difficult when it comes to gradients. We use imshow() to create an image, which in our case is the plasma gradient. We then mask this image beyond a specified radius from our center point, giving us:", "Good, but not quite there yet. The Miami sun needs a glow and a few horizontal lines. For the glow, we place a few more circles with slightly larger radii and low alpha values. The lines are added after using simple black line plots.", "Putting our Miami sun and neon grid together, we get:", "The endless neon purple road needs purpose. A distant, yet not-too-distant destination. Think \u2014 a mysterious metropolitan paradise.", "Fortunately, Matplotlib comes with a purpose-built retro skyline generator called plt.bar()! We simply use np.random.uniform(0, 10), with a few calculations to define bar-width and we have our own beautiful, randomly generated skyline.", "As we cannot see our skyline silhouette against the cloudless Miami night sky, we add a deep purple glow emanating from our endless horizon. We will use plt.imshow() again. What we need is the initial gnuplot gradient, so lets take the first 28 color mappings and create a new gradient with ListedColormap.", "I also took the liberty of reducing our neon grid line-widths, which I think now looks much better. Let's see how our endless road is looking:", "Looks good, but now our over-sized Miami sunset is possibly too over-sized and squashes our otherwise perfect view of the distant skyline. Additionally, 80\u2019s Miami skies were always full of stars and I see none.", "So, lets resize our sun and add in the stars using plt.scatter() with np.random.uniform() for x and y. We also vary the alpha parameter per star based on a combination of the y-position (dimmer towards the horizon) and a little bit of randomness.", "There are now a few minor tweaks that I think will complete the visualization.", "Firstly, stars appearing in front of the sun. We simply adjust the zorder parameter in the star\u2019s ax.scatter() functions. Moving them below the sun \u2014 which as a patch defaults to zorder = 1 [3].", "At this point, it looks good but the stars are just plain white dots, not very convincing. So we add some randomly generated twinkles.", "Finally, much the same as the emanating glow behind our horizon skyline. We add another purple-black gradient. This time along our endless road.", "Although there is no obvious use-case for this, I would highly recommend trying to create something similar as you will learn a lot in the process. And, to be honest, it\u2019s a lot of fun!", "I hope you enjoyed reading this article as much as I did creating it.", "If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to reach out via Twitter or in the comments below.", "Your home for data science.
