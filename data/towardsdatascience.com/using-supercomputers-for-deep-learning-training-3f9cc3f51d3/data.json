that supercomputers are a key component of the progress of Artificial Intelligence and what drove changes in effective compute over the last years was the increased parallelization and distribution of the algorithms.", "This post will demonstrate how these supercomputers can be used, specifically, the one presented in the previous post provided by IBM, CTE-POWER, that each server has two CPUs power 9 and 4 NVIDIA V100 GPUs. If you\u2019ve been following these series, we have been doing all the programming on Jupyter notebooks. But how the same code can be run on a Supercomputer directly as a python program? This is what we present in this post, learn how to allocate and use supercomputing resources.", "And in the next three posts we will present how we can distribute the training of a single Deep Neural Network (DNN) over many GPUs and servers in order to reduce the training time:", "If you need to review the basic concepts of Deep Learning before continuing with this post, you can do so by revisiting these previous posts:", "c.

Convolutional Neural Networks for Beginner using Keras", "In this series of posts, we will use the TensorFlow framework; however, the code in PyTorch code doesn\u2019t differ too much. We will use the Keras API because since the release of Tensorflow 2.0, tf.keras.Model API has become the primary way of building neural networks, particularly those not requiring custom training loops.", "For convenience, we will use the same program that we used to classify MNIST digits that we programmed previously in Jupyter notebook. But to be able to run it on the supercomputer, we have to convert it into a .py file. To transform the notebook .pynb into a .py file, we only need to choose the \u201cFile\u201d tab in the top menu and select \u201cDownload .py\u201d. The resulting code will be:", "This will be the code, MNIST.py file, that we will use as a case study to show how to launch programs in the CTE-POWER supercomputing.", "CTE-POWER is a cluster based on IBM Power9 processors, with a Linux Operating System and an Infiniband interconnection network. CTE-POWER has 54 compute servers, each of them:", "More details of its characteristics can be found in the CTE-POWER user\u2019s guide and also in the information of the manufacturer of the AC922 servers.", "To run a code in CTE-POWER we need to use a SLURM workload manager. A very good Quick Start User Guide can be found here.", "We can headline two ways to do use it: sbatchand salloc commands.", "The method for submitting jobs is to use the SLURM sbatchcommand directly. sbatch submits a batch script to Slurm. The batch script may be given to sbatch through a file name on the command line (.sh file). The batch script may contain options preceded with #SBATCH before any executable commands in the script. sbatch will stop processing further #SBATCH directives once the first non-comment non-whitespace line has been reached in the script.", "sbatch exits immediately after the script is successfully transferred to the Slurm controller and assigned a Slurm job ID.

In the following posts, we will introduce other parameters.", "An example of job script that allocate a node with 1GPUs for our case study looks like this (MNIST.sh ):", "You can consult this official page documentation to know all the options we can use in the batch script preceded with#SBATCH.", "These are the basic directives to submit and monitor jobs with SLURM that we will use in our case study:", "An alternative to run a job is using the salloc command. It is used to allocate resources for a job in real-time. Typically this is used to allocate resources and spawn a shell. The shell is then used to execute srun commands to launch parallel tasks. One example can be:", "When salloc command obtains the requested allocation, it then runs the command specified by the user. The command may be any program the user wishes. In our case, the command is srun to create an interactive session where we could execute commands.", "Note that we are allocating 4 GPUs from a node with this command. It is very likely that we have to wait to be granted to have the resource, as the machine is often very busy:", "We are informed with the following message when we already have the resources available:", "Once we are in an interactive session, we can check if we have 4 GPUs assigned with:", "Remember that we need to run the commands to load the modules and then run the corresponding code:", "In the case of using salloc command if we want to detach the standard outputs and the standard error messages, we can add this argument 2>err.txt:", "Redirecting the standard error allows us to see the result of the training that gives us the Keras by the standard output without the information related to the environment:", "In this post, we have described how we can access a Supercomputer and how we can use it, both interactively to a node and through a batch mode, thanks to SLURM that allows us to reserve multiple supercomputing resources.", "In the following post, we will present the most common strategies for parallelizing and distributing a single Deep Neural Network over many GPUs.", "This post is part of the documentation used in my master course Supercomputers Architecture at UPC Barcelona Tech with BSC\u2019s support.
