Take a look at the famous Groucho Marx\u2019s joke:", "One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I\u2019ll never know.", "At the human level, there are several interpretations of this sentence. But it is almost impossible for the computer to comprehend.", "Nonetheless, the learning curve of NLP is not so steep and can be captivating. In this project, I will explain an introductory level of natural language processing with the Beatles and Taylor Swift song lyrics. The final goal is to compare the word usage of the Beatles and Taylor Swift song lyrics and see if we can visualize them in clusters. To achieve this goal there are 6 steps:", "You do not need to run the code to understand this blog. But if you are interested in it, you can folk my Github repository here. The tree structure of the folder is:", "The Beatles: Love Me Do, I Want to Hold Your Hand, While My Guitar Gently Weeps, Come Together, Something, Eleanor Rigby, a Day in The Life, Don't Let Me Down, Help, Hey Jude", "Taylor Swift: Bad Blood, You Need to Calm Down, Delicate, The Man, You Belong With Me, Soon You Will Get Better, Look What You Make Me Do, Me!, Love Story, 22.", "We need one song to make a test, let\u2019s take a look at the first 4 lines of \u201cHey Jude\u201d", "Great, we just finished the first step of the project.", "The first question we need to ask ourselves is what we are going to clean. Our goal is to reduce the complexity of the sentences and remove unmeaningful characters. To change to different songs, look at the filenames list and choose the corresponding directory to the song lyrics. From this point, I change the link to \u2018Data/TaylorSwift/YouNeedToCalmDown.txt' as an example because its content has more interesting characters to clean. Let\u2019s look at the first few lines of \u201cYou Need to Calm Down\u201d by Taylor Swift.", "We need to remove\\n and some punctuation if they exist. We want to leave the number there, it might indicate the style of the singers. Lower case all the words make it easy for processing but might make proper nouns become regular nouns. We also need to convert the word you\u2019re to you are, I\u2019m to I am, that\u2019s to that is, takin\u2019 to taking but this step will be achieved at a later step.", "Note that I want to leave the apostrophe 'there because removing it may make a word meaningless", "Tokenization is the process of tokenizing or splitting a string, text into a list of tokens. One can think of token as parts like a word is a token in a sentence, and a sentence is a token in a paragraph.", "The simplest way to token a word is thesplit() method that turns a string into an array of strings. However, this method has a problem. Words such as don\u2019t or Taylor\u2019s are 2 different words combine. It\u2019s hard to list all the split rules that apply for all cases. Hence, we need the help of the NLTK tokenizer. NLTK stands for Natural Language Processing Tool Kit. It is the one-stop-shop for text processing and is accessible for everyone. Let\u2019s take a look at the NLTK functionword_tokenize and find out what it does to a random sentence.", "Note that word_tokenize splits the verb in negative form into verb+ n\u2019t. It also splits exclamation and dot marks out of the word. In this case, we have already taken care of punctuation in the previous part, but it is ok to repeat. The following is the function that receives the clean version of the song and tokenizes it:", "According to Geek to Geek, Stemming is the process of producing morphological variants of a root/base word. Lemmatization is the process of grouping together the different inflected forms of a word, so they can be analyzed as a single item.", "A few examples show how each method has different effects on our work and decide which method we want to include", "The first column is the word from our text and following by stemming and lemmatizing columns. Stemming is a crude way to process a word. It just truncates the words to convert it into a root word base on some certain rules. Sometimes it messes up the words really badly. We do not want apples becomes appl. That\u2019s why I do not choose stemming.", "On the other hand, lemmatization is followed by more complicated rules. Note that in the method lemmatize has pos (part of speech) changed to \u201cv\u201d (verb). Therefore, died becomes die. If we change pos to \"n\" , appleswould become apple. If we change pos to \"a\" (adjective), better would become good . There are many other layers that we can filter, but to keep it more simple, I will apply \u201ca\u201d,\u201dv\u201d, and \u201cn\u201dlayers sequentially.", "Stop Words: A stop word is a commonly used word (such as \u201cthe\u201d, \u201ca\u201d, \u201can\u201d, \u201cin\u201d) that we can simply ignore because they bring no values to our analysis. The code below shows how we can import the list of stopwords from nltk", "There are 179 stopwords, but I do not want to use all of them. For this project, I think pronouns may indicate an author's perspective about the song. For example, I use \u201cwe\u201d in this article because I want the readers to be on the same page with me. The word you and I repeated in the song might indicate that the song is actually the story of the author. Taylor Swift is being known for writing love stories of her past relationships, which might distinguish her from the Beatles. However, the 35th stopwords beyond might not be that\u2019s interesting", "I also created a few more stopwords that are not on the list. I know what to add because I have tried different songs to understand what was missing. Let\u2019s create a function for what we have been discussed:", "After having a really nice function that can clean and tokenize the song, our next step is to count how many times each word appears. The function would receive a list of tokens and return unique tokens with their counts. Note that, in the later step, we want to compare the similarity of all the songs. Therefore, the second input (optional) should be the unique tokens of all songs. Let\u2019s take a look at the function below:", "Excellent! You are almost done. Now come to the most important step of the projects.", "TF-IDF is a combination of two individual metrics, which are the TF and IDF. TF-IDF is used when we have multiple documents. The idea is one word can appear more in one type of document than the others. The final goal of this step is to have a table of 20 songs with columns be the unique vocabs in all documents. The values in each column are corresponding weights of each word assigned by TF-IDF formula", "As the name suggested we want to find the rate of appearance the word t has in a single document. Let\u2019s create the term frequency function and display the first 10 most common words in the whole song.", "The term_frequency's function is just a normalized vectorize_and_freq function using vocabs in one song.", "The inverse document frequency takes the natural log of the ratio between the total number of documents and the number of documents with the word t in it:", "After calculating each TF and IDF separately, let\u2019s combine them together", "This function takes a list of the vocab dictionary of every song and created the corresponding \u201ctf-idf\u201d weight for each vocab in each song. Observe that, these weights can not be 0, since the TF and IDF term are always greater than 0.", "Finally, we want to combine all the functions we have created into a metafunction:", "The output of this main function is the list of 20 songs with corresponding tf-idf weight for each word. There are 712 vocabs (root words) in 20 songs. The output above shows the tf-idf weight of some vocabs in \u201cDelicate\u201d by Taylor Swift.", "Our goal is to plot these 20 songs on a visualizable space. However, there are 712 dimensions. There are two methods that come to my mind when talking about reducing dimensionality: Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and T-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE). While PCA focuses on preserving variances of data points from higher to a lower dimension, t-SNE focuses on the probability distribution of similar points. Therefore t-SNE is more appropriate in this project.", "Let\u2019s define the t-SNE instance that transforms our data to 2D:", "Note that I change the seed to 4 because it is possible to have different results on a different run. The reason is unlike PCA, t-SNE has a non-convex objective function. The objective function is minimized using a gradient descent optimization that is initiated randomly. Let\u2019s take a look at the 2D plot of our songs:", "This is the result with seed number 4", "The plot does not really show clear clusters. Let\u2019s try seed number 10", "The points are even more scattering. There are a few points that we can conclude about this result:", "There are a lot of uncertainties, but one thing that we certainly learned is that NLP requires a lot of thoughts and techniques to produce something meaningful.", "In this project, we learned about some foundational concepts in Natural Language Processing such as tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, TF-IDF, as well as various strategies for removing stopwords and visualize the results.", "Your home for data science.
