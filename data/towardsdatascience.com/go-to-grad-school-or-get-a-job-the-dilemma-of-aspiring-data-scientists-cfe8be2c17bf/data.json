I had no idea what I was going to do when May rolled around and I was officially graduated. All I knew was that I wanted to be a data scientist. The way I was going to accomplish that was not even a little clear to me. A lot of people asked me during this time what I was going to do. My default answer was that I was going to attend grad school. It generally seemed to impress the real adults, and did a fine job of covering up my confusion. Fast-forward to the end of May. I walked off of campus for the last time and straight into my new job as a data scientist.", "The decision to take a full time job instead of going to grad school was not an easy one for me. I assume if you are reading this ,you are facing, or will face, this same decision. Let me give you a quick spoiler: This is not an article arguing why you shouldn\u2019t go to graduate school. I do not believe the decision I made is the universally correct decision for everyone. The correct decision for you will depend on your preferences and abilities.", "So if I am not going to tell you which decision to make what is the point of this article? I received a lot of advice while I was trying to make this decision for myself. Most people simply told me which one they thought I should pick. The most useful advice I received though, was from the few people who gave me questions to think about. They helped me come to the correct decision for my circumstances. Based on my experience, I want to share the most useful advice I received to help you make the right decision for you.", "This seems like it should be obvious, but it was something I struggled with for a while. When I took some time to think about what was going to make me happy, I realized I didn\u2019t actually want to go to graduate school. I saw it as a means to a career in data science, which was what I really wanted. Taking the time to think about this helped me realize that graduate school shouldn\u2019t be my first option.", "You need to ask yourself why you are considering graduate school. There are a lot of really good reasons why grad school might be high on the list of things you want. For example, if you really love learning, want to develop more skills, or love doing research, then grad school might be what you want more than a job. You also might be like me and are more interested in a career than any more academics. Once you figure out what you really want, you can start prioritizing your options.", "Once you know what you really want, it\u2019s time to think about what is acceptable to you. For example, I decided that a data science job was my top priority, but doing a masters degree in computer science was also an acceptable alternative. I also decided that I didn\u2019t think a job in analytics or a masters in business would make me happy. I determined which options were acceptable for me and which were not going to be options.", "You need to think about the same thing. You should know what you really want by now. Think about all of the other options that you consider to be good options. I would think about different types of jobs and degrees. You might think about masters degrees vs. a PhD. It might also be the level of school you are interested in attending. In the end though, you should have a list of acceptable outcomes that would make you happy and a list of outcomes that are not acceptable. Now we can take that list of acceptable outcomes and do something with it.", "The only thing that I will say everyone should do is apply to both jobs and graduate schools. At this point, you should have a list of things you could do that would make you happy. Apply to everything you can that fits in this category!", "No matter how perfect of a candidate you are for a job or academic program, there is a chance you will get passed up. No human run process is perfect, and you have to be prepared for the consequences of that.", "You have to be ready to not get your first or second or even third choice, especially if you are shooting for the stars. So make sure that you have options that will make you happy that you will get if you don\u2019t get your first choice.", "I decided that there was only a certain type of job I was interested in. If I couldn\u2019t get the job I wanted, I was more interested in graduate schools to be able to get that job. I ended up applying to 7 jobs and 8 graduate programs. By spreading my net wide, I had plenty of options when the time came to make my decision.", "Hopefully at this point the decision is easy for you. You have received offers and acceptances and now you just have to pick the one you already know is going to make you the happiest. It isn\u2019t always this easy in practice, and analysis paralysis is real. The last piece of advice I have for you is to talk to the people closest to you about what makes you happiest. Whether you end up at graduate school or in a job, make sure you are doing something that makes you happy and is pushing you towards your goals.", "Your home for data science.
