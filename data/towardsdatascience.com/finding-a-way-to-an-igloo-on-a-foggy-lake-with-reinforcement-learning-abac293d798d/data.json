Model-based: Agent makes a prediction based on historical data, takes an action based on prediction.", "2. Value-based or policy-based:a. Value-based: Discounted total reward agent can get from the given state of an environment.b. Policy-based: When an agent has lots of action spaces and with the policy, the interpreter (we) will control the state and action of the agent.", "3. On-policy or off-policy:a. On-policy: Learning happens as a consequence of the actions taken and their effect on the state. b.

Every step is a leap of faith for this actor.", "It is a game of survival and the objective is to reach home. Hence the reward which is \u20181\u2019 is only received once we reach home.
