There are unfathomable amounts of knowledge on the internet, being only a couple of clicks away. When in history can a 17 year old like myself be working on cutting edge technology such as Machine Learning, Brain Machine Interfaces, and more.", "This is the major problem with learning on the internet as it is today. There are so many things you can learn, but a lot of bleeding edge technologies are trapped in research papers. Courses from MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) try to solve this, but there is still a gap between cutting edge technology and digestible content.", "8 Million research papers are published every year", "Damn, that\u2019s a crap ton of content.", "If all of those are read, and it takes about 10 minutes to research what knowledge you need to read those papers, than that\u2019s about 150 YEARS being wasted. We can\u2019t manually create curricula and content for all of these papers.", "We need knowledge trees that outline what prior knowledge you need in order to understand a topic. For example, to understand a paper on Reinforcement Learning applied to human prosthetics. You\u2019ll need to know about Machine Learning and Brain Computer Interfaces beforehand. To learn about Machine Learning, you need to know about Linear Algebra, Python, and more.", "We need a way of generating content from research papers. Most people would prefer a video or other forms of content that are easier to understand. Even better, we could personalize content/curriculum for each user independently.", "We can utilize Machine Learning to both generate Knowledge Trees and Content. For example, if we could make AI figure out what prior knowledge you\u2019d need to understand a topic, we could autonomously generate knowledge trees. Then, content could be generated about that knowledge.", "And here\u2019s the thing, I\u2019ve already started to do this.", "I\u2019ve created a web app which allows users to automatically determine what prior knowledge they need in order to understand a research paper.", "You can test it out here!", "In summary, the application takes the title of a research paper from the user, uses Azure Text Analytics to extract key topics, then finds relevant content to help the user understand those key topics.", "Users can suggest a research paper to be added to the list on the website. A Google Script is used to receive this information.", "My program will use ArXiv\u2019s API in order to get the research paper from their database. BeautifulSoup is used to actually read and parse the research paper, and the data is reorganized for the next step.", "Azure Text Analytics allows us to detect key phrases within the research papers. These key phrases represent the prior knowledge needed in order to understand that research paper.", "Key Phrase Extraction falls under a category of Machine Learning called NLP (Natural Language Processing). NLP aims to enable computers to understand and process human languages. NLP also includes Natural Language Understand and Generation. There are 5 main steps that almost all NLP algorithms contain.", "They\u2019re essentially segmenting a paragraph into sentences, then into single words (aka tokens). This is a pretty simple process.", "Here, we use a Machine Learning (ML) model in order to predict the part-of-speech that each token corresponds to. Whether that\u2019s a proper-noun, adjective, verb, etc.", "A supervised ML model is trained on millions of sentences, with each word\u2019s part-of-speech labelled. It slowly learns how to predict these in new sentences by recognizing patterns.", "This is the process of matching all of the inflections of different words. The word Orange, and Oranges has the same base meaning, but are spelled differently. Lemmatization converts words into their base form.", "are really filler in the English language. But they can create a lot of noise in statistical models due to their high frequency. Therefore, a lot of NLP models filter them out before continuing.", "Alright, so after all of that, we\u2019re ready to continue towards Key Phrase Extraction!", "There are typically two parts to this process.", "This part aims to identify candidates to move forward, and further analyze. There are different ways of identifying potential candidates. The first is a brute force method where all words are considered candidates. However, this would require a lot of unnecessary computational power. To counteract this, we may first use methods such as Identifying Stop Words, or filtering only words with a specific Part of Speech.", "One of the more interesting ways of narrowing down candidates would be identifying certain Part of Speech Patterns. For example, we could only consider nouns following adjectives, that may be joined by a preposition to one other adjective+noun sequence.", "This process determines which Key Phrases are good or bad. There are many different models, including:", "Frequency Statistics \u2014 Based on the assumption that the best key phrases occur more frequently. (Ex. TF-IDF)", "Unsupervised Machine Learning \u2014 Common approach is a graph-based ranking method where the importance of a token is determined by its relatedness to other tokens. (Ex. TextRank)", "Supervised Machine Learning \u2014 Basic models may use Binary Classification, while more complex models would rank Keyphrases, taking the top N. (Ex. A Ranking Approach)", "Now that we have Key Phrases which correspond to required prior knowledge, we can use Wikipedia\u2019s API in order to get brief descriptions of each topic. Here\u2019s what that looks like:", "Finally, with all of the prior knowledge topics, and brief summaries of each, we can visualize this for the user. That looks like this:", "Users can easily select a research paper on the left. A list of key phrases will be filtered on the left, which correspond to prior knowledge for that research paper. Finally, the user can hover over a specific key phrase which will pop-up a tool tip with a brief summary of that key phrase.", "Everything is accessible through the website at Backen.tech.", "This application is still in its early stages. There are many improvements that can be made in the future. Here is a list:", "Currently, the application requires users to submit research papers, which will be updated on the Power BI Dashboard every day. However, this is not very convenient. The application is still very much a Proof of Concept without fixing this problem.", "There is a lot more useful information that can be extracted out of a research paper. Using tools such as sentiment analysis, entity linking, and more. These could all be visualized in a dashboard, for a better understanding of that research paper.", "Ultimately, we\u2019re trying to be able to generate curricula based on research papers. This could be done by creating knowledge trees with Machine Learning, but generating content will be a bit harder.", "A farther out idea could be to create a functionality where research papers could be converted into videos using NLP. Content and curriculum could also be personalized to each user, by discovering trends with other forms of Neural Networks. A startup named Wibbitz is already converting articles into short videos.", "Today, limits are being broken. I can create an application that solves a real world problem using Artificial Intelligence in my bedroom. Tools like Azure, Watson, and more allow people to create Machine Learning solutions without having to train their own models. You should also have a basic understanding of Key Phrase Extraction/NLP, and be inspired by the future potential of AI changing how we learn!", "Passionate about Machine Learning, understanding the
