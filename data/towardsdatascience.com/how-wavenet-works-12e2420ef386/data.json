It was created by researchers at London-based artificial intelligence firm DeepMind, and currently powers Google Assistant voices.", "This blog post accompanies a talk I recently gave at the Global AI Conference in Seattle (April 23\u201325, 2019). It also serves as a distillation of the Jupyter Notebook I used to give my lecture and lab, which can be found on my GitHub, along with supporting data and resources.", "We will primarily explore WaveNet and how it works, but let\u2019s first dive into data prep, current high-performance models (as a baseline, Facebook Prophet), and then compare results!", "We are analyzing AAPL, MSFT, S&P500, and Nasdaq index data from January 2000 to May 2019 from Yahoo Finance; these are in the data folder of the repo.", "Before we turn to the Notebook and our results, we must gain some context on how WaveNet came to be. DeepMind was working on audio sequencing problems, specifically related to learning and emulating human language. Cracking this problem was essential to breaking through the robotic voices we\u2019ve had for years, and having digital assistants sound believably human.", "One area DeepMind looked at for inspiration was Computer Vision and the Convolutional Net architecture. Interestingly, the twin ideas of filtering and convolution work well for images and video, but also for audio applications. In a nutshell, DeepMind\u2019s experiments with this architecture that was labeled \u201cWaveNet\u201d came to enable Google\u2019s sophisticated Assistant voices.", "With cross-functional application of deep nets working so well, researchers wondered if there were other applications to WaveNet, like on sequence or time-series data. Well\u2026 guess what? It worked wonderfully, but required a few tweaks. Let\u2019s dive into those tweaks, and the architecture we need to optimize for sequencial data.", "What we see above is a Gated Activation. Similar to gates in LSTM or GRUs, the tanh branch is an activation filter, or modifier of the dilated convolution that happened just below. It\u2019s the \u201csquashing function\u201d we\u2019ve seen in CNNs before. The sigmoid branch serves essentially as a binary gate, and is able to cancel everything up to it; it learns which data is important, going back an arbitrary number of periods into the past.", "Also note the grey arrows pointing right: these are Skip Connections. They allow a complete bypass of convolution layers, and give raw data the ability to influence the formulation of predictions \u2014 again \u2014 to an arbitrary number of periods into the future. These are hyper-parameters that you can validate on slices of your data; optimal values depend on the structure and complexity of the sequence you want to learn.", "Remember, in fully-connected Neural Networks, a neuron takes inputs from all neurons in the previous layer: early layers influence later ones via a hierarchy of intermediate computations. This allows NNs to build complex interactions of raw inputs/signals.", "But\u2026 what if early raw inputs are directly useful for prediction, and we want them to directly influence the output? In detail, skip connections allow outputs of any layer to bypass multiple future layers and skip influence dilution! Keras allows us to store the tensor output of each convolutional block \u2014 in addition to passing it through further layers \u2014 with skips.append(). Note how for each block in the stack above, the output from the gated activations joins the set of skip connections.", "Residual connections are similar to skip connections: think of them as consistently-available short layer skips! We\u2019ll use a one-layer skip for our model, but it\u2019s also a hyper-parameter. Why they help is mysterious, but it\u2019s most likely due to helping with the Vanishing or Exploding Gradient obstacle in backpropagation. This becomes more important with larger models, but I\u2019ll show you the implementation in a smaller setting for educational purposes.", "As you can see in the Notebook, my results are very good compared to Facebook Prophet:", "There are some tricky trends though, and no easy answers when it comes to stock prediction:", "The overall trend fools WaveNet into a strong regression, as opposed to following local momentum. Alas, no easy money in the markets!!", "However, I have only-lightly hyper-parameter tuned my model, and my training set was quite limited. Can we do better? Let me know what results you get, and how you\u2019ve deployed WaveNet in the comments below!", "Your home for data science.
