While these models have resulted in advances in the field of data science, there are also ethical concerns about their use. See this article in Nature magazine for an overview of the dangers of black-box models and their counterparts, secondary models used to explain them. See the book \u201cInterpretable Machine Learning\u201d by Christoph Molnar for a detailed explanation of model interpretation methods.", "If these interpretation methods are followed, there is less cause for concern of bias. Even still, there are proponents who believe that all black boxes are bad, and others who believe they can be useful when carefully applied. Still others prefer to avoid the term \u201cblack-box\u201d and simply call them more or less interpretable.", "Before getting into the details of what makes a black box a black box, place algorithms inside the machine learning box, and machine learning inside the AI box. Machine learning is the science of approximating quantitative estimates using algorithms. Here is a breakdown of machine learning models that are interpretable versus ones considered to be \u201cblack box.\u201d", "Interpretable models include, Linear Regression and its cousins Logistic Regression and GLM (Generalized Linear Models), Decision Trees, Decision Rules, Rule Fit, Naive Bayes Classifier and K-Nearest Neighbors.", "Less interpretable models can include any algorithm other than the above models, or any model with many transformations applied to it. There are a number of transformations that help improve model performance, but decrease interpretability. These can include basic statistical manipulation such as standardization, normalization, imputation and log transformation as well as more specialized techniques such as sub-sampling, super-sampling, and noise injection. Zhiwen Yu et al found that \u201crandom combination of transformation operators across different dimensions outperforms most of the conventional data transformation operators for different kinds of datasets.\u201d", "Here is a rundown of the usual transformations applied to data. These are just a start. Any mathematical operation that can be applied to a function can potentially be applied to an algorithm, if there is a good reason to do so.", "Log TransformationsThis transformation multiplies the data by its log.", "Min-Max ScalingThis transformation will bring all values between 0 and 1.", "StandardizationThis transformation will change the mean and standard error of the data.", "Mean NormalizationThis transformation will make all the data between -1 and 1, with a mean of 0.", "Unit Vector TransformationThis transformation transposes vectors, which changes its shape from horizontal to vertical, or vice versa.", "Every data set will have a unique application of transformations, depending on the structure of the data itself as well as the target being predicted. Without attempting to opine on a one-size fits all solution, the application of machine learning models is highly nuanced across different applications. A \u201cblack-box\u201d approach may be useful for some situations, and harmful for others. The term \u201cblack-box\u201d is somewhat misleading. The data scientist creating the model should have knowledge of what transformations are being applied and why. The disconnect comes with interpreting the results after creating the model, and whether the process of obtaining the results can be explained to a person without data science knowledge.", "This blog will explore a use case for a black-box model, to debunk the idea that black box models should be avoided at all costs.", "Consider LEED, or Leadership in Environmental and Energy Design. LEED is a green-building rating system that rewards buildings with high environmental performance. Buildings are awarded points based on various features, such as the efficiency of the mechanical system or the quantity of recycled materials. With enough points, buildings can be rated as certified, silver, gold, or platinum. The relative value of all points is published on the web via a checklist, so architects and engineers can design the building to achieve a particular certification level.", "The problem with publicly publishing the checklist is that it becomes easy to game the system. Cheating on LEED certification is a known problem within the industry. Every LEED credit has to be backed up by documentation, characteristic of a trust-less system. For example, the site boundary is used for many calculations. This can be drawn in a certain way to achieve credits that in reality, should not be received. Even worse, a design team may submit documentation saying that a particular system was installed, but then it might be downsized in construction resulting in poorer energy performance. A conflict is occurring because the same system is being used for design and evaluation. Essentially, this is like studying for a test while knowing the answers.", "Continuing with the example of a standardized test, the correct answers of a test are unknown to the person taking the test. Similarly, the exact formula used to calculate a consumer\u2019s credit score is unknown. The company keeps the formula a secret, because if it were known, it would be gamed. The integrity of the system would fall apart under the condition of total transparency. For a person to improve their credit score, qualitative recommendations, such as, \u2018keep low balances on revolving accounts\u2019 is given, or ballpark estimations such as \u2018keep balances below 30% of the limit.\u2019 However, the exact nature of how revolving balances affect the score is unknown.", "What if an architect turned statistician wanted to be able to compare all buildings to one another in quantitative terms. Through industry knowledge of the way the system is gamed, LEED scores are may not be an accurate way to evaluate a building\u2019s environmental performance. Instead, key performance indicators and various other data points can be used. This is exactly the project being undertaken by my startup \u2014 the Building Quality Index (BQI.) The purpose of the BQI is to stop the problem of disposable buildings, where buildings are being built lower and lower quality and demolished in less time than a human life span.", "A comprehensive quality and risk metric is needed \u2014 and it needs to be one that can\u2019t be gamed. For example, an owner might want to know if they should invest money into renovating a building, or if they should buy a new building. Knowing that the risk of future leaks, structural problems, or vulnerability to earthquakes is high, based on a set of data, would be highly useful information. But if the person supplying the data knew what would be considered high risk, they might be tempted to doctor the input so as to receive a favorable outcome.", "For this reason, the insurance industry does not disclose exactly what factors cause it to increase and decrease premiums, and by how much. In a system where gaming is a known problem, or where inaccurate results could cause losses of property or life, using a \u2018black box\u2019 algorithm may be the perfect solution to prevent gaming.", "\u2018Black-box\u2019-ness can be summarized as the cost of high precision. The more finely tuned a model is, the less interpretable and less transparent it will typically be, and the easier it will be to maintain privacy. In addition to the common transformations mentioned above, ensemble methods as well as bagging and boosting will also increase \u2018black-box\u2019-ness, or decrease transparency and interpretability.", "The tradeoff between transparency, privacy and precision is a delicate balance. The diagram below is a starting point for determining whether to prioritize transparency, privacy or precision. Use cases in government, science, social science, and business may have very different priorities. By asking the right questions, data scientists can develop best practices for different types of use cases.", "Your home for data science.
