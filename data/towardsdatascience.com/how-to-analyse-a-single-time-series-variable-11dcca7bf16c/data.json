This is the 2nd post in the column to explore analysing and modeling time series data with Python code. If you are not familiar with the basic statistical concepts, such as estimator, hypothesis testing, and p value, please check out my previous post: Time Series Modeling With Python Code: Fundamental Statistics.", "In this post, we will start to explore analysing a single time series variable. Given a single time series variable, where should we start the analysis? How can we get some insights into the data? To be honest, the first time I was asked to generate insights of a time series data which just came in a .csv file without any further information about the data source and application, I got no idea of where to start. After this post, hopefully, the next time you will have some ideas on how to kick start analysing a single time series variable.", "Here I will analyse the historical Apple stock price data. The .csv file can be downloaded from Yahoo finance. I downloaded the last year AAPL data, ranging from 3/13/2019 to 3/13/2020. The raw data includes daily open, high, low, close, adj close price and volume. In this post, I will analyse the daily close price of AAPL.", "Sample parameters are not constant, and they are also changing with time. A single point sample mean or sample variance won\u2019t reveal much information to us. Without knowing the variance of the sample parameter, we cannot know how well the sample parameter estimates the population parameter. Thus, we cannot rely on the point sample mean or sample variance to estimate the population parameters.", "Instead of calculating a point sample mean and sample variance from the one-year AAPL stock price data, we will apply rolling window method to get multiple sample mean and sample variance values over the one year period. The following code shows how to visualize sample mean with different window size of 10, 30, and 50.", "Similarly, we can visualize sample variance with different window size.", "When choosing the window size, there is always a tradeoff. Take rolling sample mean as an example, we will find that larger window size generates smoother rolling sample mean plot. I like to think about the choice of window size in terms of overfitting and underfitting. A small window size tends to catch more detailed information of each time point, while a large window size includes more overall information of a longer time period. In this way, a small window size may cause overfitting, as it pays too much attention to the movement of each time point. While a large window size may cause underfitting, as it captures too much overall trend but neglects the local movement of each point. Thus, a proper window size should be carefully chosen to avoid overfitting and underfitting.", "In order to use ordinary least squares (OLS) to estimate the generation process, time series data need to stationary and weakly dependent. OLS is a commonly used method in linear regression and will be discussed in detail in the 4th post of this series: Time Series Modeling With Python Code: How To Model Time Series Data With Linear Regression.", "Stationarity has three requirements. The mean and variance of the time series data both are constant. In addition, the covariance of two time points with a lag (h) is a function of the lag, while it should not be dependent on time point (t).", "Weak dependence requires that the correlation of two time points becomes zero when the lag h becomes infinity.", "There are two common time series processes: autoregressive process and moving average process. We will discuss these two processes in detail.", "For autoregressive process, the time series data depends on itself with a time lag. When the time series data only depends on itself with a time lag of 1, the process is called AR(1). If the time series data depends on itself with a time lag of N, then the process is called AR(N).", "Here, take AR(1) as an example. AR(1) process is stationary and weak dependent if two requirements are met: the expected value of the first time point is zero, and the time series is dependent on the previous time point with a multiplying parameter that lies in between -1 and 1.", "In AR(1) process, the value of \u03c1 determines whether the AR(1) process is stationary. The following is a simple visualization of how \u03c1 affects the AR(1) process. From the results, we can tell when \u03c1 is closer to 1, the AR(1) process crosses zero line less frequently.", "MA(1) process is stationary and weak dependent.", "3.3 Autocorrelation Function (ACF) and Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)", "According to the above MA(1) and AR(1) properties, we can write the correlation as follows:", "By plotting the correlation of different time lags, we can clearly see the difference between AR(1) process and MA(1) process. This correlation graph is called autocorrelation function (ACF). The ACF plot of AR process shows exponential decrease, and the correlation decreases to almost zero after serval time points. However, the ACF plot of MA(1) process shows the correlation quickly drops towards zero after the first 2 time points.", "Although ACF plot can be used to differentiate MA and AR process, it cannot well differentiate AR(1) process from AR(2) process. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) can be used to differentiate AR(1) and AR(2) process. As shown in the following example, PACF of AR(1) process shows the correlation quickly drops toward zero after the first 2 time points, while the PACF of AR(2) process shows the correlation drops toward zero after the first 3 time points.", "4.1 Unit Root and Dickey-Fuller Test", "As shown above, when \u03c1 is 1, AR(1) process is non-stationary. The scenario where the \u03c1=1 in AR process is called unit root. The following is a simple proof of why unit root is non-stationary.", "Unit root can be tested with Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test.", "Since the p value is larger than the significance level of 0.05, we cannot reject the null hypothesis that the time series data is non-stationary. Thus, the time series data is non-stationary.", "AR process with unit root is serially correlated. However, serially correlated time series data might not necessarily be AR process with unit root.", "For AR process with unit root, if the first order difference of the time series data is stationary, then the time series data follows I(1) process. Similarly, if the second order difference is required to get stationary data, then the process follows I(2) process. To find out the order of the integration process, a series of ADF need to be tested.", "In this post, we discussed on how to analyse a single time series variable. Typically, we can start the analysis by plotting the rolling mean and variance of the time series data. Then we can use ACF test to see if the time series data follows the autoregressive process or moving average process. If the data follows the autoregressive process, we can then use the PACF test to find the order of the autoregressive process. In addition, we can use a Dickey-Fuller test to find if the time series data follows the integration process.", "In the next post, we will continue to discuss how to analyse multiple time series variables.
