These keep the product leader\u2019s intuition out of the process and even outlaw it. Decision analytic approaches on a Bayesian foundation flip it around and give product leaders a quantitative language for their intuition. The resulting A/B testing approach has a lot more space for critical thinking and transparency of assumptions than before. An open-source tool (Excel, HTML) I\u2019ve built for this purpose helps product leaders build intuition with the math.", "A/B testing has emerged as a discipline for product teams to test small changes iteratively with a small but representative segment of their users. There are excellent courses out there to teach you the nuances of A/B testing. However, most of these courses are aimed at people with a data science orientation. As a product leader, you are looking for ways to drive the decision-making conversation. You have developed a ton of intuition about your users and the product you manage, but the data science teams that support you are \u201cdata-driven,\u201d and don\u2019t make space for your intuition. You, in turn, find yourself being impatient. This is not an academic Ph.D. exercise. You sometimes wonder if your data science team understands that you need to make decisions fast. When you do get the data and start making conclusions, your data science team keeps reminding you that you are overreaching. If these frustrations sound familiar, and you have been beating yourself up for lacking statistical literacy, I might have some good news for you.", "What if it wasn\u2019t statistical literacy that has been letting you down, but the current flavor of statistics itself? What if there were a better flavor that was actually easier to understand, was designed to support decision-making, and made explicit space for your intuition? What if this better flavor would either already be understood and appreciated by your data science teams, or need a little and highly-achievable up-leveling? As it turns out, conventional A/B testing is done with the help of \u201cfrequentist statistics.\u201d This branch of statistics is quite limited in its compatibility with decision-making and entirely incompatible with the notion of bringing your intuition into the math. By outlawing product leaders\u2019 intuitions in the formal experiment, this branch of statistics is actually part of the problem.", "What if it wasn\u2019t statistical literacy that has been letting you down, but the current flavor of statistics itself?", "There are better ways, and the winds of change are already blowing in that direction with Bayesian A/B tests (see here, here, here and here). In this article, I will go one step further and discuss a Decision Analytic approach to A/B testing on a Bayesian foundation. The reason for this is simple. Product leaders have to ultimately make decisions, not get a Ph.D. in data science. I will use my product orientation to design the conversation in a way that allows for direct engagement with your intuition. If you are an engineer like me, intuition arises only when you can tinker with something. So, I will have you touch a pedagogical tool that I\u2019ve built for this purpose: to bring in your product intuition into the math of A/B tests and drive high-quality decision conversations.", "Before we dive in, let\u2019s spend a little time on the core issues with frequentist A/B tests.", "The problem with frequentist A/B testsWithout the distinctions of decision-making, frequentist statistics is forced to create all kinds of unnecessary distinctions (like statistical power). With a Decision Analytic lens, we have access to direct tools to test the robustness of our decisions. This is not new at all. In fact, Bayesian experimentation with a Decision Analytic lens became a solved problem with this paper in 1970. It is the 50th anniversary of that paper this year (2020!), and that is one of my motivations for this article and the tool that accompanies it.", "For those product leaders who were never told about the Bayesian school of statistics, you might be wondering what the fuss is all about. I won\u2019t dive deep into it in this article (because I did so in this paper), but let\u2019s do the quick run through. While much can be said about this, I will focus on the most potent argument. The goal of experiments in statistics is to learn something about a population from a small and hopefully representative subset that we have access to.", "In other words, we want to get a sense of whether our population model is true, given our data is true. The math of frequentist A/B tests answers the exact opposite question: given that the population model is true, is the data true? We have to start with an assumption of a normal distribution in the population and try to make statements about the chance of seeing the effect by chance (someday, someone will explain to me what the chance of seeing something by chance means) given that the normal distribution holds. It\u2019s the wrong problem that is being solved, and I won\u2019t even get into how sloppily it\u2019s being solved. I will just quote item #5 from the American Statistical Association\u2019s historic statement in 2016 nudging statisticians to move to a post-p-value world:", "A p-value, or statistical significance, does not measure the size of an effect or the importance of a result.", "Then, there is the mother of all comebacks from those smart statisticians who have learned both frequentist and Bayesian methods, \u201cOh, it doesn\u2019t really matter which approach you take if there is enough data.\u201d This is a dangerous argument to make, because, while technically correct, it gives us a bypass from thinking deeply about what we are learning and how we are learning. We will engage with this critique formally a little later in this article. For now, I will note that critical thinking is an important responsibility of a product leader, and we must strive to find ways of bringing the best gifts of data science and product management together.", "Learning with intuitionI am going to do something strange for an article on Bayesian statistics. I won\u2019t throw any math equations at you. Instead, I am going to use simple distinctions that I believe are easy to follow, and let you develop your own intuition using this open-source pedagogical tool (Excel, HTML) built for this purpose. As an aside, the HTML tool uses FISH architecture, which means it is a single HTML file that you can safely download into your computer, and it won\u2019t transmit any data anywhere. Using this tool, you can follow along and make your own mind about my claim that this is pretty straightforward to understand.", "For our A/B test, let\u2019s start with some setup. We want to get a sense of whether increasing the button size of our call to action button on our home page increases clicks on the button. Let\u2019s assume that our unit of diversion for the experiment is \u201cusers\u201d, which implies a user will only be in the experimental or the control group, but not both. We will model our experiment as independent coin tosses, where each coin toss represents a pageview by a specific user. The pageview is of a page that has a button that we want the user the click. If the user clicks on the button, that corresponds to our model saying the coin toss landed \u201cheads.\u201d", "The model assumes that coin tosses are \u201cindependent\u201d of each other. In your experiment, you will want to make sure that you are not counting multiple pageviews of the same page for the same user. There is generally excellent advice on designing good A/B tests that you will want to heed, and I won\u2019t get any further into that. The key metric of interest for us is the long-run fraction of heads, which we can interpret as the long-run fraction of button clicks.", "Note that this has been carefully defined so as not to be a probability. This is important because, very soon, we are going to express how uncertain we are about this distinction. You can only express uncertainty on things that have no inherent uncertainty in them. To understand this, consider the probability of rain. If there is any uncertainty on what rain means, putting a further probability on a distinction that is unclear is meaningless. For the probability of rain to make sense, you and I would have to agree on a precise definition of rain that has no trace of uncertainty in it.", "You can only express uncertainty on things that have no inherent uncertainty in their definition.", "Decision Analysis has a wonderful concept that helps us keep our thinking straight around this. It is called a clarity test. A distinction passes the clarity test if a clairvoyant can tell us how that distinction will resolve in the future. A clairvoyant is defined as someone (imaginary) who can only state facts about the future but can make no judgments whatsoever. For instance, a clairvoyant cannot tell you if your model is right, because a model lives in your head, and not in the world of facts. Only if a distinction passes the clarity test can we place a probability on it. We cannot place a probability on the probability of heads. But we can place a probability on the long-run fraction of heads, as the clairvoyant can tell us precisely how many heads occurred in the long-run (we\u2019d have to agree how long is long-run of course), and therefore, give us the long-run fraction. I will leave as an exercise for the reader to figure out if statements like the \u201cprobability of a hypothesis being right\u201d pass the clarity test. We won\u2019t be needing such statements here.", "A clairvoyant cannot tell you if your model is right, because a model lives in your head, and not in the world of facts.", "You will note from the screenshot above that there are also decision-analytic elements in here. Specifically, we are assessing the value of each click. Product leaders tend to have a sense of this, so I won\u2019t go into this deeper here. For our example, we will assume it is $1. We are also assessing the ultimate launch audience size (set at 1 million here), provided we decide to launch the feature, along with the cost of such a launch (set at $20,000). We will use this information later to guide our decision analytics.", "Ok, so what does this word \u201cprior\u201d mean? The nice thing about Bayesian distinctions is that they are consistent with the English meaning of the term. Prior refers to your state of knowledge before the experiment. We humans learn based on what we know. If we don\u2019t know anything at all, we learn a lot from data. If we know something very thoroughly, we would need to see a ton of disconfirming evidence before we are open to changing our minds. These sensible logical approaches to learning are incompatible with statistical hypothesis testing. In contrast, they are the starting point for a Bayesian approach. We have to engage with what we know about the distinctions of interest.", "Engaging with what we know is not just an exercise in reflection. We are also making a modeling decision here and expressing our uncertainty in a specific form that represents how we feel. Remember that promise about being able to capture your intuition in the math? That is what we are talking about here. If alarm bells are going off for you now, there is a good reason for it. We have all been fed the diet of objectivity for the sake of science, but dig a little deeper, and the greatest epistemologists will break the bad news to you, \u201cscience is subjective.\u201d The issue isn\u2019t subjectivity, but the lack of rigor and transparency in how we engage with subjectivity. I\u2019d much rather we use language that stops the pretense of objectivity and get comfortable exposing our assumptions. That way, we can build a culture of learning as opposed to getting waylaid by assumptions we didn\u2019t know were being made.", "When you expand the \u201cBuild Prior\u201d section in the tool, you will be presented with three options. The first is the uninformed prior, which corresponds to a belief like so: \u201cI know nothing whatsoever about the distinction of interest.\u201d At first glance, some will claim this is the proper scientific position to take. At second glance, it doesn\u2019t make sense when you *know* that good button click rates rarely touch 10%. If it goes above 20%, product leaders are not thinking, \u201cawesome!\u201d Instead, they are thinking, \u201csomething went wrong with the experiment, and let\u2019s find out what.\u201d We will leave aside, for now, the argument that if you have a ton of data, the prior won\u2019t matter.", "The second option is the symmetric prior, which corresponds to: \u201cI have a sense that the user click rate is going to average 50% and it is equally likely to be above and below that in a symmetric way.\u201d That\u2019s a very specific and strong belief that looks very strange given our critique to the uniform prior above.", "Finally, that leaves the third option of the asymmetric prior. You may have noticed that I am nudging you toward getting comfortable expressing yourself with this option. If science is about finding your truth in the most rigorous way possible, and if this distribution allows you to express that truth rigorously, then I will claim this is the best scientific choice to make. Just declare it so others can challenge you if they so wish, with their own priors. Mathematically, all of these choices map onto specific shape parameters for the Beta distribution. The Beta is a flexible distribution that has another important property. It is easy to update when we combine it with Bernoulli trials (which coin tosses are) by incrementing its shape parameters. We won\u2019t be getting any deeper into the math of the Beta distribution in the rest of this article.", "As you scroll down from your choice, you will see some shaping options, like so:", "The above example allows you to express your belief that on average, you think you will achieve an impressive click-rate of 10%. The thickness of the distribution represents how sure you are about this. While the technical way to set this is with the variance, I am introducing a distinction called \u201cPrior Scale Power\u201d to make this more intuitive. The prior scale power is a number that is multiplied to the shape parameters of the distribution, impacting the variance but not the mean. You can see how the variance drops as you drag the scale power to the right, while the mean remains the same.", "Let\u2019s think of this intuitively. Your prior is a way of equating your intuition with data. If you start off with a 1-in-10 prior like we have here, you are saying your intuition is equivalent to seeing 1-head-in-10 tosses. Then, if you set the scale power to 10, you are now saying your intuition is equivalent to 10 heads in 100 tosses. While this preserves the mean at 0.1, the variance reduces because the number of tosses is higher and you should rightfully be a little less uncertain. As you get more and more sure by increasing the prior scale power, you are reducing your zone of uncertainty. Practically, look at how the table showing you the percentiles from the distribution changes (this is our Bayesian 80% confidence interval). They start at (0.012 \u2014 0.074 \u2014 0.226) when scale power is 1, and end at (0.088\u20130.1\u20130.112) when scale power is 100. Basically, the range gets tighter as the variance drops.", "Let\u2019s say we are comfortable with the prior mean being 0.1, and the scale power at 2, which is equivalent to having seen 2 out of 20 tosses. This allows us to express our knowledge while leaving enough room for uncertainty. We can now move on to building our prior for the control. In a similar fashion, let\u2019s say we believe that it is half as likely to yield button clicks, and we can pick 0.05 as the prior mean, with a scale power of 2. This prior is equivalent to having seen 1 out of 20 tosses. We are now ready to move on to the next stage and learn from our experiments.", "After setting up the priors, you will want to put to good use all the learning that\u2019s out there to design good experiments, either from the courses you have taken or from the guidance of your data science team. You have collected your data in the experiment and the control. You are now ready to learn. Open up the \u201cLearn from Experiment\u201d section in the tool and enter the number tosses (number of pageviews) and the number of heads (number of clicks) in the experiment and the control. In our hypothetical example, let\u2019s say we end up with 400 clicks out of 10,000 pageviews in the experimental group, and 300 clicks out of 10,000 pageviews in the control group. Initially, this makes the posterior distribution look rather narrow.", "I will introduce another distinction here, \u201cPosterior scale power,\u201d which works analogously to \u201cPrior scale power.\u201d We will divide the data (number of tosses and number of heads) by this power. This operation allows us to express how much we want to be influenced by the data. If we leave this at 1, then we take the full data at face value. If we increase it, we start to lower the power of the data we are seeing. Intuitively speaking, a posterior scale power of 100 means you will count a 100 clicks (and a 100 pageviews) as 1. You are setting the scale at which you want to be learning from your data. With this distinction, you are able to raise the bar for being really sure. This is how we tackle the critique that priors don\u2019t really matter if we have \u201cenough\u201d data. With a high-enough posterior scale power, it will matter.", "While there is a strong temptation to ask, \u201cwhere should we set the bar for posterior scale power,\u201d a better to question to ask is: how will our decision change based on the posterior scale power? Note the lines below the table in the picture above. They report on value metrics that help us arrive at a decision. This model has a simple value model \u2014 where we multiply the mean of the long-run fraction of clicks (which would also be our probability that the next person would click) with the number of users who will get the launched feature and the value of each click. Even with this level of simplicity, we can see that initially, when the data is taken at full power, we shouldn\u2019t launch as the cost outweighs the benefit. However, if we scale down the data a little and retain more uncertainty (by increasing the posterior scale power), that uncertainty allows for higher click rates, and hence, the value rises. At a posterior scale power of 251, there is a crossover in our decision, as shown in the sensitivity chart below (in the Sensitivity section of the tool).", "What this sensitivity analysis is telling us is that our decision to launch is pretty robust to our skepticism about the data, but would change if we took the data at face value. Why is this the case? It has to do with our prior beliefs. Remember, we started off with a belief that the experiment would be twice as good as the control. To see that belief in action, let\u2019s zero out the experiment altogether (enter 0\u2019s for all four inputs in the \u201cLearn from Experiment\u201d section). This will immediately reveal that if you were not to do the experiment at all, you should just launch.", "You can also do the opposite sensitivity analysis. Let\u2019s be really skeptical about the data, and pick a posterior power scale of 400. This means you will treat every 400 clicks (and pageviews) as 1 click (and pageview). Let\u2019s find out how many heads we need to see in the control to change our minds. The analysis below shows clearly that if we see 414 clicks or more, we should change our mind and reconsider the launch.", "Notice how this decision-analytic layer is so much more useful than notions of \u201cstatistical power\u201d as it gets us pretty directly into the decision-making conversation.", "Finally, let\u2019s see what changing our prior does to the analysis. Let\u2019s go back and select the uninformed prior for both the experiment and the control groups. We will find that we should not launch at all for just about any scale power. This is shown by the sensitivity analysis below.", "The symmetric prior tells a similar story as well. There are not enough clicks in the experimental group to justify a launch.", "Thus, we can see that a Decision Analytic A/B test allows us to incorporate prior intuition and make decisions that work with and not against our intuition. The beauty of this approach is that there is absolutely no value in exaggeration. If we are unnecessarily optimistic in our prior, or overly pessimistic in it, our decisions will accordingly be biased. This mathematical approach sets us up to tell the whole truth about our intuition and learn accordingly. As a product leader, I hope you will appreciate that this opens up a new vista of collaboration with your data science teammates. The math allows for them to learn from your intuition, and for you to make transparent your thinking. Your subjectivity is not outlawed; rather, this process allows a rigorous engagement with what you feel so you and others can learn from each other and make better decisions.", "I suspect that existing software systems for A/B testing will find it hard to support this shift philosophically, and that that this will take some time. This is not about just implementing new equations. It is about facilitating transparent and powerful conversations. Hopefully, the open-source tool referred to in this article allows you to at least try the inference and decision-making discussed in this article until your system catches up with this kind of thinking.", "My gratitude to Prof. Ronald A. Howard at Stanford University for cracking this problem so decisively in 1970, to Prof. Thomas Ferguson at UCLA for open sourcing his incomplete beta function and log gamma implementation (that\u2019s what my tool uses to produce the confidence intervals), and he credits Cecil Hastings for his 1955 book where the normal approximation appears.
