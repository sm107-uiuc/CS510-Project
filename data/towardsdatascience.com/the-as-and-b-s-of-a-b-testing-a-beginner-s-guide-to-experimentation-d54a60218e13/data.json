It offers a high-level understanding of what a typical A/B test entails before diving into specifics of each stage in the process of experimentation. Needless to say, it was a great learning experience! In this post, I am going to summarize my key learning from the course and explain how it benefits a lot of companies which are focused on improving user experience.", "A/B testing is a method of experimentation to understand how user experiences change following any changes/variations made in the way they interact with a website, a mobile app etc. It is a very popular method to understand the level of existing customer experience and improve it based on certain relevant metrics.", "Possible changes that companies may bring about are changing the layout of the website, changing the appearance/position of certain buttons on a particular webpage, change the ranking of options on the website etc. A/B testing helps the companies to evaluate whether these changes would be successful or not post-launch. This done by testing these changes on a subset of viewers for a certain period of time.", "Evaluation takes place on the basis of select metrics.", "a. Sums and Counts. Eg. The number of users who visited the website", "b. Means, Medians and Percentiles. Eg. The average number of users who enrolled in an online course after creating an account.", "c. Probability. Eg. Click Through Probability", "d. Ratios. Eg. (Number of revenue-generating clicks) / Total number of clicks", "Additionally, it is worth mentioning that these metrics should be evaluated over a fixed time interval say over a week, over a month or over a year. As the A/B tests are usually time-bound exercises, it is paramount to decide on a timeline to observe results of experimentation, in advance.", "How would you measure the rate of users returning to enroll in the second online course or measure average happiness of shoppers on online shopping portal or measure the probability of finding information via a search on search engines? In such situations, it is a good idea to come up with proxy metrics! They can be of the following types.", "It is also critical that the metric chosen are sensitive to the changes that you want to see but also robust to the changes that you don\u2019t want to see. In other words, the metrics should be robust to slight variations that may occur during the course of experimentation yet be able to capture all the changes that matter the most.", "To reduce the size of an experiment, it is often advisable to increase the significance level (alpha) or reduce the power (1-beta) so that less number of the sample would need to be tested.", "Other important things to keep in mind:", "During A/B testing, the significance level is fixed at 0.50 and power (1-beta) is set to 0.80. While these are important values, it is important to understand what constitutes as statistically significant change may not be a practically significant change! Business needs have to be identified and ROI has to calculate if the change has to be actually rolled out. Is the roll-out worth the efforts? Is business impact greater if we decide to launch the change? While we make these critical decisions, it may be worthwhile to consider opportunity costs, engineering and roll-out costs that may be involved if we go ahead with the change.", "If you used one single metric, yet it yielded muddy results then break down the experiment into different segments. Check the results on different platforms (web and mobile). Check it across different periods of time (days, weeks, months, years etc.)", "If nothing explains the weird results, then possibly the setup of your experiment is incorrect or your experiment is suffering from Simpson\u2019s paradox. This is a phenomenon when a trend appears in different groups of data but it disappears when the different groups are combined and looked at holistically.", "When many metrics are involved, more often than not the significant result may show by way of chance! The ways to solve this are:", "i. Bootstrap: Divide the test samples into further more sample and experiment on each such sub-divided samples. The significant result will disappear if it appeared by chance in the first place.", "ii. Bonferroni correction: Divide the significance level 0.50 by the number of tests run. Then check the statistical significance of your tests as against this adjusted level of significance.", "iii. Control Family-wise Error Rate (FWER): Adjust the probability that any metric will show false positives.", "iv. Control False Discovery Rate (FDR): Fix an acceptable rate of false positives generated by any metric in the experiment. Say you decide 0.05 as FDR then this means that out of 100 samples, you are ready to accept 5 false positives per test.", "Dive deeper! It is often possible that the metric may not always behave or yield results as you would expect them to. In such cases, it is useful to have an Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) that can balance the results of all metrics without losing the sight of the business needs. One is highly susceptible of getting entangled in the individual metric performance mess and hence it is important to guard against this!", "If everything went well so far in your experiment and you got the much coveted significant result then you need to introspect following few things:", "I cannot emphasize more the practical relevance of launching a change from the business perspective! Is it worth it after all?", "Thanks for reading and happy A/B testing! :)", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
