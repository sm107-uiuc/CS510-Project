In addition to giving you an understanding of how ML algorithms work, it will also provide you Python examples so you can use them to build your own ML models.", "If you are only beginning your data science journey, then linear regression is the best place to start. It is a relatively simple algorithm that can be intuitively understood by everyone. I also provide graphs in this story that will help you to visualize it.", "The term \u201cMachine Learning\u201d is quite generic as it covers a huge number of algorithms. Hence, the first step is to find out which type of algorithms linear regression belongs to. Knowing that will give you a good idea of what problems you can use it for.", "Side note, I have put Neural Networks in a category of their own due to their unique approach to Machine Learning. However, they can be used to solve a wide range of problems, including but not limited to classification and regression. The below chart is interactive so make sure to click\ud83d\udc47 on different categories to enlarge and reveal more.", "If you enjoy Data Science and Machine Learning, please subscribe to get an email whenever I publish a new story.", "Linear regression is part of the supervised learning family, which means that the algorithm is trained using labeled data points. This is opposed to unsupervised techniques where algorithms use unlabeled data.", "Supervised learning algorithms aim to model a relationship between one or multiple inputs (independent variables) and the output (dependent variable, a.k.a. target variable). For example, identifying the relationship between the size (sq.ft.) of the apartment and its market value.", "Note, supervised learning is further split into classification and regression where:", "You can see how knowing your algorithm's category enables you to identify what problems you can use it for. In simple terms, any problem with the output being a numerical value can use linear regression.", "In addition to the apartment value prediction mentioned above, here are several other examples:", "Linear regression models are often fitted using the least-squares approach. This requires finding the values of the parameters described in a linear equation of the \u2018best-fit line,\u2019 which is achieved by minimizing the sum of squared residuals.", "While this may sound complicated, the logic behind it is quite simple. Instead of describing it with maths equations, let us look at the below chart. Black dots are the observations, the red line is the best-fit line, and the thin green lines are the residuals.", "The linear regression algorithm's goal is to find a line (in this case, the red line) that has as many observations as close to the line as possible. This is what minimizing the sum of squared residuals is.", "Since the above example is for a simple linear regression (only 1 input variable), the best-fit line would have the following equation y=ax+b, where y is the output (dependent) variable, x is the input (independent) variable, and a and b are the parameters known as slope and intercept.", "Note, linear regression is not limited to using only 1 input variable. In fact, you can use as many input variables as you like. This is known as multiple linear regression, and I will give you an example of it in the Python section below.", "The two examples in this section are:", "Also, both examples use the following:", "First, let us import the required libraries.", "For this model, we will take \u2018X3 distance to the nearest MRT station\u2019 as our input (independent) variable and \u2018Y house price of unit area\u2019 as our output (dependent, a.k.a. target) variable. Hence, the goal is to use the values of X3 to predict the value of Y.", "First, let us create a scatter plot so we can see how these values are distributed.", "As you can see, there is a noticeable relationship between the two variables. As the distance from the nearest MRT station increases, the price tends to decrease.", "We will now run a simple linear regression model to find the best-fit line, which we can use to make predictions of price based on the distance to MRT.", "Now we can draw a best-fit line on the scatter plot.", "As you can see, we now have a best-fit line for our model, which can predict a house price based on its distance from the MRT station. To get the prediction values, you can either use the predict() method or manually plug in a value of x into the line equation (y = -0.00726205*x + 45.85142705777498).", "One additional observation from a chart above that you might have already spotted that highlights one of the limitations of linear regression. If we were to put an X value larger than 6,313, we would get a negative price, which is not realistic. A non-linear regression model could help us avoid this problem, but that is a topic for a future story.", "For this example, we will use the same data but add one more independent variable \u2014 \u2018X2 house age\u2019. As before, let us first visualize the data. This time with a Plotly scatter 3D chart.", "You can see from the above chart that the relationship also exists between the house age and price. This is great news as it will enable our model to give more accurate predictions. So, let\u2019s fit the model.", "The modeling here is done, but let us do a bit more work to plot the prediction plane onto our 3D graph. We will need to create a mesh with a range of input values and predict output values. This will give us the data for our plot.", "In the previous example, having one input variable gave us a 1D straight line \u2014 our prediction (regression) line.", "Meanwhile, two input variables give us a 2D flat surface \u2014 a prediction plane. You can go up in dimensions by adding many more input variables to your model, which will work just fine, but you will not be able to draw a graph to visualize it.", "To summarize, our final model is an improved one as it uses a combination of two variables to predict the house price. Try to practice by adding more input variables to see how good you can get your model.", "I hope you now have a clear understanding of how linear regression works, and you are keen to build your own prediction models.", "I will continue the series with more stories about other Machine learning algorithms.
