Entertainment couldn\u2019t be any different from the rest. Netflix had its all-time peak; people use Zoom for partying and news outlets are recommending quarantine Spotify playlists. The quarantine playlists coverage is not a coincidence. I have contributed to a couple of them and spotted dozens on my social media stream. People are making a lot of Coronavirus themed playlists. All that made me curious. What are we listening to during the Coronavirus times?", "I decided to collect data from Spotify playlists containing terms related to the pandemic and analyze them. I wanted to discover the frequency of the top songs and compare their musical features to what we listened to before the quarantine.", "Thankfully, Spotify has a useful API. Here, I am going to describe the process to collect the data and then embed the code.", "Firstly, we are going to use the API to collect all the playlists that contain the terms we want. I searched for four terms, trying to be as inclusive as possible. The terms I used to collect the data are \u201cCOVID\u201d, \u201ccorona\u201d, \u201cQuarantine 2020\u201d and \u201cCoronavirus\u201d. The search returned 7940, 9322, 9383 and 2830 results, respectively. But the first problem emerged here. We can only get two thousand results per search with Spotify API.", "The bad news is we would only get some of the data because of the limitation. So, everything we discuss will be about a sample of the data.The good news is that the prior numbers are overlapping so the true unique total number is not that high, and the sample will be adequate.After four requests we get 7085 unique playlists.", "Let\u2019s look at the playlists. On average a playlist has 103 songs and a highly creative name. Ok, maybe the last one is not exactly scientifically proven.The biggest playlist contains 8846 songs, and zeros chances someone would listen to all of them, the shortest playlist includes 3 songs.", "Now we want to use the API to collect data about the playlists. We would like to get the songs they include and data about the song.", "After running the code, we discover that the playlists contain 725,824 tracks and 275,316 unique songs. That\u2019s a lot of songs and most of them are in a couple of playlists only, indicating that they are irrelevant to the situation. I wanted to add a filter for the data that I am going to further analyze. I decided a good first filter would be for a song to be at least in 10 playlists; this gave me around 10K songs, so I only gathered metadata for these songs. The metadata were mainly audio features.", "I want to explain some key audio features, we will need to understand for later.", "More about them in the documentation of the API.", "The script to get the above data", "Now let\u2019s play with our data.", "Here is a table of the top 100 songs. From their names, it is clear for most of them why they are in this playlist.", "But let\u2019s get deeper on the Top 10K songs dataset. The most appearances of a song are 1091 and the least 10, due to the filter imposed.On average there are 29 appearances and 75% of the songs have less appearances than that. This means that the other 25% includes much bigger values. The histogram bellow can explain it better.", "We have the oldest song being released in 1954 and the newest in 2020. The most songs are from the last decade but that does not mean they are the most popular in our playlists as we can see in the histograms below.", "A further analysis we could do is to compare the audio features of them with some baseline. I decided to use for baselining the Top Tracks Of 2019 playlist. It is a small sample of what we listened to before the crisis.", "I used box plots to compare the main audio features of three datasets, the Top 2019, the top 100 songs of our data and the top 10k songs of our data.", "The Top 10K dataset is massive and too broad, the last songs are only in 10 playlists from the 7k so it\u2019s logical to have a wider range of values and be less informative.", "The valence is bigger in our data, so it seems like we listen to more positive songs.", "The danceability is slightly lower, something that shouldn\u2019t surprise us, dancing and social distancing don\u2019t go together very well.", "Tempo seems to be independent of the dataset.", "Speechiness is another metric that in our data is a little lower. I have a feeling that this happens because recently (2019 included) we have a lot of hip hop/ rap hits versus our data that also include data also from the previous decades and more diverse music genres.", "Loudness, like tempo, does not appear to change.", "Our data have lower acousticness and slightly higher energy, we may be in lockdown, but we try not to be down!", "Both the analysis of frequency of the songs and of the audio features lead to the discovery of some very intriguing patterns... It seems like we use music to help us be positive while experiencing a remarkably difficult experience.", "The project could have more features. The first thing I can think is to do some NLP on the titles and the descriptions of the playlists. Feel free to suggest more ideas on the comments or even do an article about them and post the link there.", "Thank you for being interested in my piece. I hope you enjoyed the article and learned something new.", "Your home for data science.
