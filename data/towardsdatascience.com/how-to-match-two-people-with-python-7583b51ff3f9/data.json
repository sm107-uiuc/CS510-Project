You are a new team leader of 8 talented employees. You want to split them into 4 pairs to work on 4 different projects. As an experienced leader, you know employees are the most productive when working with somebody they like. So you come up with a rating system for paring employees. The scales run from 1 to 10, with a 10 rating meaning the employee really likes the other employee and a 1 rating meaning the employer does not want to work with the other employee at all. After conducting the survey, you get this result:", "Since the employees cannot rate themselves, the diagonal elements are zeros. The good news is that you know how much each employer like the others. The bad news is that you don\u2019t know how to match them so that everybody is happy with their teammate! As data enthusiastic, you know that there must be some way you could solve this with data. And you are right.", "This problem could easily be solved with mathematical programming. While machine learning is great in learning from data and making predictions, it has a limitation in making the optimal decision. When your problems involve multiple constraints and allow for many possible solutions, only mathematical programming has the power to find the optimal solution.", "Let\u2019s find out how to match your employees with mathematical programming!", "If you are not familiar with PuLP, it is a python library that enables you to solve optimization problems. You could find the documentary about this library here. I will use this handy package to formulate and solve our problem.", "In LpProblem method, the first parameter is the name of the problem while the second parameter is your objective (maximize or minimize)", "There are 8 employees that you want to match. The NumPy array is a preference matrix of 8 employees shown in the introduction.", "Use LpVariables to create variable y, a decision variable to determine whether or not to match employee i with employee j.", "Maximize the preference scores between employee i and j", "After defining the parameters, variables, objective function, and constraints, we are ready to solve the problem with one line of code!", "Before using this result to match your employees, let\u2019s take a careful look at the results to see if they are reasonable. Remember, the objective is to maximize the preference of both sides in a pair, not just one individual.", "There are still some limitations to the result: Some people do not have their teammate as their top choice or even hate their teammate. But overall, the algorithm does a good job of splitting them into pairs so that the matching scores of the whole group are maximized. And better yet, you don\u2019t need to deal with the headache of making an optimal decision because the algorithm has done that for you!", "The notebook for this article can be found in my Github repository. If you are wondering how to group your employees, or friends into pairs, I encourage you to create a small survey of preference scores and try out this algorithm. Maybe maximizing the preference would create a productive working environment?", "Feel free to fork and play with the code for this article in this Github repo.", "I like to write about basic data science concepts and play with different algorithms and data science tools.
