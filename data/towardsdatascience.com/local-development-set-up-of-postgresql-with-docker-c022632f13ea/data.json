After that, I will show you how to connect to the database instance using the pgAdmin portal to run your queries. You can use this as a simple setup for development purposes with SQL, as part of your application or simply to practice your SQL skills.", "I will be using Docker (version 19.03.8), so make sure you have it installed on your machine.", "What we will do here is to first download the PostgreSQL image, check that the image is ready and finally run the image with specific parameters.", "You can download the Docker official image for Postgres from the docker hub repository by running the following in your command line.", "You can find the documentation of the image here: PostgreSQL Image Documentation.", "After downloading the image you can check that is available to use:", "We will create a local folder and mount it as a data volume for our running container to store all the database files in a known location for you.

You will use it to manage the DB instance as well as to run your queries against the tables of it.", "You will be using this docker image to deploy it in a container.

The next step is to connect from the pgAdmin console to the PostgreSQL instance.", "We haven\u2019t defined any network for these containers so they should be running on the default one, and if you try to access the database or the web portal through their ports, connecting via \u2018localhost\u2019 or \u2018127.0.0.1\u2019 would work just fine; but if you try connecting from one container to the other, you might encounter some connectivity issues.", "We will need to look for the IP address of the PostgreSQL container on our host, you can run this command for it:", "docker inspect return low-level information of Docker objects, in this case, the \u2018dev-postgres\u2019 instance\u2019s IP Adress.

At this moment you are ready to start building your databases and tables, uploading data and querying for your analysis or applications.", "Let\u2019s recap on what we have done so far:", "You should be ready to start developing your databases, tables and queries on pgAdmin directly to your PostgreSQL. You can use the UI to import files directly to the tables.", "Something else that you can do here is to connect to this database from a Python application on your local and then load the results to this Postgres database and query the tables using either python or the pgAdmin tool. It is up to you how you use this stack, the good thing is that you don\u2019t need to wait for an infra guy to give you access to a database to start working on your main objective, which is your analysis, app, feature or simply SQL training (even for your next technical interview assignment).", "You can also do all this setup using a Docker-compose file, where you define the PostgreSQL service and pgAdmin service along with the environment variables, volume and port mapping and run docker-compose up. The results should be the same.", "I hope this article provided you with enough information about how to set up an SQL instance on your computer with Docker to directly work with databases, tables and queries.
