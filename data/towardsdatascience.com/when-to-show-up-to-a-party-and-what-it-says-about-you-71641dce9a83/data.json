Being \u201cfashionably late\u201d conflicts with the core of my being.", "Yet I have been to enough parties to realize that punctuality is not always appreciated. I remember going to a party thrown by a friend of a friend. The Facebook invite had a 9 PM start time. My friends and I showed up at 9:05 PM.", "We were the only ones there.", "One of the hosts, not even completely dressed, said she didn\u2019t expect anyone this early. I was confused, weren\u2019t we on time?", "So if being on time is a faux-paus, what is the right time to show up? Like many questions I face in life, I turned to the internet. I conducted an online survey to determine the ideal time to show up to a party. Afterwards, I also interviewed my more socially adept friends to figure out what different party arrival times says about you.", "I recruited 71 people and presented them with three parties:", "For each hypothetical party, I asked participants three questions:", "Over 50% of people wanted guests to arrive on time to 15 minutes late.This was especially true for smaller parties: 68% of people said that that was ideal time frame to show up.", "For larger parties, close to a third of people wanted guests to arrive more than 15 minutes later than the official start time. So if you\u2019re a punctual person, get in another episode of The Office in before leaving for your shindig.", "More than 50% of people were okay with guests arriving earlier than the official start time for all three parties. However, don\u2019t arrive too early. Few people found it acceptable for guests to arrive more than 15 minutes early. If you\u2019re in danger showing up prematurely, take some extra laps around the neighborhood before knocking on the door.", "People varied in how late they found it acceptable for guests to show up.", "For smaller parties, 78% of people said that guests shouldn\u2019t arrive more than an hour late. For larger parties, 75% of people were okay with guests arriving up to 1.5 hours late. 7% of people also fell in the \u201cI don\u2019t give a F&CK\u201d category and didn\u2019t care when guests showed up.", "I thought that the party start time would affect people\u2019s expectations about when guests should arrive. I was wrong. The data suggests that regardless if the party starts at 8PM or 10PM, you should still arrive on time or slightly late.", "Party size had the bigger effect on expectations for timeliness \u2014 the smaller the party, the more on time you should be.", "The data told me when to show up to a party. But what do people actually think when you arrive to a party 30 minutes early or 2 hours late? I recruited some of my more socially-adept friends (read: the cool kids in high-school) and interviewed them about party arrival times. What I discovered is that when you show up to a party says a lot about you \u2014 your personality, your relationship to the host, and your goals for the night.", "If you show up early, you are undoubtedly the first one to arrive. You probably caught the host in the middle of setting up or getting dressed. Expect a few comments about \u201cnot expecting anyone this early.\u201d", "If you are best friends with the host, all is forgiven. You may have even been expected. Your presence means you can help the host set-up or better yet, pregame.", "If you are 2), consider this your awakening. Hopefully the data has convinced you that those exclamations of \u201cYou\u2019re Early!\u201d were not because the host was excited to see you.", "Most likely you are 3). You weren\u2019t sure how long it would take to get to the party so you arrived earlier than anticipated. Rather than circle the block a few times, you decided to just ring the doorbell \u2014 what\u2019s the worst that could happen? As you take in the look of confusion and judgement across your host\u2019s face, you immediately regret your decision. Next time you arrive early, you\u2019ll just patiently wait in your car like a normal person.", "You\u2019re likely still the first person to arrive unless there\u2019s that odd guy who showed up early. I mean who does that, even you have more social tact than that.", "Depending on how prepared your host is, one of two emotions is crossing their mind. If they\u2019re set up, they\u2019re relieved that people have actually come to the party. You\u2019ll also make the party look more popular for when other guests show up.", "If your host is still setting up, they\u2019re cursing your existence. They know the invite technically said 9 PM, but who actually shows up at 9 PM? Now they have to continue getting ready while feeling obligated to make small talk.", "So why did you show up on time? You are either\u2026", "One option is that you like being on time. Your college nickname was \u201cPunctual\u201d. You have a stopwatch tattooed on your wrist. The Facebook invite said 10 PM so doggone it, you\u2019re going to show up at 10 PM.", "The other option is that this party is the pinnacle of your night. There are only so many True Detective episodes you can watch in one day. Literally \u2014 there are only two seasons right now and you\u2019ve watched them all today. So you arrive on time because you would rather do anything else than spend another more minute at your place.", "People are starting to trickle in and everyone is standing in a large circle. You can actually hear other people speak.", "Maybe you prefer chatting in smaller groups but don\u2019t want to make one-on-one small talk with the host. Arriving relatively early is a good strategy if you don\u2019t know many people at the party. While the party is small, you can actually meet everyone there. As people trickle in, people will also gravitate toward the social circle you\u2019re in and introduce themselves to you.", "Showing up at this time can also mean this party isn\u2019t your final destination for the night. You felt socially obligated to make an appearance but you\u2019re really just waiting for the acceptable amount of time to pass before you can leave for your true destination. In the meantime, you\u2019re not going to turn down the wine being passed around.", "The party is picking up, the drinking games have come out, people aren\u2019t drunk but they are certainly drinking.", "If you arrive at this time, you are normal.", "As you enter the room, you mentally pat yourself on the back for being fashionably late. Nevermind that you were watching cat videos for the last two hours just so you wouldn\u2019t arrive early.", "Every decision is planned. You brought a 6 pack \u2014 just enough beer to show that you\u2019re not a moocher but not enough beer for people to think you\u2019re desperate for friends. Your wardrobe is put-together enough to look good but not too put together to look like this party is a big deal. The fact that you tried on five different outfits before landing on the one you have on is besides the point.", "The party is in full swing. Conversations consist of yelling into each other\u2019s ears. Like an invasive species, red Solo cups are spreading across the room. The beer pong table has a waiting list.", "You\u2019ve never met the host. In fact, you didn\u2019t know this party existed until 10 minutes ago when your friend shepherded your friend group here. You\u2019re only here because the first party ran out of alcohol and this was the best option anyone could think of. This was not before receiving several texts confirming that this party was indeed \u201cpoppin\u201d.", "Or this is the second or third stop of the night. You were at the \u201ccoolest bar before this\u201d and make it clear to anyone you meet. Now you have to match your level of intoxication to the level of the party. If your level is too low, you take some shots to catch up. If your level is too high, you still take some shots to bury the awkwardness.", "You have no idea how you got here. As you look around, you don\u2019t recognize a single person in the room. People glance your way and whisper to their friends but you\u2019re in no state to decipher what it all means. You would call your friends but you lost your phone two destinations ago. Now you\u2019re just sitting on a couch with a cup of water in hand, or is it a cup of beer? You\u2019re just going to rest your eyes for a brief second\u2026", "So hopefully you now know when to show up to your next party \u2014 yay. If you\u2019re not convinced you actually want to show up I have an article for you. But for now, I have to take a shot, grab my jacket, put on a smile, and head out the door\u2026ugh.", "If you liked this article, visit LateNightFroyo.com to read about topics that spark conversations around love, life, and more.", "How Do You Get Out of Going Out?", "How Young is Too Young to Date?", "Your home for data science.
