To speed up the process of learning, an experienced developer could teach the junior one best practices that are helpful in production purposes pipelines.", "We learn about testing, different kind of tests and code design principles at university. However, somehow, in the beginning, it is hard to find small testable units of code and we tend to test on bigger datasets than is needed or bigger portions of code than is needed.", "Finding the right unit of code that can be tested and splitting the code in such a way that it can be easily tested is something that can be learned with practice and by reading other people\u2019s code.", "Data Engineering can mean different technologies depending on the company/team you work on.", "At university, we are learning some core concepts of data processing. However, the fast evolution of technology is constraining universities to focus on some parts of the field and put aside others.", "Depending on the company and on the university, junior Data Engineer will have heard of/used certain notions or not. However, the multitude of technologies is creating the need for compromise when choosing junior Data Engineers and the need for deepening the knowledge of junior Data Engineers in multiple technologies.", "The Data Engineer is not creating anything that is immediately visible and in that sense, it is a bit like a backend developer in the world of data roles. It is really hard to present to the functional team what he does without the help of other data roles (data scientist, data visualization expert, ..).", "It is easier to present a Dashboard or a mobile application, containing a data service, than a data pipeline. It is easier to present the functional part of a recommendation engine than it is to present the data optimizations done to make it work with all data.", "At university, since everyone is presenting the work they have done for a project we don\u2019t necessarily see the difference but in a company, the difference can be striking. In a company, this means having \u201cthe worst seat at the table\u201d as Maxime Beauchemin puts it in his article.", "When you start as a developer or as a Data Engineer you may think that communication is not the core part of your job.", "However, it might be more important than you think because not communicating implies making assumptions and making assumptions imply projects that are not answering the real question of the customer.", "Besides, we are learning a lot more by asking questions than we are by searching for everything by ourselves.", "I chose these five core learnings since I consider these areas on which I have learned a lot since university and on which Junior Data Engineers struggle.", "If you would like to complete my list don\u2019t hesitate to comment below, hopefully, teachers will read this article and adjust the courses in accordance.", "Your home for data science.
