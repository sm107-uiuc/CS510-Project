In AI, We don\u2019t program the machines they learn by themselves. One of the biggest misconceptions of AI is that is a super-intelligent being or we called generalized AI that knows all, and smarter than all of us and that is a total misconception. Despite this progress, many challenges remain that will require more scientific breakthroughs.", "\u201cTrust is earned when actions meet words.\u201d \u2014 Chris Butler", "The widespread distribution of new communication technologies inevitably urges the constant improvement of the means and ways of protecting information in a wide range of digital systems that operate in almost all areas of modern public life, from banking, manufacturing to the defense and government sectors. These systems are characterized by a large variety of cyberthreats. In fact, Computer networks and the Internet have become the primary tool for spreading and distributing malware by malware authors. There is a general belief among cybersecurity experts that antimalware tools and systems powered by AI and ML will be the solution to modern malware attacks. However, creating a perfect malware detection system that detects all types of malicious software, with zero false positives seems impossible for now.", "We know that cybersecurity analysts always prefer solutions that are interpretable and understandable as rule-based or signature-based detection. That\u2019s why the focus of this article is to review the current state of the art in malware detection, indicate their limitations and discuss the possible solutions in order to increase TRUST in AI systems.", "Machine learning is a data analytics tool used to effectively perform specific tasks without explicit instructions. In recent years, ML capabilities have been used to design both static and dynamic analysis techniques for malware detection. In this context, I will set some of the states of the art in malware detection using the ML approach.", "These techniques try to improve the quality and performance of malware detection systems to build a robust one.", "While the use of machine learning for malware detection has shown promising results in both static and dynamic analysis, there are significant challenges that limit the success of ML-based malware detectors.", "The first challenge is the cost of training and updating malware in the production environment. Unfortunately, Malware detection is unlike other domains where ML techniques have been applied successfully such as computer vision, natural language processing, and e-commerce. Malware instances evolve and change their behaviors over a short period; some studies by antimalware vendors reported that a new malware instance could change their behaviors in less than 24 hours since it has been released.This means we need to frequently retrain our malware detectors to be able to detect new and mutated malware instances. Therefore, adaptability in ML models for malware detection is a crucial requirement and not just an auxiliary capability.Unlike computer vision, NLP and other areas that utilize ML, malware instances continue to evolve and change. This mostly requires retraining ML models in production, which is an expensive and complicated task. Therefore, when using ML for malware detection, we need to think differently.", "Cybersecurity analysts always prefer solutions that are interpretable and understandable. Because they need to tune and optimize these solutions to mitigate and control the effect of false positives and false negatives. Understand and Interpret ML models is a new challenge for them.Any malware detector will generate false positives. And we know that the malware analyst will not accept those black box malware detectors. That\u2019s why we need to focus on the interpretation of ML models to be acceptable by the malware analyst who does not need to be machine learning experts.", "Machine learning models are known by the lack of robustness against inputs crafted by an adversary. You can check my previous article about adversarial attacks here. In fact, a malware detection system utilizing ML could be bypassed using adversarial malware samples. Kolosnjaji et al. showed that by using an intelligent evasion attack they can defeat the deep learning detection system proposed in (Raff et al., 2017).", "To overcome the challenges we discussed earlier, I will set some of the new solutions.", "\u201cPeople worry that computers will get too smart and take over the world, but the real problem is that they\u2019re too stupid and they\u2019ve already taken over the world.\u201d \u2015 Pedro Domingos.", "To conclude, my article aimed to clear the vision of ML malware detectors. Because I believe that transparency is the first key to build trust. Through this article, we know that Machine Learning models lack robustness at present. And, we know their ability to discover hidden relationships towards solving complex problems such as those in cybersecurity. Certainly, there are further research is needed in this area. And maybe someday we can Trust the decision made by AI in the security field. For now, I think there is a lot of work to do before we can answer that question.", "Follow me to read my articles on AI in security because it\u2019s just the beginning. \u270c \u270c \ud83d\udc4c", "Happy reading, happy learning, and happy coding. \ud83d\udc4f", "[2] Naeem, H., Guo, B., and Naeem, M.
