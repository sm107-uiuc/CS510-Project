Eventually small weaknesses in the areas you\u2019ll apply compound into gaping mistakes.", "Modern reinforcement learning is almost entirely focused on deep reinforcement learning. The word in the \u201cdeep\u201d in the phrase deep reinforcement learning implies the use of a neural network in a core aspect of the algorithm. The neural network does some high-dimensional approximation in the learning process. That being said, the model does not need to have many layers and features, which is a common misconception that deep implies many layers.", "Almost all of the courses and tutorials will assume you can fine-tune simple neural networks to approximate state values or create a final policy. These models are historically highly sensitive to all of the following training parameters: learning rate, batch size, model parameters, data normalization, and more. Doubled with tasks that are difficult to solve, debugging RL can be very difficult, and just seem like a binary it works or it doesn\u2019t. Eliminating tails of confusing by knowing that all the sub approximations made are up to par. The best way to do this would be to learn supervised learning, then let an AutoML tool finish the job for you.", "Start with some code, break everything, then rebuild it. Do this a few times, and you should be good to go. Supervised learning is also a skill that\u2019ll translate to most any area in computer science through the next decade, so get after it.", "RL is a search problem in the policy space. The highest impact papers in recent years have been taking serious inspiration from search problems of old. Let\u2019s consider three of the most impactful recent papers in RL:", "Planning in RL is a big win for the (relatively small, but growing) sub-area of model-based reinforcement learning that tries to learn a model of the environment for offline planning.", "You ask: where can I brush up on the concepts of search? Here\u2019s where I learned: UC Berkeley\u2019s and MIT\u2019s intro to AI classes. Then make a code project or two and challenge yourself.", "Note how I did not say reading academic papers. The key is to be able to understand them.", "The academic field changes rapidly with papers announced daily in the vibrant Twitter community (seriously, follow a couple of famous researchers \u2014 great for keeping you up to speed). What you need to learn is to differentiate the impactful papers from the noise and the progress from the hype.", "It\u2019s not about retweets or citations right now \u2014 albeit, I do admit citations are a good proxy \u2014 it\u2019s about substantive experiments. The machine learning publication cycle is viscous, with researchers expected to publish multiple times a year. What you should look at is the experiments: are they following an arc of problem, experiment, then solution or just incrementally improving on another\u2019s method? The best papers are searching for truth, not numbers.", "The best research searches for the most important problems, regardless of the waves of the academic chatter.
