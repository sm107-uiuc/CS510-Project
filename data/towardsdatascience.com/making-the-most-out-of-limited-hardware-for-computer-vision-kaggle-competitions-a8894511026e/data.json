There are myriad blog posts, articles and discussions on their history and tutorials on how to build a simple model in a few lines of code.", "These tools, however, require more and more computational power, as academia and research seem to be very skewed towards creating deeper and deeper models, with a ginormous number of parameters, requiring an unrealistic amount of compute for any but the biggest of labs and companies. As an individual, or even a small group, these are totally out of reach; and while a lot of great tutorials, introductions, etc. have been written about how to get started with X or Y framework, it feels like there is a lack of \"practical\" guides out there, on how to help people who don't have the latest and greatest in computer hardware.", "Hopefully, this post can provide some ideas on how to lower down the compute budget one needs in some computer vision tasks. This post will mostly be centered around Kaggle competitions, but can be pretty much extrapolated to many different applications. Kaggle is a great place to learn about data science and computer vision, but can be quite daunting especially when starting out, and even more since Kaggle introduced a limited 30h a week cap on GPU usage time. This sounded more like a challenge than anything to me at first, limited resources compared to the previous competitions where one could spin up 4 instances of GPU notebooks to run all night (which, now that I think about it might have been the cause of the restrictions in the first place, but more realistically was to stop people from mining crypto and other unintended uses of the sort).", "I have to start by putting a few things out there for context: I had a pretty solid background in maths and physics due to my engineering background, but was pretty much self-taught when it comes to data & computer science. A huge part of that was thanks to Kaggle, and the compute resources we could have for free in a practically unlimited amount of time (this is around a year ago from the time of writing). This allowed for many errors and tinkering without having to worry about wasting or having to keep close track on precious GPU resources. Hopefully, this might help those out there on their own journey that doesn't have that luxury anymore but still want to learn this (overly?) hipped yet really interesting field that is computer vision in the days of deep learning.", "Here is the premise: for pretty much any relatively complex computer vision task/competitions deep learning is the state of the art today. And deep learning pretty much requires GPUs for training. The idea is, how can we break down everything to only use GPUs when we need them, and not any more? (in a broader spectrum, this also applies to the actual development of deep learning models for real world applications, where spinning up cloud instances cost a lot more when packed with a GPU).", "Data science and more specifically computer vision tasks, competitions, problems, etc. require one to create a model that takes (most of the time labelled) data and \"learns\" from it to recognize whatever patterns it can from the labels. This means passing over the images (or whatever other types of data) and constantly tweaking and changing the internals of the model to best reduce a loss function. While we won't go in detail here about why and how (once again, there is more than enough written subject online), it is still important to keep the big picture in mind. This step of passing the data and tweaking the model is the step that requires heavy lifting GPU (or TPU) processing. However, this is only one of the steps of making a model, and having limited access to raw compute power means having to try to squeeze as much as we can from all the steps before and after training. Pre-processing and error analysis are two examples of before and after steps that we'll go over here.", "When doing a Kaggle competition, these 30h of GPU time mean that the moment you switch your notebook to use a GPU, the clock is ticking, even if all you\u2019re doing is CPU bound. From there, I try to do some of the obvious tasks like data preparation/exploration only on CPU. But I try to take it a step further and reduce as much as possible all the non-GPU operations that could be removed. This mostly applies to any pre-processing that can be done on images. I\u2019m not talking about data augmentation but mostly about resizing images, cropping, centering, normalizing, etc. I usually create a new dataset with these pre-processed images, so that I just need to load them into a model and it\u2019s ready to go.", "Initially, before trying to fine tune the model, I want to make sure my model is actually working. Premature optimization is a waste of time, and GPU time. When I start working on a new project, I always try to create a tiny stratified dataset that is representative of my bigger dataset to make training take a really short time (I\u2019m talking seconds here). I really liked this tweet & article on the \u201c10 second rule\u201d which I try to apply whenever I can. The idea is to get something working, as fast as possible. At this point the output of the model doesn\u2019t matter, it just has to output something. That means taking care of the correction shapes, dimensions, tensor input/outputs, etc. This can usually take a bit of time, and if I can also do it on CPU then I do. I find that a lot of online tutorials and discussions show you how to make a model, but never how to create one when starting off from a dataset (that\u2019s assuming you do have a dataset in the first place, many times a lot of the work is actually creating it). Yet it feels as though the most of the time spent is debugging, trying to find why a model doesn\u2019t output, trying to find out how big of a batch size is possible to fit in one\u2019s GPU VRAM, etc. All these steps either don't require a GPU or can be done with a very small portion of the original dataset.", "Another trick is to try to reduce the size of images themselves, not just the number used for testing. I could take it even one step further and turn all of my images into a single channel (greyscale) instead of RGB but that would mess with the architecture of the model, so I usually keep RGB but reduce the image size significantly. The great thing is that if you reduce height & width by 2, you reduce the size of the image by 4. That means (roughly) 4 times faster training. Obviously, you lose some information there (and thus performance), but to try and test stuff at first, that\u2019s a trade-off that is worth it in my humble opinion. I also started looking into some dimensionality reduction methods, or compression algorithms for images in order to try to reduce the size of images while maintaining as much information as possible. Principal component analysis (PCA) is often used in tabular data and can be used for images; I have previously used it to reduce the total dataset size when working with satellite images. In a nutshell, some satellite images have up to 13 bands (in contrast to the usual 3, Red, Blue & Green), but reducing those to 3 with PCA yielded improved results and faster training in that task. There are probably smarter ways to do so, this is an example showing there are many ways to reduce the size of a dataset while trying to keep as much useful\" information as possible.", "When in the process of training a better model, I also usually don\u2019t do any inference on GPU. Once I have a trained model, I save it, but then I usually move to a local instance on my laptop (which gets also tricky on a 2Gb VRAM mx150, but it is always better than CPU). The inference is done on some images from the validation set to see what the results from the model actually look like, and understand what a model learned well or not. Inference is much quicker than training, as there also usually are fewer images to infer on when in the process of training a model. This is a step where longer times aren\u2019t an issue, as it can be done while a model is training on the GPU. For some reason, error analysis seems to be quite overlooked, at least from the public comments and notebooks that can be found in Kaggle competitions. Yet getting an understanding of what the model is getting right, and what it\u2019s getting wrong can be hugely beneficial. Having a background in physics and mechanical engineering, where there are laws of physics to pretty much every single phenomenon has deeply engraved in me this will to understand why things react the way they do. Yet it seems like we still have a very trial & error approach to deep learning fine-tuning. In-depth error analysis, beyond looking at false positives and negatives seems to be quite overlooked, yet I think this is something where a lot of value lies, for competitions and real world applications. For example, Class Activation Maps (CAMs) provide insight into which parts of the image are used to make a prediction. Say you have indoor images of cats, and outdoor images of dogs and are making a binary classifier for cats and dogs. If all your cat images are indoors and all your dog images are outdoors, how can we know if the model is classifying cats & dogs or indoors & outdoors? One way could be to get more data with outdoor cats & indoor dogs, but CAMs might also provide some answers to that. And these don\u2019t require that much processing power nor additional data.", "Then there are things like trying to find the most efficient architectures, but usually, these ideas are extensively explored. The field is moving from ResNets for EfficientNet architectures, better performances for faster training, win-win! Without decent GPUs, these are tricky to assess, and once again one has to compete with every other person that does have access to them. Not having access to high-end compute means trying to improve results in other topics than model architecture fine-tuning.", "On Kaggle, until very recently, running a model in a notebook meant having to rerun it to commit it, or download it when it was finished (but that meant leaving a browser tab always open, with the risk of it also crashing, and potentially losing a few precious hours of training. But if you commit it, you have no idea what\u2019s going on until it\u2019s finished. If, after 3 epochs, your model is doing crap but still running, you won\u2019t necessarily know. This is even worse when doing k-fold training, thus having to train multiple models. So to go around this a friend and I spent some time leveraging the Slack Python API, to send us a message at the end of each model training (I\u2019m planning on implementing it at the end of each epoch, but haven\u2019t done that yet). I sent myself a message after each training loop, with graphs of loss + metrics, training times, etc. This way, if I have a 5-Fold model training and after the 1st fold it\u2019s not as good as I thought, I can just go and manually stop the commit, and prevent my quota from going down for nothing.", "Sending a message using the Slack API (once set-up correctly) is really simple:", "In this example, I have created a # kaggle_notification channel on the Slack I use for personal projects, and I call send_message_to_slack at the end of each epoch, fold or anywhere else. With some tinkering, it\u2019s also possible to send images of logs or predictions, for example. Note that you, of course, need your script to have access to the internet.", "Not having the latest and greatest in compute doesn't mean being unable to contribute to a team trying to get the best results. In a recent computer vision, I joined a team that made it top 3% without providing much support on the model fine-tuning, but rather by spending time on pre-processing and error analysis. There are so many more interesting topics to dig in other than the more brute force approach of running bigger models on GPUs. This meant trying to understand how our model was learning, where did it get things wrong, how often, what did it get right, etc. This allows us to know if tweaking the learning rate optimization or changing a layer in the model makes sense in the first place or not.", "It is still important to try out different models, architectures and spend some time fine-tuning them. Google Colab is a great way to get started (and their paid tier is pretty affordable for some great resources!), and finding some other tricks to make the most out of it. Just like Kaggle notebooks, these have their limits when trying to train big models on relatively big datasets. But similarly, finding tricks to squeeze the most out of them is part of the fun.", "Finally, there are things I\u2019d also like to get better at, but are pretty tricky for data science as a whole I think: keeping track of experiments and their results, how each variation in the hyper-parameters of the model affected the results. Multiple times have I re-done an experiment because I failed to correctly keep track of everything previously tested. Commenting code and using git seems to work great for a dozen experiments, but doesn\u2019t scale well above that. Working as a team on a single model is also tricky and something I\u2019d like to be better at to waste less time and resources on. Andrej Karpathy did a great talk on this subject a few months go (at the time of writing).", "To end, I do really think having a tight constraint on access to hardware leads to some creative thinking, asking yourself why you\u2019re doing the things you\u2019re doing, and how can you work around without a GPU to throw models at. I also think this approach does have some limits, however. There\u2019s only so far you can go with CPUs or low-end GPUs only, and you still need more capable hardware for computer vision tasks. I think it\u2019s important to keep in mind, as much as I love the underdog story of not using GPUs much. Eventually, when I do have the money, I\u2019m going to get myself a GPU, because I do think it does unlock a lot of potential. But I\u2019m also glad I started data science and especially computer vision without great hardware! I think it\u2019s a great exercise, and I feel like it has greatly helped me in my professional work. Understanding how to find bottlenecks, how to get a very basic model running in a few hours with a fraction of the data; all these have been great learning exercises.", "Junior remote sensing engineer at Iceye; MSc in aerospace engineering.
