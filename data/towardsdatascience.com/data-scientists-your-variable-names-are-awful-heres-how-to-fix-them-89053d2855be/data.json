Even if you were the author, a few days after writing this code you wouldn\u2019t know what it does because of the unhelpful variable names and use of \u201cmagic\u201d numbers.", "Working with data science code, I often see examples like above (or worse): code with variable names such as X, y, xs, x1, x2, tp, tn, clf, reg, xi, yi, iiand numerous unnamed constant values. To put it frankly, data scientists (myself included) are terrible at naming variables when we go to the trouble of naming them at all.", "As I\u2019ve grown from writing research-oriented data science code for one-off analyses to production-level code (at Cortex Building Intel), I\u2019ve had to improve my programming by unlearning practices from data science books, courses, and the lab. There are many differences between machine learning code that can be deployed and how data scientists are taught to program, but we\u2019ll start here by focusing on two common problems with a large impact:", "Both these problems contribute to the disconnect between data science research (or Kaggle projects) and production machine learning systems. Yes, you can get away with them in a Jupyter Notebook that runs once, but when you have mission-critical machine-learning pipelines running hundreds of times per day with no errors, you have to write readable and understandable code. Fortunately, there are best practices from software engineering we data scientists can adopt to this end, including the ones we\u2019ll cover in this article.", "Note: I\u2019m focusing on Python since it\u2019s by far the most widely used language in industry data science. In Python (see here for more details):", "There are three fundamental ideas to keep in mind when naming variables:", "What does this look like in practice? Let\u2019s go through some improvements to variable names:", "Most problems with naming variables stem from", "On the first point, while languages like Fortran did limit the length of variable names (to 6 characters), modern programming languages have no restrictions so don\u2019t feel forced to use contrived abbreviations. Don\u2019t use overly long variable names either, but if you have to favor one side, aim for readability.", "With regards to the second point, when you write an equation or use a model \u2014 and this is a point schools forget to emphasize \u2014 remember the letters or inputs represent real-world values!", "Let\u2019s see an example that makes both mistakes and how to correct it. Say we have a polynomial equation for finding the price of a house from a model. You may be tempted to write the mathematical formula directly in code:", "This is code that looks like it was written by a machine for a machine. While a computer will ultimately run your code, it will be read far more times by humans, so write code that is meant for human understanding!", "To do this, we need to think not about the formula itself \u2014 the how \u2014 and consider the real-world objects being modeled \u2014 the what. Let\u2019s write out the complete equation (this is a good test to see if you understand the model):", "If you are having trouble naming your variables, it means you don\u2019t know the model or your code well enough. We write code to solve real-world problems, and we need to understand what our model is trying to capture. Descriptive variable names let you work at a higher level of abstraction than a formula, helping you focus on the problem domain.", "One of our important points to remember for naming variables was consistency counts. Being consistent with variable names means you spend less time worrying about naming, and more time solving the problem. This point is relevant when you add aggregations to variable names.", "So you\u2019ve mastered the basic idea of using descriptive names, changing xs to distances, e to efficiency, and v to velocity. Now, what happens when you take the average of velocity? Should this be average_velocity, velocity_mean or velocity_average? Two steps can resolve this:", "Following these rules, your set of aggregated variables might be velocity_avg , distance_avg, velocity_min, and distance_max. Rule 2. is kind of a personal choice, and if you disagree, that\u2019s fine, as long as you consistently apply whatever rule you choose.", "A tricky point comes up when you have a variable representing the number of an item. You might be tempted to use building_num, but does that refer to the total number of buildings, or the specific index of a particular building? To avoid ambiguity, use building_count to refer to the total number of buildings and building_index to refer to a specific building. You can adapt this to other problems such as item_count and item_index . If you don\u2019t like count , then item_total also is a better choice than num.This approach resolves ambiguity and maintains the consistency of placing aggregations at the end of names.", "For some unfortunate reason, typical loop variables have become i, j, and k. This may be the cause of more errors and frustration than any other practice in data science. Combine uninformative variable names with nested loops (I\u2019ve seen loops nested to include the use of ii, jj, and even iii) and you have the perfect recipe for unreadable, error-prone code. This may be controversial, but I never use i or any other single letter for loop variables, opting instead for describing what I\u2019m iterating over such as", "This is especially useful when you have nested loops so you don\u2019t have to remember if i stands for row or column or if that was j or k. You want to spend your mental resources figuring out how to create the best model, not trying to figure out the specific order of array indexes.", "(In Python, if you aren\u2019t using a loop variable, then use _ as a placeholder. This way, you won\u2019t get confused about whether or not the index is used.)", "All of these stick to the principle of prioritizing read-time understandability instead of write-time convenience. Coding is primarily a method for communicating with other programmers, so give your team members some help in making sense of your computer programs.", "A magic number is a constant value without a variable name. I see these used for tasks like converting units, changing time intervals or adding an offset:", "(These variable names are all poor!)", "Magic numbers are a large source of errors and confusion because:", "Instead of using magic numbers, we can define a function for conversions that accepts the unconverted value and the conversion rate as parameters:", "If we use the conversion rate throughout a program in many functions, we could define a named constant in a single location:", "(Before we start the project, we should establish with the rest of our team that usd = US dollars and aud = Australian dollars. Remember standards!)", "Using a NAMED_CONSTANT defined in a single place makes changing the value easier and more consistent. If the conversion rate changes, you don\u2019t need to hunt through your entire codebase to change all the occurrences, because it is defined in only one location. It also tells anyone reading your code exactly what the constant represents. A function parameter is also an acceptable solution if the name describes what the parameter represents.", "As a real-world example of the perils of magic numbers, in college, I worked on a research project with building energy data that initially came in 15-minute intervals. No one gave much thought to the possibility this could change, and we wrote hundreds of functions with the magic number 15 (or 96 for the number of daily observations). This worked fine until we started getting data in 5 and 1-minute intervals. We spent weeks changing all our functions to accept a parameter for the interval, but even so, we were still fighting errors caused by the use of magic numbers for months.", "Real-world data has a habit of changing on you \u2014 conversion rates between currencies fluctuate every minute \u2014 and hard-coding in specific values means you\u2019ll have to spend significant time re-writing your code and fixing errors. There is no place for \u201cmagic\u201d in programming, even in data science.", "The benefits of adopting standards are that they let you make a single global decision instead of many local ones. Instead of choosing where to put the aggregation every time you name a variable, make one decision at the start of the project, and apply it consistently throughout. The objective is to spend less time on concerns only peripherally related to data science: naming, formatting, style \u2014 and more time solving important problems (like using machine learning to address climate change).", "If you are used to working by yourself, it might be hard to see the benefits of adopting standards. However, even when working by yourself, you can practice defining your own conventions and using them consistently. You\u2019ll still get the benefits of fewer small decisions and it\u2019s good practice for when you inevitably have to develop on a team. Anytime you have more than one programmer on a project, standards become a must!", "You might disagree with some of the choices I\u2019ve made in this article, and that\u2019s fine! It\u2019s more important to adopt a consistent set of standards than the exact choice of how many spaces to use or the maximum length of a variable name. The key point is to stop spending so much time on accidental difficulties and instead concentrate on the essential difficulties. (David Brooks has an excellent essay on how we\u2019ve gone from addressing accidental problems in software engineering to concentrating on essential problems).", "Keeping what we\u2019ve learned in mind, we can now go back to the initial code we started with:", "and fix it up. We\u2019ll use descriptive variable names and named constants.", "Now we can see that this code is normalizing the pixel values in an array and adding a constant offset to create a new array (ignore the inefficiency of the implementation!). When we give this code to our colleagues, they will be able to understand and modify it. Moreover, when we come back to the code to test it and fix our errors, we\u2019ll know precisely what we were doing.", "Is this topic boring? Perhaps it\u2019s a little dry, but if you spend time reading about software engineering, you realize what differentiates the best programmers is the repeated practice of such mundane techniques as good variable names, keeping routines short, testing every line of code, refactoring, etc. These are the techniques you need to move your code from research to production-level and, once you get there, you\u2019ll see that having your models influencing real-life decisions is far from boring.", "In this article, we covered some of the ways to improve your variable names.", "(If you disagree with some of my specific advice, that\u2019s fine. It\u2019s more important that you are using a standard way to name variables than being dogmatic about the exact conventions!)", "There are many other changes we can make to our data science code to get it to production level (we didn\u2019t even talk about function names!). I\u2019ll have more articles on this topic soon, but in the meantime, check out \u201cNotes on Software Construction from Code Complete\u201d. To dive in deep on software engineering best practices, pick up Code Complete by Steve McConnell.", "To reach its true potential, data science will need to use standards that allow us to build robust software products. Fortunately for us, software engineers have already thought most of these best practices out and detailed them in countless books and articles. It\u2019s now up to us to read and implement them.", "I write about data science and welcome constructive comments or feedback. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will.
