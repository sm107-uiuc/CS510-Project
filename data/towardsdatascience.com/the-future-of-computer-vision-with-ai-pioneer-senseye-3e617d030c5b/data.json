Senseye\u2019s clients use these insights to enhance and grow their business, and to interact with their partners, employees, and consumers on a profound level.", "The All Too Real Challenge of Computer Vision Data", "Senseye pushes machines to their limits with the volume of HD video footage they use to train their machine learning models. The compute power needed to process large volumes of video data with custom technology is a limiting factor for the extraction of information from raw frames that are used to drive Senseye\u2019s data products. Ultimate product effectiveness and success is directly tied to building and testing new ideas quickly at large scales.", "Recently, Senseye partnered with Saturn Cloud to make a breakthrough performance improvement in their machine learning work. Saturn Cloud is a data science and machine learning platform, which offers the highest-speed computing tools on the market.", "Haven\u2019t heard of Saturn? Here\u2019s all you need to know: Random Forest on GPUs: 2000x Faster than Apache Spark", "To test Saturn Cloud\u2019s capabilities, Senseye chose one of their most compute-intensive processing pipelines. It was comprised of 900 ultra-high-definition videos, each 10 minutes in duration and recorded at 120Hz, which amounted to nearly 7.5TB on disk.", "The video files are transformed into chunks of three-dimensional arrays and fed through several custom PyTorch models with more traditional analytic computer vision techniques to compute features, which are eventually used in downstream machine learning algorithms.", "\u201cWith the scale we work at, it can take 60 days to extract features for machine learning. Lags like these affect our ability to iterate solutions, improve software, and increase performance. We are forced to carefully choose which solutions we want to test at scale with incomplete information, or run more solution candidates on smaller subsamples of data, which negatively affects the robustness and performance of our algorithms\u201d \u2014 Andrew Sommerlot, Director of ML & AI", "This process Senseye previously used equates to roughly 90 minutes of processing time per video per GPU (Titan RTX). Using the legacy on-premise GPU machine, the total processing time is 60 days.", "\u201cFast iterations at full scale are ideal when creating an AI-driven product that needs high performance and confidence when deployed in real-world applications\u201d", "Let\u2019s talk about \u201cHighly Scalable Python Analytics\u201d", "Saturn Cloud allows teams to scale to an endless number of GPUs. What does this mean? It means the limiting factor of on-premise computing for Senseye is totally eliminated, opening a path to lightning-fast machine learning.", "Senseye leveraged Saturn to scale up to 160 T4 GPUs in the cloud, moving away from the limits of the previously-utilized on-premise machines. This improvement required only adding 10 lines of code \u2014 a trivial change for the performance improvement.", "Now, each video takes only 40 seconds to process, enabling Senseye to iterate every day as opposed to once every two months.", "\u201cOh My God! The new workflow is 120x faster\u2026\u201d", "This reduces the total runtime of 60 days down to just 11 hours in total. What does this entail? Well for starters, Senseye can build more accuracy into its predictions, and ultimately more value to its bottom line: fewer workplace accidents by its end-users means safer work environments and less insurance claims for its proprietors.", "\u201cTaking runtime down from 60 days to 11 hours is such an incredible improvement. We are able to fit in many more iterations on our models. This has a significant positive impact on the effectiveness of our product, which takes many iterations to perform at the standard necessary for our customers.\u201d \u2014 Seth Weisberg, Principal Machine Learning Scientist (Senseye)", "Let\u2019s lay out the numbers side by side.", "Figure 1: Total Videos Processed Per Hour", "Performance improvements like this are not far away in the future: Saturn puts these capabilities at your fingertips with its turnkey data science and machine learning platform.", "To learn more about Saturn Cloud, please visit the website here: saturncloud.io", "As Senseye continues to pioneer the application of computer vision, we encourage you to follow them on their website: senseye.co.", "If you liked this article, please share and tell your friends and colleagues about the computing superpowers that will make their lives and that of their customers so much better.", "Your home for data science.
