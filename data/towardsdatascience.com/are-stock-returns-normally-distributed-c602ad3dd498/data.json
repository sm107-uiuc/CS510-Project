See our Reader Terms for details.", "After Pfizer announced that it\u2019s COVID-19 vaccine had a 90 percent success rate last week, equity markets instantly stopped and changed course. Stocks like American Airlines and AMC, which had been battered by the pandemic, were all of the sudden given new life by a sudden influx of money, while the so-called \u201cstay at home\u201d stocks suddenly had the wind taken out of their sails (Zoom had a brutal week). This rapid change of events left \u201cquant\u201d investors picking up the pieces of what had just happened. Events like these were supposedly so rare that \u201cwriting out the chances of occurrence on any given day required a 16-digit number \u2014 followed by 63 zeroes.\u201d", "This sudden collapse in strategies deployed by quants exposes certain assumptions about the behavior of the stock market and why it\u2019s so dangerous to make them, the chief one being that stock returns are normally distributed, more or less. This article sets out to show that that assumption is wrong, and that stock prices are not normally distributed. The upshot of this is that \u201cfreak occurrences,\u201d so to speak, turn out to be a lot more common place than expected (while still being pretty rate, relatively speaking). This, however, does not render quantitative models useless. It only highlights that a model is only as good as the assumptions behind it.", "The Normal Distribution is a statistical concept and it is so important because it describes how many of the data we observe every day behave. More specifically, it describes how the values of a variable \u2014 human height, for example \u2014 are distributed. Before going into more detail, let\u2019s look at a picture of a normal distribution to get a better idea of it:", "The normal distribution is a bell-shaped a curve, and the key aspects of it are 1) 68 percent of the values under the curve fall within one standard deviation of the mean \u2014 within the red region of the graph \u2014 2) 95 percent of the values fall within two standard deviations of the mean \u2014 within either the green or red regions of the graph \u2014 and most importantly, in my opinion, 3) 99.7 percent of normally distributed data are within three standard deviations of the mean \u2014 will fall in the yellow, green, or red regions. In other words, 99.7 percent of the values a variable can take will fall under the blue curve pictured above. Using normally distributed dummy data, pictured below, 99.7 percent of the values a variable can take will range from roughly 0.5 to 3.5.", "This is important because if stock returns fit this type of distribution, then an investor can be sure that 99.7 percent of the values that a return can take will be confined to a certain range. For example, if Walmart\u2019s returns are supposedly normally distributed, as pictured below, then an investor can be confident that the range of possible values will fall under the curve. Note, the probability that a return will fall along the tails of the distribution curve is nearly impossible, if the data is normally distributed:", "The million dollar question is whether stock returns are normal and if a Walmart investor, for example, can sleep soundly, knowing that a return of -0.2 or below is virtually impossible. There are several methods to test for normality, and this article will highlight the Shapiro-Wilk Test and the Quantile-Quantile Plot.", "The Shapiro-Wilk Test is one of several normality tests that takes a sample of data and assesses the likelihood of that sample being drawn from a normal distribution by using what\u2019s called a p-value and then comparing it to a threshold, typically 0.05. In Python, if the p-value is below 0.05, then it\u2019s likely, but not definitive, that the data in question is not normally distributed, and if it\u2019s above 0.05, then the data likely follows a normal distribution. Applying this test to the randomly generated data mentioned above, it is likely that the data follows a normal distribution:", "Applying this test to Walmart, however, yields a different result i.e. it fails the normality test. Of course, other stocks may pass this test. Yet performing this same to test to every stock in the Nasdaq 100 returns the same result:", "None of the stocks had a p-value greater than 0.05, meaning that their returns likely do not follow a normal distribution.", "In very simple terms, the Quantile-Quantile Test is a graph with a diagonal drawn straight through a series of points. If each point on the graph falls on the diagonal then the data likely follows a normal distribution:", "The sample data above hues pretty closely to the straight line, indicating that the data is likely normal. Applying this test to Walmart\u2019s historical returns yields a result that indicates that the returns are likely not normal, since there is deviation from the diagonal:", "Normality tests are important because they help determine whether it\u2019s appropriate to make a certain set of assumptions on which to build an investment model. If the data does not behave in the way it is assumed to behave, then what was thought to be impossible, like suffering a huge investment loss, can turn out to be a lot more probable. The takeaway is not to toss investment models aside, but to recognize that they are only as good as the assumptions behind them.", "The Python code can be found here", "Your home for data science.
