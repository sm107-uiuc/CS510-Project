Without it, companies are unable to create, maintain, and upgrade their products. Technology enterprises rely on their engineering department to survive in a competitive world.", "Even so, not all engineers perform the same set of tasks. In heavy technology-based companies, software engineers are one of the most critical resources. They build programs, create software, and maintain the functionality of the systems. Many other career paths diverge from software engineering. They specialize in a particular subject.", "In the data landscape, corporations face a tremendous growth in data amount. We need someone to step up and claim the responsibilities of managing that data. That commences the dawn of big data engineers. A big data engineer can evolve from a database administrator, a data architect, or a data analyst.", "Big data engineers and software engineers differ in skill sets. Still, many companies tend to regard them as identical entities. They misemploy the terms in job descriptions. Furthermore, they make false assumptions in technical interviews.", "In most cases, a software engineer handles the jobs of a big data engineer. His responsibilities thus turn complex, obscure, and polyvalent.", "As a big data engineer, I have a strong urge to fortify our positions in corporation hierarchies. People have to regard our profession as a distinctive career path. To do that, we first define who we are and how we differ from other engineers. As someone who works a lot with software, I want to point out the things that set us apart from software engineers.", "When there is a need for data, there is a need for data modeling. This is where we define table relationships, name the columns, and test the query.", "Any software engineer can create a database with a handful of tables. A big data engineer can manage hundreds of tables linking to each other. It requires certain expertise to address various issues. How do we join tables? Under what format will the columns be? How much should we replicate data?", "Everything comes with experience, so does data modeling. A big data engineer needs to take precautions before building his dataset. A single mistake can lead to severe performance issues or redundant data storage.", "A big data engineer handles data modeling requests from time to time. A request can be trivial as adding a column or complex as creating a database for a whole pipeline. In either case, the big data engineer needs to first asset the impact of the change to the current system. Then he proposes some optimization to lessen that impact. Another skilled big data engineer shall keep an eye on this to keep everything in standards.", "A typical data modeling process begins with a design phase. The big data engineer gathers all the business and technical specifications. These include the available incomes, the expected outcomes, and some constraints. Some sketches of the consequent data shall come in handy. It can show the stakeholders how we will retrieve data from the source and combine them to get the results.", "Next comes the implementation phase. The big data engineer executes plenty of queries to verify the feasibility of his design. Will we finish the query under a reasonable execution time? Will the results contain the desire outcomes? A rigorous, thorough, and comprehensive design phase leads to a straightforward implementation.", "In case the reality doesn\u2019t match his design, the big data engineer takes a step back and reviews his solution. The back and forth evaluation need several iterations until the official release.", "Success in this phase allows the big data engineer to proceed to the validation phase. This is a critical step in modeling the data set. Stakeholders assess together the integrity of the data produced by his models.", "The value must be coherent with the rest of the system. The naming convention should follow the internal standards to avoid confusion. The data structure is supposed to be comprehensive. The validation phase requires a deep understanding of business needs and technical use.", "The rest of the data modeling process consists of documentation, monitoring, and maintenance. A big data engineer builds data systems to last, thus he should take care of his legacy. His original intentions must be crystal clear to his successors. He communicates via documentation, how-to instructions, and proper-defined monitoring metrics. He craves for his data model to survive through many systematic changes.", "A big data execution consists of many operations. These include data manipulations such as ETL \u2014 Extract, Transform, and Load. Nowadays, it exists many tools to automatize those operations. The rest is to program the instructions.", "There\u2019s nothing complex about writing big data execution. The key concept lies in the ability to employ the popular frameworks.", "Apache Hadoop ecosystem is the first big data framework that made it into the industrial mainstream. Its job scheduling system consists of MapReduce operations and a resource negotiator \u2014 YARN. The Hadoop ecosystem provides us with a minimal UI. It tracks the job progress along with the system logs for each of the nodes used.", "Another popular framework based upon the MapReduce job operations is Apache Spark. It\u2019s gaining more and more popularity among Big Data companies due to its sparse and flexibility. A Spark architecture consists of a Master node and several Worker nodes. The RDD or Resilient Distributed Dataset is the core difference from the origin.", "Writing big data execution falls into the daily activities of a big data engineer. To build a new dataset, to construct a fresh data pipeline, or to process data from sources. After finishing programming his execution, he would submit the job to a data scheduler.", "A data scheduler is a timer for jobs\u2019 execution. You can set a frequency for your job, define the number of retries, or create dependencies between jobs. A famous open-source data scheduler is Apache Airflow developed by Airbnb engineers.", "One of the core concepts of Apache Airflow is DAG \u2014 Directed Acyclic Graph. Airflow creators explain DAG as a simple way to represent your workflow. A workflow consists of a set of tasks along with their dependencies. A DAG contains a finite number of elements. Vertices represent a set of tasks and edges correspond to their interactions. A simple constraint in a DAG is that it doesn\u2019t exist any loop in the workflow. It means we cannot execute a task twice in the same context.", "Here\u2019s an example of a job scheduling using Apache Airflow", "Corporations must be penny-wise in data storage. Not only it\u2019s a limited resource, but it can become a bottleneck in data operations. Setting up a data storage system is getting cheaper with cloud-based architecture. But maintaining one is never straightforward.", "We need a team of one database administrator, two or three data architects, and a handful of data analysts. A big data engineer can play the role of all those three.", "Optimizing data storage comes down to the understanding of your data. Where does it come from? What is its nature? Under what format will we store them? It\u2019s never a waste of time analyzing data before its injection into the data storage system.", "A big data engineer has pre-optimized tools under his belt, but he needs more. He commits to ensuring the most optimization possible for his system. He cares about three things in data admission:", "Companies often neglect data storage optimization because it\u2019s daunting and tedious. But data-driven businesses best to treat data with care as their products. Big data engineers help to keep a healthy storage system and to make the most profit possible.", "A data pipeline is a flow of data. Data usually moves from one place to another to serve different purposes. Output data goes to reporting, machine learning models training, business decision making.", "Stable, uninterrupted, and accurate data transportation is requisite. We need to ensure consistency throughout the pipeline. We must not tolerant any information loss.", "To create a data pipeline, a big data engineer combines all the activities above. A data pipeline is a collaboration between many data owner entities. They might not share the same standards. A big data engineer \u2018s hence supposed to know his input and output data inside out.", "A data block is the minimum viable element of a typical data pipeline. It contains databases, a storage/analytics engine, and many connectors IN or OUT. This modular architecture helps to craft a data pipeline with flexibility and robustness. We can add, remove, modify any blocks at will without grave affecting the whole system.", "A big data engineer builds his data pipeline to last. The maintenance is as much important as the construction. What could we do to make an endurable legacy? Document business needs, track queries execution and leave out an incident manual. A data pipeline life cycle starts from the product specification to reporting dashboards and well long after that.", "We had a look at the activities that set a big data engineer apart from a software engineer. Still, they share a lot in common. A big data engineer must know how to work with software as much as a software engineer must know how to handle data.", "My name\u2019s Nam Nguyen, and I write about Big Data. Enjoy your reading? Follow me on Medium and Twitter for more updates.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Engineer by day, writer by night.
