Initially, the requests are simple. They don\u2019t take much time to fulfil. As the team size grows, the data engineers take more and more additional work. A time comes when the data engineering team becomes a blocker for the business. How?", "Data engineers start by catering to requests that are ad-hoc in nature. They deviate from their main responsibilities of developing new pipelines, adding new sources of data, fixing issues with old data, modelling the data in lakes and warehouses and so on. In addition to the ad-hoc requests from the data analysts and data scientists, the data engineers also start catering to infrastructure, CI/CD, source control, container, system administration issues.", "Traditionally, the additional work that data engineers take on was supposed to be taken up by the DevOps engineers and system administrators, but as we all know that Data Engineering is a vast field and requires a certain baseline of domain knowledge, a different kind of person was needed to solve this \u2014 someone who is a thinks about DevOps & Data Engineering alike, someone who can handle the more day-to-day operational stuff to keep the systems alive and working.", "This missing link is the DataOps Engineer.", "I have written about this previously. Because of the innovations, changing landscape and new trends, certain technologies, job profiles break into one or more (in some cases, two or more join to form a single one) to cater to specific use cases. Think about the birth of SRE. It was born because the principles of DevOps were missing roles & responsibilities required to take care of highly scalable systems. If we fast forward a little from that point,", "The DevOps space has split into three in the past couple of years \u2014 core DevOps, DataOps and DevSecOps.", "In the current landscape, the roles and responsibilities of these personas can be defined as follows", "1\ufe0f\u20e3 DataOps Engineer \u2014 keeping the data systems up from an infrastructure point-of-view and deal with day-to-day issues with data infrastructure. A cross between a DataOps Engineer, a DBA and a SRE is a Data Reliability Engineer.", "2\ufe0f\u20e3 Data Engineer \u2014 creating and maintaining data pipelines, modelling data for the data warehouse, loading data into data warehouses & data lakes. Ensuring that the data is reliable for consumption by the business.", "3\ufe0f\u20e3 Data Analyst \u2014 analysing data from a business point-of-view, creating reports, having a very good understanding of all the data in the system, and supporting business decisions.", "4\ufe0f\u20e3 Data Scientist \u2014 understanding the business thoroughly, building statistical and machine learning models, making predictions, and supporting business decisions.", "There are many more personas. I\u2019ll be talking about those in the future. But for now, let\u2019s get back to understanding more about DataOps.", "Just like you need a program/project/product manager to sit between the engineering teams and the business teams, you need a DataOps person to sit between your engineers and analysts. In the larger scheme of things, the idea behind having this new role is to reduce the amount of friction between engineering and analytics teams while delegating specific responsibilities to these newly defined roles.", "Short answer, no. DataOps is mostly about infrastructure but it\u2019s more than just that. Borrowing from something Brittany-Marie Swanson of Facebook \u2014", "It (DataOps) focuses on cultivating data management practices and processes that improve the speed and accuracy of analytics, including data access, quality control, automation, integration, and, ultimately, model deployment and management.", "The goal is well stated. I have already talked about automation, integration and deployment previously. What about data access? Isn\u2019t data access role of a Database Administrator? Well, the reality of our times is that the Database Administrator role is only a reality for legacy processes and infrastructures. One or more such roles have been subsumed by one of the newer roles like that of a Data Engineer, a DevOps Engineer, a Site Reliability Engineer or a DataOps Engineer. The same applies when we talk about Quality Control.", "Every agile team in a growth company will need DataOps engineer. DataOps is a reality now. In the next year or so, you\u2019d see more and more job opening for DataOps Engineers along with other similar roles like Database Reliability Engineer. Hopefully, data teams understand the need for this role earlier rather than later making the suffering of data engineers and analysts bearable and less painful.", "1\ufe0f\u20e3 \u2192 Difference between DataOps & DevOps", "2\ufe0f\u20e3 \u2192 Is DevOps related to DataOps", "Your home for data science.
