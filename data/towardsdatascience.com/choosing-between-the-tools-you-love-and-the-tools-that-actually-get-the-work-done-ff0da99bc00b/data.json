It matters that you did.\u2015 Cassandra Clare", "As people who constantly write code, we develop soft spots for certain tools and technologies that we tend to use all the time even if they are not the best or advisable tools to use in certain instances. It is then our responsibility to know when to draw the line between using the right and appropriate tool, technology, or method, and using tools we just like.", "For any project you take as a data scientist, AI or ML engineer, be sure to know what solution the problem requires you to build. If you understand the problem statement well enough, you will find it relatively easier to build and implement your solution. In building your data science, AI or ML solution, be sure to take it one step at a time. Building solutions using a systematic or step by step approach is very essential if you aim at building solutions that can stand the test of time. Be sure to follow the ethical and generally accepted workflow of a data science or ML project. At every stage in the workflow, do a research or case study on the possible ways to tackle the problem at hand and look up the tools and technologies available for you to use. When these things are done, weigh the pros and cons that come with using each of the available tools or technologies and by your own discretion, choose the ones that will help you achieve your goals in a much easier and faster way. If there are many available options to choose from, it will then boil down to choosing anyone with a good community and content built around it to help and guide you as you use that tool or technology so as you can effectively utilize the tool or technology.", "Choices are abundant, it is the right decision which is the rare one!\u2015 Mehmet Murat ildan", "As a data scientist, AI, or ML engineer, you have to keep an open mind so as to be able to work efficiently. Keeping favorites in terms of tools and technologies will only limit you and make you unaware of the vast options to choose from that will help you get your work done easier, faster, and more efficiently. Teaching yourself to learn, unlearn and re-learn will probably be the most important thing you can teach yourself if you constantly want to stay relevant in this field. You have to get rid of tools, technologies or methods that worked for you in the past and pick up newer and more efficient ones. Time is a very important factor in the life of a data scientist, AI or ML engineer and as such, you should always make it a point to settle for time-conserving tools, technologies or methods when working on any project.", "The right decision at the right time upon your choice can make your life like flowers; otherwise, it will be as thorns. The first one you will enjoy and the other one you have to bear.\u2015 Ehsan Sehgal", "I hope I have been able to educate you on the reasons why it is advisable to go in for options that actually work for you to make your work easier and faster instead of options that you have developed a soft spot for over the years of working.
