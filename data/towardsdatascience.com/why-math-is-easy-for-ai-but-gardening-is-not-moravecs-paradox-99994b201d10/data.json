It is because of the fact that the grand machinery of evolution has also been at perfecting and optimizing these skills in our species, harder and longer than anything else.", "Biology will not, after all, yield to the enterprise of artificial intelligence that easily.", "It could be argued that perhaps we should build our AI systems emulating the brain circuitry and design the various sub-processors mimicking the handiwork of evolution. In that way, we might be able to allocate the right amount of computing resources to the right sub-processors as human evolution has done.", "Whole brain emulation could be a possible path to AGI. There is a lot of debate around its feasibility and potentials. There is an exciting project to simulate the whole Neocortex of the human brain. We are not here to discuss those.", "Currently, the generally-accepted approach of building an intelligent agent is the \u2018mimick human behavior\u2019. This is equivalent to the famous Turing test, where the criteria for an AI agent to pass the test is only \u201c\u2018to appear human-like to an external examiner and force her to believe so\u201d. Note that the Turing test places no hard requirement on the AI agent to be actually human-like on the intelligence spectrum. It only requires the agent to enact a great mimicry.", "As long as we are designing AI systems by that principle, we might be, after all, guided by the limits placed by biology. It will take us a lot more computing power and ingenuity to build AI, which mimics everyday perception and locomotion tasks than to build AI, which only solves mathematical reasoning problems.", "Math is easy, gardening is real hard, after all.", "One wonders what implication it has for the jobs of the future. There are a lot of speculations about the white-collar jobs being replaced by AI technologies, much like how the industrial revolution replaced a lot of physical labor jobs or the automotive revolution made horse carriages obsolete.", "Alternatively, many pundits have been proclaiming a turnaround and a brighter future for the labor market with the so-called fourth industrial revolution which is brought forth by AI and robotics automation.", "Whatever the case may be, we saw that there is a strong scientific argument to believe that a host of jobs involving complex physical movement and subtle sensory perception (e.g. gardening, barber, elder care, childcare, sports, bartending, hotels and hospitality) are unlikely to be replaced by any robotic automation anytime soon. These jobs, although looking effortless on the surface, depend on skills that are perfected by millions of years of biological process optimizations, and require far more computations than many of the white-collar repetitive jobs which only depend on high-level reasoning, a relatively recent product of human evolution.", "The future is uncertain and exciting to behold.
