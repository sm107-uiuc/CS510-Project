This application is based on my opinions and they could be wrong. Always seek advice from a professional financial advisor before investing your money.", "Let\u2019s consider that I want to invest $1\u2019000 for a year. The interest that my local high street bank is offering for depositing the money for a 1 year fixed term is low. Hence, I am not happy with the yearly return it offers. As a consequence, I have decided to invest in equities by buying shares of various companies with my $1\u2019000. Although\u00a0they\u00a0are\u00a0riskier\u00a0comparatively,\u00a0they\u00a0can\u00a0potentially help\u00a0me\u00a0generate\u00a0more\u00a0in\u00a0return\u00a0for\u00a0taking\u00a0the\u00a0risk. So far, so good.", "I want to invest the investment money in such a way that I can earn the highest amount of return by taking the least amount of possible risk. For me, that is the optimum portfolio and the application which I will demonstrate in this article will explain how we can achieve it.", "The code is uploaded on Github and the link is provided here", "I have selected 7 potential companies and I want to find the optimum way of investing my money by buying their shares.", "In a nutshell, I will be performing the following steps:", "Note: In my future articles, I will implement a solution in Python which will determine the appropriate companies we should invest in. It will be using traditional analytical concepts along with the advanced machine learning concepts.", "Therefore, we need to find the optimum portfolio. The optimum portfolio is the one that generates the highest return for the lowest risk.", "The methodology revolves around the concept that as we increase the number of portfolios, we will get closer to the actual optimum portfolio.", "This is going to be our chosen optimum portfolio to invest in.", "Note: As I have big future plans for this application, I am going to architect and design the application in a componentised manner so that the application can be easily enhanced in the future. I will also explain the architecture and design of the application in this article.", "Read this article that explains how investment management works", "At a high level, we need to perform the following seven steps which are illustrated below:", "This is our business case. The application we need to implement will perform these steps in a way that we can easily extend and enhance each of the steps in the future. I will explain it in detail in this article.", "For each asset, we are going to generate the following measures:", "The first step is to calculate the returns of the assets in your portfolio.", "For us to calculate the asset returns, we need to perform the following two steps:", "2. Then we need to compute their geometric returns by calculating the following equation:", "The returns are generated so that we can standardised the stock prices so that they can be compared.", "The asset returns which were computed above are all 2-dimensional as there is a time axis involved. We now need to compute a single number to represent the returns of the assets. One of the most common ways is to compute the mean of the returns which is known as the expected returns.", "To compute the asset expected mean return, we need the mean of the returns of each stock:", "Now are ready to compute the expected return of the portfolio. The portfolio holds the assets together. The assets within the portfolio have been allocated a proportion of the total investment amount. As an instance, the portfolio might hold 40% of asset ABC and 60% of asset DEF.", "From the asset expected return, we can compute the expected return of the portfolio. It is calculated by computing the weighted average:", "The risk of an asset can be computed using a number of risk measures. One of these measures is the standard deviation which can inform us of how the price of an asset deviates from its mean. As an instance, some of the assets might be negatively correlated with each other, implying that as the value of the first asset moves down, the value of the negatively correlated asset increases. This shows us that the risk of a portfolio is not a simple sum of the risks of the individual assets.", "The volatility of the portfolio is the risk of the portfolio. The volatility is computed by calculating the standard deviation of the returns of each stock along with the covariance between each pair of the stocks by using this formula:", "Volatility in this instance is the standard deviation i.e. the total risk of the portfolio.", "Standard deviation measures the dispersion of the values around the mean.", "We could have invested our money into a savings account (risk-free) and earned a return without taking any risk. How can we decide whether the return we earned is worth the risk we took? As a result, we can compute the Sharpe Ratio.", "The final step is to compute the Sharpe ratio of each of the portfolios. Sharpe Ratio is the amount of excess return over the risk-free rate as the relevant measure of risk:", "If you want to read more on the investment performance measures then read this article:", "For the sake of simplicity, before I document the technical details, I wanted to demonstrate the final results in a step by step manner. I will take the bottom-up approach as it will help us understand the concepts better.", "In this section, I will demonstrate the concept using visual charts that the application produces for each of the steps so that we can understand the concepts better.", "Note: All of the data that I am going to explain below is saved automatically in an Excel spreadsheet by the code.", "So far we have understood that the application will fetch historical stock prices for our 7 selected companies. It will then generate 10'000+ portfolios by calculating the return, risk and Sharpe ratio of each of the portfolios.", "Amongst these portfolios, it will indicate the following three portfolios:", "Once I executed the application, the 10'001 portfolios with their risk-return trade-off are displayed:", "Each circle is a unique portfolio. x-axis is the risk and y-axis is the return of the portfolio. The colour of the portfolio is the Sharpe-Ratio.", "We can see that the relationship is not perfectly linear. When an investor combines the assets together in a portfolio, the comovement of the assets can help us diversify the risk and this is known as the risk-return trade-off. There are three diamonds on the chart:", "These are the details of the Portfolio 2187.", "The two key points to note are:", "We built a component that fetched the past 3 years of historical stock prices:", "The stock prices are time-series data.", "This is the snapshot of the data which the code stored in the StockPrices sheet of the excel spreadsheet as shown below.", "As you can see, we cannot simply compare ZM with SYMC because the stock prices are of different magnitude. Hence, we need to compute the returns to standardise the stock prices.", "We have computed the daily geometric returns:", "The returns are time-series data. This is the snapshot of the data which is stored in the Returns sheet of the excel spreadsheet as shown below.", "Note: Are historical returns the right choice? Should we instead generate different measures? I will implement a superior application in the future that demonstrates how we can implement time-weighted returns instead.", "The code then prepares the covariance matrix:", "The covariance matrix is stored in the Covariances sheet of the Excel spreadsheet as shown below:", "The code generates 10\u2019001 portfolios where one of the portfolios is the one where we allocate the investment equally on the 7 assets. A constraint is imposed on all of the 10\u2019000 portfolios that the sum of their allocations need to be 100%. This implies that we are only going to buy the assets.", "The code plots the portfolios on a Risk-Return chart, where the y-axis is the return of the portfolio and x-axis is the risk of the portfolio.", "We can see that the three portfolios are marked. The green diamond is our optimum portfolio.", "The portfolios are stored in the MonteCarloPortfolios sheet of the Excel spreadsheet as shown below:", "We can then find the allocations of the Portfolio 2187 (our optimum portfolio as pointed out in the chart) and then invest in the portfolio.", "The risk, return and Sharpe ratios of all of the generated portfolios are stored in the MonteCarloPortfolioRatios sheet as shown below:", "Finally, I am going to document the code which I implemented.", "I will start this part by explaining how to architect and design the application. I will be explaining each component in detail along with the code.", "The core of the design of this application revolves around just one concept:", "When the application runs, it will produce a large amount of data such as stock prices, their returns, covariance matrix, portfolios and their allocations along with their risk, return and Sharpe ratio. The Python code will also save all of this data in an Excel spreadsheet.", "Please access the entire code on the GitHub by clicking here", "The following folder structure is created in C: drive.", "The following Python files are placed in the code folder", "We will work on the documents and tests folder in future articles.", "The aim is to implement a configurable application. The plan in the future is to implement superior metrics for risk and return. Additionally, we would want the code to automatically fetch the right companies.", "As a consequence, I have implemented an area in the code where the configurable settings are stored:", "The key to note is that the risk and return functions, along with the number of portfolios and the symbols of the companies are stored here. This will allow us to add new companies or generate new portfolios and alter the risk function without changing the other parts of the code.", "When the code is executed, it will output the data in an excel spreadsheet which will be stored in PortfolioOptimisationPath = \u2018C:\\Temp\\PortfolioOptimisation.xlsx\u2019", "The application is heavy on object-oriented design. As a result, a number of objects are instantiated in the application. We want to take out the creation of the objects from the usage of the objects. Hence the responsibility of the object factory is to instantiate the required objects for us.", "If we want to change the implementation then we will only change the logic there. This will allow us to easily extend the functionality in the future.", "As an instance, in the next phase, we can implement a web_companies_extractor class that would get the names of the Nasdaq 100 companies by scrapping the Wikipedia web page. All we would need to do is to return web_companies_extractor from the function get_companies_extractor()without changing the rest of the code.", "The sole aim of the companies extractor is to return a data frame which has all of the required companies information populated.", "In this instance, the static companies extractor, as the name implies, returns the static list of companies which are configured in the settings.py file.", "The purpose of the price extractor is to get the stock prices of the required assets for our target start and end date.", "The code that calculates risk and returns are located in the risk_return_calculator class.", "As we introduce superior risk metrics, we will add the metrics here and change the configuration file accordingly. This will then allow us to easily maintain and enhance the features in the future. As an instance, I am planning to implement EWMA to compute the expected returns of the assets. All I would do is to implement the method in risk_return_calculator and point to the required method in the settings.py file.", "This is the main class that generates 10'001 portfolios for us.", "The key to note is that it is instantiated with the risk and return functions. It simply generates a portfolio with equal allocations and 10\u2019000 portfolios with randomly generated allocations. The sum of allocations for each portfolio is 100%, implying that we are only interested in buying the assets.", "It then calculates the risk, returns and Sharpe ratio for each of the portfolios.", "This file prepares the required charts for us.", "The intermediate data along with the final portfolios are stored in an excel file. The saving of data is performed by the file repository.", "The Monte Carlo simulator generates the allocations along with the risk, return and Sharpe ratio for each of the portfolios in a data frame with the following shape:", "However, the chart plotter expects 3x1D arrays of risk, returns and Sharpe ratio:", "The mapper maps the data which is the output of the Monte Carlo simulator in the required input format for the Chart Plotter.", "This is an example of a single responsibility pattern. Each component/class has its own clear responsibility. This feature allows us to easily maintain and extend the application in the future.", "When we started the article, we outlined the 7 steps of the process.", "The main file executes the steps in the right order", "We implemented a Main.py file which runs all of the steps above:", "Note the function generate_optimum_portfolio() executes the steps in the right order:", "This functionality demonstrates how we can implement a solution that delegates the tasks to the functions that are responsible for executing their responsibilities. It then helps us build a maintainable application.", "Please access the entire code on the GitHub by clicking here", "This is a working solution that gets us an optimum portfolio. Now that the framework is built, we can easily enhance it. I will be adding the following features:", "If you want to see these next steps implemented then please let me know.
