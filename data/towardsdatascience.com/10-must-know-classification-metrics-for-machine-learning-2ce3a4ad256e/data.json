Depending on the number of classes target variable includes, it can a binary or multi-class classification.", "Evaluating a machine learning model is just as important as building it. In this post, we will go over 10 metrics for evaluating the performance of a classification model.", "The optimal choice of metric usually depends on the characteristic of the data and the given task. I will also explain when a particular metric might be a better fit than the other ones.", "The metrics we will cover in this article are:", "It is simply the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the number of all predictions.", "If a model correctly predicts 90 observations (i.e. data points) out of 100, the classification accuracy is 90%.", "In some cases, the accuracy might be misleading. Assume we are creating a model to perform binary classification on a data set with an unbalanced class distribution. 93% of data points are in class A and 7% in class B.", "The model can achieve an accuracy of 93% just by predicting every observation as class A. What if it is crucial to detect class B correctly and we cannot afford to misclassify any class B samples (i.e. cancer prediction)? In such cases, we cannot use accuracy to evaluate a model unless we can somehow manage to eliminate the imbalance class distribution.", "Confusion matrix does not return a numerical value as an evaluation. In that sense, it is hard to call it a metric. However, confusion matrix provides valuable insight into predictions.", "Confusion matrix goes deeper than classification accuracy by showing the correct and incorrect (i.e. true or false) predictions on each class. In case of a binary classification task, a confusion matrix is a 2x2 matrix. If there are three different classes, it is a 3x3 matrix and so on.", "Let\u2019s also explain the terms in the confusion matrix.", "The desired outcome is that the prediction and actual class are the same.", "Precision is mainly used in binary classification tasks. It focuses on the positive predictions.", "Precision is the ratio of the correct positive predictions to all positive predictions. In a sense, it evaluates the model only based on the positive predictions.", "Precision measures how good our model is when the prediction is positive.", "For an email spam detection model, we try to maximize precision because we want to be correct when an email is detected as spam. We do not want to label a normal email as spam (i.e. false positive). On the other hand, we can afford not to catch a few spam emails.", "Recall is also used in binary classification tasks. It focuses on the positive class.", "Recall is the ratio of the correct positive predictions to all observations in the positive class. Thus, it evaluates the model based on its ability to predict the positive class.", "Recall measures how good our model is at correctly predicting positive classes.", "For a tumor detection task, we need to maximize recall because we want to detect positive classes as much as possible. We cannot afford to misclassify any positive class (i.e. a case with a tumor).", "It is important to understand the difference between precision and recall. Precision is based on the positive predictions whereas recall is based on the positive class.", "F1 score is the weighted average of precision and recall.", "F1 score is a more useful measure than accuracy for problems with uneven class distribution because it takes into account both false positive and false negatives.", "The best value for f1 score is 1 and the worst is 0.", "Log loss is one of the most commonly used classification metrics. It is also known as the cross-entropy loss.", "Classification algorithms usually output probability values for an observation belonging to a particular class. Class label is assigned as the label with the highest probability.", "Unlike the previous metrics we have discussed, log loss takes the probability values into consideration rather than the assigned labels. Thus, it usually provides a more robust evaluation.", "When calculating the log loss, we take the negative of the natural log of predicted probabilities. The more certain we are at the prediction, the lower the log loss (assuming the prediction is correct).", "Log loss is a very important metric and concept. It is usually the choice of evaluation for Kaggle competitions. If you\u2019d like to read more about log loss, I previously wrote two articles which are \u201cAll the way from information theory to log loss\u201d and \u201cWhy we care about the log loss\u201d.", "Sensitivity, also known as the true positive rate (TPR), is the same as recall. Hence, it measures the proportion of positive class that is correctly predicted as positive.", "Specificity is similar to sensitivity but focused on negative class. It measures the proportion of negative class that is correctly predicted as negative.", "Specificity can be related to the false positive rate (FPR). The FPR is equal to 1 minus specificity.", "In the previous section, we mentioned that the predicted class label is determined according to the returned probability values. In case of binary classification, we deal with the probability of the positive class. Normally, if the probability of the positive class is higher than 50%, the predicted class label is the positive class.", "However, we can change this threshold value of 50%. For instance, if the threshold is set as 70%, the model predicts an observation as positive only if the predicted probability is greater than 70%.", "Adjusting the threshold value changes some of the predicted labels. Besides, the performance of the model might slightly change depending on the threshold value. The following is an example that shows how predicted classes change according to the threshold value.", "The real performance of a binary classifier depends on the threshold value. In that sense, ROC curve provides a robust and thorough evaluation of the performance. It summarizes the performance of a classifier by combining confusion matrices at all threshold values.", "ROC curve has two axes both of which take values between 0 and 1. Y-axis is the true positive rate (TPR) and x-axis is the false positive rate (FPR).", "We aim to increase the true positive rate (TPR) while keeping false positive rate (FPR) low. As we can see on the ROC curve, as TPR increases, FPR also increases. So it comes down to decide how many false positives we can tolerate.", "ROC curve gives as an overview of model performance at different threshold values. AUC is the area under ROC curve between (0,0) and (1,1) which can be calculated using integral calculus. AUC basically aggregates the performance of the model at all threshold values. The best possible value of AUC is 1 which indicates a perfect classifier. AUC is zero if all the predictions are wrong.", "Note: AUC is not dependent on classification threshold value. Changing the threshold value does not change AUC because it is an aggregate measure of ROC.", "ROC curve and AUC are mainly used in binary classification tasks but they can be extended to in multi-class problems as well.", "There is not an optimal and easy-to-find choice for all tasks. We need to clearly define the requirements and choose the most appropriate metric based on the requirements.", "The choice of metric also depends on the structure of the data. For instance, unbalanced class distribution prevents us from using the classification accuracy.", "Thank you for reading. Please let me know if you have any feedback.", "Your home for data science.
