Santa already has his own factories and automated machines to help him make cookies. As you know, there\u2019s no perfect machine and production process, so there is a variance between different bags of cookies.

How do we validate Santa\u2019s words?", "Here, is where \u201chypothesis testing\u201d comes in.", "To implement hypothesis testing, firstly, let\u2019s set up our null hypothesis (H0) and the alternative hypothesis (H1). As a reasonable person, we should not suspect others without having any evidence. So, we assume Santa is honest about his business (H0). If we want to check whether his cookies is less than 500g, we need to collect data and have enough evidence to support our guess (H1). So\u2026we have the hypothesis statement set up as follows:", "Since we are unsure about how our population distribution looks like, I use the dashed line to represent possible distributions. If Santa\u2019s claim is true, we could expect one bag of cookies has a distribution with a mean weight equals to 500g (left picture). However, if Santa's claim is not true and the mean weight of cookies is less than 500g, the population distribution should look differently (any of right picture).", "Cool!

Then, if we calculate the sample mean (x\u0304) from each sample dataset, we could get m data points of the sample mean (x\u0304). Use these data points, we could draw a distribution of sample mean (x\u0304).

We standardize our value so that the mean value of distribution always equals zero. The benefit of standardization is that statisticians already generate a table that includes the area under each standardized value. So that we don\u2019t need to calculate the area case by case. All we need to do is to standardize our data.", "How to standardize? In our case, we use the z-score to transform our data. And z-score is the Test Statistic in our case.", "The below picture shows the sampling distribution of the test statistic (z-score). We can see that if our sample data exactly equal to the null hypothesis (the population mean =500g, the sample mean = 500g), we should have the test statistic equals to 0.

Then, what we really want to know is: how likely (probability) we get this sample data if the null hypothesis is true?", "To answer this question, we need to calculate the probability.
