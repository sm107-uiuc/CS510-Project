Some of the major challenges in NLP include speech recognition, natural language understanding (e.g., text understanding), and natural language generation.", "One of the early applications of machine learning in text understanding is email and message spam detection [1]. With the advancement of deep learning, many new advanced language understanding methods have been published such as the deep learning method BERT (see [2] for an example of using MobileBERT for question and answer).", "The other popular method in NLP is Named Entity Recognition (NER). The main purpose of NER is to extract named entities (e.g., personal names, organization names, location names, product names, etc.) from unstructured text. There are many open source NLP libraries/tools with NER support such as NLTK and SpaCy [3]. Recently Spark NLP [4] gets more and more attention due to its more complete list of supported NLP features [5][6].", "It seems to me that the development of Spark NLP [4] is based on Ubuntu Linux and OpenJDK. Thus it\u2019s straight forward to setup environment for Spark NLP in Colab (see instructions and code examples) since Colab uses Ubuntu operating system.
