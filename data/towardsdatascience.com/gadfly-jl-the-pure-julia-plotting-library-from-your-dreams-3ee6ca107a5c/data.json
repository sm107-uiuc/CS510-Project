Plots.jl is a simple library that provides ports to Python\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["If you have been working with Julia for even a short amount of time, you might be familiar with a plotting library called Plots.jl. Plots.jl is a simple library that provides ports to Python libraries such as Plot.ly and Matplotlib with simple functional methods like plot() and scatter(). While this is certainly a great way to get around creating an entirely new library for use in the Julia programming language, it also presents a few problems.", "Firstly and most importantly, interpreting Python with Julia creates a lot of problems with performance. From just simply importing Plots.jl to actually plotting values, the performance with Plots.jl is absolutely abysmal! On top of not being Julian, a lot of the software is missing in the Julia version, and many features are entirely overlooked. While GR is likely the most promising back-end for Plots.jl, it lacks a lot of the great features that might be available for you with Pythonic libraries. Despite this, I do have an article you could check out to improve your GR visualization skills with Plots.jl:", "So with these serious fundamental flaws with Plots.jl, it is easy to see why scientists have looked elsewhere for great statistical visualization in the Julia language. One of the best options I have looked at is a statistical graphing library called", "First and foremost, it should be noted that Gadfly is very similar to another library for which I am the creator, called Hone.jl. The two both use the same back-end, Compose.jl, for drawing vector graphics in Julia. The similarities might not end there, but there are also a lot of key differences between them, such as Hone\u2019s object-oriented and modular methodology which is not at all in line with Gadfly\u2019s. Despite this, Gadfly does take a very interesting methodology in its own right, and works pretty differently than other plotting libraries that you might draw some similarities to.", "With the alternatives outlined and often far more popular with Julia users, why might you want to use Gadfly? Firstly, Gadfly is Julian. This of course means that it is not only fast, but well-suited to the Julia language \u2014 something that cannot be said for its Plots.jl counterparts. For me, this is a huge advantage as not only do you not need to deal with the performance issues that Plots.jl claims, but it also becomes relatively straightforward to work with.", "Another great thing about Gadfly is its out-of-the-box interactivity. Plots are interactive by nature, and comparable to something like Plot.ly. This is a concept that is not usually seen anywhere else inside of the Julia language, so having it is bold and unique to Gadfly.", "Gadfly.jl on the surface follows the simple methodology that most Julia users are familiar with. We can create a simple plot using the plot() method, with two key-word arguments, X and Y.", "Here is where things get a bit different. Within Gadfly, there is an exported module called \u201c Geom.jl.\u201d Rather than using a separate method to create a line-plot, we can simply use the same method just with added geometry from this module.", "Likewise, we could add a color key-word argument to change the color of our geometry.", "Furthermore, we could use more geometry from the Geom.jl module, such as the histogram:", "You can also quickly plot syntactical outcomes with Gadfly, as well, allowing for quick results like this:", "Gadfly.jl is a fantastic plotting library that takes an interesting approach to problems that we have seen solved in other ways before. In my personal opinion, the approach that the module takes makes it better-off and a lot easier to use than many of its competitors. On top of that, it is of course written in pure Julia which gives it speed and ease of use that is simply unrivaled with similar packages inside of the language.", "Overall, I would say if you are working with copious amounts of data in the Julia language, Gadfly is most certainly worth a Pkg.add(). It will give you ways of looking at data that will improve your understanding and analysis far over what something like Plots.jl is capable of. Although I would certainly say that Plots.jl still might have its place, and certainly has its uses, I would also like to imply that Gadfly completely outshines it as the plotting library of Julia\u2019s dreams.", "Your home for data science.
