Indeed, tech companies and consumer brands alike are already experimenting with GANs.", "In this article, I will share what have I learned as an AI Consultant involved in the development of several PoCs based on GANs, help you better understand their technical limits, and their importance from a strategic business perspective.", "Indeed, my main tasks are to figure out how GANs can transform our business models, predict their impacts on our internal processes and identify promising startups using GANs for possible collaborations.", "To put it simply, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of Machine Learning frameworks that operates by pitting two neural networks against one another.", "The GAN architecture was first described in the 2014 paper by Ian Goodfellow, et al. titled \u201cGenerative Adversarial Networks.\u201d It is a system that is efficient in producing, evaluating, and reworking a creation, which is why it has been referred to as the creative-side of AI.", "This neural network architecture has shown impressive improvements over previous generative methods, such as variational autoencoders or restricted boltzmann machines.", "Without getting too much into details, one neural network, called the generator, generates new data. In the same time, the other neural network , called the discriminator, evaluates them for authenticity. The discriminator decides whether each instance of data it reviews belongs to the actual training dataset or not.", "The generator output is connected to the discriminator input. By using backpropagation, the discriminator\u2019s classification provides a signal that the generator uses to update its weights. The feedback loop between the two improves the performance of each other.", "In most cases, GANs can be used where generative models and techniques like Variational Autoencoders and pixelRNNs are used. Most GANs projects rely on image data and use Convolutional Neural Networks as the generator and discriminator models. The advantage of using GANs being that they are faster and easier to train than traditional approaches like boltzmann machines.", "Most of the applications seem to be related to image/content generation, but the possibilities are very numerous.", "The possibility of conditionally generating an output makes GANs very interesting for companies.", "The fact that GAN models can be conditioned on an example from a domain, such as an image is a game-changer. Indeed, this allows for applications such as:", "From a consultant perspective, I tend to see GANs more as a new way to formulate problems rather than just being a specific algorithm. Indeed, they can be used to re-formulate & solve several existing business and ML problems in new ways.", "The first immediate application that we have in mind for GANs is related to data generation for our internal projects. Indeed, one thing all data scientists can agree on is that we always need more relevant data.", "Depending on the use case, we believe GANs can be used to produce new data in \u201cdata-limited situations\u201d. Even though, we can still rely on data augmentation technique or synthetic data, GANs represent an interesting alternative.", "Moreover, GANs can discover structure in the data that allows them to generate realistic data. This can be strategic if we can\u2019t see that structure by ourselves or can\u2019t rely on other existing methods.", "GANs have already been used for data augmentation, for example, to generate new training images for classification, to refine synthetic images, etc. The key idea here is to leverage GANs for new sample generation to improve other models. The results are very promising since we have been able to utilize synthetic images produced by GAN for data augmentation purposes in our internal projects.", "A great example of this would be medical images. Indeed, they can be expensive and time-consuming to collect. My company manufactures a lot of medical devices. As such, we are also interested in GANs applied to the medical imaging domain.", "Prediction #1: I expect to see more startups developing offers related to data creation using GANs. Tailored-made data creation using GANs can become a new business model for startups. They could either monetize the data created based on the nature of the project or time-invested.", "One of the major areas that GANs will impact is creativity. Today, we are already considering starting several PoCs related to image generation for our products. I believe \u201cCycleGAN\u201d will probably become the first solution to become widely available to companies.", "CycleGAN uses a cycle consistency loss to enable training without the need for paired data. In other words, it can translate from one domain to another without a one-to-one mapping between the source and target domain.", "We intend to use GANs to help us design our future products (photo-enhancement, image colorization, style transfer, \u2026). Indeed, by tools dedicated to sentiment analysis (social media data) based on Machine Learning, designers, and GANs, we could have access to new ideas and explore new unidentified trends and quickly determine if our targets will like them or not.", "Prediction #2: I expect to see some startups becoming specialized in helping brands enhance their creative process thanks to data and GANs. The role of a creative director could become \u201caugmented\u201d.", "Perhaps, in the near future, no-code AI platforms will develop an offer only dedicated to the creation of new designs based on a dataset that the user would have provided. Such business models could highly interest brands involved with design. The business outcome of GANs could be sold independently or be part of a subscription model.", "In general, the Marketing function will be greatly impacted by GANs. Our goal is to quickly enhance our Marketing department using GANs. Below, I have mentioned only some of the elements we are working on.", "Improvement of products descriptionFollowing up on this paper, we also believe that GAN models can replicate text patterns from successful product listings or descriptions, in our case on E-commerce websites.", "Indeed, even the greatest products can fail due to poor marketing. Our idea is to leverage GANs as a form of test marketing to predict and improve how consumers respond to new products.", "More or less using the Diehl-Martinez-Kamalu (DMK) loss function as a new class of functions that forces the model\u2019s generated output to include a set of user-defined keywords, we believe it would become possible to enable the GAN to recommend a way of rewording the phrasing of a product description (on a website or packaging).", "Prediction #3: I believe the Airbnb experience will motivate new startups to develop tools related to the creation of Marketing text samples. Depending on the product, startups could charge different prices to help small companies improve their Marketing actions.", "GAN-generated content will become increasingly difficult to distinguish from real content.", "Following up on this idea to improve processes related to E-commerce. Marketers know that it can be costly to create visuals featuring models because of lengthy photoshoots. GANs have already been used to create \u201cartificial\u201d models such as Lil Miquela. This idea of relying on GANs to create models that perfectly resembles our target audience could help us reduce our Marketing budgets and improve our brand image\u2026 if this approach proves to be scalable.", "Prediction #4: Startups specialized with GANs will develop an offer to create \u201cartificial models\u201d for small brands using social media. They might either \u201csell\u201d them or manage them by partnering with brands for sponsored content. Startups creating these models could also adopt the same business model as a traditional animation studio. We might also see new tools enabling Marketing professionals to create their own \u201cartificial model\u201d using a no-code platform through a subscription model.", "Without having to create an \u201cartificial model\u201d, we are also exploring the Pose Guided Person Generation Network. This research project was aimed at manipulating a subject within an image into different poses. The value in this would be that our product photographers could focus on taking one reference picture and let the GAN generate all the other product angles. As you can imagine, this would also translate to significant time and cost savings for an e-commerce business.", "Prediction #5: Major online marketplaces or large tech firms could develop a feature enabling sellers to automatically generate images for a given product thanks to GANs. Startups could also become specialized in the creation of visuals (for instance logos or videos) through GANs for businesses selling their products online.", "Obviously, some of you might be wondering what will happen to all the models and photographers. I believe that there will always be a market for \u201creal\u201d content and perhaps some customers will prefer promoting \u201creal content\u201d on social media. However, there will be an increased demand for capturing high-quality training data.", "Over the next decade, GANs will strenghten the generative media industry. I can envision applications in the movie industry (for instance: licensing an actor\u2019s face), Virtual Reality, design, art, etc. It is safe to assume that computer software companies such as Adobe will highly invest in GANs.", "Our customer segmentation and recommender systems will also be impacted the development of GANs. Indeed some researchers at Amazon India Machine Learning trained the ecommerceGAN (ecGAN) to achieve this result. Concretely, the ecGAN explores the space of all possible orders a customer could make and find out which orders a customer would actually make.", "The generator creates possible order combinations while the discriminator decides if that order is realistic. The other very interesting element is that the original training data set of the GANs can also be updated to include new trends, allowing GANs to recommend products that both current and future customers will actually want to buy together. We believe that this new model will increase the accuracy of product recommendations on websites.", "The same researchers at Amazon India Machine Learning developed the ecommerce-conditional-GAN (ec2GAN) to predict the demographics of the customer, selling price, and the general dates for sales. The ec2GAN was able to make accurate predictions with its generated scenarios that were similar with the real-world data. When used across customer demographics, prices, and seasons, the ec2GAN can provide invaluable information for retailers.", "Another key project we are thinking about is the combination of voice marketing, AIoT, and GANs.", "Indeed, our goal is to enhance our products by adding a feature that will enable users to ask, for instance, the following question, using a smart device, when looking at a product:", "\u201cCan you show me how I would look like if I bought this jacket during my last trip to the south of France.\u201d", "Voice Marketing: Strategies and tactics used to reach a target audience through voice-enabled devices powered by AI assistants such as Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple Siri.", "The idea of being able to leverage a generative model for a very specific output like the one above-mentioned could be a game-changer when it comes to Marketing experience and data collection.", "Prediction #6: I believe GANs will become embedded in all smart devices and will give users a more personalized experience. Large tech firms will probably quickly develop new features using GANs or Zero-shot learning and partner with brands to enable users to create unique content during their shopping experience.", "Finally, we are also highly interested in text-to-image synthesis. Imagine a tool where you could create new visuals by only giving their description. Beyond the creation of visuals for our products, we could use this tool to create infographics from text, or generate website designs.", "Despite these promising applications, it remains to be seen on which of these formulations GAN will tend to yield better performance than current ML solutions. Moreover, the answer may depend on whether the data is images, text or a combination.", "From a strategic point of view, GANs will further increase the need for companies to have proprietary data. It will become an even greater differentiating factor between companies.", "From a technical point of view, we are confronted with several issues regarding our internal PoCs. The most important one being scalability. Beyond the deployment issue, computationally intensive neural networks like GAN can be difficult to manage, and it often takes days to train them.", "I could also mention that GAN models are highly sensitive to the hyperparameter selections, can easily suffer from overfitting due to an unbalance between the generator and discriminator, the generator tends to collapse and as a result, produce limited varieties of samples or that the discriminator can get too successful that the generator gradient learns nothing.", "Your home for data science.
