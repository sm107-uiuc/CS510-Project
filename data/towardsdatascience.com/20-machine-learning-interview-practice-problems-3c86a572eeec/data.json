Here we go!", "Be sure to subscribe here and to my personal newsletter to never miss another article on data science guides, tricks and tips, life lessons, and more!", "Cross-validation is essentially a technique used to assess how well a model performs on a new independent dataset. The simplest example of cross-validation is when you split your data into two groups: training data and testing data, where you use the training data to build the model and the testing data to test the model.", "There isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all metric. The metric(s) chosen to evaluate a machine learning model depends on various factors:", "There are a number of metrics that can be used, including adjusted r-squared, MAE, MSE, accuracy, recall, precision, f1 score, and the list goes on.", "If you would like to learn more about how you can evaluate your machine learning model, check out my article \u2018How to Evaluate Your Machine Learning Model with Python Code\u2019!", "Recall attempts to answer \u201cWhat proportion of actual positives was identified correctly?\u201d", "Precision attempts to answer \u201cWhat proportion of positive identifications was actually correct?\u201d", "A false positive is an incorrect identification of the presence of a condition when it\u2019s absent.", "A false negative is an incorrect identification of the absence of a condition when it\u2019s actually present.", "An example of when false negatives are more important than false positives is when screening for cancer. It\u2019s much worse to say that someone doesn\u2019t have cancer when they do, instead of saying that someone does and later realizing that they don\u2019t.", "This is a subjective argument, but false positives can be worse than false negatives from a psychological point of view. For example, a false positive for winning the lottery could be a worse outcome than a false negative because people normally don\u2019t expect to win the lottery anyways.", "Supervised learning involves learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs [1].", "For example, if I had a dataset with two variables, age (input) and height (output), I could implement a supervised learning model to predict the height of a person based on their age.", "Unlike supervised learning, unsupervised learning is used to draw inferences and find patterns from input data without references to labeled outcomes. A common use of unsupervised learning is grouping customers by purchasing behavior to find target markets.", "Check out my article \u2018All Machine Learning Models Explained in Six Minutes\u2019 if you\u2019d like to learn more about this!", "There are two main ways that you can do this:", "R Squared is a measurement that tells you to what extent the proportion of variance in the dependent variable is explained by the variance in the independent variables. In simpler terms, while the coefficients estimate trends, R-squared represents the scatter around the line of best fit.", "However, every additional independent variable added to a model always increases the R-squared value \u2014 therefore, a model with several independent variables may seem to be a better fit even if it isn\u2019t. This is where adjusted R\u00b2 comes in. The adjusted R\u00b2 compensates for each additional independent variable and only increases if each given variable improves the model above what is possible by probability. This is important since we are creating a multiple regression model.", "A method common to most people is cross-validation, splitting the data into two sets: training and testing data. See the answer to the first question for more on this.", "NLP stands for Natural Language Processing. It is a branch of artificial intelligence that gives machines the ability to read and understand human languages.", "There are a couple of reasons why a random forest is a better choice of model than a support vector machine:", "In its simplest sense, PCA involves project higher dimensional data (eg. 3 dimensions) to a smaller space (eg. 2 dimensions). This results in a lower dimension of data, (2 dimensions instead of 3 dimensions) while keeping all original variables in the model.", "PCA is commonly used for compression purposes, to reduce required memory and to speed up the algorithm, as well as for visualization purposes, making it easier to summarize data.", "One major drawback of Naive Bayes is that it holds a strong assumption in that the features are assumed to be uncorrelated with one another, which typically is never the case.", "One way to improve such an algorithm that uses Naive Bayes is by decorrelating the features so that the assumption holds true.", "There are a couple of drawbacks of a linear model:", "Another way of asking this question is \u201cIs a random forest a better model than a decision tree?\u201d And the answer is yes because a random forest is an ensemble method that takes many weak decision trees to make a strong learner. Random forests are more accurate, more robust, and less prone to overfitting.", "Mean Squared Error (MSE) gives a relatively high weight to large errors \u2014 therefore, MSE tends to put too much emphasis on large deviations. A more robust alternative is MAE (mean absolute deviation).", "Extreme violations of these assumptions will make the results redundant. Small violations of these assumptions will result in a greater bias or variance of the estimate.", "Multicollinearity exists when an independent variable is highly correlated with another independent variable in a multiple regression equation. This can be problematic because it undermines the statistical significance of an independent variable.", "You could use the Variance Inflation Factors (VIF) to determine if there is any multicollinearity between independent variables \u2014 a standard benchmark is that if the VIF is greater than 5 then multicollinearity exists.", "There are a couple of metrics that you can use:", "R-squared/Adjusted R-squared: Relative measure of fit. This was explained in a previous answer", "F1 Score: Evaluates the null hypothesis that all regression coefficients are equal to zero vs the alternative hypothesis that at least one doesn\u2019t equal zero", "Decision trees are a popular model, used in operations research, strategic planning, and machine learning. Each square above is called a node, and the more nodes you have, the more accurate your decision tree will be (generally). The last nodes of the decision tree, where a decision is made, are called the leaves of the tree. Decision trees are intuitive and easy to build but fall short when it comes to accuracy.", "Random forests are an ensemble learning technique that builds off of decision trees. Random forests involve creating multiple decision trees using bootstrapped datasets of the original data and randomly selecting a subset of variables at each step of the decision tree. The model then selects the mode of all of the predictions of each decision tree. By relying on a \u201cmajority wins\u201d model, it reduces the risk of error from an individual tree.", "For example, if we created one decision tree, the third one, it would predict 0. But if we relied on the mode of all 4 decision trees, the predicted value would be 1. This is the power of random forests.", "Random forests offer several other benefits including strong performance, can model non-linear boundaries, no cross-validation needed, and gives feature importance.", "A kernel is a way of computing the dot product of two vectors \ud835\udc31x and \ud835\udc32y in some (possibly very high dimensional) feature space, which is why kernel functions are sometimes called \u201cgeneralized dot product\u201d [2]", "The kernel trick is a method of using a linear classifier to solve a non-linear problem by transforming linearly inseparable data to linearly separable ones in a higher dimension.", "When the number of features is greater than the number of observations, then performing dimensionality reduction will generally improve the SVM.", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "[1] Stuart J.
