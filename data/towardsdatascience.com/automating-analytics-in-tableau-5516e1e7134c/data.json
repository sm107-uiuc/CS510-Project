BI/Data teams in companies of all shapes and sizes in nearly every industrial sector develop dashboards to effectively communicate key business metrics across the organization.", "One major advantage of using Tableau (which is often overlooked) is that it exposes a public API to programmatically handle nearly all tasks that can be carried out over the application GUI \u2014 Including administration.", "This is the part where Python comes in. The scripting capability and support from a vast number of libraries makes it a popular choice to handle end-to-end process automation in BI workflows.", "To effectively use the integrations, the Tableau workbook(s) should be available on one of the following:", "1. Tableau Server Lets you host workbooks and data sources in-house on your organisational servers or using cloud service providers.", "2.

You can create a free trial account to try out some of the test integrations and code snippets listed below.", "Upon creation of a Tableau Online account, save the credentials for username, password, tableau server address and site name. A single tableau server can have multiple sites and each of these sites hosts a collection of workbooks and datasources.", "There are a number of ways to integrate Python with Tableau Server, each based off a different use-case.", "Probably the best option out there for performing server related tasks from a Python script. It\u2019s an open source project managed by Tableau that wraps around the Tableau Server REST API.", "2. TabPy libraryAllows you to embed and execute Python scripts within Tableau\u2019s table calculations. It essentially allows Tableau to remotely execute Python code.", "3.

With Tabcmd, requests are always serialized per shell session. TSC can be multithreaded to tens or hundreds of workers providing a massive boost in the performance for its server requests. On Python, you can implement the ThreadPoolExecutor() with a map() on a list to a function that uses TSC and have it work to your advantage.", "This could potentially be useful in kick-starting fast and efficient BI reporting. Bringing this together with Python for Google Sheets/Excel or Python for SQL can supercharge your workflow.", "Tableau has rich documentation on using both TSC and Tabcmd. The snippets in this article scratch the surface of the multitude of actions that can be performed with them on a Tableau Server.
