Artificial intelligence (AI) has shown much promise since its original inception by pioneers like Alan Turing and his contemplation of machines that can learn to think and act like humans. Machine learning and its subset deep learning have inspired hope that machines can one day develop or even supersede human cognition. This is a potential technology that the Department of Defense (DoD) cannot and will not ignore. Whilst the DoD has established Directive 3000.09, putting in place a practical framework for developing autonomous weapon systems (AWS) and the lethal counterpart LAWS, their development of a comprehensive ethical framework that responds fully to national and international concerns is currently a mere afterthought. But when advancing towards a future where robots may take the lives of humans, shouldn\u2019t ethics be at the very heart of this technology?", "Both AWS and LAWS have the potential to save lives on the battlefield, according to advocates in the US and internationally. Fewer boots on the ground mean fewer military deaths and more precise and efficient missions means fewer civilian casualties. And whilst accepting the inevitability of war may be a depressing reminder of humanity\u2019s primal instincts, war machines around the world are well-oiled, well-funded, and developing with the times. China, Russia, Israel, Australia, the UK, and the EU are all developing AWS which have the potential to become killer robots as the technology advances. The US has no intention of being left behind. In fact, in the 2020 budget, the DoD is looking to spend US$4.6 billion on unmanned and AI systems combined.", "The US already has well-established government agencies like the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which funds research into robot autonomy and AI systems. Operating for the past sixty years, DARPA is now looking to the future with its AI Next Campaign. DARPA tackles high risk, high pay-off, and long-term projects with national security in mind. One of DARPA\u2019s AI Next projects is Context Reasoning for Autonomous Teaming (CREATE). CREATE\u2019s objective is to establish decision-making capabilities within smaller teams of autonomous agents so they are not reliant on centralised control. Think swarms of drones that can work together locally and make immediate decisions rather than check-in with command.", "Whilst DARPA works on some of the longer-term projects, the Joint Artificial Intelligence Centre (JAIC) was established in 2018 to keep up with and deploy tech at the speed it\u2019s being developed and used in the private sector and academia. The JAIC oversees the DoD\u2019s adoption of AI across its departments and is developing partnerships in academia and the private sector to gain access to rapidly developing and deployable AI tech. But it\u2019s not just national pressure that the DoD is feeling. Some attention has been given to the idea of an international AI race and even the frightening notion of a LAWS arms race. It is this speed and urgency that is most concerning. No state wants to lose the AI race. And with Russian president Vladimir Putin stating that \u201cWhoever becomes the leader in this [AI] sphere will become the ruler of the world\u201d, worried states are picking up the pace. The US stands a good chance of winning the race to develop and deploy autonomous weapons, but at what cost? Without the constraints of a well-considered ethical framework, the US may develop and deploy autonomous weapons in a manner that brings more shame than the 1945 atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.", "Organisations like Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Harvard Law School\u2019s International Human Rights Clinic (IHRC) are utilising objectives like the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots to slow down the AI arms race, centring discussions around the ethics of this technology. Questions are being asked about the ethics of detachment when it comes to waging war. Will autonomous systems make the decision to go to war easier since the risks are fewer? What does it mean to give a machine the power and will to kill? Who will be accountable if something goes wrong? There is a risk that in a bid to keep our hands clean in the dirty business of war, the bloodshed will become invisible from the sanitised war rooms where human officers oversee the lethal machines.", "On the international stage, the phrase \u201cmeaningful human control\u201d is discussed as a key component of the ethical development of LAWS. Yet no consensus has been reached as to what \u201cmeaningful human control\u201d would look like in reality. In the 3000.09 Directive, the DoD discuss appropriate levels of human judgement rather than control. The DoD does not rule out the possibility that fully autonomous weapon systems will be able to select targets and deploy lethal force without direct human involvement. However, semi-autonomous weapon systems will (and do) require human authorisation for the use of lethal force.", "Within the United Nations, the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons (CCW) has hosted international discussions on the future of LAWS, with some states and organisations calling for an all-out ban. But the world\u2019s big players (and big military spenders) China and the US are keen not to limit the potential of this technology. The US public, however, is not fully on board. In the US, 52% of respondents in a 2019 Ipsos poll were either somewhat or strongly opposed to the use of LAWS, whilst just 24% supported their use. The ethics of LAWS will be crucial in gaining public support should the US go on to develop fully autonomous weapons. The poll garnered opinions across 26 countries and found that 66% of people opposing the use of LAWS felt that such weapons cross a moral line. People simply aren\u2019t comfortable with the idea of a machine making the decision to take a human life.", "So, where does the DoD stand on the ethical development and use of LAWS? The DoD does acknowledge the importance of ethics in regard to LAWS, as they initially sought guidance from the tech industry before declaring a need for their own ethicist. However, the DoD has been working to develop AI tech for some time, with projects like Shakey the Robot dating back to 1966. More recently, in February 2019 the DoD unveiled its 2018 AI strategy. Yet, it wasn\u2019t until September 2019 that the DoD revealed its plan to hire an ethicist, indicating that developing a robust ethical framework is not an urgent priority. With the AI race heating-up and China aiming to be the AI world leader by 2030, who has time for ethics?", "JAIC Director Air Force Lt. Gen. Jack Shanahan notes that China\u2019s strong ties to academia and industry give them an edge in the AI race. Not to be outdone, the DoD has plans to strengthen their ties with a range of actors developing AI tech with dual-use capabilities. According to the 2018 AI strategy, the DoD intends to partner with academia and industry in providing AI knowledge and expertise for humanitarian assistance. This humanitarian face may make them more appealing partners, as some in the tech industry found working with the military morally distasteful. Google declined to continue with the Pentagon\u2019s Project Maven contract after its staff protested developing tech with lethal intent.", "Compared to fears of falling behind China, ethics simply aren\u2019t a priority for the DoD. And yet it may not be callousness that leaves ethics as a lagging priority. Currently, AI technology has only reached the point of allowing machines to perform some basic tasks at the same level as, or slightly higher, than humans. Image recognition and cancer detection are just two examples. We are decades away from developing the kind of technology that would allow machines to perform the range of complex cognitive tasks that humans are capable of, let alone combining that with robots that can move with human-like dexterity. With all the AI hype, it\u2019s tempting to think that killer robots are just around the corner, when in fact it could be decades before we are even close to developing that kind of complex tech. The DoD may be thinking that they have plenty of time to get serious about the ethics of LAWS. Meanwhile, DARPA and the JAIC are ploughing ahead with AWS research and development. And somewhere quietly in the background, the DoD is taking a leisurely approach to securing an ethicist and forming transparent ethical guidelines which would hold them accountable during their race to the AI finish line (if there is one).", "As we have seen with bias, what gets taught to AI systems becomes embedded and replicated. If LAWS are developed with ethics at the very heart of every aspect, and not a mere afterthought, then we increase our chances of creating machines that are better than us. It may not be possible to fully replicate humanity\u2019s consciousness within a machine, in which case the argument against killer robots may become stronger. When it comes down to it (and if technology allows), passing decisions of life and death to a machine that is more moral than we are may bring comfort instead of eliciting fear. If the DoD wants to lead the US into an AI arms race, it must do so from a robust ethical position that keeps up with rapid tech advances enlivened by the Great AI Race.", "Freelance writer exploring
