I dished out my Gojek app (similar to Uber Online Driver Service) and arranged to depart to my girlfriend\u2019s residence. With a smile and tidy clothes, he started a small chat with me which led to an hour conversation and inspired me to write this article. As a data scientist, I felt his sharing was meaningful in my professional life as a data professional and hopefully yours.", "Why would I fix my car? if within an hour, I can get an additional 50K (5 USD) extra?", "Counting all revenue, he earns an approximate 600k IDR (60 USD) income and 280k IDR (28 USD) net income per day. Ultimately, this is a good income considering the rate of the average wage in Jakarta which is 250k IDR (25 USD per day).", "I would love to formulate his key objective as this.", "In simple English: To maximize the number of trips within the shortest amount of time until the bonus is met. To do that, he needs to account for many different constraints: traffic jams, health conditions and accidents.", "Similarly, I would love to plot my key objective as the following:", "In simple English: To maximize the amount of impacts within the shortest amount of time until a certain minimum objective is met (MVP-Minimum Viable Product). To do that, I need to account for many constraints: team meetings, flurries of non priority tasks and unforeseen circumstances.", "I found that this key objective is relevant to me. At Google, we have the Performance System called Objective Key Results (OKR) where your performance is purely measured by your impacts. Here are some of the common OKRs that I used (Cloaked to not infringe Google\u2019s blogging policy)", "Utilize [data\u2026] to identify unknown phishing campaigns (Objective). Write X approved campaigns protecting X users per week (Key Results). Launch a new ML model in production, improving its recall by X% (Key Results)", "Simply put, these are examples of impacts metrics (Key Performance Indicators):", "One of the biggest enemies of Online Driver is the traffic jam. A bad driver would accept every request. A good driver prioritizes the Income per Hour on every trip.", "Similarly, the worst thing you could do as a data scientist is to accept every assignment and idea. Most of the project requests you received will have unknown impacts and feasibility (imagine projects to tune ML/make a new recommender/ cluster multiple site groups). You will need to assess each project. For example, should you build on an existing model? should you productionize or kill it and move on? Once you ranked them by Impact/Hour (Low hanging fruits), position yourself in the right project and plan your day to deliver impacts.", "Why do I take this project?", "Does this project produce an action or support to sustain? If no, then let it go. This decision is your biggest asset to avoid inefficiency and achieve key objectives.", "I have a friend who forgot the importance of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)and ended up wasting hours implementing a ML model that otherwise can be replaced with rule-based (if-else) logic. Many data scientists are fixated to implement technically complex models without understanding the business problem well. Too often, we lost sight of the impacts. This is not how to build your portfolio.", "Focus on the Impacts/Hour in everything that you do.", "This is the Gojek Driver\u2019s schedules.", "There is logical reasoning behind this schedule. First of all, he maximizes short trips in the morning by positioning himself at the market to improve his chance of receiving requests from shoppers. Since most people will go to the markets near their home, he can accumulate the volume of trips he needs early in the morning (eat the big frog) while avoiding rush hour.", "Once rush hour is over, he starts taking city requests and stations himself at city centers to take long distance orders. Finally, after 8 pm, he would look for the trip which gets him home easily.", "By knowing his objectives, he has the game plan to achieve the key results without burning out.", "Similarly, game your performance. If you work in an open office, find ways to a quiet and secluded place to conduct deep work. Find projects which relate to your interest and needs. Communicate to stakeholders and confirm the ground truth as early as possible. If you find yourself overwhelmed, then delegate the tasks. By planning your game plan, you avoid unnecessary wastage ahead and focus on delivering impacts", "Take Actions and maximize the likelihood for you to reach your key objectives.", "As a driver, he found that the Gojek clan is important, but soon found himself overwhelmed with the clutter. He quit the clan and collaborated with a small group of senior GoJek Drivers. This helps him make smarter relationship investments where each driver helps each other in productivity.", "Similarly, as a data scientist, Your goal is to find yourself in the middle of people smarter than you. Establish relationships with them with a clear objective and don\u2019t let your friendships and networks clutter your productivity. Invest time in your close friends and data-minded peers.", "I found that in large companies like Google and Visa, we work in a large mix of business stakeholders, engineers, and other data analysts. The most important steps to ensure you are producing impacts are to speak their languages and persuade them to support your ideas.", "Surprisingly, I have some \u201cdata scientists friends\u201d who do not even know system thinking and Dev Ops (Development Operations). They do not collaborate well with their peers. In the end, these projects were completed but not implemented to deliver production impacts.", "Therefore, know your key supports, and allocate time to communicate and achieve key objectives together. Remember, data science is teamwork.", "Find Driven Individuals to Avoid Clutter and Achieve Objectives together", "There are many benefits of remembering these lessons. First, you would use the key objectives to prioritize your projects based on Impacts/hour. Second, you are able to prune down non-priorities (unnecessary meetings, networking, etc). Finally, you find support to help achieve the key objectives.", "In conclusion, we have three key factors to consider in our Data Analytics career:", "I really hope this has been a great read and a source of inspiration for you to develop and innovate.", "Please Comment out below for suggestions and feedback. Just like you, I am still learning how to become a better Data Scientist and Engineer. Please help me improve so that I could help you better in my subsequent article releases.", "Thank you and Happy coding :)", "Vincent Tatan is a Data and Technology enthusiast with relevant working experiences from Google LLC, Visa Inc. and Lazada to implement microservice architectures, business intelligence, and analytics pipeline projects.", "Vincent is a native Indonesian with a record of accomplishments in problem-solving with strengths in Full Stack Development, Data Analytics, and Strategic Planning.", "He has been actively consulting SMU BI & Analytics Club, guiding aspiring data scientists and engineers from various backgrounds, and opening up his expertise for businesses to develop their products .", "Lastly, please reach out to Vincent via LinkedIn, Medium or Youtube Channel", "Your home for data science.
