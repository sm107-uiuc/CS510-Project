In this article, we apply Dylan Evans\u2019s way of thinking to assess:", "Weather forecasters use probabilistic forecasting by explicitly mentioning the degree of certainty whether a weather event will occur. They are often required to include in their forecasts the likelihood of a weather event occurring. When they predict \u201c90% chance of raining tomorrow\u201d, there is an 85% likelihood they are correct.", "Weather forecasters would score perfectly on calibration curves. In contrast, medical practitioners would show substantial overconfidence.", "When doctors were convinced that there were 90% chance their patients had pneumonia, only 15% of the patients were tested positive for pneumonia (see below). That is overestimation bias in its extremity.", "Doctors have much more faith in the accuracy of their diagnoses than the evidence actually warrants. They would rather be safe than sorry, even if it might result in more cases of false positives. A doctor would be facing a lawsuit if a patient in the late stage of a terminal illness was found to be a false negative.", "Have you noticed that physicians prefer using hedging words to describe how likely their diagnoses will pan out true?", "With hedging words such as \u201cpossibly\u201d, \u201clikely\u201d, \u201cpresumably\u201d, they can wiggle around the vague information they had conveyed so that they are less likely to be wrong.", "A weather forecaster\u2019s work is repetitive. He could promptly check if his weather forecast is true the next day. The questions \u201cWill it rain or snow tomorrow?\u201d, \u201cWhat is the possibility that Tokyo will be struck by typhoon on Friday?\u201d are well-defined. The answers are lucid and definite. Thus a weather forecaster can improve his risk intelligence rapidly by learning from immediate feedback.", "It is harder for a doctor to receive immediate feedback from his patients. The patient might not come back. The patient might be referred to another doctor. A lot of questions in medical field cannot be answered with exactness. Certain infectious diseases like Ebola and COVID-19 require prognostic screening tests, genome sequencing, contact tracing, data analysis and scrupulous monitoring.", "Questions such as \u201cDoes this new medicine have side-effects on the patient?\u201d, \u201cWhat treatment should be given to a COVID-19 patient with chronic medical conditions?\u201d may typically result in a change of medical diagnoses over the course of weeks, or months.", "The Dunning-Kruger effect is a cognitive bias rooted in a lack of risk intelligence. David Dunning and Justin Kruger suggested that incompetence not only causes poor performance, but also the failure to recognize that one is incompetent. Incompetent people are most likely to suffer from illusory superiority. They are more likely to overestimate their knowledge or ability out of overconfidence and a lack of self-awareness.", "Knowledgeable people grow more aware of the limitations of their knowledge as they gain more knowledge, even if this greater awareness could undermine their confidence. An erudite scholar might thus suffer from illusory inferiority. He might underestimate his own ability. He knows there is a lot of questions he doesn\u2019t know the answers yet.", "Your knowledge is often based on things you are not consciously aware of. It could be gut feeling, instincts or intuitions.", "People who are native speakers of English might not be aware of the grammar rules, but they could speak and write coherently and properly. Non-native speakers would have to spend years learning tenses, sentence structure and vocabulary to reach an adequately good level of mastery.", "University students might have learnt mathematical concepts and rules, but are unaware of how to apply it in a specifically hard problem. The mathematical fundamentals they have been trained are unknown knowns. But to mathematics prodigies, these problems would be just a piece of cake.", "Unbeknownst to them, mathematical prodigies are more skilled at calling out mathematical fundamentals to approach a problem. Mathematics prodigies who learnt mathematics at a very young age would have internalized mathematical concepts, methods and techniques. They are, simply put, better at seeing connections and turning the implicit known into explicit known.", "An expert gambler would purposely make a few obvious mistakes to gauge how well would his opponent play against him. If the opponent exploited his mistakes tactfully, the expert gambler would stop playing. He would only bet when he was confident he could win. Expert gamblers often understand their strengths, foibles, limitations and learn from their past mistakes.", "The desire to exhibit intelligence can inhibit risk intelligence. Knowing what you don\u2019t know can prevent yourself from succumbing to the illusion of explanatory depth.", "Bayes theorem can be useful for finding an unknown probability when we know other probabilities with certainty.", "How likely will an elderly aged 65 and above die from Covid?", "A Chinese and an American will have slightly different risks of dying. For a Chinese above 65 years old:", "P(dying from Covid | above 65 years old) = P(dying from Covid) * P(above 65 years old | dying from Covid) / P(above 65 years old)", "If a Chinese is aged 65 or above, he has 19.6% chance of dying from Covid.", "The American has 20.3% chance of dying from Covid.", "Bayes theorem only works if you can avoid committing base-rate fallacy. Different countries have different base rates. Countries with older demographics tend to have higher case fatality rates.", "If you visited a friend who had been watching a movie for 30 minutes, what would you predict the length of the movie?", "When Thomas Griffith and Joshua Tenenbaum asked people the exact same question, people were giving statistical estimations based on their everyday experience. By taking into account the base rate of movie run times, they unknowingly adopted Bayesian thinking.", "Griffith and Tenenbaum found that movie run times follow a Gaussian distribution, whereby the prediction values cluster around the mean (see below):", "It is not necessary that you have mastered the complex math theory of Bayes theorem or Gaussian distribution to arrive at the results above. Risk intelligence can be intuitive, as it seems.", "Fermi problems are math problems we will never know the exact answer to. If we can make reasonable assumptions and ball-park estimates, we can make an educated guess to come up with an approximate answer.", "Microsoft and Google like to grill their interviewees with Fermi problems to test their thinking skills. Be prepared for infamous questions like these:", "How many piano tuners are there in Chicago?", "If there is a significant number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy, why has our civilization never encountered any others?", "Fermi paradox can be solved using Drake equation.", "How many packets are needed to measure a single line of M&Ms to a distance of 100m?", "A regular M&M is about 1cm in diameter.", "One packet of M&Ms can make a single line of 30cm distance.", "How old are you if you are a million seconds old? A million hours old? A million days old?", "which means you are an 11-day old baby.", "which makes you a very old supercentenarian.", "which is impossible for a human, at least for now.", "Risk intelligence can prevent us from staying in ignorant bliss or overreacting fearfully. In general it is much more difficult to forecast pressing issues of geopolitics, macroeconomics and stock market trends.", "Surprisingly, everyone can methodically train for the ability to predict future. Philip Tetlock suggests the following pragmatic approaches. Take a brief training course on probabilistic reasoning and forecasting. Identify cognitive biases in your daily life. Read and discuss news with other forecasters. Join global forecast tournaments.", "Last but not least, stay open-minded and be willing to change your mind fast and often.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
