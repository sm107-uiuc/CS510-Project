But this method is a nice way to get started.", "Side note: there is a way to auto-shutdown using the \u201cscript mode\u201d method, but it requires some additional coding. This is an option you can explore, and if you want, you can read my article on script mode here.", "After I walk through creating an S3 bucket and spinning up a Sagemaker notebook instance, I will reference you toward some example code I wrote and have stored on GitHub. The notebook on GitHub walks through how to connect to your data in S3, and then walks through some Hyperopt + TensorFlow\\Keras code. In my Hyperopt example, I\u2019m doing hyperparameter search for a recurrent neural network.", "(One thing to note that\u2019s not mentioned in the notebook is that Hyperopt is optimizing on negative accuracy. The negative is important. Hyperopt wants to find the minimum of your cost metric, which in my case is accuracy. Therefore, using negative accuracy finds the network with the highest accuracy!)", "Okay, so if you\u2019re reading this article then you\u2019ve probably trained a neural network before. You might have even used sklearn to do neural net random search cross-validation, but you want to take it to the next level.", "First off, I recommend reading the following article on hyperparameter tuning. In short, Random Search actually does pretty great without having to run tons of iterations. But regardless of whether you\u2019re using random search or Bayesian methods, you might have run across the following problems\u2026", "1. Hyperparameter tuning on a neural network takes a LONG time (even with a GPU).", "2. Running long jobs on any free training platform (ex. Google Colab, Kaggle) usually ends up timing out.", "1. Buy a personal computer with a GPU (which is going to cost you, and a bigger one will be better)", "2. Rent a GPU on the cloud (also going to cost you)", "Personally, I eventually went out and bought a laptop with a GPU, but before I did that, I tried the cloud options. Having a personal GPU is great, but as you progress you\u2019ll find yourself needing more power, and you\u2019ll end up back in the cloud regardless (at least that\u2019s what I\u2019ve found).", "Okay, on with the show already, how do we use Sagemaker to build our neural networks!", "Seems like a logical first step. Go to the link below and click \u2018Create an AWS Account\u2019 (if you don\u2019t have an account already).", "So at this point you should be at the management console.", "Now follow the prompts to create your bucket, give it a name, etc. Make sure that you pick the region that you\u2019re in. I\u2019m in the east coast US, so for me N. Virginia works.", "If you\u2019re like me, and you\u2019re just playing around with Sagemaker and you don\u2019t care too much about permissions (because none of the information being stored is sensitive) then you can just click \u2018Next\u201d for pages 2\u20134.", "When you\u2019re done, you should have a new S3 bucket! Now click your S3 bucket name.", "That should take you into your S3 bucket where you can upload data! Click \u2018Upload\u2019, then \u2018Add Data\u2019 and select your data from your local machine, and follow the prompts. Again, I don\u2019t really care about permissions too much, so I just clicked \u2018Next\u2019 a lot after selecting my data.", "(Note: there is a cost to S3. So you probably want to delete your data set and maybe even your bucket when you\u2019re done.)", "Go back to \u2018Services\u2019 and find \\ click \u2018Sagemaker\u2019.", "(Note: we\u2019re going to kick off a notebook instance running on an ml.p2.xlarge which has a GPU and costs roughly $1.20/hr. When you\u2019re done training, make sure to shut down the notebook instance. Also note that this job IS GOING TO COST YOU MONEY!!)", "Click Notebook Instances > \u2018Create Notebook Instance\u2019", "Now we\u2019re going to give the notebook a name and make sure to select a ml.p2.xlarge to get a GPU instance.", "You might have to work through some permissions, and if you\u2019re like me, you can bypass a lot of this. (I\u2019m not going to cover any of this here). Also if you\u2019re like me, you might have some issues getting access to a GPU, in which case just contact support via the \u2018Support\u2019 drop-down, and submit a quota increase specifically for GPU instances. When your quota increase has been completed by AWS, you\u2019ll have to go back to \u2018Create Notebook Instance\u2019 and start over.", "Once you\u2019ve completed the \u2018Create Notebook Instance\u2019 steps, the notebook instance will now be created. This might take some time\u2026", "Once the instance is created, you should be able to click \u2018Open Jupyter\u2019 which will take you to Jupyter running on your new GPU instance\\machine!", "Once Jupyter is open, create a new \u2018conda_tensorflow_36\u2032 notebook by clicking the \u2018New\u2019 dropdown and selecting \u2018conda_tensorflow_36\u2032.", "Now you can check out my full notebook on GitHub which includes comments to figure out how to connect to your data, install hyperopt, and run your job! See full GitHub repo with notebook here.", "When you\u2019re done, remember to shut down your notebook instance by clicking on your notebook instance name and then clicking \u2018Stop\u2019. I would even recommend deleting the notebook instance, as well as revisiting your S3 bucket and deleting your bucket, otherwise leaving all of this work sitting on Amazon WILL COST YOU MONEY!", "Thanks, everyone and hope you found this helpful.
