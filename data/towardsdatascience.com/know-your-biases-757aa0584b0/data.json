You might ask a question irrelevant to your problem, wrongly define the population of interest, make a bug in your analysis, etc.", "One of the most vulnerable moments is the data collection. It\u2019s because what you get at this step is what you base your final decision on. Today, let\u2019s discuss a few common pitfalls that can make great disfavour of your perfect data collection process.", "First let us introduce our main enemy \u2014 bias. In statistics by bias we mean a systematic distortion of the data (on contrary to variance, which is chaotic). You can imagine an archer shooting a target and hitting just below the center all the time. In the same way e.g. your data on college students\u2019 height might be notoriously overestimating the measurements because of the faulty equipment.", "The problem is that you don\u2019t always know if and how your data is skewed. That\u2019s why it is important to be aware of the dangers just waiting to break your analysis.", "Many companies were forced to close the offices because of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Wherever possible, the workers do their job from home. Some IT companies, like Twitter or Facebook, have even decided to allow their employees to work from home indefinitely. Many people wonder whether it is a good decision. After all, aren\u2019t people less productive then? Imagine you are a director in a tech company and consider such move. You might want to find out how the people working in the industry feel about it and whether they have any problems working this way.", "Imagine you prepared a form with questions you are interested in and sent it out to the people. Let\u2019s discuss some scenarios.", "Scenario I: You sent out an email with the questions to all your employees.", "This is pretty convenient \u2014 you have all the addresses and maybe you even trust that your employees won\u2019t lie (more about that problem below). But in the first place you wanted to learn something about all the people in the IT industry, not only from your company. Your colleagues probably won\u2019t be a representative sample of the population. Maybe you have a cool office that everyone wants to get back to? Or your employees are highly motivated people who have no concentration problems at home? You don\u2019t know that.", "The way you collect the data excludes a part of the population from the sample. Hence it is not representative \u2014 this kind of bias is called undercoverage bias.", "Scenario II: In order to reach more people you posted the form on your company\u2019s public blog.", "Now everyone is covered \u2014 every person with an internet access can reach your form (and you assume that all IT workers have internet) so you don\u2019t leave anyone out. But is everyone equally probable to answer your questions? Since the article is posted on your company\u2019s blog, your employees will be more likely to read it and hence fill your form (even if they won\u2019t be the only ones to do it).", "Your sampling method prefers some people over others, resulting in a selection bias.", "Scenario III: You have hired a company specialising in polls to find a representative sample of IT industry workers and provide you with their email addresses.", "Seems perfect, right? You managed to contact a representative sample of a population you are interested in. There is still one problem \u2014 not everyone will reply. And the people that don\u2019t answer your question won\u2019t be just some random folks, they might have some common reason not to reply.", "That\u2019s why you might end up with a nonresponse bias. It\u2019s not enough to reach out to a representative sample \u2014 your answers are the data you are interested in at the end of the day.", "Scenario IV: Tired with failures you\u2019ve hired a hacker to block computers of a representative sample of IT industry workers until they fill out your form.", "This time it has to work, right? No way anyone will throw away their computer just to avoid filling some short form. But the fact that you got the answers does not mean that they are honest. After all, people are angry now and they might lie. They also know that you will somehow use them so they might trick you to believe something that suits them. Perhaps they are afraid that the data won\u2019t be properly anonymised and they don\u2019t want to admit to their unproductivity? Or maybe they want you to think that WFH is great and they will say that they love it just because they want to have this option?", "This is probably one of the most difficult situations to defend from \u2014 you get the answers but you don\u2019t know if they are true \u2014 we call it a response bias.", "Be aware that there are more kinds of biases that might sneak into your data and you should always consider what might be wrong. They include, but are not limited to observer bias, attrition bias, recall bias, etc. Wikipedia describes some of them. There is a great xkcd cartoon on survivorship bias too.", "Your data might look perfectly fine but it might lead you to wrong conclusions, even if it is just slightly off from the reality. It is hard to defend yourself from biases, but being aware of what might go wrong will help you avoid many mistakes.", "If you\u2019re interested to see some real life mistakes being made, we recommend having a look at a recent article by Cassie Kozykov about study on COVID-19 infections in New York City.", "This article has been written together with Tomasz Weso\u0142owski.
