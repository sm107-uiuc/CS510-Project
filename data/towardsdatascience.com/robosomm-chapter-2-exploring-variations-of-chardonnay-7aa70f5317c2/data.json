In this article, we will study variations in Chardonnay wines using a set of data science techniques called clustering.", "15,000 online reviews for Chardonnay wines published to www.winemag.com were scraped, including other attributes that might be of interest: the vintage, the price, the rating and the location of the winery.", "In studying the various types of Chardonnay, we are most interested in the perceptible features of the wines. To this end, descriptors were extracted from the text-based wine reviews, leveraging work from a previous chapter of the RoboSomm series.", "First, the reviews were normalized by removing punctuation, stopwords and converting the text to lower case. Inflections of words were standardized using a process called stemming. The 2,000 most common words and combinations of words (bigrams) were then extracted. This list of terms was filtered to preserve only those that could reasonably be extracted when blind tasting a glass of wine. In addition, words with ambiguous meaning (i.e. does \u2018acid\u2019 mean that there is high or low acidity in the wine?) were removed also.", "This process left roughly 500 normalized raw descriptors to describe our Chardonnays. A mapping system was used to map each raw descriptor onto a category (level 1), a high-level descriptor (level 2) and a low-level descriptor (level 3). An example of this has been provided below.", "For our clustering exercise, level 2 descriptors were used. This level is general enough to allow for consistent themes to appear across wine reviews, and specific enough for interesting differences between clusters to arise.", "In data science, clustering is a task of creating a grouping sets of similar data points. It is an unsupervised learning method, meaning that it draws references from a dataset without there being labeled responses. In this case, we set out to use clustering to learn how many types of Chardonnay there are and how these are different.", "Since our data is categorical in nature, we had to be mindful about choosing the right method for building our clusters. Many standard clustering algorithms such as k-means use Euclidean distance-based evaluation metrics to assign cluster membership. These do not work well for categorical data, where the difference in magnitude between values is meaningless.", "After exploring a few alternatives, we settled on the k-modes algorithm. This algorithm requires the number of clusters to be specified. Choosing the \u2018right\u2019 number of clusters, k, is no simple task! We used a combination of techniques (scree plot, average silhouette scores, silhouette analysis) to arrive at a value of k = 5. You can read more about this process in this Jupyter Notebook. Within these 5 clusters, there were 3 with a meaningful number of observations. We called these A, B and C.", "Our three clusters are not the same size. In fact, Cluster A contains the majority of the Chardonnays in our dataset. Cluster B and C are slightly smaller, comprising 21% and 14% respectively.", "Let\u2019s take a look at how our clusters differ in terms of (level 3) descriptors. The most frequently appearing descriptors in Cluster A are fruit-related: most notably apple and pear. Cluster B features citrus related fruit descriptors such as lemon, lime and orange. Specific fruit flavors appear to be less pronounced in Cluster C wines, although these wines still have a fruity profile overall, and are hallmarked by ripe fruit flavors. In addition, these wines appear to be concentrated, rich and full-bodied.", "These themes are confirmed when we look at the % of all descriptors within each cluster that belong to specific categories (level 1 descriptors). 17% of Cluster C wine descriptors pertain to the body of the wine, versus 8% and 9% for Clusters A and B, respectively. Interestingly, Cluster C wines have fewer acid descriptors (9% of total, vs. 11% and 12% for Clusters A and B). This may suggest that Cluster C wines are less acidic. In any case, acidic features are less pronounced in these wines than for the other clusters.", "Next, let\u2019s take a look at differences in the geographical profiles of our clusters. We can see that Cluster C wines are indeed very different from Clusters A and B. While Clusters A and B are predominantly US wines, Cluster C wines come from France. More specifically, about two-thirds of Cluster C wines are white Burgundy.", "Another observation is that Australian wines appear intensively in Cluster B (9% of total), whereas they are much less common in Clusters A (3%) and C (2%).", "We can also compute the distribution of prices for each cluster. Not entirely surprisingly, Cluster C contains by far the most expensive wines. The average price here is $54.52, a good 65% more expensive than the average price in the other clusters. This is consistent with the stereotype of Burgundy wines as the gold standard of Chardonnay wines.", "A final variable worth mentioning is the alcohol content of the wines in each cluster. Once again, Cluster A and B wines are similar. Cluster C wines, however, have a notably lower average alcohol %. This may be attributable to geography. Colder climates such as Burgundy are known to produce lower-alcohol wines.", "Having examined our three clusters, we can summarize our findings for each. This also allows us to give them a name, something a little more inspiring than \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019 and \u2018C\u2019.", "Below is a summary of Cluster A, our tree fruit-intensive Chardonnays. On the left, you can see an overview of the most common descriptors by category. The geographical profile, age and price are on the right.", "Cluster B was distinct in terms of its citrus fruit descriptors. The presence of lemon, lime, grapefruit and orange notes made these wines different.", "The label for Cluster C is no surprise: White Burgundy. These wines stood out due to their richness, softness and concentrated flavors. This was the most distinct cluster in our analysis based on average silhouette scores (more on this in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook).", "In exploring the different varieties of Chardonnay, we have learned a lot about the flavors, geography and prices of these wines. This work is an interesting starting point that can help us understand variations within a grape variety. It is encouraging that an unsupervised clustering task using only wine descriptors was able to create such a strong distinction between French and US Chardonnays. This by itself makes this an interesting area for further analysis.", "Your home for data science.
