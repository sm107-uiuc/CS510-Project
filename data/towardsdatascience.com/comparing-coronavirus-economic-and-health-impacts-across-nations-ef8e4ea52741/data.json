You should not rely on an author\u2019s works without seeking professional advice. See our Reader Terms for details.", "A few weeks ago, the IMF released its June 2020 world economic outlook and it makes for grim reading. The agency predicts that global gross domestic product (GDP) will decline by 4.9% this year. Should we care? After all, people have long criticized GDP as a terrible metric for the health of a nation. Does a decline in GDP really matter when people are sick and dying?", "Luckily we are not limited to analyzing global health based on a single variable, and even economists have caught up to this fact. They now have another metric to track. Like us, IMF staffers probably start every morning by opening dashboards that tally coronavirus infections and deaths. Just as the 2007 financial crisis made everyone amateur economists, this crisis is making us all amateur epidemiologists. And, like a county\u2019s stock market or GDP, coronavirus infection rates can represent the strength and health of a nation.", "To get a better understanding of how the world is facing this virus I have collected both economic and health data across nations. One main input will be the virus spread measured in infections per 1M people. The other will be a nation\u2019s economic growth rate measured as a percentage of GDP growth. Easy enough, let\u2019s get to it.", "Economic data for comes from the IMF. The organization released growth predictions for every country in April and most countries again in June. Of course, these are just projections, which are difficult to make in normal times. There\u2019s no guarantee they will come true, but it\u2019s the best I could find.", "For reference, I also grabbed economic predictions from October 2019, before Covid hit. In those halcyon days US GDP was projected to grow by 2% and unemployment US unemployment was running at an all-time low of 3.7%. I have taken all these projections and put them into a simple table like the one below.", "For coronavirus cases, data is easier to come by and there are dozens of good sources available. I chose the nice tabular records from worldometers since they\u2019re up to date and well-formatted as shown below.", "I know I said I\u2019d only look at GDP, but I could\u2019t resist adding a few other bits of data for this analysis. Better to have them just in case we need them.", "The IMF also published expected employment figures in April this year. They are even more bleak than the GDP data. Using the IMF website, we can export a per-country table of 2020 unemployment.", "Total GDP per country is also published by the IMF and is useful for giving a sense of the size of the GDP gains/losses.", "Finally, I thought I might want to compare different regions of the world, so I also grabbed region data from statisticstimes.com", "Doing anything fun with multiple data sources means putting them into a single dataframe. Luckily the python Pandas library allows for the easy merging of different datasets. In this case, I could merge the different tables by country in only 4 lines of code!", "That\u2019s it. After cleaning up country names (eg. \u2018Republic of Korea\u2019 vs \u2018Korea\u2019) we can merge as many data sources as we want.", "After the merge, everything is in a neat and tidy dataframe with all the key information needed for analysis. A sample of the dataframe is shown below.", "I like to use R for analysis and explortion since it\u2019s interactive and allows for data manipulation without much code. Here\u2019s a simple snippet to read the .csv file we generated in python. It\u2019s easy to order it by any variable like coutry population", "With clean data, it\u2019s easy to investigate questions about the economic impact of the virus. A few of these questions are below.", "One east way to see the relationship between national wealth and Covid-19 is to plot the two variables against each other. The code to do this using the R ggplot package is shown below.", "One observation jumps out when plotting Covid cases (per 1M people) against national wealth (GDP per capita). It seems that rich countries are not handling the crisis any better than poor ones. In fact, some of the wealthiest nations such as Qatar, the United States, Sweden, and Singapore have very high infection rates. In fact, the correlation between national GDP per capita and infections per capita is positive.", "The average GDP per capita of countries with more than 5000 cases per million people is a whopping $36233.19 (US dollars), much more than poor countries. Code to calculate this is below.", "One possible explanation for the poor outcomes of rich countries might be better Covid testing. In fact, president Trump has claimed that the large number of cases in the United States is due solely to a superior testing regimen. If we plot total tests (per 1M people) against (total cases per 1M), we see that the correlation is not perfect. In fact, nations like the United States, are not testing more people than many European countries.", "The blue line is a simple linear regression, and it gives us a good indicator of which nations are testing well. The nations below the line should arguably be testing more to keep up with peer countries of similar wealth/infection rate. In R, the linear regression line is easily added with the single statement. See the bold line below.", "One thing which stood out when plotting Coronavirus cases against GDP is how well East Asian nations are doing. In the first graph, these countries were represented by large green dots hanging low on the y-axis. It\u2019s perhaps easier to do a bar plot per region to see exactly how the virus has affected each part of the world. R code for a bar plot is below.", "Plotting average infection rates by region, we confirm that East Asian countries (China, Japan, Korea, Taiwain etc) have very few infections on average. In contrast, West Asian (or Middle Eastern) countries are hardest hit. Finally, Southern Europe (Spain, Italy etc), South America (Brazil, Chile etc), and North America (USA) have the most positive Covid cases per capita.", "Ok, so rich countries generally have more infections than the poor ones (East Asia excepted). A simple question is whether this health crisis is translating into an economic crisis in hard-hit countries. Or, is the global economy so interconnected that every nation is facing recession? Plotting the projected 2020 GDP of nations against their coronavirus cases (per million), there is no obvious correlation. Many countries with few cases are still expected to contract significantly this year.", "The above plot uses GDP to size the dots. So, we an see China with few cases and 1% growth in 2020. We also see the USA with many cases, and an economy projected to contract by 8%.", "Of course, it may be better to check again by using the economic projections made in October 2019 as a reference. If we subtract the June 2020 projections from the ones before coronavirus hit, we can get a better metric, which I call \u2018GDP loss\u2019.", "This plot isn\u2019t much better, but we do see that nations with large outbreaks like the UK, USA, and Spain now show a much greater hit. In general, it looks like every region outside East Asia will experience significant economic impact in 2020, regardless of current infection rates. This could be due to expectations of future outbreaks, or because global demand (especially from the USA) will be so depressed this year.", "A clearer measure of economic harm from Coronavirus can be seen in unemployment figures. Below I\u2019ve subtracted the expected 2020 unemployment figures ( Oct 2019 data) from the April 2020 measurements. Here it\u2019s clearer that hard-hit nations show greater increases in unemployment.", "In the United States where I live, the Covid-19 crisis has sadly split many into opposing and radical camps. Some believe that the virus must be controlled at all costs and yet others that think we should consider the human and economic toll of long shutdowns. Unfortunately, these opinions have been split along party lines and led to the same dumb dichotomies and basic thinking that hamper much of U.S. politics.", "Personally, I have been hungering for an analysis that takes into consideration the health of a nation both medically and economically. Although IMF economic projections are imperfect, they can begin to show that countries affected by Covid suffer meaningful economic damage. It is in the interests of all nations to fight and control this virus for the benefit of the entire world.", "Your home for data science.
