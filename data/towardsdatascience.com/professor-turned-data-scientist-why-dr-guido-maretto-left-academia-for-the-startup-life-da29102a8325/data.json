Former faculty fellow at the Massachusetts of Institute of Technology (MIT).", "After getting my Ph.D at Caltech (California Institute of Technology), I was a post-doctorate in Brussels in Belgium, and then I started a faculty position in Lisbon in Portugal at the Nova School of Business, where I stayed for 7 years until I moved to industry and became a Data Scientist at Flyr Labs in San Francisco.", "What were you main responsibilities at the Nova School?", "I was teaching and doing research. Initially my research was mostly mathematical and theoretical models. Then I got more interested in empirical analysis, so using data. Specifically the reason is that with a colleague in Brussels, now at the Bank of England, we got curious about the things that government was saying about criminal organizations in Italy. Different politicians were saying opposing statements. So we thought it would worth getting to the numbers to answer the question of who was essentially lying and uncover some truth.", "That\u2019s when I got interested in working in industry. Because when you work in academia, you have a lot of time to answer questions very precisely with good methodology. Thus you have the chance to get to true answers better with best possible methods. But unfortunately the impact is very low. Even if you spot the root cause of the problem and find potentially good solution, it may be years before any policymaker picks up the solution or analysis. This is more true where I am, which is Southern Europe. This is what got me interested in moving to industry: the possibility of solving problems, not only finding solutions, but actually implementing solutions.", "So was this the main reason for moving from academia to industry?", "Absolutely. I would say that main allure that data science has over conducting empirical research in academic environment is that you are forced to operate in much higher speed, but you get to actually implement the solutions that you find.", "How did you manage the transition from academia to data science?", "I strengthened my skills a bit by going to a coding bootcamp, which was very important, because the type of machinery that we use both in terms of statistical methods, but most importantly in statistical packages that are used for conducting economic research are not the same as the ones that I use in industry. Even though the goal might be to do optimal pricing, estimate demands and what not, the type and volume of data that is used and the state of industry require use of different set of tools.", "What are some important differences between tools you\u2019ve used in the past as an academic and the tools you are using now as a Data Scientist?", "Economists are mostly trained on Stata, which is something quite important that\u2019s different from academia. These days R is luckily becoming more common in the curriculum. But most data science work is done in Python and a bit of R. But there is this skill gap that is necessary to bridge after academia. Also important in industry is SQL, and anyone who has worked in data science knows that it\u2019s pretty hard to escape entirely from SQL.", "What\u2019s the similarities and the differences in the types of problems you\u2019ve solved in the past as an academic and the problems that you are solving now?", "In terms of subject of study, there\u2019s no difference. Now I work in a company that helps major airlines assign prices to seats. So what I do is demand estimation, competitive analysis of different markets, and creating automated models that can react to situations giving our customers best possible prices.", "So in terms of what I think about day in day out, there\u2019s little difference actually. In terms of how I think about organization of the work, theres\u2019 a world of difference. Everything is faster and everything is also shallower by its nature. But that\u2019s the way it has to be because there\u2019s a tradeoff between finding a great solution and doing something in the meantime. This is a tradeoff that doesn\u2019t really exist in academia but it\u2019s fundamental to the life of a corporation \u2014 to keep operating while the biggest improvements are achieved.", "When it comes to the subject and the problems that you are solving like demand estimation, there\u2019s little difference between data science and economics. But when it comes to the broader disciplinary approach solving these problems, do you see any big overlaps there as well?", "Yes, specifically in the case of economics but also for most sciences that use data (in academia), the focus is not on forecasting something that would happen, but explaining why something happens. To be a bit more precise, what we do in data science is a lot of forecasting, and what we do in academic research is a lot of inference.", "Now never mind that 80% of social science research outside of economics doesn\u2019t even understand the difference between causality and correlation, but that\u2019s their own problem\u2026Anyway, in reality the biggest methodological difference is that hanging your head on whether a relation is causal or not is important only in so far it comes to prediction. This is certainly the case when what we want to predict is demand, because that\u2019s a problem that suffers from a lot of endogeneity and bias of various kinds.", "But in other cases, the methods are extremely different and some problems would lend themselves to the use of highly non-linear and completely non-transparent methods that lack interpretability of relations that are baked inside the model but are great at forecasting.", "Side note: For clarification, Guido argues that certain problems do very well with data science methods like complex neural networks. Comparatively, other problems like price setting through demand estimation are more suited for inference-based methods that are simpler but yield more accurate returns that are used in economics/statistics. Endogeneity in pricing is a specific example of this.", "In the case of price setting, one important endogenous variable is the consumer\u2019s willingness to pay on the prices that are set, and this variable is unobserved, not included in our model, and not independent from price.", "To learn more about endogeneity, please refer to this TDS article on the subject.", "How do you address differences in these two paradigms in daily practice?", "In practice, there\u2019s a bit of both. Because if you throw a Deep Neural Network (DNN) at demand data and then you start setting the prices which is what most companies do in pricing \u2014 they use machine learning models to do demand estimation \u2014 you\u2019d find that the model would fail because the process that generates the price has changed, it has become you d.", "Side note 2: The reason for this again has to do with endogeneity. Here, models are trained on data in which prices are not independent from the endogenous variable, the customer\u2019s willingness to pay. So once these models go live in production, these models will change the process generating the prices and its covariance with the endogenous variable. As a result, the predictions based on the original training set becomes less precise.", "So there\u2019s a bit of an art in using methods that are very powerful that allow us to achieve high accuracy, but are not interpretable. What I see in my day to day work, which involves demand estimation, is to have to do a bit of both, practically speaking. So it\u2019s steering away from the search for causality that is typical of academic research and economics. But it cannot be completely dropped because the same tools that I use to sharpen causal analysis are powerful in feature selection and for forecasting.", "What are common data science tools and techniques that you get to use at Flyr Labs?", "We do everything in Python. In terms of which packages we use, we are a small company, so we still have freedom to pick and choose without being tied to a specific package. Because of my economic background, I enjoy doing analysis with StatsModels, because I find that\u2019s the package that offers the most complete end-to-end use for inference. For example it allows me to cluster errors very easily, which is very complicated with scikit-learn for example.", "Then in some cases for deploying into production, we would move to scikit-learn or Tensorflow, to use some of their features that StatsModels does not do great for production.", "What are the bigger challenges at Flyr Labs?", "In absolute or in comparison to academia?", "In absolute terms, I would say that one thing that is always challenging is the need to get buy-in for one solution at different levels. And sometimes politics gets in the way of that. So that\u2019s a most complicated part. Because by character, I don\u2019t like to talk a lot and repeat same things over and over. So when I convince one person that the solution is good, I\u2019m not too excited about convincing person number 2 and so on.", "However, I would say that this is fundamental aspect in the career of a Data Scientist. Because without this self-promotion of your solution, you would not get to implement it and you would not get to make impact on your company\u2019s metrics. And this is ultimately going to link to your career. So I think it\u2019s a necessary evil.", "To some people, it can be quite enjoyable. Many people get into data science and go into product because they have a preference for the soft side of the job [soft skills], let\u2019s say, rather than the actual analysis and producing facts.", "As a final question, do you have any words of wisdom for the TDS community especially those who are in academia or economics who want to get into data science?", "What is happening these days in that the number of Ph.D fellowships is not decreasing if not increasing. And the number of faculty positions and pure research positions in university is decreasing. So by all means, keep an eye out and keep industry and data science opportunity to transition to throughout your career.", "Major thanks to Ludovic Benistant of TDS for his support and guidance.", "Your home for data science.
