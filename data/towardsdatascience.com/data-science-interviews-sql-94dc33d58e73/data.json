So, let\u2019s not beat around the bush: databases and SQL are not the most \u201cfun\u201d parts of being a data scientist. And it\u2019s probably not what you\u2019re the most worried about for an interview. But that said, because you\u2019re going to be working with data a lot, that means you\u2019ll be writing many queries to retrieve it and transform it to become meaningful.", "This post will provide a technical guide to SQL within data science interviews. The problems discussed are from this data science interview newsletter which features questions from top tech companies and will be involved in an upcoming book.", "The first step of analytics for most workflows involves quick slicing and dicing with data in SQL, and hence being able to write basic queries efficiently is a very important skill. Although many may think that SQL simply involves SELECTs and JOINs, there are many other operators and details involved for powerful SQL workflows. For example, utilizing subqueries is important and allows you to manipulate subsets of data by which later operations can be performed, while window functions allow you to cut data without combining rows explicitly using a GROUP BY. The questions asked within SQL are usually quite practical to the company at hand \u2014 a company like Facebook might ask about various user or app analytics, whereas a company like Amazon will ask about products and transactions.", "Here are some of the basic but important SQL commands you should definitely know. Let\u2019s first just discuss what they do \u2014 you\u2019ll see the actual syntax and code later on with examples.", "In practice, interviewers will assess that you can take a simple question (often a business use case), and formulate the correct query to use.", "Generally, SQL queries will involve the following parts:", "2. Joins: frequently used in queries between multiple tables. For example, the below is getting the total time spent by username:", "3. Filtering: there are various ways to test equality, among the most common are using = and <> (not equals), or > and <, along with regex and other filtering clauses for filtering (OR, AND). For example, below is an example using LIKE which matches user names on regex:", "4. Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and Subqueries:", "CTEs allows you to define a query and then reference it later using an alias \u2014 most useful for breaking up large queries or where there is a natural ordering to the various queries written. For example, we can do a quick CTE for a subset of users, and then do a simple analysis using those specific users:", "Subqueries are inline in the query itself and can be used just once:", "Query questions usually revolve around a set of tables that is relevant to the company \u2014 at Facebook that would be user and usage tables, at Uber that would be on riders and drivers, and so on. Therefore, besides just being comfortable with queries, it is important to understand the basic concepts of databases (covered below): primary keys, foreign keys, indexing, and so on. A good way to do so is to think about potential tables that companies should use as well as what operations would be useful.", "For example, imagine you work at Facebook and there are users and posts and reactions on posts. How would these tables look like and what are the foreign keys you use to join tables? Which columns for the tables would be indexed and why?", "Window functions are functions that calculate across a set of rows (like an aggregation function does) but do not group those rows (as aggregation functions do). They involve an aggregation function and an OVER clause, and you can narrow the window by using PARTITION BY:", "In this particular example, we get the total time spent at the row level (without needing a GROUP BY per user_id) within the sessions data.", "Note that you cannot use window functions and aggregation functions in the same query \u2014 but they are handy in various scenarios. You\u2019ll want to involve them anytime you see an aggregation needed, but with the rows maintained.", "If you\u2019re interested in further exploring SQL in data science interviews, check out this newsletter that sends you practice problems three times a week. Also, be on the lookout for an upcoming book!", "Your home for data science.
