Certainly, many issues can be spotted quickly and clearly right at the start, those missing river level values for example (even if you\u2019re not immediately sure how to handle them). But many issues will only come to light once you dig a little deeper into the data and start to consider the distributions and relationships within and between variables. A person\u2019s height, for example, might very reasonably be somewhere between 50 cm (toddler) and 1.80 m. Their weight may also very reasonably be anywhere between 10 kg and 100 kg. But only when considering both together could you realise there\u2019s a \u201ctoddler\u201d weighing 100 kg or a tall adult weighing 15 kg. You suddenly have some outliers on your hands! Thus, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is a step when data quality issues are still very much being explored.", "We just brought up an example where you need to compare two variables in unison in order to spot outliers. By implication this was easy; you\u2019d just plot one variable on the x-axis and the other on the y-axis and see what \u201csticks out\u201d. What if you had age as well? Well, there are graphing tools that allow you to define a z-axis as well, and even rotate the axes dynamically to visualize the data from different directions. What if you had salary as well? It\u2019s getting tricky now, isn\u2019t it? You could start plotting the different combinations of variables as x and y over multiple graphs. But even that\u2019s only considering pairwise relationships.", "What if your data had 10 variables? 20? 1000? Fortunately, there are a number of techniques to reduce the dimensionality of your data and visualize patterns. One common technique is principle components analysis (PCA), although there are many others.", "A skill we can\u2019t emphasise enough when it comes to EDA is data visualization. And this doesn\u2019t always have to be a figure! If it\u2019s a reasonably small number of summary statistics, then a table can often be the most effective, and efficient, way to communicate. We don\u2019t tend to print out so much these days, but imagine how much ink you\u2019d use printing out a moderate sized bar chart that merely conveyed three data values. Perhaps that would be a good candidate to present in a simple table.", "There are more and more plot types readily available in packages now, offering many and varied ways to represent your data. But just because they exist, doesn\u2019t mean you need to use them. Don\u2019t be the datavis equivalent of that guy who gives a powerpoint presentation using every single animation and sound effect he could find just because they were there! Think carefully about what message you want to draw out in your figure and craft it accordingly. Some basic types to get you started:", "This is an incredibly abridged selection of plot types, but they are good stalwarts that, with some careful thought, you can make effective use of time and time again. Above all, and this cannot be stressed enough, think about what it is you\u2019re trying to communicate in your plot and try to effectively convey it, and only it, with a minimum of ink and extraneous fuss and bother.", "This is the fourth article of a linked series written to provide a straightforward introduction to getting started with the data science process. You can find the introduction here, the previous article here, and the next article in the series here.", "Your home for data science.
