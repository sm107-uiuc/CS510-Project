Very little of what most people see that directly involves numbers is not cutting edge data science. Indeed, it\u2019s usually not any sort of data science or worthwhile data analysis at all. It\u2019s what I call \u201cdata smooshing\u201d. Data smooshing is when you haphazardly smoosh data together like several colors of Play Doh and call it a \u201csculpture\u201d. This particular example has several elements of \u201cit could be done better\u201d in it. This sort of non-analysis is a source of many a miserable listicle. In our particular case, it was based on a list that purported to show which US states were more dependent on the Federal government.", "The data therein is a list that is based on four variables: 1) the Federal share of state government revenue; 2) the ratio of Federal funding to the state vs. Federal income taxes collected from the state; 3) the percent of a state\u2019s workforce employed by the Federal government; and 4) the ratio of that state\u2019s median wage for Federal employees vs. the median wage for private sector employees. I\u2019ll leave off picking at the specific choices and definitions of variables and presume they\u2019re acceptable. In any case, Mr Ben Geier, \u201can experienced financial writer currently serving as a retirement and investing expert at SmartAsset\u201d chose them, so he probably has some leg to stand on for definitions. Indeed, Mr. Geier \u201chas appeared on Fortune, Mic.com and CNNMoney\u201d.", "So, what was done with those numbers to provide a result. First, each variable was reduced to ranks (how \u2014 adorable). Then, the ranks for each state were averaged (oh, averaging ranks, oh my). Then, and then, the intrepid author saw fit to rescale the averaged ranks (for 50 states) to a 0 to 100 scale. I just got two Forrest Whittaker eyes while smashing my face into a wall. Did we at least get a chart or graphic to summarize this outcome? Well, we did get a picture of a table that had the numbers on it! Yes, a picture of a table. I am certain that Mr. Geier knows finance quite well. But he really oughtn\u2019t quit his day job to do data analysis and presentation.", "What\u2019s wrong with his process? After all, ranking can smooth out numbers so they\u2019re easier to follow. Averaging can be a valid way to combine numbers. Rescaling has its uses. And who needs a graphic, anyway? Don\u2019t tables present the \u201creal data\u201d? Let me answer these questions as follows: I can have an adorable puppy, some good topsoil, and a bottle of Green Meanie cleaner. Each is good for its purpose, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can just throw them all into a blender and get something even better.", "Starting from the last point, tables are for appendices. Unless you have a very few (roughly 5) points, tables can\u2019t be processed as a whole by the human brain. We are hard-wired to like pictures, and a picture of a table doesn\u2019t count. Since we\u2019re talking about states, a color-coded, or \u201cchoropleth\u201d map would have been a great way to present the final index, something like this:", "How did I make this? I used the Google GeoCharts API. The specific code for this chart is at the end of the article. Since Medium\u2019s support for modern data visualization is remarkably craptacular, I then clipped a picture of the chart\u2019s representation on my own scratch HTML page and loaded it as a picture, above. The darker the color, the more dependent the state is, on the baffling 0\u2013100 scale.", "Why do I say \u201cbaffling\u201d? That gets us to the next problem with the data\u2019s publication. In the real world, zero usually means zero, as in nothing, or at very least, as in midway between positive and negative values. Assigning any state a score of zero should mean that the state has absolutely no dependence on the Federal government. No state has absolutely no dependence on the Federal government. Nevertheless, the scale started at zero. It\u2019s like saying that zero degrees, Fahrenheit has any real meaning.", "Not only that, the scale ended at 100. Why 100? We usually associate 0\u2013100 scales with \u201cpercents\u201d, at 0, we have nothing and at 100 we have total. So, then, we have a state (New Mexico) ranked at 100. Does that mean it\u2019s 100% dependent on the Federal government? No, it just means that it\u2019s go the highest averaged rank. I\u2019m going to go stick my head in a vat of pickle juice until I feel better.", "I\u2019m back. I smell like dill and vinegar, but I am fortified to address the next problem. The pre-scaled index was created by averaging ranks. Averaging. Ranks. Taking ranks and then averaging them. It doesn\u2019t work that way, it just doesn\u2019t. Ranks are not quantities. Ranks are orders and have no quantity. You can\u2019t add a rank of 5 to a rank of 4 and get a rank of 9. That\u2019s because \u201crank of 5\u201d means \u201c5th\u201d, not \u201c5 rank thingies\u201d. In addition, the underlying \u201csize\u201d of the variable that is being represented by ranks might not be the same per rank step? The distance between rank 5 and rank 4 might be 3 units, but the distance between rank 4 and rank 3 could be 14 units! If you can\u2019t add, you can\u2019t average.", "However, I did hint at the proper solution: If you have several variables that you want to create an aggregate ranking for, you add or average (an arithmetic mean is just a sum divided by a constant, so it\u2019s a variant of addition) the underlying variables being ordered then rank that outcome! How could we do that for this data? In a minute.", "Finally, the first problem, the data was immediately reduced to ranks before doing anything else to it. That\u2019s a great way to say \u201cI don\u2019t understand the data at all.\u201d Ranks are simple to represent, but they throw away nearly all information in the data, leaving only order. It\u2019s a great way to provide an illusion of analysis.", "I\u2019ll not leave you hanging, if (and I say if) you wanted to present this data about the states in a single index, what would be a less horrible way to do it? First, you would need to create a single number for each state. A simple way to do this would be to average the four data points. Oh, wait, they all have different scales! That\u2019ll mean that a larger scale data point will dominate all the others. We can fix that by rescaling all the data to the same range. Then we can average the rescaled data.", "I then mapped the data to the same color scheme, but without applying ranks or re-re-scaling. I didn\u2019t rank the averages, because it produced a trivial 1\u201350 scale. Instead, since a choropleth can just adjust for the data, I applied the averages to a color scale of from 0 (minimum theoretical possible) to 1 (maximum theoretical possible. You can see some notable differences when comparing them side by side.", "It\u2019s more accurate in two ways: It doesn\u2019t overemphasize the apparent \u201cpurity\u201d of a few states that is really just an artifact of averaging ranks. It shows a \u201cmuddier\u201d outcome that is likely to more accurately portray some underlying reality. This is because I didn\u2019t resort to ranking. Ranks introduce fake clarity. They\u2019re a great way to lie without lying. They let you pretend that differences are evenly distributed and stark. Reality is almost never evenly distributed and stark. Case closed?", "No, not case closed, case is never closed with me. Remember, we started with four variables and smooshed them into one index. Our index is a teeeeeeeny bit better than the original, but it\u2019s still an irrational smooshie. Irrational? Let\u2019s say it has a lot of assumptions, one of which is that there is no structure within the data.", "What is structure within the data? Whenever you have multiple variables, there\u2019s a chance that they might not all measure the same \u201cthing\u201d. What are these \u201cthings\u201d? Sometimes, there are events or conditions that aren\u2019t immediately obvious. However, they can partially manifest. If you collect data, you might be able to describe bits and pieces of the underlying \u201cthings\u201d and then use those bits and pieces to get an idea of the underlying \u201cthings\u201d. These \u201cthings\u201d are also called \u201clatent variables\u201d.", "There are a lot of ways to try to discover latent variables. One that is commonly used is called exploratory factor analysis. This is based on looking at how different variables might relate to each other on a one-to-one basis. Let me illustrate:", "As you can see, a simple plot (thanks, base R) of each of the four variables against each other, shows there might be some relationships, but it\u2019s messy. Fortunately, there\u2019s one more thing I can do to help clarify. It\u2019s well known that the logarithm of numbers can produce a bit more clarity when you have \u201cstraggly\u201d data. When I plot logarithms, I get this:", "Far from perfection, but it\u2019s easier to see a linear relationship between the logs of Federal contribution to state revenue and Federal funding vs. income taxes. So, further analysis will be done using the logs of the data. But what do to with this? How do we find that \u201cstructure\u201d? Like I said, one way to do it is to use exploratory factor analysis. This always starts by doing a correlation matrix of all the data, like so:", "Sorry the table looks like crap, but Medium doesn\u2019t believe in modern things like proper tables. There are some good correlations, some middling correlations, and some really weak correlations. Basically, The first two variables correlate really well with each other, and the last two correlate pretty well with each other. This is a very simple and easy to see structure (fortunately). We could bypass fancy pants ways to pick how many factors we want to extract. I\u2019ll let you in on a secret. The fancy pants ways (like parallel analysis) also say two factors. So, if I pull out the R psych package and do a factor analysis with two factors, I get a bunch of stuff.", "One of the things I get is what are called \u201cfactor scores\u201d. I could reproduce them for you, but they won\u2019t mean a darn thing. This is because factor scores, since they are linear combinations of input variables to different degrees, no longer directly represent the inputs. Instead, they are supposed to reflect those \u201clatent\u201d things I talked about a long time ago. The method also makes the units tricky to understand. They are centered at zero, and the units are roughly standard deviations, sort of, combined, read a book.", "Anyway, what we also get are \u201cloadings\u201d, and they can help us interpret the factors\u2019 meanings. For our analysis, we got one factor with loadings of 1.00 for Federal Contribution to State Revenue and 0.61 for Federal Funding vs. Income Taxes. The other factor had loadings of 1.00 for Percent Federal Employment and 0.49 for Federal vs. Private Wages. A loading of over 0.40 is usually considered pretty good, so we could potentially name our factors \u201cGovernment Dependency\u201d and \u201cPersonal Dependency\u201d. We could show these on a choropleth, but it gets very tricky. We have two variables that have to be shown at the same time by using colors. Depending on the color scheme, it can be done. What we get looks like this:", "What do we have? The more red a state is, the more personal dependency (employment, better wages) there is on the Federal government in that state. The more blue a state is, the more that state\u2019s government depends on funding from the Federal government. Lighter or darker gray represents lesser or greater combined dependency. What happens when we compare that to the original map, based on that original single-dimensional, rank-based index?", "If you squint, you can see some correspondence between the two maps, but there are also interesting differences. Virginia and Maryland, for example, turn out to have very high personal dependency on the Federal government. This makes sense, since Washington, DC, is right between the two. On the other hand, it looks like states that only had low to moderate \u201cindex\u201d dependency turn out to have noticeable personal dependency elements. a broad band of personal and government dependency runs northeast starting in Texas and ending in Maine. Interestingly, California, Oregon, and Illinois don\u2019t fare too badly, but it\u2019s Wisconsin and Connecticut that manage to maintain fairly low dependency in both categories. In other words, if one sees \u201cdependence\u201d on the Federal government to be undesirable, the new map helps see what kind of dependence might predominate in a state, and reducing local government dependence would require entirely different means than would reducing personal dependence.", "So, is there a way to analyze all four variables at once and take into account data structure? We could try looking at a lot of methods, but they become very difficult to present and interpret. In this case, it would require a four-dimensional representation.", "This is all well and good, of course, but it requires extra work to more than implicitly compare states if presented by itself. You have to recognize a state\u2019s shape, compare color to color, etc. The maps are nice for an at-a-glance view, but what if you want to ask which states really resemble which other states? One way to do that is with a clustering analysis. There are k-means, k-medoids, uncounted hierarchical clustering methods. I\u2019m not going to get into that this time. I just wanted to show how you could tell a much richer story by using formal data analytical techniques than by just smooshing data.", "Your home for data science.
