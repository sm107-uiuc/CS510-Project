A project that has developed since to an immersive theater experience in collaboration with Avner Peled. Last March I presented the first ideas behind the family dinner of Marrow, the main scene of the experience, which was prototyped at IDFA DocLAB 2018. In the medium post Family2Family, I explained why and how we trained a Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) machine learning model on a \u201cperfect family dinners\u201d dataset.", "Back then, we worked with a specific conditional model of GAN \u2014 Pix2Pix \u2014 This model studies pairs of images, learning how to generate a destination image when being presented with a source. It can handle small datasets, which makes a lot of difference in constraints of time and budget). The prototype\u2019s objectives at that time were mainly focused on the physical participants\u2019 interactions, setup and the statement of the overall project and not so much about the training process of the model.", "In September 2019, we started the development phase under the co-production of the National Film Board of Canada and AtlasV. This allowed us to revisit a few of the decisions we\u2019ve made a year earlier and question whether they are aligned with the project\u2019s goal and calls for action.", "Marrow highlights glitches found in machine learning models to reflect on the possibility of mental disorder in AI, and on the social constructs that lead to those glitches, offering new paths for social thinking.", "We needed to change the chosen GAN model to a more robust one, that attempts to generate perfect families from scratch, instead of relying on source input. That way we can go deeper into the training process, and the analysis of the dataset. We wanted to highlight and visualize the glitches and errors that occur during the training and generation of state of the art GANs. And so, we shifted to StyleGAN (at that time V.01): This generator is famously known for its ability to generate high-resolution images, especially in faces, and to recognize high-level features in the dataset such as smile or age.", "Machine learning models are like data-hungry children, and most of the time the quality and quantity of the dataset determine the performance of the model. Some models are hungrier than other models, and StyleGAN is definitely one of the hungry ones. We didn\u2019t anticipate that StyleGan requires such a larger dataset than Pix2Pix, the previous model we used.", "\u201cBig data\u201d is one of those buzzwords that the AI field comes with. It refers to millions of data points that can draw valuable insights into a learning model. In the real world setting, however, only a few have access to those kinds of resources, ones that are becoming the most expensive resource of our times; the oil of the digital area as The Economist named it. Most of us, who are not part of a large corporation, need to find our way of working with relatively small data sizes. That is one reason why small independent projects tend to use models that were pre-trained by one of those corporations. Models that are trained on a small number of observations tend to exhibit overfitting, and produce inaccurate results. When in real-world environments this can have a dangerous social implication of inequality and bias.", "In our unique case, we weren\u2019t actually aiming for the perfect HD result that you would normally expect from StyleGAN, you might say we wanted the training to fail, so we can exhibit errors that are inherent to the algorithm and to the constraints of biased datasets. We aimed to teach the machine about intimate human concepts such as \u201cfamily dinner\u201d, but The distorted image you would find when scraping the web is so far from what a real family is. Using the \u201cfamily dinner\u201d tagline produced mostly young, shiny, happy and mostly white wealthy families. A stock of images that can only lead the machine to results that are a fake image of ourselves. In that case, the machine\u2019s output will be a distorted mirror of our own perceptions.", "A common failure in GAN is an oscillating \u201cnon-convergence\u201d: An endless state in which the discriminator and generator take turns in fooling their opponent when they are in fact fooling themselves. In the human brain and in neural networks of other living organisms, neurons are always in a state of oscillation. As the environment changes, the neurons coordinate as they shift their balance from one wave frequency to another. In machine intelligence, however, neural networks aspire to fixate and converge on a single value \u2014 one optimal result. Ironically, the state of oscillation during the training of an artificial neural network commonly signifies that something is wrong, that the system is out of balance. As we are speculating on the possibility of mental illness in machine learning, the case of oscillation in GAN is an exemplary case for how a disorder could manifest in such a model.", "Nevertheless, we couldn\u2019t have a complete failure, we needed a result that is clear enough for the user to understand the model, but also distorted enough to reflect the mental disorder. The dataset had to be large and diverse enough for the training to make some progress, but not enough for the training to converge on a high-quality image. In our case, a large enough dataset could not be found. We aimed to train a machine learning model on the concept of a family dinner. Not just that \u2014 of a perfect family dinner. A tag line that is so specific that it can only a few hundreds of high-quality images that can be molded into a more or less consistent dataset.", "Since we did succeed to train Pix2Pix with only hundreds of images we first engaged with StyleGAN on a similar number (~700), scraped from the \u201cperfect family dinners\u201d tagline, and then stripped from their background using the \u201cDensePose\u201d neural network for human pose detection. This was a failure, after 72 hours of training we stopped the process as we noticed how the outputs are becoming more and more broken, and the metrics defined by the creators were outputting very bad figures. We witnessed extreme overfitting, caused by the model\u2019s attachment to very particular image styles from the small dataset. Additionally, since the images were not well aligned (i.e, having varying angles and perspectives ) the machine captured these deviations and treated them as main features \u2014 our data was very dirty and we needed to clean it.", "Even though we had only ~700 images, we hypothesized that if we would curate them even more carefully, it may improve our model. We decided to go on a more precise approach where \u2014 angles and perspectives are aligned and centered and the number of figures in the pictures is similar. This reduced our dataset even more but cleaned our data and led to less noise in our model.", "With only about 200 images, we were right to see a slight improvement over the larger, more diverse dataset. However, a small dataset not only rendered the detection of patterns more difficult it also hindered creativity and the ability to produce new images. As a result, it was almost impossible to render accurate results using such a small dataset. As in the previous case, this training process broke after ~90 hours.", "We started to feel the stress of costs and time. Marrow is an experimental project with limited resources. Training and data collection is an expensive process; in terms of dollars, human efforts, computational resources and time. We couldn\u2019t afford to run more and more experiments without making sure the next one will be the right one. We managed to contact Jaakko Lehtinen, one of the creators of StyleGAN, and get his advice before executing the final run. He told us that without a doubt we need about 5\u201310k images to get decent results, and even that will not assure us \u2018disentanglement\u2019: the desired state in which the GAN can discern between qualitatively different and meaningful attributes of an image (In comparison, StyleGAN\u2019s dataset of high-quality faces has 70k images).", "We understood that we needed a hybrid approach: First, opt for quantity over quality and scrape for as many images as possible, then, augment our data using customized techniques to make it easier for our model to process the images. Now we are witnessing the creation of bias first-hand: In order for our model to get a good grip on reality, we need to present it with a tampered image.", "In our case \u2014 after scraping images for synonyms words for \u201cdinner\u201d and \u201cperfect\u201d and added \u201cperfect family meals\u201d, \u201chappy family dinner\u201d and \u201cperfect family dinner of four\u201d we ran them through a processing pipeline:", "1) Run all images through the \u201cfind image dupes\u201d utility to remove all duplicates.", "2) Using the previously mentioned DensePose analysis to blatantly cut four figures out of the picture (If there are more, we choose 4 people at random).", "3) Manually resize and position the family right next to each other and anchored at the center of our image.", "4) Create more family diversity by shuffling around the order of the figure four times, producing four images out of one.", "We then applied another filtering process on the images: running DensePose analysis once more on the produced image, discarding any image that didn\u2019t have four people (Mostly some broken body parts that managed to pass the first run).", "We were left with ~6.5k images.", "This reduced the overfitting in the model classifier and produced much more consistent results. Still, quality peaked at about half-way through the process, after which artifacts started to appear.", "The approach led us to satisfactory results; a well-formed, yet the distorted image of a perfect family.", "The struggle in collecting and allocating data is a real struggle for the majority of people who are outside of those big companies. It has real implications for our lives. Marrow is driven by our motivation to talk about data and information accessible through alternative mediums such as interactive storytelling, and envision possible futures in information technology. This is the time for artistic and independent social experimentation that can challenge and undermine common practices, and build a new community with a shared body of knowledge.", "During the Marrow development phase, our goal was to understand how to work with the results of a distorted family, adding real-time interactions with the users and creating more interventions with the GAN model. We looked for ways to link StyleGAN to the story, along with other models and visuals, wanting to raise a conversation about distorted outputs, and how they highlight the confusion when one\u2019s own sense of expression slips away.", "More about it in the next post, where we will describe how we developed a tool that helped us explore the latent state of StyleGAN and communicate between the team members in real-time.", "A special thanks to Osman Zeki for doing a lot of the scraping work and for the helpful feedback and suggestions during the ideation phase of the training.The experience is being developed in collaboration with Philippe Lambert, sound artist.", "Your home for data science.
