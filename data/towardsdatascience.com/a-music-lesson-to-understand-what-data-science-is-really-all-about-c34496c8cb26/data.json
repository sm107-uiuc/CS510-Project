And when that happens, you can\u2019t slap back because (a) you\u2019re too scared/surprised/unprepared, and (b) reality doesn\u2019t have a face that you can slap back\u2026 So you\u2019re basically screwed. Unless you realize that there is actually a lesson to learn.", "I started out my professional journey as a musician, and if any group of people in the world have stories to tell... Well, it\u2019s musicians. So check this one out:", "A much-too-young version of me was standing in the middle of a stage with an accompanying crew of three seasoned jazz players (drums, bass, piano), waiting for the count so I could showcase my talents. Palms sweating, electric guitar hanging from my neck, trying to do some brain yoga to calm my thoughts. It was my chance (actually it turned out to be my only chance) to show that I was good enough to earn a scholarship at a prestigious jazz school, and I knew I had to show off.", "And I was prepared, too. Or so I thought. I had bought the fancy guitar hanging from the wall at the store, the nice leather strap, the cool cable (with the mute button and all) and even the power amp with a GAZILLION watts. I had also memorized all the scales, the \u201cright\u201d notes (whatever that means) and the chords. I mean, what could go wrong? Well it turns out, EVERYTHING.", "The count came and those damn jazz players took off faster than a Jamaican sprint runner: the hi-hat seemed like it would fly right out of the drum set, the walking bass seemed like a running bass and the piano looked like it was about to lose several keys. And me? I stared in bewilderment for a few moments, unable to start playing, until it got kinda awkward and the pianist asked \u201cBro, you gonna play?\u201d", "So I did what normal people do when they\u2019re experiencing a total brain freeze: I made a fool of myself. Some clumsy scales here and there (that didn\u2019t work), then some chords (that actually made it worse) and finally I just stopped playing altogether. Eventually the accompanying musicians stopped too and I was forced to take the longest walk of my life from the stage to the door. But reality wasn\u2019t done with me yet.", "Walking out the door, I saw one of my classmates from music school, sitting in the hallway, chilling and smoking a cigarette. He asked what was happening inside the auditorium and I told him about the auditions, to which he replied \u201cHey, maybe I can give it a try. Can I use your guitar?\u201d Still shame-shocked, not knowing what else to do, I handed him over the guitar and he stepped in.", "The accompanying players counted to four and I couldn\u2019t believe my ears: this bad-dressing, worse-smelling, hallway-smoking dude heard the first two chords of the song and knew EXACTLY what to do. He proceeded to play one of the best jazz solos I have ever heard live. Seriously. And he did it with my guitar!! Are you kidding me? This guy didn\u2019t even know there was an audition, obviously hadn\u2019t prepared for it, and he still managed to shamelessly kick my ass while smiling and looking like he was enjoying it.", "Needless to say, I never became a professional jazz guitarist.", "Fast-forward twelve years, and I am walking down the streets of Paris, mask on, listening to the Towards Data Science podcast. I had already made the career switch from my (not-too-shiny) jazz days, to working as a data analyst for mass media consumption. On that particular episode, Jeremie asked his guest Goku Mohandas about his transition from a non-computer-ish field into data science, and whether he advised people to focus on computer science from the start. While Mohandas validated the need for pure computer professionals, his actual reasoning relating to people who transition into data from another field made me pause my walk abruptly:", "\u201cI strongly advise that you either do a double major with some other niche focus that\u2019s not computer science, or don\u2019t do computer science as a major at all, because you can learn it on the side\u2026 So maybe you can focus on the industry in which you want to make an impact on, and then use data science as a tool, not as an industry itself\u201d.", "Wait. What? He advised us not to study computer science? I had spent the better part of the last decade wishing I had \u201cused my time more efficiently\u201d, learning about computers instead of\u2026 whatever it is I did during those years. I thought \u201cif only I had learned to program some years earlier, or studied computer science or applied math, my career in data would have taken off faster and painlessly\u201d. And yet, here is this guest on one of my favorite podcasts saying that\u2019s exactly what you SHOULDN\u2019T do? I don\u2019t get it.", "Going back to my friend the jazz virtuoso, I realized there was a fundamental difference between he and I. That dude understood what jazz music was all about. Standing on that stage, he paused for a few seconds, heard what the other musicians where playing and knew precisely what was required for a great performance. No need for any fancy toys, just pure understanding of the field of jazz music.", "Me? Well, I had all the cool stuff: nice guitar, power amp, leather strap\u2026 I was practically a walking music store. But I didn\u2019t have the slightest idea about what needed to be done to play a good jazz solo. I too, tried to hear what the others were playing, but just couldn\u2019t understand or diagnose the situation. Bottom line was, I had the nice toys, but the other guy had the know-how. There\u2019s a name for that in professional circles: it\u2019s called domain knowledge, and that\u2019s exactly what Goku Mohandas was talking about. You know why it\u2019s such a big deal? Because it provides you with the most important skill of all: the ability to ask the right questions.", "If you ask the wrong questions, you\u2019re gonna get the wrong answers. The thing is, to ask the right questions you need to know what the heck you\u2019re talking about. Otherwise, you\u2019re just an idiot with a guitar in the middle of a stage, wishing you could put on Harry Potter\u2019s invisibility cloak (or whatever its name is. I have no Harry Potter domain knowledge\u2026)", "Data science is not about shiny toys. It is not about the tools, just like music is not about guitars, amps or leather straps. You don\u2019t become a data professional when you learn to code, or solve partial derivatives, or train a convolutional neural network. Don\u2019t get me wrong, those things are all necessary, but they won\u2019t turn you into a true data problem solver.", "Interesting problems will only surface when you ask intelligent questions related to a specific field in which you are an expert. Basically, like my friend the guitarist, you only become a true data-problem-solving hero when you can \u201clisten to the first two chords of the song, and know exactly what to do\u201d.", "At its very core, data science is the modern version of the centuries-old craft of research. And how does every good research start? With a good question!", "From the time the first person ever tried to figure out how to not get eaten by a mammoth, to the development of computer vision and everything in between, research has been centered around 4 things:", "(1) Asking good questions related to a problem that you see in real life (what academia calls \u201cthe phenomenon\u201d)", "(2) Finding out if somebody already answered those questions (what academia calls \u201cliterature review\u201d)", "(3) If nobody has answered the questions, developing a logical process to find the answers yourself (what academia calls \u201cmethodology\u201d and \u201cempirical evidence\u201d)", "(4) Sharing those answers with others (this is why research journals exist in the first place).", "Isn\u2019t that the same thing we data geeks try to do all the time??? Go check the image of \u201cthe data mining process\u201d on that book you read in college (they ALL have something like that). Doesn\u2019t it really boil down to this? Isn\u2019t that what Isaac Newton was doing when he saw that apple fall from the tree? The only difference is that he did it with pencil and paper while we spend our days tapping like mad people at a computer keyboard. Don\u2019t believe me? Do the following: Check any academic journal online, read one of the articles and ask yourself if the structure follows what I just mentioned. I\u2019ll save you some time: it does.", "Now, pay attention at how that research process begins: questions. The thing is, you can only ask good questions when you know the field and that\u2019s why domain knowledge is so important.", "Let me give you an example: about a year ago I took my girlfriend to her first ever football match. This woman knew NOTHING about football, and was amazed at how everybody around her noticed things that she didn\u2019t. It got to the point where a team scored a goal, 30.000 people rose to celebrate, and she didn\u2019t even know what was going on. I had to say \u201cMmm this is the part where you get up and scream like a crazy person\u201d. So she proceeded to do just that. It\u2019s not her fault, she just had zero domain knowledge (on the other hand, whenever we have a discussion about law and human rights she destroys me. It\u2019s just her field).", "The point that I\u2019m trying to drive home is this: data science is the art and craft of researching in order to find answers to interesting questions. But the element that starts that process is the \u201casking the right questions\u201d part. And to do that, you need domain expertise. That\u2019s why you should see data science as a tool that allows you to solve problems in a specific area that you care about.", "The world\u2019s primary need is not people who know how to code or do complex math (there are too many of those out there already). What it desperately needs is people who are passionate about their field, who know what the heck they\u2019re talking about and use data science to solve problems in that field (and if you are a code and math genius as well, even better).", "So if you studied biology, or architecture or any other cool discipline, then leverage that! Of course you still need to learn the technical aspects of data science and computers, but you have an enormous advantage over someone (like me) who knows nothing about those things.", "Listening to that podcast episode made me change my mind about my past years as a musician. As one of my professors in college once told me: \u201cIf you dedicated so many years to something you love, then you have a gift. Don\u2019t let that go. Use it\u201d.", "My mind keeps going back to my childhood, when my love for music started and I ran around the house, playing with toy guitars. It reminds me of the things that I love and how, in a way, they give meaning to what I do everyday as a data professional.", "I hope that you too can hold on to the things that are close to your heart and use data science to make important progress in those fields. And if you ever have doubts, remember that at least you never had to stand on a stage looking like an idiot.", "Your home for data science.
