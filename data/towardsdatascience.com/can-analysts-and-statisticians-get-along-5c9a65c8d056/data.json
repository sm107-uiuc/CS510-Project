Instead, an analyst\u2019s highest virtue is speed\u2014finding out what\u2019s in their dataset as quickly as possible.", "The idea of undisciplined prancing around in data rubs many statisticians the wrong way.

Those classes practically condition you to provide sophisticated answers to stupid questions, so what are you expecting from a workforce brought up on a decade of them? Hiring math/stat worshippers in droves will save you from some problems, but it exposes you to others, including bullies who make life hard for those who aren\u2019t building every sandcastle with 110% care.", "Setting my casual causal inferences aside, if you have a teammate who is going to pour their heart and soul into doing rigorous work, then hopefully that rigor is worth chasing. If your teammate lacks the skills to know which rabbit-hole to go down, they\u2019re going to need someone to point them in the right direction.", "With analysts helping them, statisticians no longer need to grope their way through the dark, building a universe in their heads to figure out how to ask their questions. Instead, they can let analysts to inspire their hypotheses and assumptions.", "So why aren\u2019t statisticians delighted to have analysts help them identify what\u2019s worth doing and why aren\u2019t analysts delighted to hand over the checking-our-conclusions-aren\u2019t-nonsense bit to statisticians? Why the antagonism and lack of respect?", "In the bad old days, datasets were too small to split, so you\u2019d have to choose between using them for analytics and statistics. That means the two groups would have to fight over each dataset.", "In organizations with a modern approach to data science, strong collaboration between analysts (inspiration / exploration) and statisticians (rigor / testing) is a part of the culture.", "Thanks to improvements in hardware and lower storage costs, today many endeavors are breaking through the one-dataset ceiling, ushering in an era of data abundance.*", "Now analysts and statisticians can receive their own piece of the original dataset, allowing exploration specialists to work in harmony with testing specialists, each group contributing what it does best\u2026 assuming they can let go of their habit of battling one another on sight.", "The price of effective collaboration between generation and testing of hypotheses is data quantity.", "Analysts can use their piece as a guided meditation to figure out what\u2019s worth pursuing and when they\u2019ve narrowed down what the business cares most about, the leftover piece gives statisticians a shot at rigorously checking if the analysts\u2019 hunch is worth acting on.", "Organizations can have a symbiosis between the data disciplines\u2026 and they should! Welcome to the modern era of data abundance!*", "Although today\u2019s typical datasets are much bigger (and more easily shared/accessed) than last century\u2019s data, there are use cases which are trapped in the one dataset era because initial data collection is very effortful or expensive. An example from my career is fMRI data \u2014 even today, it is very expensive to scan a single human brain, so neuroscientific datasets featuring a few dozen scans are still considered impressive. That\u2019s one reason it\u2019s naive to assume that all data will be big data. Information is simply scarce in some topics, and those who work on those topics face a one-dataset reality.", "If that sounds like your environment, try to be thoughtful about which camp rules the roost and respectful of folks from the other camp \u2014 they provide a fundamentally different service from yours and you would do well to remember that they are experts in their own right, even if your business has elected to choose your services over theirs.", "If you had fun here and you\u2019re looking for an applied AI course designed to be fun for beginners and experts alike, here\u2019s one I made for your amusement:", "Your home for data science.
