Matplotlib has served its purpose of quickly creating simple charts, but I\u2019ve grown frustrated with how much code is required to customize plots or do seemingly easy things like get the x-axis to correctly show dates.", "For a while, I\u2019ve been looking for an alternative \u2014 not a complete replacement as Matplotlib is still useful for exploration \u2014 ideally, a library that has interactive elements and lets me focus on what I want to show instead of getting caught in the how to show it details. Enter plotly, a declarative visualization tool with an easy-to-use Python library for interactive graphs.", "In this article, we\u2019ll get an introduction to the plotly library by walking through making basic time series visualizations. These graphs, though easy to make, will be fully interactive figures ready for presentation. Along the way, we\u2019ll learn the basic ideas of the library which will later allow us to rapidly build stunning visualizations. If you have been looking for an alternative to matplotlib, then as we\u2019ll see, plotly is an effective choice.", "The full code for this article is available on GitHub. You can also view the notebook with interactive elements on nbviewer. The data used in this article is anonymized building energy time-series data from my job at Cortex Building Intelligence. If you want to use your web dev skills to help buildings save energy, then get in touch because we\u2019re hiring!", "Plotly is a company that makes visualization tools including a Python API library. (Plotly also makes Dash, a framework for building interactive web-based applications with Python code). For this article, we\u2019ll stick to working with the plotly Python library in a Jupyter Notebook and touching up images in the online plotly editor. When we make a plotly graph, it\u2019s published online by default which makes sharing visualizations easy.", "You will need to create a free plotly account which gives you 25 public charts and 1 private chart. Once you hit your quota, you\u2019ll have to delete some of the old charts to make new ones (or you can run in an offline mode where images only appear in the notebook). Install plotly ( pip install plotly ) and run the following to authenticate the library, replacing the username and API key:", "The standard plotly imports along with the settings to run offline are:", "When we make plots in offline mode, we\u2019ll get a link in the bottom right of the image to export to the plotly online editor to make touch-ups and share.", "Plotly (the Python library) uses declarative programming which means we write code describing what we want to make rather than how to make it. We provide the basic framework and end goals and let plotly figure out the implementation details. In practice, this means less effort spent building up a figure, allowing us to focus on what to present and how to interpret it.", "If you don\u2019t believe in the benefits of this method, then go check out the dozens of examples such as the one below made with 50 lines of code.", "For this project, we\u2019ll be using real-world building data from my job at Cortex Building Intelligence (data has been anonymized). Building energy data presents intriguing challenges for time-series analysis because of seasonal, daily, and weekly patterns and drastic effects from weather conditions. Effectively visualizing this data can help us understand the response of a building and where there are chances for energy savings.", "(As a note, I use the terms \u201cPower\u201d and \u201cEnergy\u201d interchangeably even though energy is the ability to do work while power is the rate of energy consumption. Technically, power is measured in kilowatts (KW) and electrical energy is measured in KiloWatt Hours (KWh). The more you know!)", "Our data is in a dataframe with a multi-index on the columns to keep track of the sensor type and the sensor number. The index is a datetime:", "Working with multi-index dataframes is an entirely different article (here are the docs), but we won\u2019t do anything too complicated. To access a single column and plot it, we can do the following.", "The default plot (provided by matplotlib) looks like:", "This isn\u2019t terrible, especially for one line of code. However, there is no interactivity, and it\u2019s not visually appealing. Time to get into plotly.", "Much like Bokeh (articles), making a basic plot requires a little more work in plotly, but in return, we get much more, like built-in interactivity.", "We build up a graph starting with a data object. Even though we want a line chart, we use go.Scatter() . Plotly is smart enough to automatically give us a line graph if we pass in more than 20 points! For the most basic graph, all we need is the x and y values:", "Then, we create a layout using the default settings along with some titles:", "Finally, we can create our figure and display it interactively in the notebook:", "Right away, we have a fully interactive graph. We can explore patterns, inspect individual points, and download the plot as an image. Notice that we didn\u2019t even need to specify the axis types or ranges, plotly got that completely right for us. We even get nicely formatted hover messages with no extra work.", "What\u2019s more, this plot is automatically exported to plotly which means we can share the chart with anyone. We can also click Edit Chart and open it up in the online editor to make any changes we want in an easy-to-use interface:", "If you edit the chart in the online editor you can then automatically generate the Python code for the exact graph and style you have created!", "Even a basic time-series plot in Plotly is impressive but we can improve it with a few more lines of code. For example, let\u2019s say we want to compare the steam usage of the building with the energy. These two quantities have vastly different units, so if we show them on the same scale it won\u2019t work out. This is a case where we have to use a secondary y-axis. In matplotlib, this requires a large amount of formatting work, but we can do it quite easily in Plotly.", "The first step is to add another data source, but this time specify yaxis='y2'.", "(We also add in a few other parameters to improve the styling which can be seen in the notebook).", "Then, when we create the layout, we need to add a second y-axis.", "When we display the graph, we get both steam and energy on the same graph with properly scaled axes.", "With a little online editing, we get a finished product:", "Plot annotations are used to call out aspects of a visualization for attention. As one example, we can highlight the daily high consumption of steam while looking at a week\u2019s worth of data. First, we\u2019ll subset the steam sensor into one week (called steam_series_four) and create a formatted data object:", "Then, we\u2019ll find the daily max values for this sensor (see notebook for code):", "To build the annotations, we\u2019ll use a list comprehension adding an annotation for each of the daily maximum values ( four_highs is the above series). Each annotation needs a position ( x , y) and text:", "(The <br> in the text is html which is read by plotly for displaying).", "There are other parameters of an annotation that we can modify, but we\u2019ll let plotly take care of the details. Adding the annotations to the plot is as simple as passing them to the layout :", "After a little post-processing in the online editor, our final plot is:", "The extra annotations can give us insights into our data by showing when the daily peak in steam usage occurs. In turn, this will allow us to make steam start time recommendations to building engineers.", "The best part about plotly is we can get a basic plot quickly and extend the capabilities with a little more code. The upfront investment for a basic plot pays off when we want to add increased functionality.", "We have only scratched the surface of what we can do in plotly. I\u2019ll explore some of these functions in a future article, and refer to the notebook for how to add even more interactivity such as selection menus. Eventually, we can build deployable web applications in Dash with Python code. For now, we know how to create basic \u2014 yet effective \u2014 time-series visualizations in plotly.", "These charts give us a lot for the small code investment and by touching up and sharing the plots online, we can build a finished, presentable product.", "Although I\u2019m not abandoning matplotlib \u2014 one-line bar and line charts are hard to beat \u2014 it\u2019s clear that using matplotlib for custom charts is not a good time investment. Instead, we can use other libraries, including plotly, to efficiently build full-featured interactive visualizations. Seeing your data in a graph is one of the joys of data science, but writing the code is often painful. Fortunately, with plotly, visualizations in Python are intuitive, even enjoyable to create and achieve the goal of graphs: visually understand our data.", "As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.
