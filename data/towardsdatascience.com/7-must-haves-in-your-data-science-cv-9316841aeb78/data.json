As the hiring manager for several of the positions, I also read through a lot of CVs. Recruiters screen through a CV in 7.4 seconds, and after recruiting for several years my average time is pretty fast, but not that extreme. In this blog, I\u2019m going to walk you through my personal heuristics (\u2018cheats\u2019) that help me screen a resume. While I can\u2019t guarantee that others use the same heuristics, and different roles will differ in the importance of each point, paying attention to these points can help you conquer the CV screen stage. Additionally, some of these heuristics may not seem fair or could potentially overlook qualified candidates. I agree that talented Machine Learning practitioners who don\u2019t invest in their CV could get rejected with this screen, but it\u2019s the best tradeoff considering the time. Remember, a highly sought after position may attract a hundred or more CVs. If you want an efficient process, the CV screen has to be quick.", "Here are the 7 heuristics used to quickly screen your Data Science CV:", "I\u2019m going to quickly run through your CV to look at your previous positions and see which are marked as \u2018Data Scientist\u2019. There are some other adjacent terms (depending on the role I\u2019m hiring for), such as \u2018Machine Learning Engineer\u2019, \u2018Research Scientist\u2019 or \u2018Algorithm Engineer\u2019. I don\u2019t include \u2018Data Analyst\u2019 in this bucket as the day-to-day work is typically different from that of a Data Scientist and the Data Analyst title is an extremely broad term. If you\u2019re doing data science work at your present job and you have some other creative job description, it\u2019ll probably be in your best interest to have your title changed to a Data Scientist. This can be very true for Data Analysts who are de facto Data Scientists. Remember, even if the CV contains descriptions of the projects you\u2019ve worked on (and they include machine learning), a title other than Data Scientist will add unnecessary ambiguity. Additionally, if you\u2019ve undergone a data science bootcamp or full-time masters in the field, this will probably be considered the beginning of your data science experience (unless you worked in a similar role earlier, which will warrant questions at a later stage).", "Ideally, I\u2019d like to read what you did (technical aspects) and what the business outcome was. There\u2019s a lack of technically savvy data scientists who can talk in business terms. If you can share the business KPIs that your work impacted, that\u2019s a big thumbs-up in my book. For example, indicating your model\u2019s improvement in AUC is alright, but addressing the conversion rate increase as a result of your model improvement means you \u2018get it\u2019 \u2014 the business impact is what really matters at the end of the day. Compare the following alternatives depicting the same work with a different emphasis (technical vs business):", "a. Bank loan default rate model \u2014 improved model\u2019s Precision-Recall AUC from 0.94 to 0.96.", "b. Bank loan default rate model \u2014 increased business unit\u2019s annual revenue by 3% ($500K annually) while maintaining constant default rates.", "What\u2019s your formal education and in what field. Is it a well-known institution? For more recent grads, I\u2019ll also look at their GPA and whether they received any excellence awards or honors such as making the Rector\u2019s or Dean\u2019s list. Since Data Science is a wide-open field without any standardized tests or required knowledge, people can enter the field in various methods. In my last blog, I wrote about the 3 main paths taken into the field and based on your education and timing, I\u2019ll figure out which one you probably took. Hence, the timing helps understand your story \u2014 how and when did you transition into data science. If you don\u2019t have any formal education in data science, that\u2019s fine, but you need to either demonstrate a track record of work in the field and/or advanced degrees in similar fields.", "I\u2019ve seen some beautiful CVs (I\u2019ve saved a few of these for personal inspiration) but I\u2019ve also received text files (.txt) that lack any formatting. Working on your CV can be a pain, and if you\u2019ve chosen data science as your endeavor there\u2019s a good chance you don\u2019t enjoy creating aesthetic designs in your spare time. Without going overboard, you do want to look for a nice template that enables you to get everything across in limited space. Use the space wisely \u2014 it\u2019s useful to split the page and highlight specific sections that don\u2019t fall under the chronological work/education experience. This can include the tech stack you\u2019re familiar with, a list of self-projects, links to your github or blog and others. A few simple icons can also help with emphasizing section headers. Many candidates use 1\u20135 stars or bar charts next to each language/tool they are familiar with. Personally, I\u2019m not a big fan of this approach for several reasons:", "I\u2019ve also seen this approach abused even further by taking the subjective measures and turning them into a pie chart (30% python, 10% team-player, etc). While this was probably supposed to be a creative way to stand out, it demonstrates a lack of basic understanding behind the concepts of different charts.", "Here are two examples of CVs I\u2019ve found visually appealing, with details blurred for anonymity.", "There are two types of variety I look for:", "This can generally be broken down into languages, specific packages (scikit learn, pandas, dplyr, etc), clouds and their services (AWS, Azure, GCP) or other tools. Some candidates mix this up with algorithms or architectures they are familiar with (RNN, XGBoost, K-NN). On a personal note, I prefer that this revolve around technologies and tools; when a specific algorithm is mentioned it makes me wonder whether the candidate\u2019s theoretical ML knowledge is limited to just those specific algorithms.Here, I\u2019m looking for the relevance of the tech stack \u2014 are they from the last few years (a positive sign that the candidate is hands-on and learning new skills), the breadth of the stack (are they very limited to specific tools or are they familiar with quite a few things) and the fit with our stack (how much will we need to teach them).", "Is there something you\u2019ve worked on that you can share on GitHub? Any Kaggle competition or side-project can be very helpful, and enables looking at concise code, types of preprocessing, feature engineering, EDA, choice of algorithm and countless other issues that need to be addressed in a real-life project. Add a link to your GitHub and Kaggle account for interviewers to dive into your code. If you don\u2019t have much experience, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll be asked about one or more of these projects. In some interviews I had, the candidate didn\u2019t remember much about the project and we couldn\u2019t develop a conversation regarding the choices they made and the reason behind them. Be sure you brush up on the work you did or keep it out of the CV. Similarly, make sure you present your best work and you\u2019ve put enough time and effort into it. It\u2019s better to have 2\u20133 high-quality projects than 8\u201310 medium (or lower) quality.", "If you\u2019re looking for a new data science position, take some time and go through the points in this article. It\u2019s fine if you can\u2019t check off all of these marks, but the more you can, the better. Hopefully, these tips will help you stand out from the crowd and pass the CV screen with flying colors.", "Good luck and happy job hunting!", "Do you have a different approach when screening Data Science CVs?
