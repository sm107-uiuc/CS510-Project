Time complexity\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["One of the most important factors one needs to take into account when designing and implementing algorithms is the time complexity that is computed during algorithm analysis.", "Time complexity corresponds to the amount of time required for an algorithm to run over the provided input in order to generate the required output. In this article, we are going through the most common functions which are useful in the context of algorithm analysis. Furthermore, some code examples are provided in order to help readers understand how these functions relate to common operations undertaken by the computer, as part of the execution of an algorithm.", "This is probably the simplest function that is, for any argument n, constant function assigns value c.", "The constant function is useful when we need to count the number of basic operations executed by an algorithm. A few examples could be integer addition or subtraction and variable assignment or comparison.", "Another simple function which is important in our context is the linear function which is quite similar to the constant function but instead of assigning a constant value to the function, the linear function simply assigns the input given to itself.", "Linear function is quite useful when it comes to analyse an operation that needs to be performed over all n elements. An example could be the process of reading a sequence of n elements which are not stored in the computer\u2019s memory (i.e. to read all elements we need to perform n operations).", "Example of operations of complexity N:", "The logarithm function is one of the most common functions used in the context of algorithm analysis.", "In order to compute the precise logarithm for any integer we need to apply calculus however, in the context of Algorithm Analysis, we don\u2019t necessarily want the precise value, since a good approximation is sufficient for our purpose. To do so, we usually use ceiling that translates to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the logarithm. For example, the ceil of log16 is 4 because ((((16/2)/2)/2)/2) = 1. Similarly, ceil of log 18 is 5 because (((((18/2)/2)/2)/2)/2) = 0.5625 \u2264 1.", "Usually, algorithms that divide the problem in half in every iteration correspond to logarithmic order of time complexity. Such example could be the popular Binary Search algorithm shown below.", "Note: In Computer Science, we typically use log-base 2 due to the nature of the computers which are designed to store binary. This can be a bit confusing since in Mathematics the \u201cdefault\u201d base is 10 and most calculators assume base-10. In Algorithm Analysis, when the base is omitted we typically parse the log function with a base equal to 2.", "Another function which is common in complexity analysis is the quadratic function that assigns itself the square of the input n.", "In algorithm analysis, quadratic functions are used to describe the complexity of nested loops that is, a sequence of n operations which are performed n times. An example is provided below, where given a list, the algorithm attempts to find and report the duplicates. Note that this is definitely not the best approach (in terms of time complexity) when it comes to solve such problems.", "A similar function with Quadratic is the Cubic Function that assigns itself the cube of the input n.", "Cubic Functions are quite rare in Algorithm Analysis that typically denote that the design of an algorithm has poor performance.", "The Constant, Linear and Quadratic and Cubic functions belong to the wider family of Polynomial Functions of the form", "where \u03b1\u2019s are coefficients and d corresponds to the degree of the polynomial. Obviously, time complexities that are polynomials with smaller degree represent more efficient implementations than those of a larger degree.", "The exponential function is one more function which is useful when it comes to measuring time complexity of algorithms.", "The function consists of the base b and the exponent n where the latter is assigned the input value. Similar to the Log Function, we assume that the default base for the exponential function is equal to 2.", "A very common example of an algorithm of exponential time complexity, is the recursive function (i.e. a function that calls itself) given below that computes Fibonacci numbers", "Now let\u2019s say that for the same problem, a number of different algorithms has been implemented and we need to decide which one is better (at least in terms of time complexity). Measuring time complexity for each of the algorithms can help us decide which one is the most efficient and thus better in terms of performance.", "The table below illustrates how the time complexity is affected based on the size of input and the function that describes the complexity of an algorithm.", "It is clear now that the design of an algorithm should ensure that it does the job as efficient as possible otherwise, the time complexity can quickly explode and thus make the implementation inefficient and in many situations unusable.", "In this article, we went through the most basic functions that are useful when it comes to compute the time complexity of algorithms. We have introduced a number of Polynomial functions along with the Log function and explored some code examples that correspond to each of the aforementioned functions.", "It is important to choose algorithms with the lowest possible growth rate. Algorithms that run in linear or n log on time are considered quite efficient while algorithms of higher polynomial order such as Quadratic or Cubic usually denote inefficient algorithms with high growth rate, i.e. they might become a nightmare when they need to run over large datasets.", "Your home for data science.
