And it is not a surprise \u2014 Google always has something exciting and unusual up its sleeve. The 2019 year wasn\u2019t the exception to this rule. Android Q, upgraded Smart Assistant, new smartphones Pixel 3a, and Pixel 3a XL \u2014 the list of updates is far from being full.", "And today we will focus on machine learning solutions for developers like ML Kit for Firebase. This Kit was presented to the public last year on Google I/O 2018. And this year it got some updates. Let\u2019s review this SDK to find all the pros and cons and key capabilities.", "We hope this definitive guide will be useful and cognitive for you.", "ML Kit SDK is a rather new product from Google that was presented in 2018. ML Kit is a software development kit that makes it possible for developers to simplify the integration of machine learning models into their mobile apps. Moreover, even a junior developer can deal with this task.", "ML Kit is still available in the beta version only. It can be launched using Firebase. At the moment, there are 11 features with APIs available. By the way, only 5 features were available on Google I/O presentation in 2018, and today, this number is doubled. Features are the following:", "We will explore each feature and its API better a bit later, and now we will single out particularities and strong sides of ML Kit.", "It is not a secret that the integration of AI-based algorithms into mobile apps is not an easy task, and it requires good skills and much time. For a start, developers need to learn some appropriate machine learning libraries like TensorFlow, Torch, PyBrain, Azure, and so on. Then, a neural network should be trained to implement all the necessary tasks. But it is not the end! Moreover, it is just the beginning. The next step is to build a machine learning model that will be not very heavy since it should run on mobile devices smoothly. And only when the model is built, developers may relax a bit. As you can see, this task is rather complicated even for experienced developers.", "But the new ML Kit SDK allows developers to make everything faster and easier. Developers need to pass data to the required API and wait for the response from SDK. Google\u2019s representatives assure that developers don\u2019t need to be highly skilled in neural networks to implement their APIs. Everything developers need is to add several lines of codes, and a new app will get cool AI-based features.", "It is an appropriate option for skilled developers. If existing ML Kit APIs don\u2019t provide developers with the features they need, they can build their custom ML models. On Firebase website, there is an explanation of how developers can do it and benefit from their models.", "ML Kit works with TensorFlow, and this is a machine learning library for iOS and Android operating systems. This library allows developers to download their model to Firebase console and bundle it with their product. If a built model is too heavy, developers can leave it in the cloud, and then arrange dynamical downloading to the app. It makes it possible to downsize the app, and users will download the app faster. Apart from this, updates of models are also dynamic, and it is an important thing. It means that the model will be updated, whereas the whole app won\u2019t be updated.", "Developers can choose on-device or cloud APIs, depending on their needs. If you don\u2019t know what option is better, you should consider all the differences to make the right choice. Cloud APIs process data on the Google Cloud Platform, therefore object recognition is performed more precisely.", "However, cloud models are larger than on-device models. On-device models require less space, they can function offline, and data processing is faster, but these models are not so accurate.", "What\u2019s more, there are some specific features both in offline and cloud mode. For example, text and landmark recognition, image labeling \u2014 these features work in the cloud. On-device APIs offer much more features like text recognition, face detection, barcode scanning, image labeling, object detection & tracking, language identification, translation, smart reply, AutoML model inference, Custom model inference.", "Price also varies. Local APIs are free of charge. Firebase ML Kit uses Cloud Vision API, so cloud APIs and Cloud Vision APIs are provided at the same price. The more often you use APIs, the more you will need to pay, everything is simple. For example, up to 1000 uses per month, it\u2019s free. Then each new 1000 uses will cost $1,50.", "Also, one more important thing is privacy. According to Google\u2019s statement, the user\u2019s data isn\u2019t stored in cloud APIs, and it is deleted once the processing is complete.", "One more good news \u2014 ML Kit SDK is a multi-platform, that is APIs can be used for iOS and Android apps. Thus, a new ML Kit may compete with CoreML from Apple and even beat it one day. However, today, CoreML has more advantages than ML Kit. For instance, CoreML uses TensorFlow, and it also accepts ONYX, Python tools, Apache MXNet.", "Android apps that got ML features with ML Kit may run even on Android 4.0, so one of ML particularities is its capability to work on old Android versions. New versions like Android Oreo and Pie got better performance. Cloud models also use Standard Neural Network API for Android.", "ML Kit SDK may function flawlessly with other Firebase services. Image labeling can be kept in Cloud Firestore. Or Google Analytics can be used to measure user engagement. Besides, A/B testing of custom ML models can be performed easily with the help of Remote Config and ML Kit.", "Firebase service includes detailed manuals for developers with an explanation of how to implement the main use cases in apps they develop. There are manuals for Android and iOS programmers, so developers can use existing APIs to enhance their apps with new features for a couple of hours.", "As we promised at the very beginning, we will discuss each feature in detail and provide you with a piece of information concerning each feature.", "This feature is available both in the cloud and on-device. Text recognition API makes it possible to recognize any Latin-based language in text form. This feature can be used for the automation of annoying data entry for credit cards, receipts, and business cards. Cloud-based API allows developers to extract text from pictures of documents. This text can be used then for documents translation or accessibility increase. Moreover, apps with text recognition feature may read numbers on real-world objects. For example, customers need to extract data from a picture at the shop.", "This ML Kit API makes it possible to recognize objects in images. There is no need to provide additional metadata, and recognition is implemented on a standalone basis. This feature is available also offline and in the cloud. With the help of image labeling feature in mobile app, users will be able to know everything that is shown in the picture. Users got the list of all objects recognized in this image: people, animals, buildings, and so on. Each label comes with a score that indicates the confidence level of ML model in the recognition of that or another object. Using this feature, users can perform automatic metadata generation and content moderation.", "This API is available only in the cloud. It makes it possible to recognize well-known landmarks in any image. To test it, developers may put an image to this API, and then all recognized landmarks will be shown. Apart from this, geo coordinates of the landmark are also indicated. Therefore, it is possible to see where this picture was taken. This information can be used for metadata generation, providing users with a personalized experience.", "Face detection API is used for the detection of faces in images, key facial features, and build contours of detected faces. This feature is used only offline. Using this API, users can extract faces from pictures and edit them using different filters. Also, it is possible to generate avatars from users\u2019 photos. Since ML Kit provides users with a possibility to apply face detection feature in real-time mode, developers may integrate it into video chats or games. So if you need to develop face recognition app, you may this API from ML Kit.", "Barcode scanning API allows users to read data from barcodes using most standard barcode formats. Scanning is performed on the device, and the Internet connection isn\u2019t required. With the help of barcodes, users can find out what is hidden in encoded data. For example, it can be contact information or any payment data. This feature is very convenient to detect the encoded data.", "This amazing API that works on the device will help users localize and track objects in an image or live camera feed. A detected object can be classified into the selected general category. If users need to build live visual search experience, object detection and tracking feature may be advantageous. When all objects are detected, users can send them to the cloud back-end or a custom model, if developers build this model.", "Everything is clear with this feature. Language identification API makes it possible to identify the language from one text string. This feature can be especially useful for translators or historians who need to find out what language is written in an image or document.", "This API is as simple as the previous one. It is used for text translation of up to 59 languages, and users can switch between languages. That is, it is possible to select various combinations of translations using available 59 languages. Translation API uses the same models used by Google Translate offline app.", "Smart Reply API generates reply suggestions on the basis of the whole conversation. And this feature may build a full suggestion, not only short answers like \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d. Thus, users respond to messages quickly since all replies are generated automatically. But only the English language is supported at the moment, and this feature can be used only in casual conversations, not for specific discussions.", "AutoML model inference feature allows developers to train their image labeling models. On-device image labeling API model is trained to identify up to 400 various categories. But it may be necessary to narrow down the number of objects to recognize more specific ones. For example, users will need to distinguish one dog\u2019s breed from another. And here AutoML Vision Edge tool is used to train the required model with their images uploaded by developers.", "This feature is focused on skilled developers who didn\u2019t find an appropriate ready-made model, and they can build their custom model using ML Kit. To do it, developers may use TensorFlow Lite model with ML Kit.", "Important note! ML Kit for Firebase is still in a beta release mode. And each API may be changed in backward-incompatible ways, and API is not subject to deprecation policy or SLA.", "Unfortunately, some pitfalls in ML Kit also exist, and we should take them into account.", "It is a great option to use custom models since they can help experience developers integrate the features they need. However, additional custom models may become very heavy for the app and make the app too large. Thus, a file\u2019s size will be much larger than the size of a typical app. And it won\u2019t be good either for developers or users.", "Even though ML Kit was presented more than one hour ago, it is still in beta release mode, as we noted above. And it may have a negative impact on cloud-based APIs. If developers need to add cloud-based APIs, they need to use Cloud Vision API directly. Besides, any beta version has some defects and bugs, and it is normal for a beta release. There is no news concerning the date of the final version release.", "Several companies already used ML Kit successfully to provide users with a new outstanding experience. We will list two examples here.", "That is is a fitness app for those who want to lose weight. The app makes it possible to track the number of calories burnt. FitNow, the owner of the app, was one of the first companies that used ML Kit to provide users with a commercial app. Thus, the app uses text recognition API, and users can input the information about products they ate without typing it manually. That is, users point the camera towards the product label and Lose I! app scans and read everything. Apart from the available API, the company also created its custom model.", "This app is built to make the process of tax payments more manageable. There is a barcode scanning API integrated. For example, drivers can scan their driving license, and the app will read all the personal data from this license. Thus, users will make fewer mistakes, and the accuracy level will be increased.", "Wrapping app, we would like to add that ML Kit is a robust tool to build apps that are strengthened with machine learning features. Besides, you can add your custom models. Moreover, Google will probably prepare some new capabilities in the future that will knock us out. And maybe ML Kit will finally be released officially.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Technical writer at Cleveroad.
