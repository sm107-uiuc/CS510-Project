While many considered the tumultuous events of 2020 to have arrived as a bolt from the blue, one academic named Peter Turchin predicted a spike of instability for the United States in 2020 at least as early as 2010. In an article published in Nature that year, Turchin noted various trends \u2014 stagnating real wages, rising inequality, a growing youth population \u2014 indicating a cycle of instability due to come to a head around the start of the next decade. Naturally, the accuracy of this prediction ten years down the road has generated a fair amount of buzz. Humans have been attempting to predict the future since time immemorial, and the turbulence and uncertainty of our present era only increases the appeal of foreknowledge. So what methods did Turchin use to make his prediction and \u2014 more importantly \u2014 was it a fluke?", "What Turchin has done is not new, exactly. Taking observations from the immense dataset represented by recorded history, he searched for patterns and relationships with which to build a model that could be extended into the future. This concept of predictive modeling based on observed data is the backbone of what we now refer to as data science. First developing as a field alongside the emergence of computers in the 1940s and 50s, predictive modeling was initially limited to highly technical fields \u2014 early uses included predicting air flow in the atmosphere and the behaviors of atoms in a chain reaction \u2014 but has increasingly expanded to less technical fields as more and more of the data and the computing power it relies on become available. With the explosion of data generated by the era of the internet and ubiquitous computing, application of predictive modeling to business, language, and other areas has suddenly become viable. The extension of data science and predictive models into disciplines traditionally considered the humanities seems like a natural next step. For someone like Turchin, a professor of ecology and mathematics who initially made a name for himself predicting population dynamics in beetles, this must be especially true. The field of history, with its love of documents, aversion to mathematical abstraction, and millennia of records, appears a treasure trove of raw material awaiting a modeler\u2019s hand.", "Peter Turchin is not the first to have this impression. His work in what he terms \u201ccliodynamics\u201d is the latest expression of a long arc in historiography which first intersected with predictive modeling half a century ago, when that field was still in its infancy. \u201cHistoriography\u201d is the term for the theory and practice of the writing of history: using records to build narratives that allow us to understand the past. I\u2019ll spare the reader a more detailed account of the history of historiography (perhaps another post?) but a few snapshots are necessary to represent the trend that eventually brings us to that 2010 article in Nature. This will be extremely abbreviated \u2014 anyone with a more complete understanding of the history of historiography, please forgive these vague generalizations.", "To begin with, histories varied in the degree to which they possessed an overarching narrative. One frequent thread, visible across various cultures, is an emphasis on an ebb and flow controlled by outside forces. When non-cyclical narratives did develop, they were largely cosmological in nature, describing trends such as moral decay or religious awakening which would inevitably occur between the beginning and end of the world. The coming of the Renaissance and the Enlightenment in Europe brought societal changes which necessitated new forms of narrative to accommodate them. One notable example of this was the \u201cWhiggish\u201d historiography which had developed by the eighteenth century in England. Whig history shared medieval Christian historiography\u2019s concept of motion toward a preordained end, but rather than religious, this motion consisted of scientific and political development toward industrialization and liberalism.", "All of these historiographies tended to emphasize the decisive role of individuals (so-called \u201cgreat man history\u201d) and Enlightenment historiography in particular stressed the importance of ideas and intellectual history. A form of historiography radically opposed to these previous views took shape in the nineteenth century alongside major developments in economics and political science. This newer conception of history is perhaps best exemplified by Marxist historiography, which holds that contexts such as economic factors and social class are the prime drivers of history, rather than ideas and individuals. While Marxist historiography incorrectly predicted an inevitable transition to communism, the concept that societies were molded by their economic circumstances rather than vice-versa was a profoundly influential innovation. Considering historical events through this lens became especially useful with the rise of social history in the 1960s, which expanded the focus of history to include the lives of ordinary people and \u2014 critically for our purposes \u2014 society-wide trends and movements which required a certain amount of abstraction to describe. Modern historiography has developed immensely since, but exists always in some degree of tension between these two general approaches: the more idea and document-oriented, literary, somewhat individual focused history of the humanities tradition, and the more statistics-oriented, society focused, somewhat impersonal tradition heavily influenced by the social sciences.", "So what does all of this have to do with Peter Turchin? Whether or not he identifies it as such, Turchin\u2019s \u201ccliodynamics\u201d is an outgrowth of the abstracted social science strain of historiography, which has from its very inception striven to incorporate scientific methods as much as possible. The idea of predictive modeling using history itself dates back to the earliest days of predictive modeling. In his Foundation novels, written beginning in the 1940s, Isaac Asimov described the field of \u201cpsychohistory,\u201d a future merger of mathematics, psychology, and history which allows the character Hari Seldon to predict the future in detail millennia in advance (it is worth noting that the parallel with Hari Seldon is one Turchin acknowledges). As historical demography and modern computing have increasingly provided data and the means to work with it, respectively, various economists, historians, and statisticians have tried their hand at extrapolating into the future. Their efforts, including those of their latest successor Turchin, have been hampered by the two fundamental flaws of applying predictive modeling to history: shifting scale and lack of data integrity.", "The problem of scale is one uniquely present in the field of history. While other disciplines are more or less able to consider one scale at a time \u2014 psychology largely works with individuals, sociology with groups, and economics is divided into micro- and macro- subfields \u2014 history occurs at multiple scales simultaneously. While broad economic and social factors move the world towards conflicts and other major developments, events often hinge on individual relationships, decisions, and occurrences. For example: high inequality and explosive population growth alongside rapid technological change undoubtedly contributed to the situation in China in 1936, with civil war between Communists and Nationalists and invasion by the Japanese. However, no quantitative analysis could have predicted the critical turning point known as the Xi\u2019an Incident, in which Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek was taken captive by his subordinate Zhang Xueliang, the former warlord of Manchuria, and forced to negotiate a truce aligning with the Communists against the Japanese.", "Similarly, while demographic trends and a surplus of elites may have suggested that England would be invaded by surrounding powers around 1066, the exact timing \u2014 and ultimate outcome \u2014 of events was affected by something as simple and unpredictable as a spell of unseasonal weather. Northerly winds held the future William the Conqueror\u2019s invasion fleet in France while Harald Hardrada was free to invade from Norway and be defeated at the Battle of Stamford Bridge, then relented in time to deliver William\u2019s army to England to fall upon Harold Godwinson\u2019s exhausted forces and inaugurate the Norman conquest. In a further example from yet another time and place, the invention of the cotton gin in the 1790s United States greatly improved the profitability of growing cotton, increasing the southern states\u2019 dependence on slavery and altering the balance of power and development of the young country at a critical moment. Such human-scale pivots in society-scale trends are not small in number: they include disruptive technologies, concentrations of power in the hands of individuals, natural occurrences, and of course, random chance. It is this simultaneous importance of the microscopic and macroscopic which necessitates the coexistence of the seemingly opposed traditions of humanist and social scientist historiography. While documents, ideas, and individuals may struggle to comprehend vast movements and aggregated trends, statistics and economic indicators are powerless to capture the geopolitical significance of Kaiser Wilhelm II\u2019s determination to beat his uncle at yacht racing. To be complete, any historiography requires elements from both major traditions, and pure cliodynamics will always be hamstrung by its inability to account for human-scale factors.", "The other major issue is purely data-oriented. For predictive modeling to work properly, it requires clean, consistent inputs. This concept is so universally true in computer science and analytics in general that a decades-old axiom exists to sum it up: \u201cgarbage in, garbage out.\u201d History itself could hardly be described as clean and consistent, and history data is a downright mess. In order for any quantitative methods to be applied at all, let alone predictive ones, even numeric history data like census records requires immense amounts of cleaning, the process of handling flaws and omissions in a dataset which could adversely effect the quality of the output. It\u2019s commonly said that data scientists spend 80% of their time on data cleaning and only 20% on data modeling. For those working with history data, the proportion of time spent cleaning is even greater. The need for massive amounts of time-intensive cleaning raises serious questions about the integrity of the datasets used by Turchin and others. It seems highly unlikely that any individual has been able to properly clean and reconcile data from \u201cthe last 10,000 years\u201d at a level of granularity which would render modeling both possible and useful. The surviving data is simply too incomplete and spread across too disparate of contexts. The mere act of placing two pieces of data next to each other can involve subjective decisions which effectively create new data and bias the outcome. One of the concepts Turchin\u2019s analysis refers to is \u201celite overproduction,\u201d the assertion that instability is closely related to more elites being generated in a society than places for them, but when using sources ranging from Old Kingdom Egypt to Meiji Japan, what exactly is an elite? The answer appears to be that an elite is whatever Turchin identifies as one. This level of intervention in data labeling, while difficult to avoid when bridging such varied contexts, will inevitably carry undue influence into the model\u2019s predictions. Considering the extreme limitations of the data, I\u2019m betting that in reality Turchin is not predicting the next thousand years from the last ten thousand so much as predicting the next twenty years based on the last hundred or two.", "Ultimately, cliodynamics and similar attempts to divine the future based on historical precedent will certainly prove useful, but unable to stand on their own or be truly predictive. Even if the immense barrier presented by lack of data integrity can be overcome, the inability of predictive modeling to handle the human-scale factors present in history will render it ineffective below the macro level or over long periods of time. Indicators can suggest \u2014 in this case, correctly \u2014 a recurrence of cyclical instability, but that\u2019s all such predictions amount to: a suggestion. Turchin\u2019s 2010 predictions describe a coming spike in the youth population mirroring one that contributed to unrest in the 1960s and 70s, but fails to note that the youth population unexpectedly collapsed after its 1960s peak due in part to the adoption of modern contraception \u2014 a factor which doesn\u2019t exist for the vast majority of his dataset. Furthermore, the predicted 2020 youth bulge has failed to arrive thanks to shifting life patterns which have moved modern demographics out of step with historic ones. While it represents a useful descriptive tool which historians could potentially benefit from adding to their arsenal, cliodynamics would do well to learn from its own history. Hubristic claims to have uncovered iron laws granting foreknowledge of an inevitable outcome were made by practitioners of Whig and Marxist historiographies centuries ago, and the future is no more inevitable now than it was then. The actual course of events may drift one way or another, but can be yanked and turned by sudden developments and unpredictable individuals, the unique vagaries of history that keep it forever suspended between art and science and require a complete tradition of historiography to comprehend. No, Peter Turchin, history does not need to and cannot become an analytical, predictive science \u2014 but it might do well to incorporate one.", "Your home for data science.
