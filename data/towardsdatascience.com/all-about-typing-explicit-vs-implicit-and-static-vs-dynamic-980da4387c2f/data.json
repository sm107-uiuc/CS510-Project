Dynamic", "description": "Although programming often gets a reputation as a very complex activity, in the simplest definition it is relatively easy to understand. All programming centers around moving data and processing\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Although programming often gets a reputation as a very complex activity, in the simplest definition it is relatively easy to understand. All programming centers around moving data and processing data, with no exceptions. Even at the lowest level of programming, writing machine code, the objective is to move data back and forth between registries and memory addresses. I personally like to separate these programming objectives into four different categories.", "Most of the time when programming, one of these four operations is being used. While loops and conditionals are the tools that allow us to manipulate and work with this data, it is types that allow us to store and create the data in the first place. While types are an easy concept to grasp, there is a lot that goes on behind the scenes of a programming language that can factor in on how types are created, handled, and used inside of a particular language. For the most part, these observations include the way the language handles errors regarding types (Type Errors,) and how types are handled within the execution of the language.", "One huge distinguishable difference that a lot of programming languages have is the way that types are processed by their compiler. It is likely that most programmers are familiar with the terms \u2018 static\u2019 and \u2018 dynamic\u2019, but what do these two terms infer about types?", "Static typing refers to types that are created at execution. This means that before the language has even ran through its code, it has an idea of what kind of types it is going to be using and how they are going to interact with one another. Static typing has the advantage of making types immutable, which means that your data can safely reside within said types, and the work typically needs to be done to retrieve data out of said types. This can be great for code that requires this application of types. However, whenever you need types that will constantly be altered and used in different scenarios, it might be wise to look towards dynamically typed languages for a solution.", "Dynamic typing refers to compilers that deal more with the types during runtime, rather than when the program is compiled. Like static typing, this certainly has applications, but can also create problems \u2014 specifically if the programmer is not aware of how types are used within the language. It might be foolish to say that either statically typed languages or dynamically typed languages are better, but for most applications in Data Science, dynamic typing will likely be the best choice. That being said, there certainly are benefits to using a statically typed language for Data Science, as well.", "Another very important concept programmers should become familiar with is the idea of implicit and explicit type declarations. This is probably even more important to be aware of when working with a new language than whether or not it is static or dynamically typed. Of course, this is subjective, but I remember I had a hard time starting JavaScript early on because it would constantly assume what type I wanted to use \u2014 seemingly at random. Implicit and explicit typing, also known as strong or weak typing, is the amount of assumption that a programming language will apply to type assertion.", "Implicit typing can get you out of a pickle, and make programming a little more smooth in many situations. The downside to this, however, is that there is a very serious downside to having a programming language that guesses what you try to do behind the scenes. It can be hard to troubleshoot errors when your response to them is", "\u201c It\u2019s not even a string! Why is it a string all of the sudden?!\u201d", "Explicit typing on the other hand might make it more difficult to convert types and work with them, but will yield much more predictable results. Explicit is the key word here, as type declarations aren\u2019t assumed, and types aren\u2019t going to magically transform without explicit instructions to do so.", "Finally, to give an idea of what these concepts mean and where they sit with types, it might be a good idea to look at where your language fits into the bigger picture. Starting with many Data Scientist\u2019s weapon of choice, Python is a very dynamically-typed language. This is especially valid since Python is an interpreted language that is ran by C. Despite this, Python does not assume what you want to do with your types, and is for the most part pretty strict and explicit. While this is not an exact science, I imagine that Python would land about here on a compass between these two factors:", "This wouldn\u2019t be an article written by me if I didn\u2019t include the love of my life, Julia in the discussion. While Julia is certainly dynamically typed, it takes advantage of methods to create immutability and incompatibility between types impossible in certain situations. That being said, although within the realm of the conventional definition of static typing Julia is not, given its Just-In-Time compiler that compiles the code as it is executing, Julia also could be considered a little more static than something like Python. In terms of being implicit or explicit, Julia is very serious with types and really does not play around otherwise. This is something I have really admired about Julia, as this is something I personally prefer.", "While we are running through the languages of scientific computing, R is certainly a language that is notable to categorize. R is similar to Python in terms of being very dynamic, however hits a lot further down the scale on how it handles type assertion. More specifically, R can be an incredibly implicit language to work with.", "Another language that many might have experience in, and most are likely familiar with is a little language called JavaScript. JavaScript is a language that I actually had a really hard time adapting to because of its implicit nature early on. Though there are certainly some examples of more implicit languages that could be pointed out, I would say that of the languages I have used it is probably one of the most.", "Lastly let\u2019s look at a statically typed language one might use for Data Science. Among the most popular in this field is C++. C++ is a great object-oriented option for those who seek to work in that paradigm because of its speed, age, and reach in both scientific and other computing fields. C++ Is a statically-typed, and explicit language \u2014 as you might have expected.", "The ideas of typing are something that is certainly vital to a programming languages character. While it can be said that some activities might be better done with one or the other, this is usually subjective, and most languages regardless of where they fall on the compass I illustrated above can usually perform the same tasks \u2014 without taking performance or level into consideration, that is.", "That being said, while these factors might not necessarily limit a programming languages ability to do something, it can make a big impact on productivity if the one using the language is not aware as to the nature of their programming language. It is important to know how to use and manipulate your programming language correctly, which is even more true when your language wants to assume something, or you want to say edit types on the go. Furthermore, when choosing a programming language these factors could also apply to your choice and be a huge part in the decision making process. Maybe you want to do Data Science, and strongly dislike weakly-typed languages, knowing this difference between R and Python could be a huge factor in driving you to make a conclusion.", "Another important thing to remember is that \u2014 specifically with explicit and implicit typing, these determinations are on a scale. While the same can be said when taking an unconventional view at static and dynamic typing, typically those are just a boolean yes or no. Thanks to generics, however, I would say that anything is possible. There are so many creative language compilers out there that some may do a little bit of both, or you might run into something like Julia which is able to harness the advantages of both whenever one might want them.", "Your home for data science.
