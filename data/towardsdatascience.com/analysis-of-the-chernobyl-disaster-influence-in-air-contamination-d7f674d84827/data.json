S., and hosted on Jovian.ml.", "The full notebook and dataset used can be checked in GitHub or Jovian.", "The Chernobyl disaster started on 1986\u2019s April 26th, when the Chernobyl\u2019s nuclear power plant reactor caught on fire, lasting for 10 days, resulting in the unprecedented release of radioactive material from a nuclear reactor. The power plant is located at 100 km from Kievin (Ukraine), but the effects of this accident reached far beyond its country borders.", "The three most affected countries were Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, but the accident\u2019s consequences were not limited to those territories. Several other European countries were affected by it, due to a massive atmospheric transfer of radioactive material. Until this day, the real impact of this event is still under controversy.", "The assessment of the radionuclide intake with food and drinking water was based primarily on several measurements of I-131, Cs-134, and Cs-137 that were performed all over Europe [1], which are the radioisotopes reported in this dataset.", "The dataset was extracted from the REM data bank at CEC Joint Research Centre Ispra. The data was downloaded from Kaggle\u2019s data bank and is also available on the JRC Directorate for Nuclear Safety and Security.", "In this first section, we will perform data cleaning, by removing non-relevant columns and correcting/removing wrong values, and preparing the dataset for the analysis that is going to be performed in the following sections, by handling missing and invalid values.", "After reading the dataset .csv file, we remove columns that won\u2019t be used in the analysis, rename countries' abbreviations, and fixed some wrong and missing values.", "We can generate a map showing all locations that reported values in the analyzed dataset.", "View the map in fullscreen for a better experience!", "In this section, we will perform computations on numeric columns, focusing on their statistics, plotting graphs to help with visualization, while adjusting the data frame when necessary.", "The IAEA report on the Chernobyl disaster [1] corroborates with this finding: \u201cIn the early period after the accident, the radionuclide of most radiological concern was I-131; later, the emphasis shifted to Cs-137.\u201d", "We can visualize that France, Germany, and Sweden are the regions that reported most of the measurements in our dataset, respectively.", "Being the nearest country to Ukraine in our dataset, it\u2019s reasonable to presume that Czechoslovakia* had the highest reported exposure to the radioisotopes. This presumption can be confirmed by checking the following bar plot.", "We can also visualize a bar plot for the regions.", "We can confirm that, for our dataset, the country and locality/region that reported the highest total activity concentration are Czechoslovakia and Vienna (Austria), respectively.", "To better visualize it, we also generated an interactive heatmap that shows how the reported values are distributed on our dataset.", "From the heatmap generated using the reported locations of our dataset, we can visualize that most of the concentration of the radioisotopes were measured in Central Europe with the peaks being between Austria\u2019s and Czechoslovakia\u2019s regions.", "The impacts of the Chernobyl disaster are still controversial to this day. The damage caused to the fauna and flora can be noticed not only close to the power plant, but also in several other regions of Europe.", "From our analysis, we were able to assess how far and quickly the pollution happened through the spread of radioactive particles in the air and which countries and regions were most affected by it. We could verify that, in just a few days, there were already high concentrations of radioisotopes being detected in European regions very far from the power plant\u2019s location.", "Another interesting find of our analysis was the realization that a locality in Austria (Graz), which is relatively farther than other regions in the dataset, has measured much higher activity concentration values than those regions. Checking the literature on the Chernobyl disaster to verify if that big difference was due to wrong values reported in the dataset, we were able to confirm that this information is indeed what happened.", "A report from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on the Chernobyl accident [1] states that, even though the three most affected countries were Belarus, the Russian Federation, and Ukraine, due to wet deposition processes, there were also major contaminated areas in Austria and other close countries. In those regions, a radioactive plume from Chernobyl coincided with rainfall, releasing a much greater total radioactive deposition than in other countries.", "Other scientific papers, like the study of the contamination of Austrian soil with Caesium-137 [2] published in 2001, corroborate with that information. Those studies were of great value to this analysis and we recommend reading them if one decides to get more details in the subject.", "[1] International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Environmental Consequences of the Chernobyl Accident and their Remediation: Twenty Years of Experience, 2006, URL: https://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1239_web.pdf.", "Your home for data science.
