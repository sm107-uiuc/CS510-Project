This is what I previously named a \u201cC.I. environment\u201d \u2014 C.I. stands for \u201cContinuous Integration\u201d, a term which places the emphasis on the production of a final integrated application in an automated way[1]. Such an environment can also be seen as organized as a sort of Software Factory \u2014 here the terminology takes inspiration from traditional manufacturing industry \u2014 a perfectly oiled machine that helps to increase individual productivity and reduce the chances of errors for everyone. In short, to help developers produce good code with the least possible effort.", "So far so good, but\u2026 what does this mean in practice?", "Well, as you know my goal here is to review some of the choices and options when it comes to the selection of tools for our code production pipeline. I\u2019ll focus mostly on Open Source tools: Although there are very good commercial and proprietary solutions around[2], I prefer to present options which are available to everyone for free (I\u2019m from a town in Northern Italy where people are famous for their stinginess[3] ;-) ).", "Back to our environment and what sort of stuff we need to put inside it: At a very basic level \u2014 things can actually get more complicated here \u2014 we need instruments to: (a) manage the source code, providing code templates, handle source code versions and so on, (b) manage the build process to convert source code to the binary (executable) artefacts, with dependencies handing, versioning and storage of the produced components etc. and, last but not least, (c) provide instruments for the final configuration and deployment of these components.", "As we\u2019ve seen, when it comes to ML project involving some kind of model training, actually there\u2019s a further step between (b) and (c), which consists in producing the trained model. That is, some sort of new artefacts that stores the model parameters in some compact form to be used later.", "But let\u2019s deal with things in order: The first point \u2014 source code control and versioning \u2014 is a very important one. Saving a version of your code after making changes is an essential habit. It provides a means for monitoring those changes as they occur, it coordinates contributions by different people and tracks the ownership of changes made to the code, it provides a backup of the work done and allows to restore a working version in case some change introduces bugs or malfunctionings. Not bad, isn\u2019t it? In general, some form of versioning should be applied not only to application code but to binary artefacts, ML models, documentation, configuration and scripts.", "When talking about control and versioning for source code, Git[4] is the first thing that comes to mind. There are alternatives, of course, but it\u2019s safe to state that nowadays Git can be considered among the absolute winners.", "Git is notoriously a distributed version control system: unlike what happens with other tools like CVS or SVN, we don\u2019t need in principle a centralized repository. In practice, though, it\u2019s good practice to have a central place where developers push their code changes, for coordination and archiving purposes. One option is to exploit on some Git-based online public repository like GitHub or Bitbucket, but private companies usually tend to get nervous when it comes to putting their source code outside the safe walls of their own corporate fortress.", "You might prefer to host a source control central repository on your own on-premises servers. Just putting bare repositories for your Git projects on some shared folders \u2014 to be accessed via shell commands \u2014 is an option, but if you want some nice UI tool, one you can try is GitLab[5]; I\u2019ve used it in the past and it does its job fine.", "The good news here is that I didn\u2019t find any specific reasons to change version control tool or workflow for the specific case of machine learning -based software projects. Code is code, and Git works pretty well whether your code implements a pretty user interface in Angular, a Java REST service wrapping a JDBC database query, or Python code defining a Deep Neural Network architecture in Tensorflow.", "Now, what about the next step, managing the build process to convert your source code to binary (executable) artefacts? For this, it is usually not a good idea to rely uniquely on your IDE\u2019s project configuration and build mechanisms[6], better use some specific build and dependency management tools. Unlike IDEs, build tools are usually shell-based and that means that they can be managed through text-based scripts and configuration files. Your whole build process can then be organized, archived, versioned and so on \u2026 version everything, remember?", "Build and dependency management tools compile your source code into a binary artefact keeping track of package dependencies and managing them automatically and uniformly. Enterprise-sized software projects usually have a very large number of dependences, and managing them all by hand results often in a real nightmare.", "The issue with build tools is that, when selecting one, you have to make sure it fits your technology stack. Since my normal work consists essentially in Java-based projects, the tool that I most commonly use is Maven[7].", "When I started to play with Tensorflow and Keras code, I had to find a way to make my Python code fit the existing building workflow (or vice versa). Python has its own build and dependency management tools, based on distutils and setuptools, and the challenge was to integrate these with our Maven workflow.", "Maven is a rather flexible tool, allowing extension of its capabilities through a plugin-based system. I made some searches around the web for some Python-related plugins: Actually there is something available, both as Python-specific plugins or in terms of use of the generic exec-maven-plugin to start Python subprocesses calling setup.py[8] \u2014 but in the end, I decided to follow a different approach.", "The issue I was facing was an instance of a more general problem referred to as polyglot programming. That is, the practice of using different programming languages to model different parts of an application, with each language supplying the performance, the available libraries or APIs, the expressive power etc. that most fits each specific functionality or software layer.", "Recent trends to what are called microservices architectures[9] are making this kind of programming quite popular: You can have a service layer in Python serving ML models (think TensorflowServing), a business-logic layer of Java services and a typescript/Angular application layer to provide User Interface functionality. You can consider adding as many languages as you want, depending on the needs of your application. Keep into account that in any complete real-world application the functionality providing Machine Learning capabilities is likely to be just one of many interacting parts.", "In such a jumbled setting, rather than trying to make a single instrument like Maven fit all technologies, my approach reverted to using different tools for different projects: Maven for java projects, setuptools for python, Angular cli for Angular projects and so on. Then, in order to provide a uniform structure to the operations, a set of bash scripts would implement each development phase by exploiting the proper tools for each given technology. A build.sh script, a test.sh script, a deploy.sh script for the main development lifecyle phases, as well as support scripts like setver.sh to change current build version (in the case of Maven this script edits the pom.xml file, for example), and so on.", "Project templates used to generate and initialize projects\u2019 code \u2014 like Maven archetypes or Python cookiecutter templates \u2014 would include a ./scripts subfolder under the main project folder, including the proper versions of the scripts for the given technology, so that the developers don\u2019t have to worry about what is invoked, provided that the ./scripts folder is included in the system path. I don\u2019t know if this way of organizing things represents current best practices for polyglot programming development, but in my case it worked pretty well.", "With respect to the list I made at the beginning of this post \u2014 the list of stuff to put into our CI environment \u2014 we still have to discuss about tools to manage the produced binaries, to configure and to deploy them.", "Here, too, we have the problem that the usage of different tools for the different languages leads to the production of heterogeneous, incompatible binary formats for our application components. (we might have .jar files for java components, wheels for Python and so on). I\u2019ll just anticipate that to solve part of this problem, I\u2019ve found precious help in a nice little tool called docker, but since I\u2019ve already written more than I planned, I\u2019ll leave this for another day.", "As usual, I hope you found this post interesting!", "[1] Other similar terms that we could use here are Continuos Deployment, or Continuous Delivery (C.D.); or yet DevOps enviroment, where the emphasis is in turn placed on the deployment of the application components and their continous provision to the final user. I\u2019m not getting very precise or formal on the usage of the terms, I just mean to convey the general concept that some sort of computing environment is setup at company level that provides all the instruments needed to manage our software lifecycle.", "[2] Take a look for instance at Jira Software", "[6] There are exceptions to this, of course. For example, though I haven\u2019t been working with Microsoft technologies for several years now, I\u2019m aware that generally speaking the build process is well integrated with IDE tools in the .NET world.", "[8] See for instance Shiningpanda\u2019s solution, which uses the generic maven exec plugin to wrap calls to Python\u2019s setuptools.", "[9] For a good explanation about microservices architectures, you can take a look at Martin Fowler\u2019s article \u2014 quoting from there:", "\u201cThe term Microservice Architecture has sprung up over the last few years to describe a particular way of designing software applications as suites of independently deployable services. While there is no precise definition of this architectural style, there are certain common characteristics around organization around business capability, automated deployment, intelligence in the endpoints, and decentralized control of languages and data.\u201d", "or check Sam Newman\u2019s Book Building Microservices.", "Your home for data science.
