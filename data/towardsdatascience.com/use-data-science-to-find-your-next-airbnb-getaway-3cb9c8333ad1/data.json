Let\u2019s say you narrowed down your search to one or two neighborhoods based on your travel interests. The density of Airbnb listings in each neighborhood is so high that you will still end up with hundreds of listings to choose from. Instead of reading through each and every listing\u2019s description, amenities offered and various other features, can we ask a machine learning algorithm to find patterns in the data and group similar listings into clusters?", "Methodology: A common process to find many solutions in Data Science is the Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining (CRISP-DM). It has six major phases: - Business Understanding \u2014 Develop a business understanding.- Data Understanding \u2014 Develop a data understanding.- Data Preparation \u2014 Prepare your data to be analyzed.- Modeling \u2014 Model the data.- Evaluation \u2014 Evaluate the results to answer your questions of interest. - Deploying \u2014 Deploy your model based on the results of your analysis.", "I have employed this process to gather the data from Airbnb and deployed an interactive data dashboard to Heroku that will allow users to find similar airbnb listings.", "Business Understanding: The goal of this phase is to gain clarity on what exactly we are trying to solve. Based on the problem statement, our main aim is to help users find airbnb listings quickly and more reliably. Thus, our business goals are: better user experience and increased trust in the results found. These goals translate to a series of questions/tasks:", "Data Understanding: In this phase, we need to gain an understanding of the data necessary to answer our questions and the data needed to build the applications we identified in the business understanding phase. In our case, we can acquire the data from Inside Airbnb website \u2014 which publishes Airbnb listings data for several cities. The dataset comprises of several csv files that each capture information about the listings. For my analysis, I have used the detailed listings which consists of 106 features for 48,884 airbnb listings.", "Following along the CRISP-DM process, I have created a series of blog posts that cover the data gathering, pre-processing, modeling and deployment steps in great detail (along with code) explaining the choices made to arrive at the results. These blog posts can be found at the end of this article.", "Here, I would like the share the results of my analysis and explain the insights that we can gather from these results.", "A good starting point in narrowing down our search is to gain an understanding of which neighborhoods are pricey. The price displayed here is the median price per neighborhood. At a glance, we know that some areas are quite expensive compared to others, especially the ones in lower Manhattan. Similar insights can be gathered for other boroughs that help you narrow down the neighborhoods that are in your price range and meet your travel needs.", "Suppose that you wish to stay close to Central park in Manhattan and you decided to search for Airbnb listings in the Chelsea Neighborhood. There are 980 listings in this one neighborhood alone. Shown in figure 5, is the density of Airbnb listings in this neighborhood. As you can see, this is quite a large number of listings and this is where we can use Machine Learning to find patterns in the data and group similar listings into clusters.", "Now, our task is to find similar listings based on the features we constructed from description, amenities and several other factors for each listing. A total of 2151 features were engineered from the original 106 features for each listing. The full list of features can be found here: [2151 features].", "While working with a dataset with many features it is extremely difficult to visualize/explore the relationships between features. This is where dimensionality reduction comes in. In machine learning, dimensionality reduction is the process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. Principal components analysis (PCA) is linear dimensionality reduction technique which works well with datasets with many correlated features. In simple terms, PCA attempts to reduce the number of features within a dataset while retaining the \u201cprincipal components\u201d, which are defined as weighted, linear combinations of existing features that are designed to be linearly independent and account for the largest possible variability in the data. You can think of this method as taking many features(2151) and combining similar or redundant features together to form a new, smaller feature set. Shown below are the first 50 principal components with the amount of variance explained by each.", "As each principal component is a linear combination of the original features, it is possible to view what makes up each of these components. By looking at figure 7, the component make up of the first two principal components we can see that the most distinguishing features are the amenities offered at each airbnb listing. One way to interpret the component make-up is to say that:", "the dominant features that help segregate the Airbnb listings in Chelsea neighborhood are the amenities offered.", "In order to build our data dashboard, we could take the first 3 principal components, however, we would be throwing away a lot of useful information if we discard the remaining 47 components.", "An alternative approach is to apply t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) \u2014 which is a non-linear technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. t-SNE maps the multi-dimensional data to a lower dimensional space and attempts to find patterns in the data by identifying observed clusters based on similarity of data points with multiple features. In our case, we will take the first 50 principal components and apply t-SNE to reduce the dataset to 3 dimensions.", "By reducing to 3 dimensions, we are now able to visualize this in a 3-D scatter plot. Each data point corresponds to an airbnb listing. Points that are closer together have similar characteristics, i.e amenities offered, host_identity_verified etc. You can interact with the Plotly visualization below and even modify it if you like!", "Find a smaller bubble next to a larger bubble and you can save some money!", "Visualizing all the listings at once is not a good idea, as it becomes very difficult to read the plot. This is where data dashboards come in. Using a data dashboard we can filter the visualization based on certain attributes and investigate the relationships between data points with more ease.", "For example, the demo below shows how we can find two similar 3-bedroom airbnb listings in Chelsea neighborhood and compare the prices with other neighborhoods like West Village.", "You can interact with the application that is deployed to Heroku over here: [Airbnb data dashboard]. The steps taken to build and deploy this is documented here: [Deploy the data dashboard app to Heroku]", "The above t-SNE visualization lets us find similar airbnb listings based on how close they are in component space. But it does not group the individual listings into clusters and label each listing as being part of a cluster. This is where K-Means clustering comes handy!", "Consider this scenario: Suppose you found a really nice listing on 10th Avenue and West 20th Street and you wish to find a similar listing close to 34th Street Penn Station. By choosing another member of the same cluster closer to Penn Station, you can trust that there is some similarity between these two locations.", "The word similar here has a much deeper meaning than just saying similar price, similar amenities etc. It is a combination of 2151 features that we have created using NLP and Feature Engineering and then asked an unsupervised machine learning algorithm like K-Means to group them based on how close they are in terms of distance in the vector/component space.", "Every Data Science problem starts with a question. Our question of interest was: Can we find similar Airbnb listings based on what they offer? By making use of the CRISP-DM process we started our journey by understanding the problem, acquired the data from Airbnb, pre-processed the data, modeled the data and finally deployed a data dashboard which lets users find similar listings with ease. While this may seem like an overkill just to find an Airbnb listing, but the joy of discovering something unique makes it all worth it!", "Blog series which covers each step used to arrive at the results shown above:", "All the visualizations have been created in python \ud83d\udc0d", "Your home for data science.
