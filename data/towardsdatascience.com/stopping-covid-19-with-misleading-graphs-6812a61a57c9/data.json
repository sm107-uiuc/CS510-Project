Graphs and charts are great at conveying complex statistics to a general audience. What graphs are also great at is misleading people into making wrong conclusions about the world. Some media mislead because of their incompetence in statistics, while others intentionally manipulate the data to paint a better picture of their country. In this article, we will look at how Argentinian, Russian, and Georgian media have been \u201cfighting\u201d the outbreak by manipulating graphs.", "If you need to show that your country is great at testing people, just ask Argentinian media for advice, they have done a great job with the following graph:", "The graph shows the number of COVID-19 tests per million people. For non-Spanish speakers, EEUU is the United States of America, Alemania is Germany, and Noruega is Norway. Now, look at those bars: Argentina tests almost as many people as the USA! At least that\u2019s what it seems like until you look at the numbers. Argentina tests 330 people per million, while the USA tests 7000. That is 20 times more, but the USA\u2019s bar is only 1.2 times higher. The graph makes Argentina look decent at testing people, while it\u2019s clearly not the case. The TV channel arbitrarily manipulated the bars\u2019 sizes with no regard for logic or rules of scaling. This is how the graph would look without manipulations:", "This visualization paints an entirely different picture and shows that Argentina is nowhere close to testing as much as the US and other countries. But who wants to see the bad news, right?", "Flattening the curve is what every country is obsessed with, and it is not an easy thing to do. But not for this Russian TV channel:", "The graph shows the growth of COVID-19 cases from March 5 to March 31. The cases start growing rapidly, but since March 26, the growth seems to slow down and come closer to the top of the curve. Yet, as we learned from the Argentinian graph, looks can deceive.", "Until March 26, the bars\u2019 heights correspond to the numbers. You can verify it by seeing that, for example, the March 24 bar with 495 cases is twice as high as the March 20 bar with 253 cases \u2014 the visual increase corresponds to the numeric increase, wherein 495 is almost twice as big as 253. However, starting on March 26, the scaling of bars becomes inconsistent with the numerical differences. If you look at the numbers, the growth rate stays about the same:", "However, these changes are not depicted accurately with the bars. A 500 increase in cases on March 31 does not correspond to the visual increase, which shows something like a 50 cases increment. The TV channel assigned arbitrary heights to the last week\u2019s bars. Here is what the graph should have looked like:", "In this graph, the visual differences correspond to the differences in numbers and paint an accurate picture: cases keep growing exponentially, and it\u2019s a bad sign. Also, if you are wondering, the Russian graph is not a logarithmic one either.", "What\u2019s worse is that since these graphs are on TV, they are shown just for a couple of seconds, which is too little for anyone to examine the graph in detail and assess its labels, units, and correspondence of visual elements to numerical values. Most people would have time to glance at the bars for only a few seconds and conclude that things are getting better. Few of us would make an effort to pause TV and critically engage with the graph, and some media make use of it to deceive us.", "While for the previous two graphs you could still come up with some excuses, such as saving space or making the bars more visible, this one, from the Georgia Department of Public Health, leaves no room for forgiveness:", "The graph shows the decreasing number of new cases from April 28 to May 9. However, look at the order of dates on the x-axis: April 28, back to April 27, now April 29, and April 26 all the way between May 7 and May 3. One cannot accidentally put the dates in such a bizarre order. It requires manual and deliberate reshuffling.", "Georgians were quick at spotting the manipulation and voicing out their complaints. A day later, the graph was taken down, and Candice Broce, the governor\u2019s spokeswoman, apologized for the peculiar figure:", "The provided excuse does not make the graph any more informative, and I don\u2019t think there is any way to justify such a mistake. The government of Georgia could have used the graph to persuade its citizens to support the early reopening of the businesses. If you want to read more about the case, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has a great article on it.", "As we saw, sometimes media use the public\u2019s lack of attention to push their agenda. Our misleading interpretations of those graphs might later impact how we vote, behave, and make decisions. Hence, in such an overwhelming swarm of graphs and charts, it is essential to pause and ask critical questions:", "It is not always easy to fact-check every chart, but that\u2019s what it takes to be not misled by data manipulations. So let us be mindful of the news we consume and deliberate about the information we believe.", "Thank you for reading my article! If you have any comments, concerns, or questions, I would love to discuss them in the comments!", "The book that inspired me to write the article: How to Lie with Statistics by Darrell Huff.", "You can find more misleading and poorly done graphs at r/dataisugly on Reddit.", "Your home for data science.
