His response truly reflects the nature of the question itself, in that the question is subjected to the definition of intelligence by whoever poses the question.", "Julien\u2019s latest article on GPT-3 is a well-needed article, as I feel the topic of Artificial General Intelligence(AGI) has almost taken a backseat in our imagination.", "Julien points early in the article, two viewpoints on AGI. One viewpoint alludes to the fact that AGI is decades away; while the other questions the possibility of humans ever achieving AGI.", "Julien\u2019s article is littered with some technical and specialist terms, but each term is accompanied with a brief definition and in some cases an extensive background.", "Terms such as \u2018Deep Neural Networks\u2019, \u2018Machne translations\u2019, \u2018Word2vec\u2019 and \u2018Few-shot learning\u2019 are presented and defined in a manner that provides readers with a crash course on language modelling and NLP, as well as the primary information around GPT-3.", "The article doesn\u2019t mention GPT-3 until halfway through the article, due to the fact that Julien cleverly takes the reader through a journey that outlines crucial developments and research that have contributed to the advancement of language modelling and GPT-3 itself.", "Information on the intrinsic characteristics(number of weights) of both GPT-3 and its predecessor are provided to give the reader an understanding of the level of progress the GPT model has made at every released version.", "The latter half of the article presents examples of the intuitive application of GPT-3, developed by early access API users.", "But more importantly, Julien answers the question proposed in the article\u2019s title. Julien\u2019s conclusion at to whether if GPT-3 is AGI falls on the conclusion that it isn\u2019. But even more so, the answer to the question itself is not as clear as one might think.", "The unclarity stems from the fact that the definition of intelligence is ambiguous and subject to an individual\u2019s interpretation.", "What Julien states that is an important matter to discuss is the application of GPT-3. We\u2019ve already seen its ability to generate poems, gameplay scenarios and web components defined through language.", "What we now need to observe is how the latest feat of AI can be applied in a more general setting that involves videos and images.", "Julien\u2019s article interestingly contains segments of philosophical views and statements. For example, Julien points to the proposition that we can\u2019t determine the level of intelligence GPT-3 possesses, just as we can\u2019t determine the level of cognitive function of a paralyzed person or individual with physical limitations.", "This article delves touches areas of AI that are worth pondering about.", "Machine Learning Practitioners: The language and technical term used is very familiar with anyone involved in machine learning. And the definitions and papers included allows for further exploitation of topics related to GPT-3", "For those who are slightly short of time and would like to get bite-size information on GPT-3, then Dale Markowitz\u2019s article is the perfect stop. With well structured and presented paragraphs, you get the important information on key properties of GPT-3. The article also includes some examples of GPT-3 based applications.", "Dale\u2019s article can be described as a quick shot of useful information that contains the important details on GPT-3.", "Dale included in the article an exploration into the general makeup of the GPT-3 language model without the extensive inclusion of technical jargons and details.", "The article starts with some showcases of GPT-3 based applications through a series of embedded twitter posts.", "Dale\u2019s article provides information into the definition of the common technical idea GPT-3 is associated with, which is \u2018language model\u2019.", "The description of \u2018language model\u2019 is accompanied by an example even a five-year-old can understand.", "More importantly, Dale\u2019s article includes the properties of GPT-3 that are important to know, in order to carry further exploration. The article mentions the transformer-based architecture of GPT-3, along with the number of parameters within GPT-3 and its predecessor.", "The article concludes with statements to indicate the main reason as to why GPT-3 sets itself apart from its counterparts, which is mainly the fact that GPT-3 has a general application to a variety of tasks, without the need for fine-tuning.", "General audiences: The language used in the article is not too technical. The information presented is well structured and presented in a format that enables the understanding of key GPT-3 characteristics and benefits. No major technical background required.", "Web programmers will want to read this article", "Frederik Bussler has written a piece that has reignited a question that has been around the tech industry for a few years now.", "Frederik presents a brief background into the different versions of GPT and an opinion based reasoning as to why the coding job role might face an AI-Apocolypse sooner than later.", "Frederik starts his latest article with an indication to the reader in regards to how quick the progression of AI advancement can be. He references a question proposed by researchers in 2017, which asks the question that \u201cCould AI write most code by 2040?\u201d. In 2020 we are no doubt beginning to see an answer to that question.", "Like most other articles describing GPT-3, Frederik mentions the key characteristic of the GPT-3 language model, which is its ability to generalized to domain-specific tasks as a result of its very robust neural network parameters. This, as noted by Frederik, is why GPT-3 can code in practically any programming language.", "Frederik breaks away from the main question the article is trying to address and provides the reader with a detailed description of the variants of the GPT language model.", "The article steers back to the main subject, with a section named \u2018Evolve or Die\u2019, a faith that most industries will probably be subjected too, but coders more sooner than others.", "Frederik provides further information to the reader \u2014 who might be sceptical at the claims Frederik is making, that \u2018No-code\u2019 movement has been in full force with the introduction of platforms such as Squarespace, Wix, GoDaddy, generally WYSIWYG website generating platforms.", "To back up the trend of the emergence of code-free platforms, Frederik includes AutoML and links to a company that enables the creation of AI models with no coding skills.", "I get the impression that Frederik is pretty convinced that the coding or programmer role is fair game for AI in the very near future.", "Read this opinion-based article and find arguments that could reaffirm your worry of an AI-Apocolypse within several industries.", "Programmers: I\u2019ve always taken comfort in the fact that programmers and coders will be required even though AI and automation will decimate a large number of job roles in the future. The emergence and potential of GPT-3 seem to have ignited some worries that we should probably give more attention to.", "Not everyone is buying what GPT-3 is selling", "There is no shortage of articles glorifying the feats of GPT-3, but Ayush article seeks to bring us back down to Earth. This bluntly written article is short and convinces the reader that GPT-3 is nothing more than an AI-tool overhyped by mainstream media.", "Ayush Sharma article aims to bring individuals in tech that hold the notion that GPT-3 is an advent to the much anticipated Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).", "I particularly like the analogy he uses where he describes the similarity of the notion embraced by a few individuals in tech, to cavemen delivering they have solved nuclear fusion through the discovery of fire.", "Ayush seems not to be fooled by the shiny new toys build through GPT-3. The article reminds us that the hype and attention we are currently seeing is a familiar behavioural cycle adopted by mainstream media to overestimate the potential of AI advanced, all to sell stories.", "Describing GPT-3 as a \u201cglorified $10+ auto-complete software\u201d is rather harsh. In this article, Ayush states bluntly reasons as to why GPT-3 is not AGI.", "The article goes further to include examples of GPT-3 shortcomings.", "The conclusion to the article included an embedded tweet from Sam Altman, the CEO of Open AI, where he states that the hype surrounding GPT-3 is not warranted, and although it might be impressive, there is still a long way to go.", "Everyone: It\u2019s easy to get lost in the potential of AI that is showcased across the internet. Therefore, it is always healthy to have a rather critic-like perspective, so as to manage the expectation of the public and prevent future disappointments.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
