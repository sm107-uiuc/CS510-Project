And such posts exist because there are questions like:", "These questions have no single right answer as data science encompasses different roles and each role has different requirements from a mathematical perspective. Part of the reason is the broad nature of the term Data Science that many educators exploit.", "If you\u2019re someone who is more inclined towards the engineering(designing ETL pipelines, creating & handling data infrastructures) side of data, you might not need to understand Math. For someone who wants to master Machine Learning in general and deep learning especially, you should definitely make yourself familiar with mathematical concepts like Linear Algebra, vector calculus, probability theory at a minimum.", "This post intends to answer why it is necessary to learn math to master Data Science for a more Machine Learning oriented role. We will discuss what real-world scenarios you might run into where you\u2019ll leverage your deep understanding of algorithms.", "But let\u2019s first understand the core components of Machine learning and how they have a direct relation with math.", "There are 3 core components of ML:", "ML is inherently data-driven; data is at the heart of machine learning. The end goal is to extract useful hidden patterns from data. Although the data is not always numerical, it is more useful when it is treated as numerical. We can think of data as vectors \u2014 an object that adheres to arithmetic rules. This leads us to understand how rules of linear algebra operate over arrays of data.", "A model is a mathematical representation of certain beliefs and assumptions. It is said to learn(approximate) the process(linear, polynomial, etc) of how the data it is provided, was generated in the first place and then make predictions based on that learned process.", "From general ideas of applied math, we define the functions of many variables that represent certain assumptions from a probabilistic view. In a regression example, the model approximates a function that maps inputs to real-valued outputs.", "To account for the term \u201cautomatically\u201d in machine learning, each model is characterized by a cost function that we design to measure how well those assumptions that we made while developing our model correspond to the reality(yet unseen data or test data). We use numerical optimization methods(partial differentiation, SVD) to minimize this cost function.", "The main purpose of defining these 3 concepts in this manner is to help you understand the mathematics they are based on.", "You might argue that all these concepts are abstracted any way in the libraries, why not build over them directly? To counter that let\u2019s look at these real-world scenarios that you as an aspiring Machine/Deep learning practitioner would run into on a daily basis.", "As a Data Scientist, you are not only required to know machine learning algorithms but also to leverage your knowledge and build more efficient models. A great simple example of this is selecting the performance measure for your problem, a performance measure gives you an idea of how much error your system makes while predicting.", "Taking an example of a regression problem of house price prediction with a dataset containing many outliers. For someone who just knows that Root Mean Square Error(RMSE) is the preferred performance measure for regression models will simply evaluate the model on that even though the outliers would add large errors as an implication of the squared term in the formula.", "Now, RMSE measures the distance between the vector of predictions( h(x(i)) in the formula below) and the vector of target labels(y(i)). It is the root of a sum of squares of these distances. How do we do that on large arrays of data? All thanks to the magic of Vectors and Linear Algebra.", "A more efficient performance measure around which the model should have been designed in this scenario is Mean Absolute Error(MAE) as they are less sensitive to outliers as compared to RMSE as can be seen from the formula.", "Data Scientist at any product-based company will be required to support crucial decision making with his analysis and model results and thus need to be well versed with the domain/field of study. Be it finance, e-commerce, bioinformatics, or disease diagnosis. Computation heavy domains like finance, banking, etc. require a strong mathematical background.", "For example, a data scientist working as a quant in a hedge fund who is developing a model to price derivatives securities should be aware of how log returns, normal distribution, and calculus are contributing to the development of their model.", "Traditional statistical analysis is still heavily used in all the research-oriented multi-billion dollar fields like drug discovery which requires you to understand statistical concepts like mean, standard deviation, sampling, bootstrapping, kurtosis, skewness, etc.", "Not just these, Math serves as the founding principle for all the major industries.", "Debugging a software program is easy as you only have 2 dimensions to look into, the algorithm or its implementation. It is easier to build intuition for where the problem might be but in case of machine learning debugging gets very hard because of the added dimensions in the form of data and the chosen model. Your algorithm is either not working or not working well enough.", "Luckily, we have other indicators to figure out where the bug is. For someone who comprehends the underlying mathematical multivariate calculus well would have a better idea of how the cost function of the gradient descent is being optimized. With mathematical familiarity, you are better equipped to debug your learning systems(models).", "Many times, a model works really well but it is not used in production(the actual product) because of its scalability and computational complexity. Learning about the inherent limitations of your training algorithm helps you choose the right model for your use case even if it is not the optimal model.", "A good example to talk about here is our understanding of the cost functions. For instance, Mean Square Error(MSE) cost function for a Linear Regression model happens to be a convex function. This convex function is continuous and its slope never changes abruptly which leads us to use Gradient Descent as it guarantees to reach arbitrarily close to the global minimum which is the goal of the cost function.", "Learning about the shape and math behind cost functions also help us in defining the parameters of the model. For example, while using Gradient Descent, we should make sure that the features are scaled as it converges very slowly to the global minimum as shown in the figure on the right below:", "Applying for the position of a Data Scientist doesn\u2019t just require you to know Sci-kit learn or Tensorflow, you are required to know how a decision tree calculates the gini impurity at each node, how a cost function of a linear regression model is optimized, or what is the decision function for a linear SVM classifier.", "Here\u2019s what Google\u2019s Data Scientist Job description says:", "expertise in statistical data analysis such as linear models, multivariate analysis, stochastic models, sampling methods.", "The figure above shows a cogent breakup of mathematical concepts that lie at the roots of the four branches namely, regression, classification, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation.", "From a career perspective, if you really want to pursue Data Science, you must at least be familiar with topics like Linear Algebra covering vectors and matrices, Probability distribution to quantify uncertainty, Scalars, and vector calculus that explain gradient descent.", "We need to learn the mathematical foundations of Data Science are important to:", "With this channel, I am planning to roll out a couple of series covering the entire data science space. Here is why you should be subscribing to the channel:", "You can connect with me on Twitter, LinkedIn, or Instagram(where I talk about health and wellness.)", "Your home for data science.
