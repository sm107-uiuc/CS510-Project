This is the case of multi-image super-resolution (MISR), emphasis on the use of multiple images.", "MISR takes multiple low-resolution (LR) versions of an image and tries to combine them to recover the details of the high-resolution (HR) version of the scene. The trick lies in the fact that the LR images are slightly different from one another and what information was lost in one image due to the LR acquisition may still be present in another one.", "A simple example to show the principle is the following. Suppose you have a true HR image with a checkerboard pattern of pixels but you can only observe four LR images with a quarter of the HR pixels each. However, also suppose that the first LR image sampled the odd-indexed pixels from the HR image in both directions, the second LR image the even ones vertically and the odd ones horizontally, the third the odd/even ones and the fourth the even/even ones. Without using any magic, one can reconstruct the exact HR image simply by taking the pixels from the LR images and interleaving them in the right order!", "Satellite imagery is a prime example of where MISR can shine. Earth observation satellites, such as PROBA-V or the Sentinel constellation, acquire multiple images of the same scene because they periodically revisit it during their orbits. This is an important effort to monitor the environment, assess the risk of natural disaster such as floods, or understand the impact of human activities and climate change by detecting change affecting an area over a period of time. Therefore, there is a wealth of multi-temporal data that can be used to extract more information rather than looking at single images. Enhancing the spatial resolution by means of MISR approaches could help produce higher-quality products for scientists.", "However, in general, MISR is much more difficult than the toy example presented above. In particular, the main issues encountered when trying to combine multi-temporal satellite images are:", "On November 1st, 2018, the European Space Agency started a public challenge to enhance the images acquired by the PROBA-V satellite. PROBA-V is a small satellite dedicated to the study of Earth\u2019s vegetation and whose data can help combat the spread of deserts and deforestation activities throughout the world.", "PROBA-V acquires images with a ground resolution of 300 meters with a revisit time of 1 day. However, it also acquires higher-resolution images (100 meters per pixel), albeit less frequently, in the order of one every five days. Developing a MISR algorithm for this scenario is particularly interesting because it can help boost the temporal availability of high-resolution images by exploiting the more frequent low-resolution ones.", "The public dataset of the challenge is set up exactly to do that. Multiple low-resolution images of a scene acquired over the span of a month are available and a ground truth high-resolution version of the scene is also provided.", "An exciting race developed where many teams contributed with their own solutions. After a hectic last week and an all-nighter to be remembered, on June 1st 2019, DeepSUM, the method proposed by the Image Processing and Learning Lab of Politecnico di Torino managed to beat the fierce competition of team rarefin composed by members from the Montreal Institute for Learning Algorithms (MILA) and Element AI, and win the challenge.", "DeepSUM is an end-to-end trainable convolutional neural network which processes a number of low-resolution input images to provide a super-resolved image at its output.", "At a high level the network is composed of three main stages:", "Overall, the design and training of DeepSUM is guided by the idea of explicitly addressing the problems affecting MISR of remote sensing images that we discussed above. Here is how each one of them is tackled:", "While multi-image super-resolution is a very important problem for the remote sensing community, as proved by the vast scientific literature, very few works tackled it using deep learning. The new dataset provided by ESA\u2019s challenge will surely create a wave of interest and new techniques will appear in the coming months and year. We will look forward to exciting new developments.", "Your home for data science.
