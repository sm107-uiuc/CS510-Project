We were wondering if there is a simple way to understand which places are \u2018safe\u2019 and which are too crowded to go due to pandemic. What are the hours to meet fewer people on the way, which route to take?", "This even resulted in a prototype of a service that collects the data like popular times from Google (not available for developers) and shows the heatmap of crowded and not too crowded places.", "It\u2019s not a secret that due to COVID-19, Apple and Google united to provide healthcare authorities with statistics about how people\u2019s mobility patterns changed. Apple\u2019s report reflects the changes in walking, driving, and being in transit based on requests for directions in Apple Maps, while Google focuses on \u201cmovement trends over time by geography, across different categories of places such as retail and recreation, groceries and pharmacies, parks, transit stations, workplaces, and residential\u201d.", "Both sources reflect the percentage of change in how people started less (or more) commuting, walking, driving, and visiting places when compared to the baseline \u2014 the average during times before the pandemic. This publicly available data is a finding for curious people and a resource for authorities who need to make informed decisions.", "Looking back at the prototype, our careful user pretends to live in the Mayfair district of London. And there is a reason why London became a city of choice to test the prototype. It has a lot of publicly available real-time CCTV cameras. You can access almost 900 cams through the London Traffic Cameras website. It also has an archive of snapshots captured every 5 minutes and stored for one month and a half.", "We hypothesized that if we analyze the streams and calculate the number of people on the snapshots (real-time processing is too heavy for a sofa report), it may provide us with some insights on how popular the places are in particular hours, and how the whole traffic changes over time. So, we took 50 cameras from the city center. The heart of our circle was Big Ben, while the covered area started from Harrods on West to the London Bridge on East, and from Kings Cross on North to the Battersea Park on South. Quite a central area, so cannot speak for all the city, still being big enough with more than 5 km in diameter.", "The archive of snapshots that was available at the moment when this bright idea came across our minds was, unfortunately, a little bit out of date to capture the big drop in mobility caused by increased strictness of social distancing rules in late March. So, we analyzed the available timeframe: from the 16th of April till the 8th of July, almost three months.", "The technology behind this analysis was OpenCV, YOLOv3, and Tensorflow \u2014 the open-source libraries and frameworks available from the shelf. In terms of the people detection, we fully relied on YOLO which is the state-of-the-art (best in the block) machine learning model for object detection.", "Our calculations for all the fifty cameras brought us the number of people that varied approximately from 5,000 to 29,000 per day. The dotted line is a trendline \u2014 a linear approximation of our jumping daily numbers. As you may notice, there are several dates where the data is missed, those are some technical issues on our side or just the days missed in the archive.", "How reasonable are the numbers we got? Well, more or less when we recall that we process only once-in-5-mins snapshots. This is 12 images per hour. In reality, people appear more often in front of the cameras, so ideally we would take a frame roughly every 20\u201330 seconds, which would make us 120\u2013180 frames per hour, 10\u201315 times more than we have. Multiplying it by our numbers, we would get 50,000\u201375,000 people on an empty day and 290,000\u2013435,000 on a crowded one during the times of pandemic. Seems legit for a 5 km circle in the center of London considering limited cameras view.", "Apple allows downloading the raw dataset so that you can play with the numbers compared to the baseline which is 100% by the y-axis (and they also lack a couple of days). 33% value on the chart means that Londoners walk less for 67% en masse.", "While the Apple report describes the whole of London, the camera analytics observes only a part of central London that consists mostly of offices and public spaces having fewer residential buildings. So, our assumption was that while people living in bedroom communities continued walking to the grocery stores, parks, and other venues, the traffic in downtown should have decreased dramatically during the quarantine.", "So, we compared the outcomes using the normalized representation of both charts.", "From what we can see, the growing trend is a bit more aggressive for the city center. Because of the strong initial fall, faster growth is something we should expect. As time went by, restrictions became weaker and more people returned to normal life visiting places located in the downtown.", "If we take a closer look at June and July, we will see the trend (dotted line) is almost the same for the city center and Greater London despite the fluctuations in real numbers. This may mean that the walking patterns are getting back to normal at approximately the same pace in the center and the rest of the city.", "As a conclusion of this Sofa Report, I would state that our approach certainly doesn\u2019t work for bigger areas just because of the lack of video-surveillance. However, for local communities equipped with cameras, it\u2019s quite comparable to the results of giants like Apple and Google.", "All the computations here were done using the casual desktop CPUs and not-the-last-gen GPUs.", "Your home for data science.
