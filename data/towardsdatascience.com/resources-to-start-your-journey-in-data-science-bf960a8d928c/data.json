You must have a solid foundation if you\u2019re going to have a strong superstructure\u201d - Gordon B Hinckley.", "The above quote applies to any domain. I have listed down the few courses and pointed to YouTube channels below which will help anyone to work on the foundational aspects of data science.", "PadhAI is an initiative under One-Fourth Labs, a startup at IIT Madras which is committed to ready India for the AI-age with affordable high-quality online courses. Foundations of Data Science course is up on their website with content covering the basics of Python programming, Statistics & Probability. If you are a student you can avail discount by providing a valid ID card!", "3Blue1Brown is a Math YouTube channel created by Grant Sanderson. The channel provides an amazing visual perspective of a lot of advanced mathematical concepts. Below I have listed down the links to Linear Algebra & Calculus YouTube playlist which are very much essential before diving into learning different machine learning algorithms.", "Mathematics for Machine Learning from Coursera", "Mathematics for Machine Learning specialization is from the Imperial College of London and comprises of 3 courses Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Dimensionality Reduction: PCA with weekly quizzes and few coding assignments as well. Advantage of Coursera is, one can always audit the course and get access to course content at free of cost. If you are a student, you can apply for financial aid providing the valid reasons and get access to course content including quizzes , assignments and earn a certificate as well with no fees.", "Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses by Andrew NG, computer scientist and a top instructor on Coursera.", "Both the courses are pretty famous and involve weekly quizzes and coding assignments. For the Machine Learning course, assignments are in Octave/Matlab(syntax very similar to NumPy library in python) and for the deep learning course assignments are in TensorFlow.", "Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses by Jeremy Howard, Kaggle Grandmaster and a professor at the University of San Francisco. Good thing about these courses is its freely available and Jeremy Howard takes a top-down approach in explaining various ML/DL concepts.", "Introduction to Machine Learning for coders!", "Once you are familiar with the foundational concepts + various machine learning/deep learning concepts, it's time to get your hands dirty by participating in data science competitions or hackathons.", "I have seen many people saying that doing Kaggle or Analytics Vidhya competitions is of not much use since most of the competitions don\u2019t depict real-world data/real-world problems. But I would say these platforms definitely provide exposure to a variety of problem statements which one might not get a chance to work on in his student life or corporate world.", "Yes, you read it correctly!! Google Colab and Kaggle provides free GPU compute to all their users. If you have a huge dataset and want to train a deep learning model, just upload the dataset to any of the two platforms and you can easily reduce the training time of your DL models from few days to few hours!!", "On Kaggle per week, one gets 30 hours of free GPU compute which comes with P100 GPU, 16GB of GPU memory. Recently both the platforms have started providing TPU compute for free!! In Kaggle, one can use up to 30 hours per week of TPUs and up to 3h at a time in a single session. Its time for you to explore more now :)", "If anyone wants to pursue a Masters's program along with their day to day job to enhance their knowledge in data science, I have listed down the universities which offer MS degrees equivalent to that of on-campus programs without mentioning mode of delivery as \u201cOnline\u201d on the degree certificates and provide career service as well!!", "Single course(3 credit) duration: 4 months (Need to complete 10 such courses)", "So the total cost for the degree would not exceed more than ~$8200.

I personally feel it is not the right way to make a decision just by looking at the degree he/she holds and not the skillsets which he/she posses. But anyway, having a degree will enhance your knowledge and hold on to the subject which is very much essential.", "I hope this post was helpful in providing a comprehensive list of resources to start your journey in Data Science.", "Many of them might still say that \u201cCan\u2019t we just survive in the Data Science filed just by knowing how to use libraries like sklearn, Keras, TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc. and ignoring the fundamental concepts or the math behind any machine learning or deep learning algorithms ??\u201d", "My answer to them is a big NO.
