Do they add any value? Is there a downside?", "In this article, first, we\u2019ll get into what these buzzwords stand for.", "Second, the article argues that for good reasons, all three buzzwords are marketing old concepts in new clothes. It is merely asking us not to be a data fundamentalist, and not to abandon common sense. In fact, the data-informed business decisions and data-driven business decisions turn out to be the same when we apply clear thinking; when we don\u2019t apply clear thinking, the result is the same for both cases, we make wrong decisions.", "Lastly, we\u2019ll explore how at once buzzwords hurt and help.", "If you\u2019re looking to validate, be data-driven. If you\u2019re looking to innovate, be data-informed. If you are looking to find inspiration for an idea, be data-inspired. This is how you\u2019ll see it explained.", "Below is a table showing a little bit more accepted detail in the industry for the buzzwords.", "As we move from a data-driven to a data-inspired approach, we start focussing more on data interpretation and story building skills. We are no more dogmatic on the numbers. In the first case, we try to understand why behind all the metrics, and in the second case, we try to create stories with all those numbers.", "The challenge is if you are open to insert narratives to connect the dots, you would invariably find data to support your POV. There is a reason we have an expression that data is like a prisoner in police custody. Torture it, and it\u2019ll tell you things you want to hear.", "To sum up, the buzzwords are merely asking us to not take data at face value, not to rely only on what is easily available and measured, and not to abandon common sense.", "Now, to understand why all three buzzwords are marketing old concepts in new clothes, and how and why they hurt and help at once, we need to understand their history.", "Please take a look at google search trends for these buzzwords. In the year 2010, we got the buzzword data-informed, before that the tech world was mostly data-driven. Data-inspired has started showing up since 2018.", "Data-driven has been in fashion for a long time; the time before data-driven we\u2019ll call the stone age.", "In the beginning, we didn\u2019t have data buzzwords, we had visionaries: business visionaries, product visionaries, and marketing ninjas. Endowed with rock-solid intuition and an impeccable understanding of the needs and behavior of users, they were making the most of the decisions in an organization. Decision making for a business was more of an art than a science. It was not consistent.", "The fortunate teams had real visionaries (10X), and unfortunate ones had fake ones (Sub-X). Real ones did a good job of connecting dots on moving parts of the business and made solid decisions; fake ones struggled, but no one knew.", "Digitalization of data resulted in a deluge of data, and it presented an opportunity to enhance the performance of both groups \u2014 10X folks and X folks. We needed a slogan to get people excited. The industry invented the word \u2014 data-driven, to rally the population towards a new approach. No doubt, the approach helped.", "Data-driven decision making helped the entire industry. It helped, however, 10X folks more than the Sub-X folks.", "It is because the new data provided more leverage to folks who were already good at connecting dots. 10X folks with superior data interpretation skills did an amazing job at decision making, but the benefit for \u2018X\u2019 folks was moderate. It is because they took the \u2018data-driven\u2019 label literally, and mistook data as an insurance policy against common sense and deep thinking.", "With data on their side, over-enthusiastic data-savvy guys shouted \u2018data\u2019 without thinking about the context. Not only did it lead to wrong and sub-optimal decisions, but also it slowed down decision-making, and hence business innovation.", "Moreover, the dogmatic data-driven guys lobbied for strategies with short term benefits. They were not willing to believe in anything that they can\u2019t see and measure in the first pass. Their enthusiasm was getting the business stuck with local maxima.", "With the abuse of data-driven buzzword on the rise, there was a need for a new mental model. A new buzzword.", "A new term got coined. Now you had a response to over-enthusiastic data-driven colleagues. \u201cGuys your approach of data-driven is great, but we need to be data-informed here.\u201d Please notice, both the buzzwords have the word data. It is harder for data-driven fundamentalists to oppose anything that started with data.", "Unfortunately, the birth of all the buzzwords is not inspiring. Some buzzwords are born out of need, and some with the need to sound smarter. Data-inspired, in my opinion, falls into this category.", "It asks you to use the framework when data is super-minimal. You rely on your intuition, creativity, and your past experience to spot trends in the data.", "Unfortunately, data interpretation is hard as it requires an understanding of the user\u2019s needs and a lot of thinking. To stop the neglect of deep thinking by the community, new buzzwords are coined as a cue to remind: don\u2019t stop thinking.", "It is critical that we understand this, otherwise, we get hypnotized by the gloss of new buzzwords and end up making the same mistake.", "Let\u2019s look at the knowledge hierarchy \u2014 an old concept, to understand it better. It shows us the journey of data getting transformed into a decision? There are a couple of steps before we get to wisdom. Wisdom gives us decisions.", "The model above never implied that gathering data is enough, and it takes away the burden of decision making. Data-driven never meant data collection or reading it literally. Remember your business context is also data, even though it is not formulated into the data you are seeing now. Remember that insight from industry or insights you gathered last year is also data. These additional data are there to help you transform the current data into wisdom.", "On the one hand, the new buzzwords tell us nothing more than to do data interpretation, on the other hand, it makes us fall for the green lumber fallacy. We start mistaking talkers from the doers, we fool ourselves that knowing buzzword implies we are good in data interpretation. Frequently, it takes attention away from the core.", "It is important to strike the balance and understand the trade-off before adding a new buzzword in the mix. Data-informed sounds good, but data-inspired seems self-indulgent.", "Your home for data science.
