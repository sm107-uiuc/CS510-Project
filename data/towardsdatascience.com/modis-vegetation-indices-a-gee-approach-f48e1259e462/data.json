Several reasons can be appointed for its success: the high revisit-time of 1 to 2 days, the global coverage, the wide range of applicability and its derived products. Just to name a few.", "In this tutorial, you\u2019ll focus on the MOD13Q1 product, which consists of both the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) in a global scale at a 16 days frequency. You might already know the NDVI from the Introduction to GEE, but here you\u2019ll also explore the usefulness of EVI for environmental analysis.", "From the GEE Introduction, you already know how to sign up and use gee, install folium for interactive visualization and geehydro to interact with the code in a similar way to the native Javascript API. If you\u2019re interested in climate modeling and read the Introduction to CMIP6, then you must know Proplot as well. The novel package for this tutorial is ipygee, which works in a similar way as geehydro to allow the use of some functions that are only available within the GEE code editor.", "To install ipygee, just use Pip:", "Then you can proceed to import all the tools you\u2019ll need in this tutorial:", "As you know, to use gee you must always trigger the authentication and initialize the library, especially if you are interested in running the code in Google Colab.", "The World Database on Protected Areas (WDPA) is the greatest database of marine and terrestrial protected areas and it\u2019s easily available in GEE. It provides comprehensive geographic information and the boundaries of any area in the world. Here you\u2019ll use it to get the shape of the Xingu Indigenous Park in Brazil, known as one of the first and greatest protected areas in the world.", "With the EE snippet, you can load the polygon database of the WDPA and filter the area of the Xingu Park:", "As you already know, Folium and geehydro allow visualization of GEE data. In this case, you can plot the area of the Xingu Park and interact with it:", "The Xingu Park is a special place for its rich history and diversity. Before the boundaries were defined to make the Park official in 1961, the Villas-Boas brothers first went there almost by accident as part of the Roncador-Xingu expedition. As most of the country (and the government at the time) thought the region was deserted, they quickly found it was filled with hundreds of different indigenous tribes. Those encounters defined the beginning of the history of indigenous rights in Brazil.", "To load the MODIS product, simply use ee.ImageColletion() with the snippet you need. To make the analysis a bit easier, you\u2019ll filter the data for the last 3 years.", "The MOD13Q1 product has both the NDVI and EVI available, so you can easily select them and attribute the data to different variables:", "A minor issue with MODIS data is that you need to apply a scale factor according to the product you\u2019re using to make sense of it. According to this User Guide (RTFM), the scale factor for the MOD13Q1 product is simply 0.0001. That means you\u2019ll have to multiply each dataset by this scale factor to start using it properly.", "You probably already figured out that you\u2019ll need to write a small function to do it. In GEE dialect that means you\u2019ll have to .map() over an ImageCollection. No unnecessary for-loops here, please. When in Rome, do as the Romans do.", "Please, insert your Monty Python joke here.", "With the datasets properly scaled, you can finally use them within the WDPA boundaries of the Xingu Park and start your analysis. A good way to start is to plot the mean NDVI on the interactive Map.", "The same code goes for the mean EVI. Thanks to Folium and geehydro it\u2019s simple as that. While an interactive Map is cool, any python enthusiast would be interested to get a time series and squeeze out some cool information from it with data science. GEE has a native way to make time-series plotting but, unfortunately, that\u2019s only available in the Code Editor. That\u2019s exactly where ipygee comes in handy, as it mimics the native javascript-based ui.Chart.image.series(). Without it, we would be in trouble.", "It works just the same way with the same arguments, and it even allows you to make a small widget from it when you plot.", "That could get a way better, you could probably be thinking. The amazing part from that is that ipygee also permits you to work with this time series as any Dataframe you might be familiar with. That\u2019s where Pandas gets in the pitch. Don\u2019t believe it?", "From then on, you can go from GEE to our usual Python ecosystem at ease. Think about Pandas, Seaborn or any related package you know to study time series. Thanks to ipygee you can go from both points any time you want.", "That means you can plot it in the way you like it. Try it out with Proplot:", "Again, the same can be done with the EVI time series just waiting around the corner. With a bit of Pandas, we can transform these 16-day sampled time series in a monthly time series with .groupby(). That could make them behave a bit less wildly.", "To compare the two time series, you\u2019ll go back to the standard Matplotlib as there are some issues about sharing axis in Proplot for the time. Unfortunately, or not, you\u2019ll have to stick with a little less elegant solution until they fix this minor problem.", "Notice the difference in magnitude but the same behavior in both time series. It\u2019s likely that the more complex algorithm of EVI makes it resistant to atmospheric effects and allows it to reflect more robust vegetation changes. The vegetation in the Xingu Park is dominated by the Cerrado biome, which is less dense than the standard Amazon rainforest. Perhaps that\u2019s why EVI is lower than NDVI, but that\u2019s a guess.", "MODIS-related products are fantastic datasets that allow a wide range of environmental applications. The global, high-frequency and high-resolution MOD13Q1 dataset is extraordinarily useful to study vegetation behavior and changes. With the Python API, you can have access to many of these products in GEE and, hopefully, you learned how to explore them with this tutorial.", "As usual, the interactive Jupyter Notebook with all of the code above is freely available in my Climate Data Science repository.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Meteorologist, climate data scientist founder of the Amazon\u2019s first-ever Climate Consulting Company.
