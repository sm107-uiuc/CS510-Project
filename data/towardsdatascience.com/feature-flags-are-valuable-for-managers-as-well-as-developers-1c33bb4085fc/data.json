Do you create a new release of your application and then push it to production? Can the preceding release already contain the code?", "For years, I have seen development teams coupling the launch of a new feature with the deployment of a release. And when the feature was not working properly, the only solution was to rollback the whole release, losing all other changes.", "Continuous Delivery introduced a new idea: every single change leads to the delivery of the code, which can either be automatically deployed to production (Continuous Deployment) or require a manual action (Continuous Delivery). Working this way requires the ability to enable/disable the usage of a feature, and this exactly what Feature Flags are designed for.", "But please note that Continuous Delivery is not a prerequisite to use Feature Flags. It might be desirable to decouple a business go-live from a technical deployment, regardless the way of working.", "As an architect, I am deeply convinced that Continuous Delivery is the future for a team like mine \u2014 and the whole company. And because my teammates and manager agree with this vision, we have been working hard to reach this target.", "Deploying our applications several times a week (or a day) for our daily business is a great achievement but the truth is we were still struggling to launch a new feature. At the time, a feature was enabled or disabled via some config shipped with the app, and the only way to activate a feature was to update the config, i.e. release and deploy the app again.", "To solve this pain point, I proposed to implement a system of Feature Flags, which is far from a revolution but little known and often underestimated. The idea is to have a system to toggle a feature, that can be queried to determine whether the given feature is active. Pete Hodgson says it all in his brilliant article on Martin Fowler\u2019s blog:", "Feature Toggles are a powerful technique, allowing teams to modify system behavior without changing code.", "When I presented the idea to the management, I was told that maybe we should buy a tool for this \u2014 and that would be great if such a tool could also do A/B testing and other sexy features. Of course, it makes sense to consider all options here, and to take the good decision according to the company constraints and capabilities.", "I advocated for making our own for this time for a few reasons, among others:", "Finally, the management trusted me and gave the green light for a light-weight PoC with limited scope (no A/B testing, focus on technical features). After just one sprint, the component was ready because our infrastructure is designed for this, and developing microservices is our daily business.", "The proposed service has been designed as a simple RESTful API, binding the usual CRUD operations:", "Note that the PATCH method is used instead of the PUT since we only apply a partial update of the Feature resource (only status and last modification info).", "The component relies on its own dedicated relational DB, with one single basic table made of few columns: name, status, expiration date, creation and modification info.", "There is almost no logic in the application, requests are transformed and given to the DB. We just implemented a few additional security and caching layers for obvious reasons:", "Another crucial point is the capability to manage errors from the clients calling this API, when the service does not respond for some reason. There are traditional patterns for this, like timeout, circuit-breaker, etc.", "The adoption of this new mechanism took a few days until every IT team had a chance to launch some new technical feature (or disable some old ones) but every developer was very positive about it, because it greatly facilitated the go-lives, with a considerable reduction of stress level.", "Just a few weeks later, our company was strongly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis, and as an e-grocery company, we had to adjust many business processes to support the sudden demand we were facing.", "I was more than pleased to see that in such critical times, developers intensified the move to toggles. Very often, when things get harder, people choose to flip back to the former, traditional, legacy way of working, but this was not the case here.", "In my humble opinion, this was the time when many people did realized the incredible benefits of Continuous Delivery coupled to Feature Flags: IT teams were able to go fast, developing urgent features in a short time, which were immediately pushed to production, and features activation was just one click away \u2014 or more likely, one curl away.", "Moreover, as the Feature Toggles service is exposed, it can be reached by any application in our constellation, so that every part (front end, back end, mobile, etc) is immediately aligned when a feature is activated.", "Another interesting benefit here is that not only can features be activated but also deactivated very quickly, which is quite comfortable as it is way easier than a full rollback.", "It would be naive to think that there are only advantages in setting Feature Flags up to the architecture. One drawback in particular is the additional complexity for every client calling the service. This code must be maintained and tested, and after the feature has been launched, it has to be cleaned up.", "This brings us to another threat: having too many Feature Flags can be counter-productive. Again, Pete Hodgson warns us about this in his article:", "Feature Flags have a tendency to multiply rapidly, particularly when first introduced. They are useful and cheap to create and so often a lot are created. However toggles do come with a carrying cost. They require you to introduce new abstractions or conditional logic into your code. They also introduce a significant testing burden.", "To mitigate the risk, we adopted the strategy consisting in creating a story in the backlog as soon as a Feature Toggle is inserted, so that cleaning tasks can be on our radar during grooming (or backlog refinement) sessions.", "We also defined a recommended workflow to help developers to use the tool, with some guidelines. Typically, a naming convention was necessary, since the feature name is the identifier.", "Feature Flags boosted our productivity, reduced our stress during deployments, and gave the product owners (or managers in general) the ability to activate a feature based on business constraints, not technical release trains. I believe the agility we all gained here is priceless, as the time-to-market is slightly reduced, and the control increased.", "In the end, everybody wins: developers, managers, product owners, and finally customers. Definitively a good move.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "IT architect. Continuous Delivery enthusiast. Human-oriented. Happy to learn from others and to share experience."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
