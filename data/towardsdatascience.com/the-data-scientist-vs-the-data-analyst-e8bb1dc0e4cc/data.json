And data scientists view data analysts as slightly enhanced secretaries (no offense to secretaries).", "OK, I\u2019m exaggerating. Or am I?", "Just play along with me as I explore the most extreme facets of these two characters, trying to uncover their fundamental differences. But first, we must understand what ties them together.", "Let\u2019s set the basics straight. A private company exists to make money. It doesn\u2019t exist to improve happiness, fairness, diversity and inclusion. Those are nice side-benefits, nothing against them, but none of them is the company\u2019s goal.", "What is also NOT the company\u2019s goal is analyzing data, creating beautiful charts or building machine-learning models. These are nice too, but they are side-inputs. Means to an end: making more money.", "That is what both the Data Analyst and the Data Scientist are there for. Where their jobs differ is in how they do it. And that\u2019s because there are many ways to make money, but at a very abstract level, it all boils down to exploration versus exploitation.", "I know, \u201cexploiter\u201d is not a word and sounds like an insult, but that\u2019s what the data analyst does, all day every day: they exploit the data at hand. The data analyst will patrol the known perimeter, find improvement opportunities and weaknesses to fix. They will sort things in buckets, count what\u2019s in every bucket and sound the alarm if something is amiss. As such, data analysts typically know their area very well. Anything out of the ordinary will be noticed, and management will rely on them to be vigilant and thorough.", "Most data analysts are structured and organized people. They deal well with repetitive tasks, for several reasons. First, they understand the importance of those small details in the everyday functioning of the business, so what might seem boring to others will be important to them. Second, they are good at finding many subtle ways to enrich their routine, be it by deepening their business understanding, nurturing their social network or simply cracking jokes during a meeting. And finally, they usually prefer a predictable world over a chaotic one.", "That being said, data analysts are not passive by any means. If an enemy comes out of the woods to attack the castle, they\u2019ll be first to spot them. If instead, we want to attack the enemy hidden in the woods, they\u2019ll tell us which side of the forest looks safest to enter. Data analysts are all about tactics and how to best navigate in the known world.", "While data analysts rarely leave the confines of the walls, data scientists are never to be found inside the castle. The data scientist is the guy or gal that goes exploring solo in the jungle to find out more about the noises heard at night. Whereas you can expect the data analyst\u2019s report on the hour, you have no idea when the data scientist will come back, what they\u2019ll bring back with them, or whether they\u2019ll come back at all. Most of the time, they don\u2019t. And that\u2019s OK. Because if they do come back, it\u2019ll be because they made a game-changing discovery. Data scientists are restless and do not care for what is known: they want to explore and predict the unknown.", "Here\u2019s a take on exploitation versus exploration in the context of business strategy:", "I caricatured to the extreme, but the fundamental differences are true and they should be relevant to you whether you are wondering about your career path or preparing to hire for a data role.", "You will often hear data analysts mock the data scientists and their projects that go nowhere. While we should always strive to build useful business components, no matter the role, it is by definition normal that the data scientist misses the target more frequently: he or she is shooting in the dark. But when they do find something, it will be different enough to justify the investment.", "On the other hand, if you rely on data scientists to conduct your everyday operations, you are toast. You need people who are detail-oriented and know the ins and outs of your business like their back-pocket. Those typically less eccentric analysts are the ones keeping the boat afloat.", "I wonder if I\u2019ve been unfair to one group or the other. Probably a little bit: data analysts can be creative and go for long-shots, and data scientists are not all unreliable daydreamers. The best of both groups are the ones who learn the traits of the other group and pick-up just enough skills to shine.", "The best data analysts I\u2019ve encountered are the ones who learned python and the basics of statistics and machine learning in their spare time.", "The best data scientists I\u2019ve seen are the ones who spent time understanding the industry, the business and the products they were involved with.", "Your home for data science.
