This includes leading technical teams and educating business executives. A pretty common question is:", "I come from a quantitative background and qualified as an actuary. I spent the early years of my career within \u201cnon-traditional\u201d actuarial disciplines. Then, I stumbled into the field of data & analytics which has flourished in digital and technology transformation.", "In my early years, most of the statistical models were already built. Our primary responsibility was to ensure that its assumptions and adjustment factors were updated.", "Moving forward, most predictive models introduce the concept of AutoML (Automated Machine Learning). This involves the automated model selections and calibration based on certain business user settings.", "If it is all automated, what is the actual role of a data scientist? Also, how could it be so hard?", "Every model is highly dependent on the input configuration. For example, what is the dependent variable, what are the input range variables, do we want a general or specific model, and many others.", "Whilst the AutoML orchestrates the process, human decision-making remains. Data Scientist is then expected to understand the underlying statistical model mechanics, assumptions, and principles. This ensures that the selected models behave according to expectations.", "Data Science models are built to solve business problems. Data Scientist has the responsibility that the models work according to the business process. It is a business profession that deals with mathematics, it is not a mathematics profession that deals with business.", "Beyond the model build, data scientist needs to evangelise and uplift the organisations data literacy. This includes areas such as model transparency, model data lineage, and model understanding to increase organisations data confidence.", "In my various years of experiences, the quest for clean data is an elusive one. I believe that it is a journey, which requires a defined process to continuously improve and integrate.", "Data Scientist is expected to play a major part in the data cleaning. The old saying of \u201c90% of the time in data prep and 10% of the time in modeling\u201d still remains true. As per my reasoning above, executives trust data scientists that understand the business. It is everyone\u2019s responsibility on the data pipeline including data engineers and reporting analysts that also make it happen.", "For organisations, a model should be treated as an asset. With any asset, it needs to be governed and maintained. Also, it needs to be leveraged for various use cases rather than just a single-use.", "For example, we created a customer attrition predictive model for one of my previous clients. Beyond identifying at-risk customers, we also used this for customer engagement segmentation and as an input to a credit risk scorecard. Build one and re-use many will drive higher ROI for any asset, which will promote more use cases for other model development.", "Data scientist needs a good grasp of mathematics, business, and technology. Those that think a solid quantitative degree is enough, will find it challenging to thrive in the commercial environment. Those that have the right focus will be able to embrace the data science journey and bring others along with them.", "If you like this article and would like to see more content, please consider joining Medium membership to support me and other fellow writers using the link below:", "Check out my other articles if you want to learn more about practical and impactful data analytics topics.

He is recognised as the leader of the Analytics CoP (Community of Practice) that empowers and motivate others beyond the status quo.", "Your home for data science.
