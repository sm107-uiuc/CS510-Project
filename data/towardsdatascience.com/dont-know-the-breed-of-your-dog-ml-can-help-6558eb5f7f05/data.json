You probably would have to ask a specialist about that. Well, no more! In this post, I will teach you to build your own web application that will accept the image of your dog and output its breed with more than 80% accuracy!", "You might be wondering how\u2019s that possible? Well, we will be using Machine learning, specifically Deep Learning, to train a model on a dataset of dog images with their breeds in order to learn the features that distinguish each breed. Let\u2019s start then!", "The dataset can be downloaded from here. After successfully loading and exploring the dataset, the following were some of the insights about the data:", "The top 30 breeds ordered by the number of images are shown here:", "We can also see some of the dog images with their breeds here:", "After analysis, comes the part to get the data ready for machine learning algorithms. We will load each image as a NumPy array and resize them to be of size 224x224 as it is the default size that most conventional neural networks accept images in. We will also add another dimension for the number of images", "Lastly, we will use ImageDataGenerator to apply re-scaling and augmentation on the fly to the images", "We will start by training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) from scratch on the pre-processed dataset as follows:", "We are using a callback ModelCheckpoint to save just the model based on the validation score. Testing this model, we get an accuracy of just around 1%", "Now we will see how using pre-trained features can make a huge difference. Download the ResNet-50 bottleneck features. You can extract the respective train, test, and validation sets by running the code cell below:", "We will define the model again now and use GlobalAveragePooling2D on the extracted features which average an array of features into a single value. Lastly, we use additional callbacks for reducing learning rate, ReduceLROnPlateau , if the validation loss isn\u2019t increasing in 2 successive epochs and also to stop the training early, EarlyStopping , if the validation loss doesn\u2019t increase for 5 successive epochs.", "The accuracy now on the test set is 82.65%. That\u2019s a huge improvement from the model we trained from scratch.", "For the web app, we will first write a helper function that accepts the image path and returns the breed. label_to_cat dictionary maps each numerical label to its dog breed.", "For the web app, we will use the Flask web framework which helps us create web applications with minimal code. We will define a route that accepts the image and renders an output template with the dog\u2019s breed", "predict.html is the template that shows the image and its dog breed respectively.", "Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a Dog breed classifier and can tell a dog\u2019s breed with confidence. Let\u2019s conclude what we learned here:", "We surely learned a lot but there are a lot of other things that you can try. You can deploy the web app on Heroku or try to improve the accuracy using different layers such as Dropout layers.", "For more information and detailed analysis, make sure to check out the code available on my GitHub here.", "If you feel that above content was useful for you, do share it and feel free to support me ->", "Your home for data science.
