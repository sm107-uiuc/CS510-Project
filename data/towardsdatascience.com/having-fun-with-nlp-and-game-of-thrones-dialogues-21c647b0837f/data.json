Who has more dialogues? Which words are most used through the series? Who is the true protagonist? Or maybe, is it possible for a computer to generate new dialogues for the show? This article will try to answer those questions.", "Before anything, I would like to mention these two guys whose work inspired a lot of what you are about to see, so please check their posts and their code as well:", "Paras Chopra and Daniel E. Licht.", "The dataset consists of 65 chapters of the series, not all seasons are complete, especially season 2, 3 and 4, all other seasons are complete. You can learn more about the technical aspects of gathering the data here.", "I plotted the top 20 characters with most dialogues and with a higher count of words, and we can clearly see the Tyrion indeed never shuts up, with more than a thousand dialogues and an average of 16 words per dialogue is the most talkative character by far.", "Indeed, dialogues and words are related and the top 20 characters barely changed from one plot to another, one interesting change is that of the Lannisters, who speak more words per dialogue.", "Jon Snow is a man of few words, his plot is almost flat, very similar to that of Daenerys, the Lannisters' plots are more robust, meaning more words every time they open their mouths.", "There is a big outlier in Jaime\u2019s plot, so much bigger than the other 4, when I checked I realized that is the biggest of them all. The longest uninterrupted dialogue of our sample data is that of Jaime Lannister telling Brianne how he killed the Mad King back in season 3 with more than 350 words.", "I plotted the 60 most used words by the top 5 characters, I used NLTK to get rid of some very used words in the English language and some other words that will not bring any value to the plot like \u2018King\u2019, \u2018 Lord\u2019, \u2018Sir\u2019, etc.", "Only the Lannisters have LOVE in their words and I think that really defines them as characters, their motivation is mostly passional. While the Starks like Jon and Ned fight because of duty and to save the world or Dany who is fighting because is her destiny and is pretty clear by the words she uses, she is a ruthless ruler; the Lannisters fight because of the people they love. I could also say that Game of Thrones is about a bunch of murderous people with extreme daddy issues.", "Speaking the most does not always mean to be the most influential character, that rests on how important the people you speak to are, and how many times you are mention outside your own dialogues. How related you are to the world around you, so here is the interaction network of our sample data.", "Check the link of the graph for a better view and for a chance to play with the nodes.", "Anyway this graph tells us nothing numerically about the importance of a character.", "It does tell us how important Cersei, Tyrion, and Jon are, but any could be the main character, right?", "If we measure the degree of centrality of each node, we will get a very clear answer on how important or central our characters really are to the series, so let\u2019s have a look on the top 10 most important characters according to our sample data:", "Well, Jon is indeed the song of Ice and fire by far the most important character on the show according to our sample.", "Before pre-trained models were available, you needed a huge corpus of text to do anything meaning. Now, even a small dataset is enough to do interesting things. Let me know in comments what project ideas come to your mind that could use a small text corpus along with a pre-trained model.", "I took Paras Chopra challenge and generated some dialogues myself, and the results are quite funny.", "Generating dialogues between characters will be an interesting challenge, is there an approach that you can think of?", "Who do you think is really the main character?
