That being said, there\u2019s a big difference between MLE/MAP and Bayesian inference.", "In this article, I\u2019m going to introduce Bayesian inference by focusing on the difference between MLE/MAP and Bayesian\u00a0inference.", "Note: Preliminary knowledge of MLE and MAP is assumed in this article. If you\u2019re not familiar with those methods, please refer to the following article.", "Let\u2019s start from the recap of MLE and MAP. Given the observed data D, estimations of a probabilistic model\u2019s parameter \u03b8 by MLE and MAP are the following.", "MLE gives you the value which maximises the Likelihood P(D|\u03b8). And MAP gives you the value which maximises the posterior probability P(\u03b8|D). As both methods give you a single fixed value, they\u2019re considered as point estimators.", "On the other hand, Bayesian inference fully calculates the posterior probability distribution, as below formula. Hence the output is not a single value but a probability density function (when \u03b8 is a continuous variable) or a probability mass function (when \u03b8 is a discrete variable).", "This is the difference between MLE/MAP and Bayesian inference. MLE and MAP returns a single fixed value, but Bayesian inference returns probability density (or mass) function.", "But why we even need to fully calculate the distribution, when we have MLE and MAP to determine the value of \u03b8 ? To answer this question, let\u2019s see the case when MAP (and other point estimators) doesn\u2019t work well.", "Assume you\u2019re in a casino with full of slot machines with 50% winning probability. After playing for a while, you heard the rumour that there\u2019s one special slot machine with 67% winning probability. Now, you\u2019re observing people playing 2 suspicious slot machines (you\u2019re sure that one of those is the special slot machine!) and got the following data.", "Machine A: 3 wins out of 4 playsMachine B: 81 wins out of 121 plays", "By intuition, you would think machine B is the special one. Because 3 wins out of 4 plays on machine A could just happen by chance. But machine B\u2019s data doesn\u2019t look like happening by chance.", "But just in case, you decided to estimate those 2 machines\u2019 winning probabilities by MAP with hyperparameters \u03b1=\u03b2=2. (Assuming that the results (k wins out of n plays) follow binomial distribution with the slot machine\u2019s winning probability \u03b8 as its parameter.)", "The formula and results are below.", "Unlike your intuition, estimated winning probability \u03b8 by MAP for the 2 machines are exactly same. Hence, by MAP, you cannot determine which one is the special slot machine.", "But really? Isn\u2019t it looking obvious that Machine B is more likely to be the special one?", "To see if there really be no difference between machine A and machine B, let\u2019s fully calculate the posterior probability distribution, not only MAP estimates.", "In the case above, the posterior probability distribution P(\u03b8|D) is calculated as below. (Detailed computation will be covered in the next section.)", "And P(\u03b8|D) for machine A and machine B are drawn as below.", "Although both distributions have their mode on \u03b8=0.666\u2026 (that\u2019s why their MAP estimates are the same value), the shapes of the distributions are quite different. Density around the mode is much higher in the distribution of machine B than the one of machine A. This is why you want to calculate full distribution, not only the MAP estimate.", "As we skipped the computation of P(\u03b8|D) in the previous section, let\u2019s go through the detailed calculation process in this section.", "Both MAP and Bayesian inference are based on Bayes\u2019 theorem. The computational difference between Bayesian inference and MAP is that, in Bayesian inference, we need to calculate P(D) called marginal likelihood or evidence. It\u2019s the denominator of Bayes\u2019 theorem and it assures that the integrated value* of P(\u03b8|D) over all possible \u03b8 becomes 1. (* Sum of P(\u03b8|D), if \u03b8 is a discrete variable.)", "P(D) is obtained by marginalisation of joint probability. When \u03b8 is a continuous variable, the formula is as below.", "Considering the chain rule, we obtain the following formula.", "Now, put this into the original formula of the posterior probability distribution. Calculating below is the goal of Bayesian Inference.", "Let\u2019s calculate P(\u03b8|D) for the case above.", "Beginning with P(D|\u03b8) \u2014 Likelihood \u2014 which is the probability that data D is observed when parameter \u03b8 is given. In the case above, D is \u201c3 wins out of 4 matches\u201d, and parameter \u03b8 is the winning probability of machine A. As we assume that the number of wins follows binomial distribution, the formula is as below, where n is the number of matches and k is the number of wins.", "Then P(\u03b8) \u2014 the prior probability distribution of \u03b8 \u2014 which is the probability distribution expressing our prior knowledge about \u03b8. Here, specific probability distributions are used corresponding to the probability distribution of Likelihood P(D|\u03b8). It\u2019s called conjugate prior distribution.", "Since the conjugate prior of binomial distribution is Beta distribution, we use Beta distribution to express P(\u03b8) here. Beta distribution is described as below, where \u03b1 and \u03b2 are hyperparameters.", "Now we got P(D|\u03b8)P(\u03b8) \u2014 the numerator of the formula \u2014 as below.", "Then, P(D) \u2014 the denominator of the formula \u2014 is calculated as follows. Note that the possible range of \u03b8 is 0 \u2264 \u03b8 \u2264 1.", "With Euler integral of the first kind, the above formula can be deformed to below.", "Finally, we can obtain P(\u03b8|D) as below.", "As you may have noticed, the estimate by MAP is the mode of the posterior distribution. But we can also use other statistics for the point estimation, such as expected value of \u03b8|D. The estimation using the expected value of \u03b8|D is called Expected A Posteriori.", "Let\u2019s estimate the winning probability of the 2 machines using EAP. From the discussion above, P(\u03b8|D) in this case is below.", "Thus the estimate is described as below.", "With Euler integral of the first kind and the definition of Gamma function, above formula can be deformed to below.", "Hence, EAP estimate of 2 machines\u2019 winning probabilities with hyperparameters \u03b1=\u03b2=2 are below.", "As seen above, Bayesian inference provides much more information than point estimators like MLE and MAP. However, it also has a drawback \u2014 the complexity of its integral computation. The case in this article was quite simple and solved analytically, but it\u2019s not always the case in real-world applications. We then need to use MCMC or other algorithms as a substitute for the direct integral computation. Hope this article helped you to understand Bayesian inference.", "Your home for data science.
