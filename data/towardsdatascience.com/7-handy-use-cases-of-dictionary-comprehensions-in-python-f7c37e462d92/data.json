Essentially, comprehensions are a fancy form of writing for loops that are more concise and readable.", "All comprehensions can be rewritten using for loops but the vice-versa doesn\u2019t hold true. At large, there are four types of comprehension techniques in Python.", "The goal of this piece is to show you the power of dictionary comprehensions and how to leverage it in different ways. Before we explore a few interesting cases, let\u2019s understand the syntax as it can confuse a lot of developers when starting out.", "Consider the following code that creates a dictionary from a range of numbers with the value being the square of the key:", "Now let\u2019s analyze the syntax of the dictionary expression using the above code as a reference:", "The above syntax represents the minimal form of writing a dictionary comprehension. The output of the dictionary comprehension is highlighted in green. All the key-value pairs are assigned to the constructed dictionary.", "The iterable doesn\u2019t have to be a dictionary. It can be any python object on which you can loop over \u2014 list, tuple, strings, etc.", "Unlike list comprehensions, a dictionary comprehension can iterate over a group of keys and values simultaneously as well. By invoking the items() method on a dictionary, you can convert it into a list of tuples of key-value to loop over.", "You can also set a conditional statement after the for loop in dictionary comprehension as shown below:", "Now that we\u2019ve got a good look at the syntax of dictionary comprehensions, let's move onto its applications.", "Often a case comes up where you need to build a dictionary that holds the count of each word in a string. The classic way of doing this using for loops would be:", "But we can make it significantly shorter using dictionary comprehensions as shown below:", "With a large dictionary, there might come a point where you need to append a single character to all of them. It could be a simple $ symbol for instance.", "In another scenario, you might need to remove a character from a key or value string. Here\u2019s an example of how to create a new dictionary by modifying keys and values using dictionary comprehension:", "You probably might be interested in only a part of a dictionary that has a certain set of keys. Here\u2019s an example that filters and creates a new dictionary based on a list of keys:", "But the above code would throw an error when the list of keys contains an extraneous value not present in the dictionary. So, instead of iterating over keys , we\u2019ll look to find the common keys in d and keys using sets as shown below:", "Here\u2019s a third case, where we\u2019re filtering the dictionary by keys containing a specified string:", "In cases, where your dictionary has unique keys and values and would like to invert the mapping from k:v to v:k you could do it with a for loop in the following way:", "By using dictionary comprehension, we can do the same thing in a single line as:", "Next up, we have a tuple list where each element holds the country code and name. We\u2019ll create a dictionary out of it using comprehension technique with the country name being the key, and country-code being the value:", "Sparse vectors generally contain a lot of zero values. We can consider keeping only non-zero values in a dictionary we can save some space. By using the following dictionary comprehension technique, we can convert a sparse vector to key-value pairs with the key being the index from the sparse vector:", "There\u2019s another way of writing the above dictionary comprehension that\u2019s slightly more readable:", "if v indicates to add the key and value to the dictionary only if the sparse vector\u2019s element isn\u2019t False, 0, None, etc.", "There are different ways to sort a dictionary. We can do it with keys or values, in ascending or descending orders. Let\u2019s take a look.", "Here\u2019s an example to sort by keys in ascending and descending order:", "The below example shows how to sort by value in ascending and descending order:", "Let\u2019s say we have an unknown number of dictionaries present in a Python List as shown below:", "Now, we\u2019d like to flatten the list into a dictionary such that all the sub-dictionaries are merged into a single dictionary. We can use the following doubly nested dictionary comprehension technique:", "We saw a bunch of different use cases for applying dictionary comprehensions in Python. The idea is to use it efficiently and not overdo it. It\u2019s very easy to misuse it for fairly straightforward manipulations.", "That\u2019s it for this one \u2014 thanks for reading.", "Your home for data science.
