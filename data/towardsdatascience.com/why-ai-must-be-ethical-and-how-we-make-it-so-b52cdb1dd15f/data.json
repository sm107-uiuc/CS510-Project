The rain is pleasantly pouring outside. You\u2019re having an afternoon tea, while working on your next project on your laptop. Your workflow is interrupted by a phone call. It\u2019s Danielle from Subtling. You were there last Friday on a job interview that you\u2019re excited about. Filled with anticipation, you answer the phone. Danielle says she regretfully has to inform you that they\u2019ve moved on with other applicants \u2014 a nice way of saying you didn\u2019t get the job. \u201cWhy?\u201d, you ask, hoping to at least receive constructive feedback for what you can do better for your next job interview. \u201cOur systems determined that you weren\u2019t a good pick for this position\u201d, Danielle explains. \u201cWhy not?\u201d, you ask. \u201cI don\u2019t really know\u201d, Danielle answers. Subtling doesn\u2019t quite know how their AI-powered systems decides which candidates to deem good picks for positions. Their AI analyzes resumes and tests, compares experiences, conducts thorough automatic searches for candidates on search engines \u2014 in short, it examines hundreds of thousands of data points. Subtling has a rough idea of what the AI looks at, but can\u2019t quite say what the AI puts more weight on, or how it decides which experience is better than any other. You thank Danielle for her time, and hang up the phone. Your mind starts racing \u2014 why did their AI think you weren\u2019t suitable? You pause. Of course. This is nothing new. You experience this every day of your life. It\u2019s because of your ethnicity. Another year, another innovative way of discriminating, you think to yourself. You take another sip of your tea and get your mind back into your laptop.", "It\u2019s 2023. You just got back home from work. It\u2019s freezing outside, winter came early this year. You\u2019ve got some mail, mostly advertisements, but one envelope stands out to you. It\u2019s from Amazendor Go. You open it up and find an invoice for a modest amount of money inside. Odd, you think to yourself, you haven\u2019t purchased anything, yet a decent fifteen items are listed neatly one after another. True, you have an account at Amazendor, but you haven\u2019t been to their Go store in well over half a year. Amazendor\u2019s Go store chain uses facial recognition \u2014 customers simply walk in, pick whatever they want to buy, and on the way out they just look at a camera, and their money is drawn automatically from their bank account. Or, if the user prefers, they can pay by invoice. The camera must have mistaken someone else for you. Annoying, but it\u2019s only a modest sum and you don\u2019t want to waste time arguing, so you pay the bill and get on with your evening.", "It\u2019s 2024. You wake up early in the morning to a loud banging on the door. \u201cIt\u2019s the police, open up!\u201d, a voice shouts from the other side. The sleepy state you had found yourself in was brief, as you quickly move to a state of fear and uncertainty. Has something happened to you or someone you know? Or maybe something happened to one of your neighbors and the police want to know if you\u2019ve seen anything? Well, you didn\u2019t have to ponder for long, as you walk up to the door and open it. Three policemen enter. \u201cJonathan?\u201d. You nod. You\u2019re under arrest. Why? An AI-assisted security system saw you steal a vehicle, and upon actually seeing your face, the police agreed that you match the security camera footage. The AI says it\u2019s 93% certain that it was you. You\u2019re taken to a police station. You attempt to prove your innocence by explaining you weren\u2019t there, but an AI-powered lie detector believes you to be lying. Luckily, you were able to prove that you were elsewhere at the time of the robbery, using your Google Maps history, as well as a debit card purchase that occurred too far away from the scene of the theft for you to have been able to steal the vehicle. You are allowed to go back home. You can\u2019t sleep that night. You wonder what would have happened had you been unable to prove your innocence.", "All of the technologies described in the short stories above already exist. Their adoption rates in 2019 are quite limited, but will increase in the coming years.", "Mistakes can, have and will continue to happen.", "AI can falsely identify, incorrectly analyze, or misinterpret anyone and anything.", "Don\u2019t get me wrong, I strongly believe that AI is an incredibly useful technology, which will provide fantastic benefits. It can make our lives convenient, fast, and simple. It can discover cures for diseases, it can enable us to be creative, and it can make our lives more fun. But it must be regulated.", "If it cannot be explained, it cannot be trusted. AI must be transparent. Humans must always be able to know why an AI made a particular decision.", "Our future will undoubtedly consist of human-machine collaboration. Machines such as computers and smartphones have already greatly empowered humans, and AI will only increase in doing so. But humans must always be in control of the AI.", "An AI system will always be biased to some party, but it can be trained to be less so. An AI must be fair when making judgment calls. The data that is fed to AI must be varied and diversified.", "Make no mistake: a human being is always accountable for any action made by any piece of technology. The only question is who. The responsibilities must be made clear.", "Generally, machines are better than humans when it comes to making predictive, data-based decisions, and AI should be part of any corporate strategy. But that doesn\u2019t mean people should overrely on machines, especially not when the AI is dealing with humans.", "It must be said that AI is wonderful when properly implemented. It must also be said that AI is frightening when unregulated.", "AI trailblazers are working towards establishing AI ethics \u2014 to varying success. Some early attempts have failed, such as Google\u2019s attempt at establishing an AI ethics board earlier this year, which was dissolved after just a week. Instead, I argue that the future of establishing ethical AI lies in collaboration. For instance, the European Commission is inviting Europeans to discuss ethical AI. In my opinion, inviting a broad range of individuals and entities to establish ethical guidelines is the best approach to handling AI ethics. Hopefully, such initiatives will start to appear in greater scale in the near future.", "In order to ensure AI becomes \u2014 and stays \u2014 ethical, we must achieve diversified ethical boards through broad, inclusive discussions.", "Because someday soon, AI will decide whether you\u2019re a criminal.", "And all you can do is to hope the AI makes the right call.", "Your home for data science.
