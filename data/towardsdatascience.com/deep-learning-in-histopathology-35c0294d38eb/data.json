The different learning algorithms, viz a viz Deep Learning for histopathology, along with the tasks are visualized in the following overview.", "Based on these, a number of DL models have been proposed in the literature that are traditionally based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent neural networks (RNNs), generative adversarial networks (GANs), auto-encoders(AEs) and other variants.", "Among the supervised learning techniques, we identify three major canonical deep learning models based on the nature of tasks that are solved in digital histopathology: Classification, Regression, and Segmentation.", "It can be further subdivided into local and global level classification. Local level classification entails identifying cells or nuclei in patches of the whole slide image. Deep Learning has proven extensively successful in pixel-wise prediction by sliding window approach over image patches that are annotated by pathologists as regions containing objects of interest( cells/nuclei) or background.One of the most prominent works in local classification came in 2019 when Qaiser et al\u00b9 in their paper used Persistent Homology Profiles as distinguishing features in order to segment colon tumor regions by classifying patches as tumor regions or normal ones. Persistent Homology profiles are compact mathematical feature representations of a region that are distinctive as well as robust to scale, perturbations in input data, dimension, and coordinates.They used PHP of training dataset in combination with features extracted using CNN and then employed Random Forest regressions on them separately followed by a multi-stage ensemble strategy for the final classification. This hybrid approach proved to be both accurate and highly efficient wrt inference speed.In global level classification, most of the published work focusses on a patch-based classification approach for whole-slide level disease prediction task. It can involve both patch level localization as well as whole slide level classification or grading of disease. The main disadvantage of these methods is the relatively long computational time required to carry out a dense patch-wise prediction over an entire WSI. Different works have approached this problem in different ways, some using heuristic sampling strategies to more recent ones using task-driven visual attention based coarse processing.", "Xu et al\u00b2 in their work adaptively select a sequence of coarse regions from the raw image by a hard visual attention algorithm, and then for each such region, it is able to investigate the abnormal parts based on a soft-attention mechanism. A recurrent network is then built on top to classify the image region and also to predict the location of the image region to be investigated at the next time step. This way, only a fraction of pixels need to be investigated for the classification", "Advantages of using visual attention-based models for Whole Slide Image global classification task are:", "Another recent work for global classification by Halicek, Martin, et al.\u00b3 perform patch-based localization and whole slide classification for Squamous Cell Carcinoma(SCC) and Thyroid Cell Carcinoma using CNN using an entirely different approach. A ground-truth binary mask of the cancer area was produced from each outlined histology slide. The WSIs and corresponding ground-truths were down-sampled by a factor of four using nearest-neighbor interpolation. The downsampled slides were then broken into patches of 101 x 101 size. To ensure generalization the number of image patches was augmented by 8x by applying 90-degree rotations and reflections to develop a more robust diagnostic method. Additionally, to establish a level of color-feature invariance and tolerance to differences in H&E staining between slides, the hue, saturation, brightness, and contrast of each patch were randomly manipulated to make a more rigorous training paradigm before being fed to the Inception-v4 model for detecting head and neck cancer.", "In this method, we focus on directly regressing the likelihood of pixel being the center of an object for detection or localization of objects. Regression, unlike classification, gives us a continuous value, usually probability score instead of simply a class label as output. Regression helps in better detection by enforcing topological constraints such as assigning higher probability values to pixels near the object center.Regression also helps with challenges faced in cell/nuclei detection arising due to highly irregular appearance and them occurring as overlapping clumps resulting in problems separating them. Deep regression models proposed in the literature are mainly based on either CNN or Fully Convolutional Network(FCN) architectures.", "The paper by Graham et al\u2074 on HoVer-Net is one of the most seminal works in the entire area of research. It proposes a unified FCN model for simultaneous nuclear instance segmentation and classification. It leverages the instance-rich information encoded within the vertical and horizontal distances of nuclear pixels to their centers of mass. These distances are then utilized to separate clustered nuclei, resulting in an accurate segmentation, particularly in areas with overlapping instances.Then, for each segmented instance, the network predicts the type of nucleus via a devoted up-sampling branch. The network is composed of three parallel branches that are used for three different tasks. We have corresponding ground truth annotations of the data for each of the three branches.", "In particular, the NP and HoVer branches jointly achieve nuclear instance segmentation by first separating nuclear pixels from the background (NP branch) and then separating touching nuclei (HoVer branch). This is the same model that was used for the localization and clustering of tissues step for modeling Whole Slide Images as graphs for subsequent learning using Graph Neural Networks, as discussed in the previous post.", "In the next and final part of our discussion on Deep Learning in Histopathology, we shall be discussing Supervised Segmentation, Weakly Supervised and Unsupervised Learning methodologies in the context of Digital Histopathology, with appropriate application and relevant literature.", "PS: I have linked technically important terms to respective resources explaining them.", "Your home for data science.
