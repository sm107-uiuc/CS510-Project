The media makes it sound like magic. Reading this article will change that. It will give you an overview of the most common types of problems machine learning can be used for. And at the same time give you a framework to approach your future machine learning proof of concept projects.", "First, we\u2019ll clear up some definitions.", "How is machine learning, artificial intelligence and data science different?", "These three topics can be hard to understand because there are no formal definitions. Even after being a machine learning engineer for over a year, I don\u2019t have a good answer to this question. I\u2019d be suspicious of anyone who claims they do.", "To avoid confusion, we\u2019ll keep it simple. For this article, you can consider machine learning the process of finding patterns in data to understand something more or to predict some kind of future event.", "The following steps have a bias towards building something and seeing how it works. Learning by doing.", "A machine learning pipeline can be broken down into three major steps. Data collection, data modelling and deployment. All influence one another.", "You may start a project by collecting data, model it, realise the data you collected was poor, go back to collecting data, model it again, find a good model, deploy it, find it doesn\u2019t work, make another model, deploy it, find it doesn\u2019t work again, go back to data collection. It\u2019s a cycle.", "Wait, what does model mean? What\u2019s does deploy mean? How do I collect data?", "How you collect data will depend on your problem. We will look at examples in a minute. But one way could be your customer purchases in a spreadsheet.", "Modelling refers to using a machine learning algorithm to find insights within your collected data.", "What\u2019s the difference between a normal algorithm and a machine learning algorithm?", "Like a cooking recipe for your favourite chicken dish, a normal algorithm is a set of instructions on how to turn a set of ingredients into that honey mustard masterpiece.", "What makes a machine learning algorithm different is instead of having the set of instructions, you start with the ingredients and the final dish ready to go. The machine learning algorithm then looks at the ingredients and the final dish and works out the set of instructions.", "There are many different types of machine learning algorithms and some perform better than others on different problems. But the premise remains, they all have the goal of finding patterns or sets of instructions in data.", "Deployment is taking your set of instructions and using it in an application. This application could be anything from recommending products to customers on your online store to a hospital trying to better predict disease presence.", "The specifics of these steps will be different for each project. But the principles within each remain similar.", "This article focuses on data modelling. It assumes you have already collected data, and are looking to build a machine learning proof of concept with it. Let\u2019s break down how you might approach it.", "Let\u2019s dive a little deeper in each.", "To help decide whether or not your business could use machine learning, the first step is to match the business problem you\u2019re trying to solve a machine learning problem.", "The four major types of machine learning are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, transfer learning and reinforcement learning (there\u2019s semi-supervised as well but I\u2019ve left it out for brevity). The three most used in business applications are supervised learning, unsupervised learning and transfer learning.", "Supervised learning, is called supervised because you have data and labels. A machine learning algorithm tries to learn what patterns in the data lead to the labels. The supervised part happens during training. If the algorithm guesses a wrong label, it tries to correct itself.", "For example, if you were trying to predict heart disease in a new patient. You may have the anonymised medical records of 100 patients as the data and whether or not they had heart disease as the label.", "A machine learning algorithm could look at the medical records (inputs) and whether or not a patient had heart disease (outputs) and then figure out what patterns in the medical records lead to heart disease.", "Once you\u2019ve got a trained algorithm, you could pass through the medical records (input) of a new patient through it and get a prediction of whether or not they have heart disease (output). It\u2019s important to remember this prediction isn\u2019t certain. It comes back as a probability.", "The algorithm says, \u201cbased on what I\u2019ve seen before, it looks like this new patients medical records are 70% aligned to those who have heart disease.\u201d", "Unsupervised learning is when you have data but no labels. The data could be the purchase history of your online video game store customers. Using this data, you may want to group similar customers together so you can offer them specialised deals. You could use a machine learning algorithm to group your customers by purchase history.", "After inspecting the groups, you provide the labels. There may be a group interested in computer games, another group who prefer console games and another which only buy discounted older games. This is called clustering.", "What\u2019s important to remember here is the algorithm did not provide these labels. It found the patterns between similar customers and using your domain knowledge, you provided the labels.", "Transfer learning is when you take the information an existing machine learning model has learned and adjust it to your own problem.", "Training a machine learning model from scratch can be expensive and time-consuming. The good news is, you don\u2019t always have to. When machine learning algorithms find patterns in one kind of data, these patterns can be used in another type of data.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re a car insurance company and wanted to build a text classification model to classify whether or not someone submitting an insurance claim for a car accident is at fault (caused the accident) or not at fault (didn\u2019t cause the accident).", "You could start with an existing text model, one which has read all of Wikipedia and has remembered all the patterns between different words, such as, which word is more likely to come next after another. Then using your car insurance claims (data) along with their outcomes (labels), you could tweak the existing text model to your own problem.", "If machine learning can be used in your business, it\u2019s likely it\u2019ll fall under one of these three types of learning.", "But let\u2019s break them down further into classification, regression and recommendation.", "Now you know these things, your next step is to define your business problem in machine learning terms.", "Let\u2019s use the car insurance example from before. You receive thousands of claims per day which your staff read and decide whether or not the person sending in the claim is at fault or not.", "But now the number of claims are starting to come in faster than your staff can handle them. You\u2019ve got thousands of examples of past claims which are labelled at fault or not at fault.", "You already know the answer. But let\u2019s see. Does this problem fit into any of the three above? Classification, regression or recommendation?", "We\u2019re a car insurance company who want to classify incoming car insurance claims into at fault or not at fault.", "It turns out, this could potentially be a machine learning classification problem. I say potentially because there\u2019s a chance it might not work.", "When it comes to defining your business problem as a machine learning problem, start simple, more than one sentence is too much. Add complexity when required.", "The data you have or need to collect will depend on the problem you want to solve.", "If you already have data, it\u2019s likely it will be in one of two forms. Structured or unstructured. Within each of these, you have static or streaming data.", "Your static structured table of information may have columns which contain natural language text and photos and be updated constantly.", "For predicting heart disease, one column may be sex, another average heart rate, another average blood pressure, another chest pain intensity.", "For the insurance claim example, one column may be the text a customer has sent in for the claim, another may be the image they\u2019ve sent in along with the text and a final a column being the outcome of the claim. This table gets updated with new claims or altered results of old claims daily.", "The principle remains. You want to use the data you have to gains insights or predict something.", "For supervised learning, this involves using the feature variable(s) to predict the target variable(s). A feature variable for predicting heart disease could be sex with the target variable being whether or not the patient has heart disease.", "For unsupervised learning, you won\u2019t have labels. But you\u2019ll still want to find patterns. Meaning, grouping together similar samples and finding samples which are outliers.", "For transfer learning, your problem stays a supervised learning problem, except you\u2019re leveraging the patterns machine learning algorithms have learned from other data sources separate from your own.", "Remember, if you\u2019re using a customers data to improve your business or to offer them a better service, it\u2019s important to let them know. This is why you see \u201cthis site uses cookies\u201d popups everywhere. The website uses how you browse the site, likely along with some kind of machine learning to improve their offering.", "You\u2019ve defined your business problem in machine learning terms and you have data. Now define what defines success.", "There are different evaluation metrics for classification, regression and recommendation problems. Which one you choose will depend on your goal.", "For this project to be successful, the model needs to be over 95% accurate at whether someone is at fault or not at fault.", "A 95% accurate model may sound pretty good for predicting who\u2019s at fault in an insurance claim. But for predicting heart disease, you\u2019ll likely want better results.", "Other things you should take into consideration for classification problems.", "For regression problems (where you want to predict a number), you\u2019ll want to minimise the difference between what your model predicts and what the actual value is. If you\u2019re trying to predict the price a house will sell for, you\u2019ll want your model to get as close as possible to the actual price. To do this, use MAE or RMSE.", "Recommendation problems are harder to test in experimentation. One way to do so is to take a portion of your data and hide it away. When your model is built, use it to predict recommendations for the hidden data and see how it lines up.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re trying to recommend customers products on your online store. You have historical purchase data from 2010\u20132019. You could build a model on the 2010\u20132018 data and then use it to predict 2019 purchases. Then it becomes a classification problem because you\u2019re trying to classify whether or not someone is likely to buy an item.", "However, traditional classification metrics aren\u2019t the best for recommendation problems. Precision and recall have no concept of ordering.", "If your machine learning model returned back a list of 10 recommendations to be displayed to a customer on your website, you\u2019d want the best ones to be displayed first right?", "To begin with, you may not have an exact figure for each of these. But knowing what metrics you should be paying attention to gives you an idea of how to evaluate your machine learning project.", "Not all data is the same. And when you hear someone referring to features, they\u2019re referring to different kinds of data within data.", "The three main types of features are categorical, continuous (or numerical) and derived.", "Text, images and almost anything you can imagine can also be a feature. Regardless, they all get turned into numbers before a machine learning algorithm can model them.", "Some important things to remember when it comes to features.", "You can use features to create a simple baseline metric. A subject matter expert on customer churn may know someone is 80% likely to cancel their membership after 3 weeks of not logging in.", "Or a real estate agent who knows the sale prices of houses might know houses with over 5 bedrooms and 4 bathrooms sell for over $500,000.", "These are simplified and don\u2019t have to be exact. But it\u2019s what you\u2019re going to use to see whether machine learning can improve upon or not.", "Once you\u2019ve defined your problem, prepared your data, evaluation criteria and features it\u2019s time to model.", "Modelling breaks into three parts, choosing a model, improving a model, comparing it with others.", "When choosing a model, you\u2019ll want to take into consideration, interpretability and ease to debug, amount of data, training and prediction limitations.", "To address these, start simple. A state of the art model can be tempting to reach for. But if it requires 10x the compute resources to train and prediction times are 5x longer for a 2% boost in your evaluation metric, it might not be the best choice.", "Linear models such as logistic regression are usually easier to interpret, are very fast for training and predict faster than deeper models such as neural networks.", "But it\u2019s likely your data is from the real world. Data from the real world isn\u2019t always linear.", "Ensembles of decision trees and gradient boosted algorithms (fancy words, definitions not important for now) usually work best on structured data, like Excel tables and dataframes. Look into random forests, XGBoost and CatBoost.", "Deep models such as neural networks generally work best on unstructured data like images, audio files and natural language text. However, the trade-off is they usually take longer to train, are harder to debug and prediction time takes longer. But this doesn\u2019t mean you shouldn\u2019t use them.", "Transfer learning is an approach which takes advantage of deep models and linear models. It involves taking a pre-trained deep model and using the patterns it has learned as the inputs to your linear model. This saves dramatically on training time and allows you to experiment faster.", "Where do I find pre-trained models?", "Pre-trained models are available on PyTorch hub, TensorFlow hub, model zoo and within the fast.ai framework. This is a good place to look first for building any kind of proof of concept.", "What about the other kinds of models?", "For building a proof of concept, it\u2019s unlikely you\u2019ll have to ever build your own machine learning model. People have already written code for these.", "What you\u2019ll be focused on is preparing your inputs and outputs in a way they can be used with an existing model. This means having your data and labels strictly defined and understanding what problem you\u2019re trying to solve.", "A model's first results isn\u2019t its last. Like tuning a car, machine learning models can be tuned to improve performance.", "Tuning a model involves changing hyperparameters such as learning rate or optimizer. Or model-specific architecture factors such as number of trees for random forests and number of and type of layers for neural networks.", "These used to be something a practitioner would have to tune by hand but are increasingly becoming automated. And should be wherever possible.", "Using a pre-trained model through transfer learning often has the added benefit of all of these steps been done.", "The priority for tuning and improving models should be reproducibility and efficiency. Someone should be able to reproduce the steps you\u2019ve taken to improve performance. And because your main bottleneck will be model training time, not new ideas to improve, your efforts should be dedicated towards efficiency.", "Where model 1 and 2 can vary but not data X or data Y.", "This step involves all the other steps. Because machine learning is a highly iterative process, you\u2019ll want to make sure your experiments are actionable.", "Your biggest goal should be minimising the time between offline experiments and online experiments.", "Offline experiments are steps you take when your project isn\u2019t customer-facing yet. Online experiments happen when your machine learning model is in production.", "All experiments should be conducted on different portions of your data.", "These amounts can fluctuate slightly, depending on your problem and the data you have.", "Poor performance on training data means the model hasn\u2019t learned properly. Try a different model, improve the existing one, collect more data, collect better data.", "Poor performance on test data means your model doesn\u2019t generalise well. Your model may be overfitting the training data. Use a simpler model or collect more data.", "Poor performance once deployed (in the real world) means there\u2019s a difference in what you trained and tested your model on and what is actually happening. Revisit step 1 & 2. Ensure your data matches up with the problem you\u2019re trying to solve.", "When you implement a large experimental change, document what and why. Remember, like model tuning, someone, including your future self, should be able to reproduce what you\u2019ve done.", "This means saving updated models and updated datasets regularly.", "Many businesses have heard of machine learning but aren\u2019t sure where to start. One of the best places to start is to use the six steps above to build a proof of concept.", "A proof of concept should not be seen as something to fundamentally change how your business operates but as an exploration into whether machine learning can bring your business value.", "After all, you\u2019re not after fancy solutions to keep up with the hype. You\u2019re after solutions which add value.", "Put a timeline on a proof of concept, 2, 6 and 12 weeks are good amounts. With good data, a good machine learning and data science practitioner can get 80\u201390% of the final modelling results in a relatively small timeframe.", "Have your subject matter experts and machine learning engineers and data scientists work together. There is nothing worse than a machine learning engineer building a great model which models the wrong thing.", "If a web designer could improve the layout of an online store to help a machine learning experiment, they should know.", "Remember, due to the nature of proof of concepts, it may turn out machine learning isn\u2019t something your business can take advantage of (unlikely). As a project manager, ensure you\u2019re aware of this. If you are a machine learning engineer or data scientist, be willing to accept your conclusions lead nowhere.", "The value in something not working is now you know what doesn\u2019t work and can direct your efforts elsewhere. This is why setting a timeframe for experiments is helpful. There is never enough time but deadlines work wonders.", "If a machine learning proof of concept turns out well, take another step, if not, step back. Learning by doing is a faster process than thinking about something.", "Each of these steps could deserve an article on their own. I\u2019ll work on it.", "In the meantime, there are some things to note.", "It\u2019s always about the data. Without good data to begin with, no machine learning model will help you. If you want to use machine learning in your business, it starts with good data collection.", "Deployment changes everything. A good model offline doesn\u2019t always mean a good model online. This article has focused on data modelling. Once you deploy a model, there\u2019s infrastructure management, data verification, model retraining, analysis and more. Any cloud provider has services for these but putting them together is still a bit of a dark art. Pay your data engineers well. If you\u2019re data engineer, share what you know.", "Data collection and model deployment are the longest parts of a machine learning pipeline. This article has only focused on modelling. And even then, it misses specifics on how to get your data ready to be modelled.", "Tools of the trade vary. Machine learning is big tool comprised of many other tools. From code libraries and frameworks to different deployment architectures. There\u2019s usually several different ways to do the same thing. Best practice is continually being changed. This article focuses on things which don\u2019t.", "This article is based on Facebook\u2019s Field Guide for Machine Learning, remixed with some of my own experience.", "Building nutrify.app, teaching
