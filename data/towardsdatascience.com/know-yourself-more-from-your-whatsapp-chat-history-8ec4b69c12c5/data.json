It\u2019s been a week and being all day at home bores me, so I randomly thought maybe it\u2019s the right time to do self-introspection. Luckily, I remembered that I exported my WhatsApp chat not long ago. So I jumped into it and decided to do quick data exploration, to know more about myself and my interlocutor. Let the data speak.", "WhatsApp exported chat is formatted as .txt. Every line of the message consists of <timestamp> \u2014 <sender> : <message>. In some cases where the messages has multiple lines, the 2nd and following lines will be represented with only <message> without <timestamp> \u2014 <sender> . See example below for the structure.", "Converting the data into a DataFrame allows me to do much more. The beauty of this task is it need pattern matching to separate the timestamp, sender, and the message. Regex will make the job done a lot easier. I combine Python\u2019s re module with its f-string string formatting and find out it\u2019s a great combination, especially on a more complex pattern. Here\u2019s my code to convert the .txt file into a dataframe.", "Is it enough? No. There\u2019s a lot more information we could retrieve to help future analysis. Thus, I did more feature engineering in the code below and return the following dataframe.", "Now that the data is ready, let\u2019s start by answering several questions", "Knowing chat behavior is a must. I think looking into the time when conversations happen the most will describe it quite well. So, in hour frequency, I took an average of:", "In case you\u2019re confused with seq and seq_line, assume there\u2019s a conversation between A and B", "From the chart above, I know at least:", "I could say that by average, I begin actively chatting on 6 pm, and reaches its peak on 10\u201311 pm everyday, and stop chatting until 6 am.", "I wantto know, who took longer to reply to a text. It\u2019s quite important to know who\u2019s responsive and who\u2019s not. I don\u2019t want to be generally judged by \u201cyou reply late\u201d without any evidence. So, again, this is the moment of truth.", "I do the average of all text from party-A ant party-B. I took the differences between party A\u2019s last chat to party B\u2019s first reply (vice versa), do some data wrangling and have the result in the following:", "It looks like party A and B are similar. They took ~10 minutes to reply to a message. However, on party B\u2019s side, the variance is higher, meaning there\u2019s a greater chance that party B takes longer to reply. I think I know who party B is *sigh.", "Similar to the previous problem, but now I want to see when is exactly the fastest response occurs. Looking by the mean, on working day (Mon-Fri) party A and have the fastest response at 1 am while party B at 11 pm. On weekend, party A is fastest at 0 am while party B is still at 11 pm.", "You can see several different peaks for Party A and B, but what I wanted to highlight is this fact supports my previous statement saying that the conversation is more intense at late night.", "I\u2019ve shown you who\u2019s faster at giving a reply. But what if the party taking longer to reply uses more words? I took a brief summary of lines, words, and characters used in every party\u2019s text. Please note that a text or reply could consist of multiple lines.", "If we see carefully, in terms of the number of lines, party B replies with more line that party A. This might lead to a conclusion that Party A tends to sum up the reply in a whole line, while party B tends to send it in different lines.", "The number of words and characters that party B sends on each reply is relatively lower than party A, meaning party A writes longer than party B. This is also supported by the duration variable, where party A has more duration in writing a reply than party B. So, party A writes longer than party B.", "In the previous question, we know that party B takes a longer time to respond. I assume that\u2019s because party B writes longer than A. In fact, A writes longer. And B even writes faster than A. So there\u2019s no excuse for B haha.", "One of the most popular ways to inspect word data is by visualizing its word frequency using a word cloud.", "I remove several stopwords to remove the meaningless frequent word. Since I use Bahasa Indonesia on my chat, I use Elang to remove Indonesian stopwords. Now, using word cloud, take a look at these words", "That\u2019s a lot of \u201chaha\u201d and \u201cwkwk\u201d, Indonesian-considered laughing word. Using regex, I remove the laughing words and here\u2019s the final word cloud.", "I\u2019m sorry if you don\u2019t understand the words, It\u2019s Indonesian, and it\u2019s mostly non-formal words (who use formal words in chat anyway).", "Previously I discovered that the laughing words take up a lot of my word cloud space. Are we that frequent in laughing (via text)? To find out, I extract all laughing words and compare its number with the number of lines to get the probability.", "21.7% probability of having a laughing word in one line? That\u2019s hilarious. I don\u2019t expect that much. But it is what it is. Maybe I\u2019m a funny person in-text. Am I?", "We have an intense conversation late at night, probably talking about each other experiences. We laugh a lot. Party A writes a lot but took longer to write, while Party B writes shorter, but took longer to respond.", "There are many applications to be done with the data. In future work, I would like to do sentiment analysis for the chat, See if I could use the data to forecast the number of conversations, and do clustering using more than one conversation (multiple people)", "If there anything you think I missed in this post, please leave a comment below.
