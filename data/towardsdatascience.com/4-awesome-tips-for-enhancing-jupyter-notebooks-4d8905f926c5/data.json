They provide an easy way to share Notebooks \u2014 a combination of text, code, and graphics designed to enhance the way we convey information to our audience. They\u2019re extensively used in fields such as Data Analysis and Data Science.", "Yet, most of us are really only scratching the surface of Jupyter Notebooks. We use the basic features of writing Python code and displaying graphs. But did you know that there\u2019s a lot of customizable features in Jupyter that can enhance its functionality?! Cool options that can make your notebook writing more efficient and presentation more effective.", "Here are 4 awesome tips for enhancing Jupyter Notebooks!", "A shell in technical / programming context is a way of interacting textually (using text) with a computer. The most popular Unix shell is Bash (Bourne Again SHell ). Bash is the default shell that you\u2019ll find with your terminal on any Linux machine.", "It\u2019s quite common that when working with Python, you\u2019ll be switching back and forth between writing the Python code and using the shell. For example, you might want to read a certain file from disk using Python and as such need to check what the exact name is. You\u2019d normally just go to your terminal and type in ls to get a list of all files and folders in the current directory. That back and forth can be quite tedious and inefficient", "The really cool thing is that Jupyter has the ability to execute shell commands without you ever having to leave your browser. All you have to do is place an extra exclamation mark !before the shell command and Jupyter will interpret it as Bash. Any command that works at the command-line can be used in a Python Jupyter Notebook by prefixing it with the ! character.", "We can also assign the outputs of shell commands to Python variables as in the code below.", "Many text editors and programming IDEs have customizable themes. A favorite one amoung develops are the darker themes such as monaki, since it\u2019s more comfortable for the eyes when you\u2019re looking at a screen all day. Fortunately, Jupyter has a plugin that allows for theme selection.", "To install the plugin simply run the pip command in your terminal:", "You can list the available themes like so:", "As of the writing of this article, the following themes are available:", "Check out a few of them shown below. Lots of great colour options!", "Jupyter Notebook extensions \u2014 nbextensions are JavaScript modules that you can use to enhance the features and usage of the Notebook. The extensions essentially modify the Jupyter UI for a more robust functionality.", "We\u2019ll start by installing nbextensions via pip:", "Once the installation is complete, start up Jupyter. You\u2019ll see a new tab called NBextensions. Once you select it, you\u2019ll see the many Jupyter Notebook extension options!", "You can look up most of these extensions to see what they do with a quick Google search. I\u2019ve highlighted some of the most useful ones below.", "The table of contents, as its name describes, automatically generates a table of contents for your notebook based on the titles created by the hashtags # in the notebook. For example, the titles I created in the example image below are:", "And the table of contents is generated quite nicely on the left. Each title in the table has a link that will take you right to that section on a double click. This is super convenient when your notebook starts to get big and you have many sections!", "Code completion is a very common feature in most IDEs, especially PyCharm for Python. Developers love it because it makes their job so much easier, not having to remember each and every command since they know their IDE will clean things up for them.", "Hinterland enables code autocompletion within Jupyter Notebooks. as you type, the suggestions are laid out before you. This is most notable when you\u2019re searching for a command from an external library as shown in the examples below. Super convenient!", "Split cells allows you to view 2 cells side-by-side. This is super convenient when you have 2 cells that are related, such as a description and the visualisation it refers to.", "Our final stop is Qgrid \u2014 a tool that allows you to explore and edit your dataframes without any complex Pandas code.", "Qgrid renders pandas dataframes within your Jupyter notebooks in an interactive way. With this rendering, you\u2019re given intuitive controls like scrolling, sorting and filtering, as well as being able to edit your dataframe by double-clicking the desired cell.", "Let\u2019s get started by installing Qgrid:", "To render a dataframe with Qgrid, simply import it and then pass your dataframe to the show_grid function like so:", "Doing so will show the dataframe with a number of interactive options:", "There are also several more interactive options which can be enabled by passing more of the arguments to the show_gridfunction. You can read more details about the full functionality of Qgrid on the official GitHub page.", "So there you have it! 4 Awesome Tips for Enhancing Jupyter Notebooks.", "If you\u2019re hungry for more, not to worry! There are many more Jupyter widgets and extensions available to play around with. As recommended reading, the official Jupyter Notebook Documentation is a great place to start.", "Follow me on twitter, where I post all about the latest and greatest AI, Technology, and Science!
