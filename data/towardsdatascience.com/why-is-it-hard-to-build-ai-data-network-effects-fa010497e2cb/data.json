It\u2019s hard to think of a business that isn\u2019t facing the pressing need to digitize its operating model and respond to the new threats by better leveraging their data...", "I wanted to write this article to highlight how difficult it is to reach this level of data & AI maturity and what needs to be accomplished for a company willing to build one.", "Indeed, it has become a priority for large firms to modernize their business model and build proprietary data sets. While tech firms are investing a lot on AI toolkits to attract cloud computing customers, data sets are becoming a strategic element to differentiate.", "A Data Network Effect is a property of a product that improves with the more data it has available, due to emergent relationships between segments of the data.", "Data network effects make the company defensible because competitors have a hard time adding as much value to users once you get ahead, and defensibility creates value. Moreover, switching costs become higher when data network effects deliver results. It tends to create customer lock-in effect.", "Network effects and data network effects are often linked and strengthen each other, as each makes the product more valuable in a way that attracts more customers and data.", "A truly relevant data advantage doesn\u2019t come from just gathering the largest volume of data. The best data strategies are strongly related to a particular problem domain, in which unique, new, data compounds in value as it solves problems for customers.", "I worked a lot within the IoT department and I can assure you that data network effects are particularly relevant to the long term defensibility. Indeed, we realized that hardware is often more or less copied. However, IoT companies have an opportunity to build insights from each customer and that will be increasingly hard to replicate. Ultimately, the real value gets built at the software and data level.", "All data strategies must be linked to a more holistic product, technology, or business story.", "Before getting into data network effects, it is key to introduce the concept of data moat.", "A Data Moat describes a competitive advantage a business holds because of its proprietary data set.", "To put it simply, it is an extension of more traditional \u201cmoats\u201d such as vendor lock-in, branding, efficiencies of scale, etc. Ideally, a data moat protects an earned market position from the competition. We usually consider a strong data moat, a data set that is:", "- Large- Unable to be synthesized or statistically replicated- Difficult to acquire for other companies.", "In my opinion, the first issue to appear is often the lack of real data culture and unrealistic goals. I believe that in the absence of a data-centric culture that prioritizes the effective use of data, no relevant data network effects can exist.", "Without the right culture, data is useless.", "Moreover, it is important to know that it often takes a while for AI-driven operating models to generate economic value similar to the value that more traditional operating models generate at scale. Based on my experience, data network effects produce little value before they reach critical mass, and most newly applied algorithms suffer from a \u201ccold start\u201d before acquiring adequate data.", "Furthermore, if data is only marginal to your product, the data network effects won\u2019t matter much. According to the great article from James Currier, when Netflix recommends a show to you, the algorithm is basing that recommendation on user viewing data. But Netflix\u2019s discovery function is marginal; its real value comes from the inventory of tv shows, movies and documentaries. So Netflix only has a marginal Data Network Effect.", "Likewise, the relationship between product usage and the amount of useful new data gathered can be asymmetrical. Yelp has a Data Network Effect because a greater number of reviews for a greater number of restaurants makes the product more valuable. But its network effect is weakened by the fact that only a small percentage of users produce the data; most people read from the Yelp database but don\u2019t write to it.", "If a product has no relationship between increased usage and more useful data production, then there is no network effect.", "When building data network effects, companies tend to rely too much on their proprietary data. Actually, the goal should be to improve your models with additional data sources. In general, the broader data sources you have, the more accurately you can model your environment and make accurate predictions.", "Depending on your domain, a good data strategy should include data related to the world surrounding your products or services (weather, etc.), and also data on how users are interacting with your products, especially related to what you may have modeled as expected behavior.", "It might sound obvious but when you collect data and apply it to your product, you are making predictions about users\u2019 expectations. In that sense, the system is constantly trying to predict what users want and suggest or customize as needed. As such, the only way you can increase value, is knowing whether previous predictions were correct or not.", "Needless to say that if you fail this part, you will not benefit from data network effects. We always spend time making sure we have well-defined metrics. For instance, if you are trying to improve your recommender system through data network effects (by modifying data and models), it is key to be able to measure and assess the positive or negative impact of new data.", "Another interesting element to bear in mind is that after the dataset reaches a certain size, the algorithm no longer meaningfully improves as the dataset grows. The reality is that most data network effects struggle with this.", "Moreover, the point beyond which the data network effects diminishes varies by domain. Instead of getting stronger, the defensible moat erodes as the data lake grows and competitors close the gap.", "As you gather data, the data also tends to become less valuable.", "Data will yield less value given some of the new data you acquire already overlaps with your existing data. Benefits of new data go down.", "At some point value of new data goes down, either to users directly or to product/model development (According to this study, sometimes, better effects come from increasing complexity of a model rather than from pouring more data).", "In our latest project, new data early on applied to our entire customer base. However, a few months later, the new data collected only applied to the small subsets related to special use cases.", "Any data scale effect moats also become less valuable as the data set gets expanded.", "Furthermore, the amount of work required to keep an existing data advantage over time increases with scale. The cost structure can become an issue\u2026Moreover, synthetic data can help companies reduce the gap. The wider availability of data and the growing popularity of tools to process it makes the data collection network effect less appealing, as it takes less time to disrupt the first-mover advantage.", "From an operational perspective, data network effects require at least some level of automated productization of the insights. The more automation you add into the loop, the more efficient the virtuous circle of AI becomes.", "Furthermore, the narrower the scope of a product and the greater the degree to which machine learning drives its value, the easier it is to tie these advantages together to create a competitive advantage through data network effects.", "The data gathered from new users must be of the right kind and of sufficient volume to enable data network effects. This learning must be optimized effectively enough to create new product value. And this value must be strong enough and productized well enough to attract more customers. Any break in this chain means there is no self-reinforcing cycle and hence no learning effects.", "Actually, I recommend companies to build data network effects and combine them with investments in Marketing and customer retention to create a moat around their business model.", "Data network effects tend to work better when the learning curves of your products are long and steep enough to enable you to provide increasing product value for an extended period.", "Indeed, products built on highly dynamic datasets are more prone to have perpetual learning curves. As a consequence, they can always be meaningfully improved through data. These kinds of products are the most suited for companies seeking to benefit from data network effects.", "In some cases, when scaling and as the network grows, the new data that is contributed by each new interaction becomes ever more redundant with the data that has already been collected so far.", "Moreover, when dealing with the physical world, you\u2019ll certainly gather biases that often accumulate and ultimately begin to have a real impact on your models\u2019 performance.", "Even when data is being used for a Machine Learning project, the size of the data set is only one part of the story. The value of a data set, the strength of a data moat, comes from context.", "Indeed, some business issues require models to be trained to a high degree of accuracy before they can provide any value to a customer or even being approved by the management, while others need little. Furthermore, some data sets are truely proprietary, others can be easily duplicated. Some data decays in value over time, while other data sets do not. The application determines the value of the data and the strength of your data network effects.", "The reality is that, depending on your project, data network effects might be impossible to achieve. Some business issues are too complex to fully model given the current state of the art; in that case, volume of data will not help. Adding data might improve the model\u2019s performance, but quickly hit diminishing marginal returns.", "Another interesting element is model stability. Depending on the context, your dataset relevancy can change over time, and if the model doesn\u2019t change with it, the model will decay.", "Model Decay (also Model Failure) is an informal characterization of pathologies of models already deployed (in operation), whereby the model performance may deteriorate to the point of the model not being any longer fit for purpose. In other words, the model\u2019s predictions will no longer be reliable.", "Keeping the model stable requires processing new relevant training data at the same rate that the environment changes. We call this rate of data acquisition the stability threshold.", "Perishable data doesn\u2019t make for a very good data moat. On the other hand, easy access to fresh data can be a strategic barrier to entry.", "From a strategic point of view, Business applications that require less data to reach high accuracy and less data to maintain that performance are not very defensible. Indeed, new entrants can easily amass enough data and match or your solution.", "Building a solid data strategy is very complex and goes beyond just collecting data. I believe the most important question is to determine how will data contribute to a given product. In reality, choice of algorithms or other product-feature tuning has a far greater impact than having more data alone.", "A data moat requires two essential things", "In my opinion, a winning strategy is one that seeks the creation of data network effects as well as a solid reflection on understanding the domain.", "Having more data doesn\u2019t necessarily translate to value, and gathering more useful data isn\u2019t always easy even if data is central to the product.", "Data network effects can be confused with the data advantages that come from scale. The question you should ask yourself is:", "- Does that data create meaningful value for customers/users? - If so, does increased usage lead to more useful data?", "Your home for data science.
