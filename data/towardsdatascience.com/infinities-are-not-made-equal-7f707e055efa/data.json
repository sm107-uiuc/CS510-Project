In relative terms, looking at sets A and B, we might compare if they\u2019re the same or different in size. But how do you do that if it\u2019s infinite in both cases?", "Well, we won\u2019t get to count their elements, so that\u2019s not an option. What else can we do?", "For a moment, let\u2019s pretend A and B are finite. If counting elements is not an option, how could we check if they are the same size? One option is to try and establish a 1:1 relationship between elements \u2014 also called a bijection.", "If a 1:1 relationship can be shown to exist, we\u2019ve effectively shown that A and B have the same number of elements. They\u2019re of the same size.", "Let\u2019s say the same idea works for infinite sets too. If we can establish a 1:1 relationship between two infinite sets, we know they are of the same size. There\u2019s no way one set could be in any sense bigger or smaller than the other.", "Let\u2019s verify our idea with some experiments.", "What happens if we take \u2115 and include an additional item in it. Let\u2019s label the new item -1.", "We can establish a 1:1 relationship to \u2115 by mapping n \u2194 n+1.", "We\u2019re mapping all inputs to different outputs, and we cover all of \u2115 on the output side. That means we have a 1:1 relationship, so in conclusion, the sets are the same in size.", "Turns out adding an item to an infinite set does not make it bigger.", "Had we added 10 items instead, we could label them -10\u2026-1 and we could use n \u2194 n+10 as our mapping.", "Turns out that adding any finite amount of items to an infinite set does not make it bigger either.", "The general idea known as the Hilbert\u2019s Hotel thought experiment: in a fully booked hotel with infinite rooms, you can always shift existing guests to accommodate new ones.", "Let\u2019s add infinitely many items to \u2115, namely all negative integers. We\u2019re basically comparing \u2124, the set of all positive and negative integers, to \u2115. Intuitively it\u2019s about twice the size than \u2115, but will it make any difference in our ability to form a 1:1 relationship?", "Not at all. We can alternately assign positive and negative numbers in sequence, jumping between them back and forth, covering the whole of \u2124", "Note that establishing a 1:1 relationship of a set with natural numbers is the same as giving an enumeration of its elements. The enumeration position n and the item x at that position form a pair in a 1:1 relationship.", "For our above mapping the enumeration is:", "Well, as it turns out, doubling the size of an infinite set did not make it bigger.", "Instead of looking at natural numbers, let\u2019s look at pairs of natural numbers. Like coordinates on a plane. Let\u2019s compare \u2115 to \u2115\u00b2. Adding a whole independent dimension has good chances of being in some sense \u201cbigger\u201d than the original set.", "Surely it will prove difficult to completely enumerate all of our elements in \u2115\u00b2.", "Turns out we can still do this if we follow this scheme:", "We\u2019re mapping the following sequence, filling up our entire target space of \u2115\u00b2", "Since we can give an all-encompassing enumeration of all our items, we know we\u2019re still dealing with an infinity the same size as \u2115.", "Turns out, squaring the number of items in an infinite set did not make it bigger.", "OK, what about \u211a, the set of rational numbers?", "Let\u2019s figure out positive rational numbers first.", "Any positive rational number can be represented by a pair of integers, like 1/2 or 5/9. So effectively, the positive portion of \u211a can be mapped by a diagonalisation scheme similar to what we used to map \u2115 \u2194 \u2115\u00b2.", "We\u2019ll have to change the scheme to avoid 0 in the denominator, and we\u2019d have to skip some rational numbers to account for the fact that not all pairs of integers form different rational numbers. This is because we have to deal with reducible fractions where 1/2 = 2/4 = 3/6 and so on.", "A bit cumbersome, but still. We can enumerate all positive numbers in \u211a.

You\u2019re waiting for an infinite set that is demonstrably bigger than \u2115. So far we\u2019ve been drawing blanks.", "Let\u2019s see what we already tried:", "The only thing we\u2019ve not tried yet is exponentiation of the size. Let\u2019s try to form a set of size 2^|\u2115|.", "Let\u2019s come back to finite sets for a second. Given any set A of size n, the classic way to construct a set of size 2^n is to form the power set P(A). That\u2019s the set containing all subsets of A.", "You\u2019ll notice that the size of A is 3 and the size of P(A) is 8=2\u00b3. You might be wondering if that is always the case, and indeed it is. This is easiest to see by construction.", "Say we pick some A and construct P(A). If we add an additional element e to A forming A\u2019, P(A\u2019) doubles in size compared to P(A). That is because P(A\u2019) partitions neatly into two equal sized parts. The first part contains all the elements of P(A) \u2014 these are exactly the subsets of A\u2019 that don\u2019t contain the new element e. The second part contains a twin for every item in the first part, forming all subsets of A\u2019 that do contain e.", "Let\u2019s start with the empty set A\u2070 and keep adding elements, thus forming A\u00b9, A\u00b2, etc. Each successive power set contains the elements from its predecessor, and a twin copy of those sets, each with the new element added.", "Going back to \u2115. Let\u2019s form P(\u2115) and see if it\u2019s still the same size as \u2115. We need to try and find a way to enumerate all elements of P(\u2115). Let\u2019s go.", "I don\u2019t know about you, but I find it hard to come up with a simple, systematic way of enumerating all possible sequences of natural numbers. We\u2019d have to come up with some indexing scheme.", "Let\u2019s draw a table where the columns represent natural numbers, and each row represents a subset. We place a 0 or 1 in each column, indicating whether we want to include the corresponding number in this row\u2019s subset or not. The order of our rows gives our enumeration order.", "Let\u2019s say we wanted to start our sequence by encoding the empty set, followed by the whole of \u2115, then forming various patterns, it might look like this.", "Perfect! It looks like have a way of representing our enumeration. We can now think about some sort of scheme to enumerate all subsets.", "Now, suppose we\u2019ve already found a good rule and are convinced our enumeration encodes every possible subset in some row.", "Humor me, and look at the sequence formed by the numbers on the diagonal of our table, then flip every element in it. Every 1 becomes a 0 and every 0 becomes a 1. The resulting sequence clearly encodes some subset of \u2115, so it should be a row in our enumeration somewhere.", "But at the same time, that sequence is guaranteed to not be present in our enumeration. If we wanted to claim that \u201cNo, No, that sequence is covered by row number g\u201d, we know that it\u2019s not true. Row g is different from our flipped diagonal sequence, at least at position g, that\u2019s the position where we took the original value and flipped it, so it can\u2019t possibly be the same. The subset of \u2115 encoded by our flipped diagonal is not in our enumeration. It cannot be.", "So finally, we\u2019ve met a set that is demonstrably larger than \u2115, namely the set of all subsets of \u2115. It\u2019s so vast, there isn\u2019t even a way to enumerate its members.", "OK, so we have found at least two kinds of infinite sets. Sets that can be enumerated, also called countable infinities. And even larger sets, sets so large that their members cannot even be enumerated, like the power set of \u2115. These are called uncountable infinities.", "As it turns out, the set of real numbers \u211dis also bigger than \u2115.", "Imagine, you tried enumerating real numbers between 0 and 1. You\u2019d end up doing something very similar to our subset indexing exercise, only with digits 0\u20139, instead of only 0 and 1.", "But we know that even if you limited yourself to enumerating those numbers that only have 0 and 1 digits in them, you\u2019d already have an uncountable set. There are already more real numbers between 0 and 1 than in the entirety of \u2115.", "In fact, \u211d is of the same size as P(\u2115). Let\u2019s discuss why that is the case.", "Let\u2019s establish that P(\u2115) has the same size as \u211d. We know that |P(\u2115)| is equivalent to the number of all sequences of 0s and 1s.", "Let\u2019s look at the open interval (0, 1) in \u211d, and let\u2019s try to enumerate numbers in it using a table like before, using our usual digits 0\u20139. We\u2019re using more digits than just 0 and 1. Clearly this makes this set at least as large as P(\u2115). But is it possibly the same in size?", "It is possible to establish a 1:1 relationship between sequences of digits 0\u20131 and 0\u20139. That is a matter of creating an equivalent encoding.", "There are several ways of doing that. Think of a binary encoding like computers use to represent numbers, or an encoding where the number of consecutive 1s and 0s encode successive digits. For example consider the following idea, in which consecutive sequences of 1s encode a sequence digits.", "To progress from an initial idea to an actual mapping is a tedious process. Details of constructing an 1:1 invertible encoding can be tricky, since a rigorous definition needs to account for all kinds of edge cases such as 0.09999\u2026. being equal to 0.1 etc. It is therefore often easier to find an injective mapping in each direction, and use the Schr\u00f6der-Bernstein theorem to conclude that a bijective mapping exists.", "Without spending time on the details of such an encoding, let\u2019s take it on faith that such an encoding exists. Since it does exist, we\u2019ve established that P(\u2115) and the interval (0, 1) \u2208 \u211d are of the same size.", "Next we establish the intervals (0, 1) and (-1, 1) as same in size by mapping", "We are stretching and shifting our interval by mapping 0 to -1, 0.5 to 0 and 1 to 1, with all values in-between interpolated linearly.", "This is nicely invertible. To go back we can calculate (x+1)/2, and so it is a 1:1 relationship. We\u2019re stretched our interval and established that the infinities of both intervals are of the same size.", "Chaining our mappings, we\u2019ve established that the intervals (0, 1) and (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) are of the same size. Both intervals contain infinitely many points, of course, but we know that there\u2019s a 1:1 correspondence between them. So as far as the size of infinities goes, they are equal.", "Notice that we can\u2019t stretch to infinity by multiplication with a constant like we did before.", "But we can use the tangent function to do that.", "We can stretch our interval (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) to the entirety of \u211d by mapping", "On our interval, the tan function is perfectly invertible using arctan(x), and so we have a 1:1 relationship establishing that (-\u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) is of the same size as the entirety of \u211d.", "Through a chain of 1:1 relationships we have established that:", "And therefore P(\u2115) is of the same size as \u211d.", "Yeah, I know. Now that we found an infinity bigger than \u2115, we want to know if there are any even bigger ones, or maybe smaller ones, and what about some size in-between?", "Yes, the power set of any set is of a bigger size than the original.", "So for example the size of P(\u211d) is bigger than the size of \u211d.", "The reason, outlined elegantly in Cantor\u2019s Theorem, is that you can\u2019t form a 1:1 relationship between any set A and its power set P(A). It\u2019s simply not possible for any mapping to cover all values in P(A).", "In technical terms: there are no surjective functions f: A \u2192P(A), so there can\u2019t be any bijective functions either. The power set is always too big to cover.", "No, any subset of a countable infinite set is either finite or a countable infinite set.", "The idea is that if you have an infinite set A possibly \u201csmaller\u201d than \u2115, you\u2019d be able to map it to some subset of \u2115. You could then order A based on that mapping, thus enumerating the contents of A. And to successfully enumerate the items of A is to show that there is a 1:1 relationship with \u2115, therefore proving that A is of the same size as \u2115.", "See Kevin\u2019s excellent article for more detail on that:", "Very good question. And an open one. The continuum hypothesis states that there aren\u2019t any. But so far nobody knows.", "What we do know is that the answer to that question is independent of set theory itself.
