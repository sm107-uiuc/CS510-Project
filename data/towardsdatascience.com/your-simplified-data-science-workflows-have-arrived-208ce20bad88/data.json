(Er, okay, that\u2019s not how having a baby works.)", "Machine images make it easy to create, back up, restore, and share virtual machines.", "Oh, and if you\u2019re on a tight budget, you\u2019ll love them in a way you\u2019d never love a VM copy.", "Ever lost your smartphone and then used a one-button solution to restore all your favorite apps, contacts, etc. onto a replacement phone? Machine images are like that, but for virtual machines on Google Cloud.", "Imagine that the virtual computer you\u2019ve rented from Google Cloud is a character in a video game. Before machine images, that video game had no save option \u2014 you had to restart the game from scratch every time you did something you regret.

These things take time away from working with your data, which is the part you\u2019re actually passionate about. Sure, you\u2019re discerning enough to want your own special customized setup \u2014 just the way you like it \u2014 so you\u2019re able to restrain your grumbling the first time through.", "Weeks go by.
