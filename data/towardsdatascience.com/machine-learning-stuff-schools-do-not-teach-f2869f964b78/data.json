Those are great learning materials that will equip you with solid knowledge and nice training experiences.", "However, from training ground to the battlefield is still a great distance. Schools, courses, and competition only focus on machine learning algorithms, which only plays a small part in a real-life machine learning project. There are other things that courses and competitions will not help, and you can only learn once your foot is set in the real world.", "One year working as a Machine Learning Engineer has greatly impacted on my mindset and practices on how a machine learning project should be executed. In this post, I will share some of the lessons that I learned in this first year.", "When taking courses or taking part in competitions, I was usually given machine learning problems, crafted by machine learning experts. Naturally, it comes with very clear instructions: the objectives, the dataset, context, and explanation, etc. My job was just to play with the data and produce the results, no question asked.", "In real life, what comes to me are business problems, requested by the business team and/or product team. Thus, it should be expected that the problem statements can be confusing and ambiguous, with no instruction provided. Even when things seem clear, it can\u2019t be sure that the way I interpret the problem is the same as the business team\u2019s. So, my first task is not to solve the problem, but to ask questions.", "Take an example: I work in an e-commerce firm. One day, a Product Manager gave me a shopping item and asked me to find the most similar items in the marketplace. Before thinking about collaborative filtering or other fancy algorithms, I would need to ask some very fundamental questions, like:", "It should be expected that as I\u2019m gaining more experience, I will need to start taking the initiatives, i.e. identify business needs, come up with the problems, ask myself those questions and find my own answers.", "In training or competition, it\u2019s a fair game where everyone has equal access to the same dataset. The result's quality is mostly decided by the algorithm.", "Real-life is not a fair game. For many businesses, data is their greatest assets and it is the data, not the model, that decides the success of the project. The more I work, the more I find myself asking the like of questions that were never in concern while in school:", "The availability, quality, and quantity of the data have a decisive impact on each and every other step of the project. If the data is bad, then every machine learning model seems like bad choices. If the data is good, then even if-else rules could work. I often hear people say Data Scientists spend 80% of their time finding and processing data, now I know that they are telling the truth.", "When I first started working, I often asked my colleagues what algorithms/libraries do they use. These days, the very first questions I ask is: \u201cHow did you get your training data?\u201d", "In training, the data size is small enough to fit into a single machine, and the project scope is narrow enough to be compressed into a single notebook. Thus, a few lines of code with the help of Pandas, Pytorch Dataloader and the likes can get my data ready for the model.", "In real life, things are much more completed. The data size and project complexity require me to handle data loading, data processing, model evaluation, etc., each with a separate component. Sometimes I will also need to worry about setting up machines, scheduling, data versioning, code versioning, etc. As illustrated in this paper by Google, machine learning is just a very small component of the projects, so, it\u2019s best not to focus too much on in at the start.", "Over time, I have come to a practice that when starting a project, the top priority is quickly set up a full end-to-end pipeline and test it with a small dataset. At this point, I only need things to run, and the performance is not yet my concern. This applies not only to the machine learning components but also to other parts of the pipeline. Once things are up-and-running, areas that need improvement can be identified, and worked on, one at a time. This helps me easily pin-point the bottleneck, and do better planning for the project.", "I used to think that the use of advanced models, or even more so, building them from scratch, is a sign of expertise. Therefore, in training, to polish my portfolio, or to gain that 0.01 score in the leaderboard, I tend to go for more complex, fancy models. I have time, and the dataset is small anyway, so why not just go for it?", "Practicing that in real life, however, can be a sign of stupidity. A complex model is much less applicable for many reasons:", "As such, my current routine for selecting machine learning models is as below:", "Some other lessons that I learned regarding the algorithm:", "In training, the evaluation metrics are clearly defined together with the problem. There\u2019s also a leaderboard to compare the performance of my models with others. Thus, the moment my model spit out the output, I can submit results right away and voila, the job\u2019s done.", "In real life, things don\u2019t stop when the prediction is completed.", "Many courses just focus on machine learning algorithms, and most competitions are just about building machine learning models. Yet, the algorithms and models are just very small parts of a real-life project. A well-executed project also needs proper problem statement, good data sources, solid engineering structure, smooth data pipeline, explainable results, and reliable, convincing evaluation metrics.", "Above is just one of the many valuable lessons that I learned after the first year working as a Machine Learning Engineer.
