While that\u2019s an easy way to create a filter for screening outliers, there\u2019s even a better way to do it \u2014 using boxplots.", "Boxplots are an excellent statistical technique to understand the distribution, dispersion and variation of univariate and categorical data\u2014 all in a single plot.", "The purpose of this article is to introduce boxplot as a tool for outlier detection, and I\u2019m doing so focusing on the following areas:", "The boxplot is an effective tool to visualize the spread of data with respect to central values. I really don\u2019t think you need to learn a lot of details, but below is a brief description to give a bit of intuition of how it works under the hood. Don\u2019t feel bad if you don\u2019t get it 100%.", "A picture is worth a thousand words, so instead of describing the concept in words just take a look at the following figure top-to-bottom to build your own intuition. It all starts with a small dataset of seven observations: 1, 6, 5, 4, 4, 7, 8.", "If you re-arrange the data small to large, the mid-point is the median. The median splits data into two halves. The mid-points of each halve is called a \u201cquartile\u201d. So we get two quartiles \u2014 the 1st quartile is the mid-point of the first half and the 3rd quartile is the mid-point of the second half. As you walk through the steps from the top, in the final part of the figure you have a boxplot and the data it contains.", "Statistically speaking, a boxplot provides several pieces of information, two important ones are the quartiles, represented by both ends of the box. The distance between these two quartiles is called the Interquartile Range (IQR).", "In the boxplot below, the length of the box is IQR, and the minimum and maximum values are represented by the whiskers. The whiskers are generally extended into 1.5*IQR distance on either side of the box. Therefore, all data points outside these 1.5*IQR values are flagged as outliers.", "If you\u2019ve got the intuition about right, understanding how an \u201coutlier\u201d comes into play isn\u2019t that difficult. Check out the following figure.", "Generally, any data point outside the min and max values (represented by whiskers at both ends of the box) are treated as outliers.", "Again, if you didn\u2019t understand the statistical concept 100%, no hard feelings. We can drive a car without understanding a lot of its mechanics. But we do have to know how to drive!", "Just like knowing how to drive, understanding how to implement an algorithm is the most important part of the business. Below is a small snippet to build that programming intuition in Python.", "As you can see, one outlier is pretty clearly visible in this boxplot and we can easily filter that. We don\u2019t know the exact value of the outlier but we know that it\u2019s greater than 12. So let\u2019s filter that outlier value.", "There you have it, the boxplot detects 13 as an outlier in the dataset. Whether this outlier is an anomaly or not, that, of course, is a different question that can only be answered separately using domain knowledge and additional techniques.", "The purpose of this article was to give the statistical intuition behind boxplot and demonstrate how it works with a tiny bit of programming example. The power of boxplots lies in the fact that you can \u201csee\u201d the extreme values and make a decision on the threshold for outliers by visual interpretation. The demo here was based on univariate data but it would work in a similar fashion for a multivariate dataset and categorical values.", "If you liked the article feel free to follow me on Medium or Twitter.", "Your home for data science.
