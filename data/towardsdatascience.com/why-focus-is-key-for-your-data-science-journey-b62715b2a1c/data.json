I started with an overview foundation since I didn\u2019t have much of a programming background. I would still recommend this if you have no background in math and/or coding.

You can do it! Just focus on what you want to do in this field as soon as possible. If you are still experimenting a bit that is ok. But I would recommend doing it quickly if possible.
