In fact, they are closely associated branches of mathematics that are intertwined with each other.", "In this article, we will understand what is the difference between the two. Then we will conclude with the ubiquitous question that all of us might have faced at some point \u2014 from where to start?", "Probability is a forward-looking process. It helps in predicting the next output given our knowledge of the distribution of the data generating model which is a random process", "We want to calculate P(Y|\u03b8); where Y is the outcome and \u03b8 is the parameter that defines the random process (could be flipping a coin, rolling a die etc).", "There are two schools of thoughts to interpret probability:", "1) Frequentist: It concerns around calculating the relative frequency of occurrence of a certain outcome upon repeating the experiment multiple times", "Let\u2019s take an example of a fair coin toss. Tossing a coin 10 times might show 7 \u2018Heads\u2019 which converts into a probability of 0.7, however, if we repeat this experiment long enough, then the frequency count of \u2018Heads\u2019 becomes equal to that of tails indicating probability of 0.5.", "2) Bayesian: It primarily talks about", "a) the degree of belief before seeing the new data, captured in the term \u2018prior\u2019", "b) updated information from the observed data, incorporated in \u2018likelihood\u2019 denoted by L(\u03b8|Y).", "The posterior probability is then updated by taking the product of prior with the likelihood:", "Let\u2019s understand more about likelihood: As real life processes are highly stochastic and complex that we often don\u2019t have a fair idea of their distribution, we need a better estimate of \u03b8 in order to be able to better predict the P(Y/ \u03b8).", "Simply put, we need to estimate the \u03b8 that best describes the distribution from which given data is generated. This is where Statistics comes into picture \u2014 to calculate the likelihood function.", "It is a backward looking process. It extracts the patterns from the underlying random process to come up with a possible quantitative model that explains the data behavior.", "Note that we do not necessarily know all the characteristics that define the underlying random process.", "The statistical model starts with a finite possible values \u03b8 (called as model space \u0398) along with the observed data to infer which \u03b8 would have generated that data. \u03b8 could be any parameter that defines the probability distribution like mean or variance.", "Statistical modelling also helps us to quantify the error around the inferred distribution or parameter. Estimated parameter gets closer and closer to the true \u03b8 as more data is collected from the same experiment. That is, the error around the estimates shrinks and we become more confident in our estimates. This is called as confidence interval.", "Now, you will be thinking from where does this error arise and how much data is enough to infer the true parameter.", "Well, that\u2019s because we only get to study a sample of data and not the entire population for various reasons like data availability in the first place, cost of accessing the data etc. If with repeated experiments we can get our sample space so close to the population, we could reduce the error of our sample parameter estimates to 0 and arrive at true parameter.", "Difference between Probability and Statistics \u2014 explained via examples", "Probability: For a drug trial, the entire population is divided into two groups in 1:10 ratio \u2014 Group A and Group B. P(A) = 0.7 and P(B) = 0.5, where P = probability of successful drug effect. What is the probability of the successful treatment of a random patient from the population?", "Statistics: Now, if we do not know the composition of true population and observe the data for 700 patients who get successfully treated from drug, among 1000 randomly selected patients from the population. What can we infer about the population distribution?", "Probability: If we flip an unbiased coin 3 times successively, what is the probability to get HHT?", "Statistics: If we observe HHT outcome of 3 successive coin flips, what is the estimate of parameter p of the binomial distribution?", "What comes first: probability or statistics?", "Statistics works on collecting lot of data to be able to generate insights and drive decision making. Statistics includes but is not limited to the study of probability models only.", "There are many discussions on StackOverflow, however, I would like to conclude that it is an iterative process to understand the foundations of probability enough to understand the central dogma of statistics.", "In the process, when we start understanding the concepts behind statistics and probability models, we are no more confined by the pedagogy of what to be studied first.", "Your home for data science.
