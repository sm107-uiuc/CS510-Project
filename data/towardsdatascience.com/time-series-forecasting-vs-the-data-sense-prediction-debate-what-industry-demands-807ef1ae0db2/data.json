Please follow the advice outlined in the WHO website to stay safe and protected\u201d", "Business Intelligence & Data Science are two of the most recurring terms in this era of technology and transformation. Although both of them are built on the foundation of data, they are completely different. Business Intelligence is the process of collecting, integrating and analyzing the present data to drive future decisions whereas Data Science is more about analyzing the data to predict an outcome for the future. There are multiple versions of how these two terms are coined differently, however, it all boils down to a combination of Math + Business + Technology!", "\u201cAll of us are aware of the 2019-nCoV (Coronavirus) outbreak and how deadly it has turned out to be. The World Health Organization is currently monitoring the situation closely and working towards developing a Global Strategic Preparedness. Every day a situation report is published to track the number of Confirmed Cases, Deaths, Recoveries, New Cases and so on. Think of a scenario where an estimate of the outbreak in the future can help countries implement strategic measures today. Strategic measures involve setting up health centers, stocking medical necessities, spreading awareness and so on. We will try and predict the number of confirmed cases till the end of next week\u201d.", "To predict the number of confirmed cases it is important to understand several factors that might influence the outbreak. Let\u2019s take a look at the infographic below.", "\u201cImplementing these factors to develop a regression or an ARIMAX model seems difficult given the granularity of data required is currently unavailable\u201d, however, a Progression/Business Intelligence bases approach can be taken to predict the future outcome.", "The above factors, if not used in the model can also be used to validate the model results. For e.g. we end up predicting a higher number of confirmed cases in Wuhan (say) and we need to validate the predicted figures. We can do primary research on the demographics of Wuhan. If we see a scenario that ascertains/confirms that the number of older people in Wuhan with diabetes and heart failure is much higher than the surrounding provinces, we can definitely validate our predicted values; These two factors will always be highly correlated.", "Having worked in the Analytics industry for 5 years now, I have seen scenarios where we end up complicating a process when a simple understandable solution can be implemented easily. Think of a scenario where you are asked to predict Sales because your Business Partner wants a baseline number to plan the budget for next year. You can always work on developing a Time Series Model, but will your Business Partner be able to understand what a P-D-Q framework signifies or what ACF-PACF plot stands for?", "A model doesn\u2019t necessarily mean, you start using complicated mathematics to create some equation. Step 1 for any time series data is looking at these three components:", "I tweaked the model parameters by using data from the most recent 6 days ending Jan 31, 2020, to come up with the alpha value.", "The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is a statistical measure of how accurate our forecast model is. It measures this accuracy as a percentage and can be calculated as the average absolute percent error for each time period minus actual values divided by actual values. It basically helps us identify", "The lower the MAPE the better is your model results. The World Health Organization publishes a Situation Report daily, values from which were used to validate the model figures.", "It remains to see how deadly this outbreak turns out to be but using the data available, if we can identify the high-risk zones, we can act quickly and put some resistance to the outbreak. This is where Data Scientists & Analysts need to work hand in hand and help the community spread more awareness.", "About the Author: Advanced analytics professional and management consultant helping companies find solutions for diverse problems through a mix of business, technology, and math on organizational data.
