Agile is a regroup term for a larger number of project management frameworks that all try to solve common problems in the IT industry. In recent years, the Agile approach has gained much popularity in IT departments and start-ups everywhere.", "As we all know, the problem of IT is often a mismatch between the need of the user and the understanding of the developer. As a simple example, when your grandma asks you to install a new program on her computer you\u2019ll tell her yes give me 5 minutes. Then to discover that her computer is a Minitel. In big IT projects similar things, unfortunately, do happen way too often.", "Traditional projects would make a contract for a complete software at once and deliver the full package at the end. The proposition made by Agile projects is to define the engagements differently: in incremental steps.", "Agile develops a project step by step and makes feedback possible at every step. This allows to steer a project in the right direction at regular intervals and ensures delivery of a project that the client actually needs.", "So how do people organize their work when they \u201cdo Agile\u201d? There are a few things common knowledge of Agile so let me explain those. I focus on the Scrum method because this is the one I know best:", "So, the big difference: \u201cnon-management\u201d people get a lot of autonomy and responsibility with those new ways of working. Also, roles are very clearly separated: if you are on the development team, you develop and you don\u2019t get to set priorities for example.", "This is what will affect career choices in the long term. Career choices for many people used to be: trying to move from a technical non-management position to a management position in order to have better pay and better status. But with a clear separation of roles, this is no longer relevant: the PO will manage the negotiation with stakeholders and will become better in that, while the development team focuses on development and getting better in that.", "To reformulate, what we used to do is promoting people who are good at their jobs. Which seems to make sense but actually does not make sense at all. When someone is good in developing that by no means tells us that he will be a good manager. Actually, people who do a good job should NOT be promoted: let them do what they are good at and pay for their value.", "I believe that career perspectives are deeply changing in tech. If teams can really be autonomous, low and middle management is no longer necessary. This removes a career path from development to management for many. At the same time, we see that developers salaries are often huge.", "Salary and status for technical jobs should stop the race to the top. Companies should let technical people do their tech work and pay them well to prevent them from wanting to climb the career ladder.", "In this new way of working, people will be able to do what they like, whether that is technical, or whether that is communication with stakeholders, or whatever.", "If you do what you like and you do it well, Agile has a place for you.", "My final career advice is: if you do what you like and you do it well, Agile has a place for you.", "Your home for data science.
