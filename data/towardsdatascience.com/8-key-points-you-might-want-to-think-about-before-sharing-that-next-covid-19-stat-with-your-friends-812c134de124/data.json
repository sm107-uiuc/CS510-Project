A lot of the reporting seems, unfortunately, to favour a liberal interpretation of numbers which feeds into sensationalist claims and headlines at the expense of scientific rigour and objective information dissemination.", "I have spent the best part of last fifteen years of my life leveraging huge amounts of noisy data to build mathematical models of complex phenomena: I did my graduate studies in modelling the human brain, and worked, among other places, as a quant at Goldman Sachs and data science manager at Facebook. Throughout my career, I have seen over and over again how a lack of understanding of the source, context and method of how data is obtained can lead to gross mis-interpretation of the phenomenon you are studying. The latest COVID-19 numbers and interpretations flying around in the media and social networks are no exception to that. I would like to share with you a jargon-free, non-exhaustive, 8 key point list to help you avoid most of these pitfalls.", "It has become very common to see news headlines along the lines of \u20181,000 new coronavirus cases detected\u2019 or \u2018coronavirus cases reach 100,000\u2019. These numbers are not an indication of how the pandemic is progressing, they only serve as clickbait. Here\u2019s why:", "Assume a country of 10 million people with 1 million infections, so a 10% infection rate. If we test 5,000 people randomly (more on that later) on the first day, the number of detected cases would be ~500. This number is nowhere near the real amount of infected people, confirmed cases will always be an underestimate of the real cases because of finite testing capabilities. Now say the next day, we test 50,000 people, the total confirmed cases will now increase by ~5,000. This ten-fold daily increase is an increase in the confirmed cases, not an increase in total infection numbers, and is a direct consequence of the increase in testing.", "As part of government responses to the COVID-19 epidemic, more tests will be conducted daily and the quick ramp up in these tests will far outweigh the evolution of the epidemic, hence the change in the number of confirmed cases will, especially at the beginning of the epidemic, be mainly influenced by amount of tests rather than the real infected cases.", "Taking this one step further, in a scenario where the government ramps up its testing after the peak of the infection is reached, confirmed daily cases will most likely increase although the total infected population is decreasing. Imagine a situation where tests are increasing from 5,000 to 10,000 while the infection rate is decreasing from 10% to 9% (a huge drop for one day), the confirmed daily cases will still post an increase from 500 to 900! Again, this showcases how irrelevant the standalone number of confirmed cases is in assessing the progression of the epidemic.", "Since only a limited amount of tests can be done on a given day, a protocol on how to allocate these tests needs to be put in place. This allocation strategy, also known as sampling methodology in scientific circles, has a direct impact on the cases being reported. Let\u2019s continue with the example we started with, and say the government can have 2 strategies to allocate the 5000 tests:", "Strategy B (a.k.a biased sampling ), will result in higher reported cases than strategy A (a.k.a random sampling) . Strategy B is biased because it is testing a subpopulation with a much higher likelihood of being infected. Looking now at the percentage rate of positive tests: Strategy B will give you an estimate of the percentage of self-reported symptomatic cases that are infected, whereas Strategy A will give you an estimate of the whole population infection rate.", "As governments ramp up their daily testing rates, usually the sampling methodology of the population will change progressively from a B-like strategy to A: initially, hospitalised people and people with acute symptoms are given priority, but as testing becomes more pervasive, more people with milder symptoms and eventually people with little to no symptoms will have access to these tests. The percentage of cases that test positive will usually decrease as countries aggressively increase their testing capabilities and get closer to the real population infection rate.", "On a related note, biased samples can still be used to get an unbiased estimate of the property we are trying to measure. This requires though having the right data to clearly quantify the bias of the sample and adjust for the overall population characteristics. Usually the organisations collecting the data and government should jointly be able to deliver an unbiased estimate if the right data is collected. It would be great to see such efforts undertaken, to avoid the spread of biased estimates. ( I have published a short follow-up post on what such a framework can look like here )", "As we have seen earlier, detecting all of the infections in a population is a non-trivial task. What about fatalities though? As most COVID-19 fatalities follow hospitalisation, where tests have become standard for acute symptoms, one can assume that the recorded number of fatalities is close to the real number of fatalities. One caveat to note here: the process by which deaths are recorded and attributed to COVID-19 is not always the same across different countries \u2014 more on that later.", "In the context of tracking the evolution of a pandemic, the number of fatalities is known as a \u2018lag metric\u2019 since death only occurs several events after initial infection: infection \u2192 incubation \u2192 symptoms \u2192 recovery or death ) incubation alone is assumed by the World Health Organisation to be anywhere between 1 to 14 days. Hence if we are looking for the peak in the number of infections it will usually have occurred roughly a couple of weeks before the peak of deaths is reported.", "Let\u2019s have a look at the fatality rates. We should make a clear distinction between 2 different metrics:", "The number that is reported in most headlines e.g. \u20187% of cases have now resulted in death\u2019 is the CFR, and will always be an overestimate of the real infection fatality rate. Also, as testing is ramped up CFR will invariably decrease and tend more towards the IFR.", "I hope that I have so far managed to help you develop a better understanding of what the numbers thrown around in the media really represent, as well as their limitations. In this last section I\u2019d like to give you a couple of tips when it comes to comparing stats across countries, as well as how to try getting a better intuition by contextualising them.", "So let\u2019s start with some words of caution when doing comparisons across countries:", "The last point I want to make is that when you are trying to observe and understand a phenomenon for the first time through metrics, it is always best to have an appropriate baseline or benchmark to compare to. This will make it easier to gain a certain intuition. Knowing for instance that COVID-19 is one strand of the virus flu, using the death toll of seasonal flu, could be a good baseline, e.g. Let\u2019s say the current death estimate of COVID-19 in a region is 10,000 if no mitigation or containment strategy is put in place: how alarming is this if seasonal flu fatalities in that same region is around 15,000 per year ? Compare that to the case where the seasonal flu fatalities is around 1,000 ?", "I have attempted in this article to share some guidelines that would enable the reader to avoid the most common mistakes in interpreting the COVID-19 outbreak data and stats. It is my sincere hope that journalists as well use these 8 points as a checklist to report on the data in a scientifically sound way, far from any sensationalism and fear-inducing headlines. The panic button has been pressed by a lot of governments worldwide, people are anxious, and our healthcare professionals ( a big sincere thank you to all of them ) are on the frontlines, going through hell to cope with the situation. In these turbulent times we need level-headed reporting, rooted in facts.", "Next article will be about best practices for critical decision-making using theoretical models and incomplete data in a rapidly evolving situation.
