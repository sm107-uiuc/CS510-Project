If you search on Google or Reddit forums, chances are you may quickly become overwhelmed with how much information exists. Some of that is due to the vast number of roles, from \u201cBusiness Analyst\u201d to \u201cMachine Learning Scientist\u201d that fall under this umbrella. It\u2019s also a product of advancements in the field being relatively new and constantly changing. For those graduating or looking to begin a career in data science, it can be overwhelming, and in many cases, defeating.", "While it seems like many companies are asking for every skill and ability under the sun for entry-level positions, it is, in fact, possible to get started without knowing everything.", "As a Type-A person, I always strive for perfection, which often results in \u201cfailure\u201d. When I started learning \u201cdata science\u201d, I wanted to know everything about every topic which often made it difficult to ever get too deep into any of the topics. I was constantly asking myself \u201cIs there a better option?\u201d when I would start a project or an online course. As a young, aspiring data scientist, I wanted to be doing the best possible option so companies would take notice. Not only did this turn out to be counter-productive, but it also killed a lot of time I could have been using to actually learn new skills.", "So my first piece of advice to anyone entering this field is to pick a starting point and stick with it. Are there better places? Maybe. But you\u2019re better off starting down a route than constantly trying to pick one.", "Back to my background. During my undergraduate years, I changed majors 4\u20135 times and actually didn\u2019t land on Data Science until my final year of school. I started with a focus on Computer Science and eventually transitioned because I found Data Science a good balance between math and programming. Entering my senior year, I had exactly zero Data Science internships, work experience, and projects to my name. I spent that year focusing heavily on my coursework and trying to get the most out of each project, rather than stacking my own personal ones on top. The repetition of doing simple projects over and over helped familiarize me with the basic steps of exploratory analysis, data visualization, and translating results into tangible meaning.", "For my capstone project, I chose to focus on using neural networks for genomic analysis. The setup was relatively simple but provided great exposure to one machine learning technique, rather than trying to learn all of them simultaneously. Sure, eventually I would go on to learn about Decision Trees, SVMs, and Random Forest, but taking an extended time to learn the ins and outs of one approach allowed me to gain a strong understanding of how neural networks worked and how to apply them to actual problems.", "With that, my second piece of advice is to pick one topic to focus on rather than trying to cram your resume with buzzwords. Spending a day or two working on a topic likely will leave you with little understanding of a lot of things, instead of a strong understanding of a select few.", "Finally came the process of actually applying for jobs. Reminder, I still have no work experience in data science, but now have a couple of basic projects to talk about. I sent out a lot of applications (I can\u2019t emphasize \u201ca lot\u201d enough) and was fortunate enough to get a few interviews. Eventually, I ended up in my role as a data analyst with Target.", "Since starting my role, I have been able to apply a lot of the skills I gained in college while also learning a whole bunch of new ones. Often times, I wind up learning a skill as the result of running into a problem at work, rather than simply hunting out the \u201cnext great data science topic\u201d. Most days I still feel like I know very little. The world of Reddit and data science blogs still feels like everyone knows everything (which isn\u2019t true, obviously).", "So for those of you who feel underqualified or that you don\u2019t know nearly enough\u2026", "And just for fun, here are a bunch of skills I didn\u2019t have on my resume that seem to appear as a qualification for a lot of roles these days:", "Your home for data science.
