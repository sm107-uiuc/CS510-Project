The data set has some imbalance with 26.5% churn.", "Data is first checked for unique customer ID. Blank spaces are replaced with 0 and columns are changed to numerical type whenever applicable.", "EDA is carried out to understand the data. A feature like gender has little impact on churn and will be dropped.", "Feature -to-feature correlation is mapped out using a heatmap and features that are highly correlated to one another are dropped (shown below with correlation of > 0.6).", "One hot encoding is then carried out on categorical features. And the top 11 features are selected via Random Forest Classification using the algorithm\u2019s feature importance property.", "Reducing the number of input features will simplify the problem that is being modeled and speed up the modeling process.", "Four models are used to do modeling on the final data: Logistic Regression, C-Support Vector Classification, K Neighbours Classifier and Random Forest Classifier.", "GridSearchCV is used to tune the hyperparameters and the best hyperparameter is found for each model.", "Based on class 1 classification of threshold 0.5, the logistic regression model is found to have the highest ROC-AUC score, the lowest log-loss, the highest F1 score, and the highest Recall score. Hence the logistic regression model is selected as the final model to further fine-tune the threshold to improve the recall score for our data.", "Precision is the fraction of relevant instances among the retrieved instances, while Recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of the total amount of relevant instances that were actually retrieved.", "In predicting customer churn, a higher recall would be preferred to a higher precision, because it would be ideal to be able to predict which customers are at a higher risk of leaving. However tuning the threshold to achieve a higher recall comes at the cost of reducing the precision. Hence a balance needs to be achieved. In this project, I have chosen to use F1 score as the metric to select my threshold.", "Classification algorithms work by predicting a probability before the probability can be mapped to a class label. This is achieved by using a threshold, such as 0.5, where all values equal or greater than the threshold are mapped to one class and all other values are mapped to another class.", "Since the data has a class imbalance, the default threshold can result in a poor classification. As such, it is important to tune the threshold used to map probabilities to the class labels.", "At the default threshold of 0.5, the logistic regression model gave an F1 score of 0.58. Based on the maximum F1 score of 0.62, the threshold value turns out to be 0.36. And this new threshold value increased the recall score from 0.55 to 0.78.", "Based on the logistic regression model, telecommunications companies can focus on the top two features and reduce customer churn by :", "Here is a link to my GitHub where you can find my codes and presentation slides.
