I use the data frame that was created with the program from my last article. The data is based on the raw BBC News Article dataset published by D. Greene and P. Cunningham [1].", "Feel free to check out the source code here if you\u2019re interested.", "If you missed my first guide to extract information from text files, you might want to check it out to get a better understanding of the data we are dealing with.", "Since I want to keep this guide rather short, I will not describe this step as detailed as in my last article. The most important information to mention in this section is how the data is structured and how to access it.", "As can be seen in the screenshot below, the data is located in the generated_data folder. We also want to save the train and test data to this folder, once these files have been created. Additionally, the script runs in the prepare_ml_data.py file which is located in the prepare_ml_data folder.", "As presented in my last article about transforming text files to data tables, the bbc_articles.tsv file contains five columns. However, for this tutorial, we are only interested in the text and genre columns.", "In a first step, we want to load the data into our coding environment. For this, we need the path to the directory, where the data is stored. We save the path to a local variable to access it in order to load the data and use it as a path to save the final train and test set. Since the data is stored in a different folder than the file where we are running the script, we need to go back one level in the filesystem and access the targeted folder in a second step. We achieve this by joining \u2018..\u2019 and the data folder which results in \u2018../generated_data/\u2019.", "With the path to the generated_data folder, we create another variable directing to the data file itself, which is called bbc_articles.tsv. Since it is a tab-separated-values file (tsv), we need to add the \u2018\\t\u2019 separator in order to load the data as a Pandas Dataframe.", "The following command is not required for splitting the data into train and test set. Nevertheless, since I don't need all the available columns of the dataset, I select the wanted columns and create a new dataframe with only the \u2018text\u2019 and \u2018genre\u2019 columns.", "Now, we have the data ready to split it. Luckily, the train_test_split function of the sklearn library is able to handle Pandas Dataframes as well as arrays. Therefore, we can simply call the corresponding function by providing the dataset and other parameters, such as following:", "After splitting the data, we use the directory path variable to define a file path for saving the train and the test data. By transforming the dataframes to a csv while using \u2018\\t\u2019 as a separator, we create our tab-separated train and test files.", "In this short article, I described how to load data in order to split it into train and test set. The corresponding data files can now be used to for training and evaluating text classifiers (depending on the model though, maybe additional data cleaning is required).", "In future articles, I will describe how to set up different deep learning models (such as LSTM and BERT) to train text classifiers, that predict an article\u2019s genre based on its text. Below find a link to my article where I used the FARM framework to fine tune BERT for text classification.", "Thank you very much for reading and Happy Coding!", "[1] D. Greene and P.
