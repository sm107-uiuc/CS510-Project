I thought this as well and went after an MSc in Computer Vision and Machine learning in 2018.", "Amongst the theoretical and practical knowledge I gained in my studies, there are some crucial aspects of studies and development that I believe are essential to be able to be an active component within a commercial working environment.", "Software engineering is a methodology that consists of a set of principles that are applied to the development of software. Examples of software engineering principles are analysis, design, testing and implementation.", "Having software engineering as a skill in 2020 is a basic necessity for any serious developer. So many people might make the mistake of thinking Software Engineering starts and ends with programming or having coding skills. But seasoned developers within all tech domain will attest to the fact that Software Engineering is more of a practice than a skill.", "Unfortunately, Software Engineering is not a skill that you will be taught in most advanced machine learning degrees.", "There is more than enough content to be covered within an MSc study in machine learning. Some courses simply do not enough time to dedicate to the study of how systems and application that leverage machine learning techniques should be developed.", "In my MSc studies, having a background in software engineering, coupled with an awareness of some programming languages was a prerequisite that had to be met.", "Why is understanding Software Engineering essential?", "It\u2019s great if you understand the internal workings of a convolutional layer, or can describe in detail a variety of neural network architecture.", "Still, the truth of the matter is, in the real world, machine learning models exist outside python scripts and notebooks.", "Commercial products that you\u2019ll work on after your studies come in the form of web, desktop, and mobile applications. Knowing the standard methodology of developing software that has an embedded machine learning model is paramount to your success as a machine learning practitioner.", "In my current role as a Computer Vision Engineer, the most important skill that\u2019s proven useful is my ability to pick up new OOP programming languages and develop software, more specifically, iOS apps.", "Machine learning models can exist in various systems, but all these systems have a standard approach to how they are developed and maintained. Software engineering educates you on these approaches. Software Engineering is also riddled with principles to guide the software development and maintenance process, examples are KISS, DRY, OOP etc.", "Below is a quick, friendly introductory video to Sofware Engineering principles.", "Leadership in machine learning takes various forms.", "For me, leadership within machine learning is the ability to direct the work and progress of a product, technique or tool, in a direction that better serves the wider society and creates a positive impact.", "There are evident leaders within the machine learning domain, and they have amassed a large following on social media networks such as Medium, Twitter, YoutTube etc.", "Their large audience is usually a result of the impact and contribution they\u2019ve had in the machine learning space.", "Leaders or influencers within machine learning are not made overnight, their status is a result of years, sometimes decades of constant studying and work within their chosen specialised field.", "Anyone considered an influencer or leader in the machine learning space is almost someone of high intelligence and has unrivalled expertise within their domain.", "Leadership in machine learning can\u2019t be simply taught. It\u2019s an accumulation of hours of study, work and contribution to the field, all coupled with the teachings of experience within one\u2019s academic and professional career.", "Here are a few names of leaders and influencers within machine learning that I aspire to emulate, some name might be familiar to you:", "You are not going to build Skynet in your MSc studies, and probably won\u2019t build it after.", "There\u2019s a common misconception that correlates the ability to understand aspects of machine learning to the possibility of one been able to develop advanced general artificial intelligence.", "I, for one, fell for this misconception as I thought that if I understood machine learning at an academic level, I could build personal assistants that rivalled Tony Stark\u2019s Jarvis.", "The reality of the matter is that an MSc in Machine Learning brings to light how far humans have come in the development of independent systems that can learn. Still, more importantly, MSc studies make you realise that we have yet to barely scratch the surface of the field and the possibilities that emerge from breakthroughs and advancements.", "Remember that artificial intelligence as a domain is only about 64 years old, as the term AI was formally academically introduced at a conference at Dartmouth College. We have a long way to go, and it\u2019s always exciting to be a part of the journey.", "To conclude, I\u2019ll summarise the key take away from this article.
