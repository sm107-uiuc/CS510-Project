Come join my Super Quotes newsletter. \ud83d\ude0e", "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been a hot topic in Deep Learning ever since their initial invention and publication at NIPS 2014.", "There\u2019s a good reason for it all: GANs can create new content based on only a small bit of guidance. It\u2019s that sort of creativity which makes them so powerful. GANs have been proven capable of applying that creativity to many diverse and useful applications:", "Just to name a few there.", "With all of this, massive resources are being poured into GAN research to figure out both how they work and how to design the absolute best GAN networks. Finally, after a couple of years of maturity, AutoML and Neural Architecture Search (NAS) have made their way into the domain of GANs.", "What follows in this article are 2 sections: the first explains how GANs work and how they are currently designed manually. The second is a showcase of brand new Deep Learning research \u2014 AutoGAN, which applies Neural Architecture Search to automatically find the best GAN architectures.", "Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are classified within the group of \u201cgenerative\u201d models. That means that they\u2019re able to produce, i.e generate completely new, \u201cvalid\u201d data. By valid data, we mean that the network\u2019s output should be something that we would deem acceptable for our target.", "To illustrate, consider an example where we wish to generate some new images for training an image classification network. Of course, for such an application we want our training data to as realistic as possible, perhaps quite similar in style of other image classification training data sets.", "The figure below shows an example of a set of images that a GAN has generated. They look quite real! If we weren\u2019t told that they were computer-generated, we might have believed that a human collected these!", "To do this, GANs are built out 2 separate, opposing networks: The Generator and the Discriminator. The generator is trained to create realistic-looking images when given only a noisy image array as input. The Discriminator is trained to classify whether or not an image is real or not.", "The real power in GANs comes from the opposing training style they follow. The Generator network\u2019s weights are learned based on the loss of the Discriminator. Thus, the Generator is pushed to be trained in such a way that for the images it generates, it is very hard to tell if they are real or not. At the same time that these images are looking more and more real, the Discriminator is getting better and better at telling which images are real or not, no matter how similar they may look to the naked eye.", "Thus, GANs build a sort of feedback loop where the Generator is helping to train the Discriminator and the Discriminator is helping to train the Generator. They both get better together. The diagram below helps illustrate this.", "Notice how a Generator is just a CNN with an image as its output while a Discriminator is just a CNN classification network with class probabilities as its output; very simple. Because of this simplicity, most GAN architectures are just copies of other state-of-the-art deep networks. Generators may take the form of something like a modified U-Net while Discriminators will usually look like a ResNet, DenseNet, or similar architectures.", "The good thing is that this may simplify part of the problem. Research Scientists can simply borrow the network designs from previously proven research and simply focus on algorithm design and training mechanisms for GANs.", "On the other hand, this may be a bit limiting. What if current network designs aren\u2019t optimally suited for GANs? They work well enough on their own, but perhaps improvements to the network structure could further improve GAN performance with a designed that\u2019s tailor-made for them.", "Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has been another hot Deep Learning topic. NAS is an algorithm that searches for the best neural network architecture.", "Most NAS algorithms work in this following way.", "This style of NAS has been successfully applied to both image classification and semantic segmentation.", "AutoGAN also follows this same learning scheme, specifically focusing on building the Generator network since more work has been done in finding the best classification networks (for the Discriminator).", "As the author\u2019s note in their paper, training GANs is inherently unstable simply due to their design. Careful network building is paramount to making the process run smoothly. With that in mind, AutoGANs search space is made to be far more limited than that of NAS. Instead of being able to sample from many different types and sizes of convolution blocks and skip connections, AutoGAN\u2019s Generator search space is set to be:", "With this more controlled search space, applying NAS to find the optimal Generator architecture is much simpler and more stable, since the search of NAS is far less wide and complicated.", "The other technique which made training more effective was the use of Multi-Level Architecture Search (MLAS) as opposed to the regular Multi-Level Architecture Search (SLAS). With a regular SLAS, a single RNN controller would be used to build the entire NAS network at once. But with MLAS the network is built progressively.", "MLAS performs the search in a bottom-up style, performing the Architecture Search for every cell individually. Thus, each cell will use its own personal RNN controller for the search. In a sense, this is also simplifying the search since the NAS is being focused on one specific portion of the network at a time, rather than the very complex entire thing.", "With its clever new training set up and fine-grained, focused cell search space, AutoGAN was able to achieve state-of-the-art results. Specifically, it sets a new bar for generating new images of high-visual quality based on human judgment.", "AutoML is slowly making its way into many fields of DeepLearning and AI. No doubt that it will be a strong focus of AI research over the next few years. AI creating AI.", "Follow me on twitter where I post all about the latest and greatest AI, Technology, and Science!
