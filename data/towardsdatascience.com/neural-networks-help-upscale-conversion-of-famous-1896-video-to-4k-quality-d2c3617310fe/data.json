They are already allowing scientists to reconstruct human thoughts from brain waves in real time and many other things.", "In 1896, the Lumi\u00e8re brothers\u2019 film \u201cThe arrival of a train at La Ciotat station\u201d, lasting 50 seconds, aroused the emotion of spectators and consecrated the first steps in cinema. It remains an emblematic symbol of the work of the Lumi\u00e8re brothers and more generally of the beginnings of the 7th art.", "Recently, a man named Denis Shiryaev used Neural Networks to scale the 1896 film to 4K resolution using Topaz Labs\u2019 commercial Gigapixel AI and DAIN image editing applications. He not only increased the footage to 4K, but also increased the frame rate to 60 frames per second.", "Shiryaev used Gigapixel AI to render the 50-second mute short film \u201cThe Arrival of a Train at La Ciotat Station\u201d from 1896 in 4K format with very realistic images. The original film has very blurred quality and very low resolution. After publishing his work, the result obtained were surprising. His new video seems very well to meet the video standards of the 21st century.", "Despite some imperfections, such as image jumps or blurring of certain details, the fruit of this experience is simply impressive . To complete his work, Shiryaev also added sound to this silent film.", "These images were obtained thanks to a form of artificial neural networks: Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs. This technique has been popularized in recent months, in particular by the emergence of the famous Kaggle competition \u201cDeepFake Detection Challenge\u201d and artistic creations generated by AI.", "As a reminder, the GAN method consists in opposing two neural networks . The first generates an object based on data on which it was trained, while the second has the role of determining the authenticity of the object. The first network tries again and again, until its product is perfect enough to deceive the second. In this way, the program learns itself to generate the most likely image possible.", "Gigapixel AI software uses a proprietary interpolation algorithm which analyzes the image, recognizes details and structures and completes the image. It can make images sharper and clearer, even after they have been enlarged by 600%.", "DAIN (Depth-Aware Video Frame Interpolation), on the other hand, imagines and inserts frames between the keyframes of an existing video clip. In other words, DAIN analyzes and maps video clips, then inserts the fill images generated between the existing images. It\u2019s the same concept as the motion smoothing function of 4K TVs. To achieve the same result in this 1896 video, Shiryaev added enough images to increase the rate to 60 FPS. The DAIN therefore automatically generated then added 36 additional images per second in addition to the 24 images originally recorded.", "The improved version of Shiryaev\u2019s \u201cArrival of a train at La Ciotat station\u201d looks like a recent film made using a smartphone or GoPro. The comparison with the original video is quite amazing, especially in the fluidity won in the new version. The reflections of the sun on the moving train and the women\u2019s jewelry on the platform are particularly well transcribed and constitute perhaps one of the most remarkable improvements.", "Neural networks can do the coloring, too, using the same basic technique: start with a bunch of color photos, convert them to black and white, and then train a neural network to reconstruct the color originals. Denis Shiryaev even had the task of adding colors to his improved version of the \u201cArrival of a train at La Ciotat station\u201d on the DeOldify Videos YouTube channel .", "However, people believe that Shiryaev\u2019s technique is very well thought out and very promising, since it could well inspire other people in love with silent cinema.", "The neural network algorithms are very powerful and are improved every year. The possibilities for use are very numerous and the television world may well be one of the biggest beneficiaries.", "\u201c Show the neural network a low-resolution image of a face and it will figure out that it\u2019s a face and fill in the right details for the subject\u2019s eyes, nose, and mouth.\u201d says Topaz Labs.", "Unfortunately, these useful technologies are sometimes used for malicious purposes, they can be used for example to make \u201cdeepfakes\u201d and allow identity theft in a video.", "So, there is cause for concern about the misuse that can be made of it, but technology can just as easily be a way of using AI to update old cinema and revolutionize the industry itself.", "Congratulations if you managed to get here.
