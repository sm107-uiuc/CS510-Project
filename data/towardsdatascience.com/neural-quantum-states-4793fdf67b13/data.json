Typical many-body systems are composed of a large number of strongly interacting particles. Few such systems are amenable to exact mathematical treatment and numerical techniques are needed to make progress. However, since the resources required to specify a generic many-body quantum state depend exponentially on the number of particles in the system (more precisely, on the number of degrees of freedom), even today\u2019s best supercomputers lack sufficient power to exactly encode such states (they can handle only relatively small systems, with less than ~45 particles).", "As we shall see, recent applications of machine learning techniques (artificial neural networks in particular) have been shown to provide highly efficient representations of such complex states, making their overwhelming complexity computationally tractable.", "In this article, I will discuss how to apply (a type of) artificial neural network to represent quantum states of many particles. The article will be divided into three parts:", "There is a fascinating story recounted by one of Albert Einstein\u2019s scientific collaborators, the Polish physicist Leopold Infeld, in his autobiography.", "According to Infeld, after the two physicists spent several months performing long and grueling calculations, Einstein would make the following remark:", "\u201cGod [Nature] does not care about our mathematical difficulties. He integrates empirically.\u201d", "What Einstein meant was that, while humans must resort to complex calculations and symbolic reasoning to solve complicated physics problems, Nature does not need to.", "Quick Note: Einstein used the term \u201cintegrate\u201d here because many physical theories are formulated using equations called \u201cdifferential equations\u201d and to find solutions of such equations one must apply the process of \u201cintegration\u201d.", "As noted in the introduction, a notoriously difficult problem in theoretical physics is the many-body problem. This problem has been investigated for a very long time in both classical systems (physical systems based on Newton\u2019s three laws of motion and its refinements) and quantum systems (systems based obeying quantum mechanical laws).", "The first (classical) many-body problem to be extensively studied was the 3-body problem involving the Earth, the Moon, and the Sun.", "One of the first scientists to attack this many-body problem was none other than Isaac Newton in his masterpiece, the Principia Mathematica:", "\u201cEach time a planet revolves it traces a fresh orbit [\u2026] and each orbit is dependent upon the combined motions of all the planets, not to mention their actions upon each other [\u2026]. Unless I am much mistaken, it would exceed the force of human wit to consider so many causes of motion at the same time, and to define the motions by exact laws which would allow of an easy calculation.\u201d", "Since essentially all relevant physical systems are composed by a collection of interacting particles, the many-body problem is extremely important.", "One can define the problem as \u201cthe study of the effects of interactions between bodies on the behavior of a many-body system \u201d.", "The meaning of \u201cmany\u201d in this context can be anywhere from three to infinity. In a recent paper, my colleagues and I showed that the signatures of quantum many-body behavior can be found already for N=5 spin excitations (figure below).", "In the present article, I will focus on the quantum many-body problem which has been my main topic of research since 2013.", "The complexity of quantum many-body systems was identified by physicists already in the 1930s. Around that time, the great physicist Paul Dirac envisioned two major problems in quantum mechanics.", "The first, according to him, was \u201cin connection with the exact fitting in of the theory with relativity ideas\u201d. The second was that \u201cthe exact application of these [quantum] laws leads to equations much too complicated to be soluble\u201d.

The QHO is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the classical harmonic oscillator (see the figure below), which is a system that experiences a force when displaced from its initial that restores it to its equilibrium position.", "The animation below compares the classical and quantum conceptions of a simple harmonic oscillator.", "While a simple oscillating mass in a well-defined trajectory represents the classical system (blocks A and B in the figure above), the corresponding quantum system is represented by a complex wave function. In each block (from C onwards) there are two curves: the blue one is the real part of \u03a8, and the red one is the imaginary part.", "In quantum mechanics, spin can be roughly understood as an \u201cintrinsic form of angular momentum\u201d that is carried by particles and nuclei. Though it is intuitive to think of spin as a rotation of a particle around its own axis this picture is not quite correct since then the particle would rotate at a faster than light speed which would violate fundamental physical principles. If fact spins are quantum mechanical objects without classical counterpart.", "Quantum spin systems are closely associated with the phenomena of magnetism. Magnets are made of atoms, which are often small magnets. When these atomic magnets become parallelly oriented they give origin to the macroscopic effect we are familiar with.", "I will now provide a quick summary of the basic components of machine learning algorithms in a way that will be helpful for the reader to understand their connections with quantum systems.", "Machine learning approaches have two basic components (Carleo, 2017):", "Artificial neural networks are usually non-linear multi-dimensional nested functions. Their internal workings are only heuristically understood and investigating their structure does not generate insights regarding the function being it approximates.", "Due to the absence of a clear-cut connection between the network parameters and the mathematical function which is being approximated, ANNs are often referred to as \u201cblack boxes\u201d.", "There are several types of ANNs but for our present purpose, I will focus on the specific case of Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBM).", "Restricted Boltzmann Machines are generative stochastic neural networks.

The new output from such operations is called \u201creconstruction\u201d because it is an approximation of the original input.", "Naturally, the reconstructions and the original inputs are very different at first (since the values of w are randomly initialized). However, as the error is repeatedly backpropagated against the ws, it is gradually minimized.", "Joining both conditional distributions, the joint probability distribution of x and a is obtained i.e. the RBM learns how to approximate the original data (the structure of the input).", "In a recent article published in Science magazine, it was proposed that one can treat the quantum wave function \u03a8(S) of a quantum many-body system as a black-box and then approximate it using an RBM. The RBM is trained to represent \u03a8(S) via the optimization of its parameters.", "The question is how to reformulate the (time-independent) Schrodinger equation, which is an eigenvalue problem, as a machine learning problem.", "As it turns out, the answer has been known for quite some time, and it is based on the so-called variational method, an alternative formulation of the wave equation that can be used to obtain the energies of a quantum system.

The absence of intralayer interactions, typical of the RBMs architecture allows hidden variables to be summer over (or traced out), considerably simplifying the expression above to:", "To train the quantum wave functions one follows a similar procedure as described above for RBMs (more details here).", "The figure below shows the negligible relative error of the NQS ground-state energy estimation. Each plot corresponds to a test case which is a system with known exact solutions. The horizontal axis is the hidden-unit density i.e. the ratio between the number of hidden and visible units.
