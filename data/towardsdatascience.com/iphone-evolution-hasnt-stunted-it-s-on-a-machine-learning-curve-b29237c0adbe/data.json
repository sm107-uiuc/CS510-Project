It\u2019s hard not to feel that way when earlier in the decade we used to get psyched about HD displays, the jump to 3G \u201cmobile-broadband\u201d, the addition of a front-facing camera, and smaller (and then, eventually, larger) phone sizes. These physical and tangible hardware features were visual signs of great technological progress. We grew accustomed to setting high expectations and having them surpassed.", "We lived for, what I like to call, the instant gratification features. And Apple (and their competition) know this in an era where those kind of features are few and thin. It\u2019s why we now get the annual presentation of increased pixel counts (that the average consumer eye can barely notice), an additional camera lens, and better battery life (amongst others).", "If you go to the iPhone 11 Pro Product page, three-quarters of the page is dedicated to showing off the camera and display enhancements. Nothing to sneeze at, but they\u2019ve become the usual suspects because of all the new features, those still get even a slight rise out of the average consumer.", "And let\u2019s face it. The biggest iPhone stir ups in recent years that were not one of those were the notch design and increased prices.", "On that same iPhone 11 Pro Product Page, three quarters down right after the camera and display marketing, is the info about the new A13 Bionic Chip. Apple is definitely excited about its next-generation chip and has never kept it a secret. But here\u2019s how I envision the average consumer views this section:", "Does it sound fancy? It has the word \u2018bionic\u2019 so yes. Does the techy looking graphic of \u2018A13\u2019 in the background look cool? Check. What does it mean for me as an average consumer? Faster, faster, cores, AR, faster\u2026. ooh, optimized battery life! And the next section is all about better battery life! Awesome, let\u2019s move on!", "That may be an over-characterization, but it\u2019s not far from reality. We all sit through that portion of the presentation, but I can\u2019t tell you how many times people watching with me (in tech, mind you!) start looking at their watch and say \u201cget to the good stuff already!\u201d.", "We expect the guts of our devices to improve year after year. That staple of technology was already set in the PC market. It doesn\u2019t help that the average consumer, understandably, doesn\u2019t fully know just how those improvements correlate to features that they do understand. Not being able to connect the dots, in my opinion, is why we\u2019ve almost become numb to just how much has improved over the years and how it influences just about every feature in our phones today.", "It\u2019s just like when an athlete spends the entire off-season training harder than ever with a new regimen that is demanding in almost every aspect of that player\u2019s being. The expectation was that they would train and so we don\u2019t appreciate any of their progress until we, the fans, see the proven results in action, in wins, and, of course, fantasy points.", "That\u2019s probably why most consumers just nodded through the introduction of the A-Series Bionic introduction just 2 years ago. It introduced a brand new optimized architecture for how iPhone did things. But not only that, it gave us a Neural Engine, a mobile powerhouse for machine learning and AI. It\u2019s the reason why Face-ID could be introduced at the same time (which means it also enabled the notch design).", "Here are some of the recognizable first-party achievements that have come out of the A-Series Bionic evolution:", "The industry is always looking for \u201cThe Next Big Thing\u201d. The iPhone, itself, was the catalyst for the smartphone and app revolution which changed everything in tech and made lots of money for those who jumped in. So what\u2019s next?", "Machine Learning is the standout. It\u2019s everywhere now, from Alexa, to IBM Watson, to Portrait-Mode on your phone. The potential applications are limitless and can reach across finance, medicine, architecture, and security.", "The ML industry is growing more rapidly today because the technology it works off of is more accessible, powerful, time-efficient, and affordable. The evolution took us from room-sized mainframe computers, to remote cloud machines over the web, and now having an entire Neural Engine built into a phone that fits in your pocket.", "For iOS and ML/Data Science developers, it is an exceptionally exciting time (or should be at least). Apple has made ML accessible to devs in two crucial ways. First, they provide developer kits and tools that streamline using ML in our apps (Core ML and Create ML being a few). The second is that they\u2019ve placed the hardware needed into the users' pockets. Before, developers either had to scale down their AI capability if it ran on mobile or they needed to eat the user's data to run the job on some remote server that they either pay to rent or to own and maintain and send back the results. Apple is essentially making the investment for developers to get into ML by bridging the gaps.", "That investment is going to pay off as more developers realize that even the smallest integration of ML could translate to incredibly new and enhanced features in their apps. And as third- and first-party apps integrate more and more ML capabilities, Apple can boast of a stronger and more robust App Store Catalog for its users. This could lead to even greater record-breaking profits and revenue for both developers and Apple\u2019s App Store.", "The future of new smartphone features has eyes on it like a hawk, which is a good and bad thing. While it pushes phone makers to try and come up with new innovations first, sometimes the end result can be gimmicky or incomplete (read: a certain folding phone).", "Consumers shouldn\u2019t take their attention away from that, but should also lend a great deal more of their attention on the progress being made under the hood and the value it brings to them. It would be silly of me to propose everyone learn about AI and ML, but at the same time, it\u2019s not even around the corner anymore. It\u2019s here and now.", "Your home for data science.
