This led to me putting off writing for months, discouraging me from starting my writing journey because I\u2019d \u201cnever had enough time\u201d.", "If you\u2019re thinking about getting started writing Data Science content on Medium, don\u2019t get discouraged. What you should realize is that the inherent nature of Data Science writing is different \u2014 there\u2019s groundwork that needs to be laid. This isn\u2019t our full-time job, and there are hundreds of hours of research and coding and design that need to be done before a single sentence can be written. It took me months of stalling and then a few articles that I eventually \u201cstumbled upon\u201d for me to finally figure this out.", "When I finally got around to writing, I forgot about all the advice and just wrote when I felt like it and when I had the time. In fact, my first article came to me during a client meeting where I was so fed up with being told to \u201cjust look at the data\u201d that I immediately got off the phone and wrote the whole thing in one giant sprint. It didn\u2019t take days of sitting down and writing at the same hour for the same amount of time \u2014 it just came to me.", "The same thing happened for my second article; I was researching some techniques for a side project and came across this algorithm and decided \u201cI\u2019m going to figure out what this thing does\u201d. I realized there wasn\u2019t a ton of information out there and saw the opportunity to write something that wasn\u2019t well documented for those that might need the information.", "My third article was a bit different \u2014 it didn\u2019t come internally but from conversations I was having with friends and family. During the early months of Coronavirus, I kept hearing two sides of the same argument over and over again: \u201cthe media is overreacting\u201d and \u201cwe\u2019re not taking this seriously enough\u201d. I thought \u201cwell which one is actually true?\u201d \u2014 \u201ccan I quantify just how much or how little the media is overreacting?\u201d. I set out to do just that. I gathered the data, did the analysis, and wrote the article \u2014 all in 1\u20132 weeks, which by the \u201cadvice\u201d standard, would have been too slow.", "And now this post \u2014 an article that I\u2019ve been thinking of writing for quite some time. If I had followed the advice of the typical \u201cHow to be Successful on Medium\u201d article, this post would have been written several weeks ago. But to be honest, I just didn\u2019t have the time. It took until today when I read another one of those articles and felt like I needed to say something from the perspective of someone writing Data Science content. I opened up a new draft and wrote this post in one sitting on my phone.", "The first few pieces I put together didn\u2019t come from a routine of sitting down every day at 6 am and writing for two hours straight. They came to me when I was working on projects and continuing my learning journey. As I continued to write, I began to realize that writing for Data Science is different in two ways:", "I hope this article didn\u2019t come off too sour. I hope instead it inspires you to not get discouraged by all of the \u201cadvice\u201d out there, telling you to do more. Most of those writers don\u2019t need to sit down and study the objective function of an algorithm or write 1000 lines of code in Jupyter. Get started when you want to get started, stay the course, and don\u2019t listen to the noise \u2014 the writing and the consistency will eventually follow.", "Thanks for reading!
