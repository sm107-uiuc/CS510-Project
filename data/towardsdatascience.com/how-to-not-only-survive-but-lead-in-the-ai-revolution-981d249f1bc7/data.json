It is fueled by data, and powered by today\u2019s AI practitioners. With great power comes great responsibility \u2014 not only for the generations coming after ours, but for the world around us today. To fuel a revolution that leads to a better world for all, we need to ensure that we infuse trust into AI.", "We\u2019ve all seen news stories about AI bots seeming to run rogue. Take for example Sophia, designed to be a conversational robot, who, when asked whether she\u2019d be willing to destroy humans, happily replied that she would. Or Tay, designed to be a 13-year old girl, learning from Twitter interactions, but very quickly her learnings led to her to posting hateful racist messages. And my personal favorite \u2014 Norman, the first psychopathic AI bot. Norman was designed by MIT Media Lab to show the impact of training data on AI behavior. They trained him on images from the dark side of the web \u2014 violent, disturbing images. Then, they tested his personality using the Rorschach inkblot test \u2014 they presented Norman with an image such as this one, and they asked Normal what he saw:", "When I look at this, I see Paris in springtime \u2014 an Eiffel tower surrounded by flowers. When \u201cstandard\u201d AI looked at this, it saw \u201ca close-up of a wedding cake on a table\u201d. But when Norman looked at this, he saw \u201cman killed by speeding driver\u201d.", "While these three characters \u2014 Sophia, Tay, and Norman \u2014 receive a lot of media attention, they are not truly dangerous. Sophia\u2019s question was posed by her creator and he could easily fix her training and programming to get a different response. Tay could quickly be shut down after her very public display of deviant behavior. And Norman, well, he is actually a good guy \u2014 teaching the world about the importance of accurate and unbiased data for AI applications.", "The real dangers of AI are often hidden.", "They are inside the applications affecting our lives every day, from our healthcare to our finances. The applications we use to see who we should befriend on social networks, and to receive recommendation on news stories we should be reading. The applications that decide the content shown to our children on social media.", "The real dangers of AI often start with good intentions.", "For example, Amazon\u2019s resume review tool, which was intended to help reviewers shortlist resumes, was shown to be biased against women. All because it was trained to make recommendations based on resumes submitted during the past 10 years \u2014 predominantly from men. Another example is mortgage lending algorithms, found to be biased against African American and Latino applicants. This was not intentional \u2014 these algorithms did not explicitly look at ethnicity or race when making mortgage offers. Instead, they looked at whether applicants were shopping around for better rates, and gave better offers to those who were. It turned out that the African American and Latino community were less likely to shop around, leading to a racial bias hidden underneath competition-based pricing. Today, the internet is littered with such stories, from apps that decide whether people in prison are likely to reoffend (and shown to have racial bias), to AI used to decide whether children are at risk of harm.", "Given these stories that lead to distrust in AI, what could AI practitioners do to ensure that AI systems are trusted, so as to accelerate the real benefits of AI to the real world?", "To start, we need to build AI that can explain itself to non-experts. With explainable AI, humans can more quickly detect deviant or biased AI outcomes. We also need to build and use AI that can automatically detect bias in data and models, and automatically fix bias. For AI to inspire trust, it needs to be fair and explainable, but also secure against malicious attacks, and traceable \u2014 we need to know where the data came from, and how it is being used. Daniel Kahneman showed how very biased all of us humans are in making decisions. He stated that", "\u201ca reliable way of making people believe in falsehoods is frequent repetition, because familiarity is not easily distinguished from truth.\u201d", "The same is true for AI \u2014 we can easily trick AI into believing something by feeding it with biased or false data.", "The AI theme of fairness and bias is born from the human world. Why is it that so many AI applications today are discovered to be biased? Often, it is because we have for decades been inserting our biased human decision-making into our databases, and those data are now being used to train AI models. Returning to the example of the Amazon biased resume review app: this app was only biased, because predominantly male resumes were submitted, which were reviewed and selected by predominantly male reviewers. The app didn\u2019t have a chance to learn what a good female resume looked like. Consider how different this outcome would\u2019ve been if 50% of the \u201cgood\u201d resumes were from women, and 50% of the human reviewers that selected \u201cgood\u201d resumes were women. Part of fixing bias in data, is therefore to build diverse human teams that reduce the bias in human decisions, and that in turn reduce the bias in data sets used to train AI.", "To lead in the AI Revolution requires trusted AI. That means AI that is fair, unbiased, explainable, secure to malicious attacks, and traceable. To infuse trust in your AI applications, leverage tools to detect and fix bias, and build governance, security, and lineage into your applications. Also build Data Science & AI teams that are diverse not only in terms of gender and ethnicity, but also in terms of thought.", "What will you do to infuse trust in your AI applications?", "Your home for data science.
