We filter out the top five states being affected as of April 10, 2020 (by rates per 100,000 people), as well as Washington and California, given their early case numbers.", "Let\u2019s see what we\u2019re putting together!", "We\u2019ll begin our analysis by loading in the libraries we\u2019ll need for our analysis and generating some dataframes to store our data:", "Let\u2019s break down our code in a little bit more detail:", "In Section 1, we import several libraries. We use Pandas to hold data in dataframes as well as for generating basic plots. We use matplotlib to generate the actual graphs. We use glob to grab filenames later on to create our GIF. Finally, we use moviepy to generate our GIF.", "If you don\u2019t have these libraries installed, you can use pip to install them. Matplotlib comes installed by default, so we\u2019re not including it in the list below:", "In Section 2, we generate two dataframes. We pull data from this NY Times GitHub which collects data on COVID-19 cases by state into a dataframe named df. We also pull state population data from the census website.", "Finally, in Section 3, we merge in the data from the population dataframe into our main dataframe, df. If you want to learn more about this, check out this tutorial.", "We also generate a rate of COVID-19 cases per 100,000 people by dividing the number of cases by the state\u2019s population and multiplying by 100,000. This is assigned to a variable called rate. This is similar to our other article on beautifully visualizing COVID-19 data with Matplotlib:", "Our data now includes data on all states. This would create a very messy visualization. As such, we\u2019ll want to limit our analysis to a smaller, more manageable number of states. We\u2019ll pull the states with the highest per capita rate on April 10, 2020. We\u2019ll also add in Washinton and California as they had early numbers of high cases:", "In Section 4, we generate a list of the states we\u2019re interested in graphing. We create a new dataframe that contains only yesterday\u2019s data. We then generated a list of the states that have the highest per capita rate on that date (by sorting the list descendingly and selecting only the top five). Finally, we append Washington and California.", "Then, in Section 5, we limit our original dataframe df to include only the states identified. We limit our data range to only include data from March 1, 2020, onward (as cases were extremely low/under reported before that date). Finally, we pivot our dataset to make it ready to be graphed.", "In Section 6, we reset the index from a multi-index dataframe to allow for graphing. We reset the index and remove the date column. This might seem a bit controversial, but I found it easier to visualize showing the data as \u201c# of days from March 1, 2020\u201d, especially given the motion we want to include in the data.", "We have now prepared our data for graphing. The code below iterates to create many png images that we\u2019ll stitch together to create our GIF:", "In Section 7, we accomplish several things:", "Now we\u2019re at the exciting bit! You\u2019ve now created a folder full of PNGs and we\u2019re just about to turn them into a GIF.", "In Section 8 we do two main things:", "Let\u2019s check out our final work and take a moment to pack ourselves on our backs. In just a short amount of time, we\u2019ve created a beautiful animation that very easily shows the eery and humbling spread of COVID-19.", "Thanks so much for reading this article! In this post, we learned how to merge to dataframes together, create multiple visualizations with a for-loop, and turn that visualization into a GIF.", "I hoped you learned something new and found some creative ways to show off your data!", "Your home for data science.
