It tells us the average age of death in a population. Estimates suggest that in a pre-modern and poor world, life expectancy was 30 years in all areas of the world. Since 1900 the global average life expectancy has more than doubled and is now above 70 years. The inequality of life expectancy is still very large across countries. More recently the country with the lowest life expectancy is the Central African Republic at 53 years while in Japan life expectancy is 30 years greater.", "The intent of this project was to get a better understanding of the relationship between various public health factors and global life expectancy. How can countries better allocate their limited resources to improve overall life expectancy for their population? To answer this question multivariate linear regression models were created and then evaluated to determine the best fit. Github Link", "The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries. The final dataset contains 2939 observations where each row represents a country for a specific year. There are a total of 193 countries with data from years 2000 to 2015. The features include immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors.", "Initially for the baseline model, literature review and domain knowledge were used to select which predictors could have the greatest influence on life expectancy. Additionally, 4 more features were created that could effect life expectancy and better explain the data.", "Various Python libraries such as Pandas to clean and explore the data were used. Numpy, Scipy, and Sklearn for data analysis, descriptive statistics and modeling were also used.", "First, all the fragmented observations from the dataset were removed. In order to see if the data met the linearity model assumption scatter plots were generated for each predictor with the target variable and assessed. When necessary, to meet model assumptions certain features were transformed to achieve a more linear relationship and normal distribution.", "Next, the multicollinearity model assumption was assessed between the selected predictors by creating a correlation heat-map. A multicollinearity threshold was assigned at 0.8 and variables above the threshold were cut off.", "After that, all possible cases of outliers were assessed by looking at box-whisker plots and scatter plots. Extreme observations that were skewing the data were removed.", "The first model to predict life expectancy used the features; BMI, HIV, thinness 1\u201319, GDP, mortality ratio, lifestyle, education, infant mortality rate, economy, and population size. With the R squared equal to 0.804. In other words, the initial model explains 80% of variation in life expectancy (when compared to the mean line).", "Another model was built in which the data was scaled and insignificant predictors (p-value > .05) from the baseline model were removed. Since various features have different units of measurement and the data has been transformed to meet model assumptions, scaling the data allows results to be more comparable and interpretable.", "To test the model for another linear regression model assumption, the distribution of residuals for homoscedasticity was evaluated. The residuals although scattered did suggest a minor positive linear relationship. This heteroscedasticity is likely to due predictor variable distribution being skewed or there might be missing features that the dataset does not have information on.", "A train test split test using 80% of the data to to train the model and the remaining 20% for model prediction was also used to evaluate the model. The model\u2019s mean absolute error was 3.02. Another train test split was conducted which included all of the features, even the ones that were considered insignificant, and the mean absolute error slightly improved to 2.99.", "A suggestion for countries looking to increase their global life expectancy is to focus their resources mainly on program and policies that increase HIV awareness and prevention. It\u2019s interesting to see that although the research and maintenance of HIV have increased, it is still a major burden in developing nations.", "Additionally, another suggestion would be for countries to develop more policies and allocate more resources that increase access to education. The results raise another question: Are certain countries not giving priority to education or do they not have enough resources to provide more education? Are these countries too focused on survival to the point that more education is secondary?", "A possible next step would be to separate \u2018developing\u2019 and \u2018established\u2019 countries as the public health factors affecting each type may be very different. Developing nations still lack fundamental resources while established nations may have completely different issues such as cardiovascular disease and cancer (more data!).", "Here\u2019s a link to the Github repository which includes the code and further explains the steps I took for this project.
