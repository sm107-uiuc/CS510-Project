This means that instead of storing the traditional tables and rows of data in a data frame, it stores JSON/dictionary-like objects. This makes it very powerful and flexible as you can store documents within documents and your documents do not need to have a fixed/consistent format.", "MongoDB provides us with very powerful query languages. In my opinion, it is as simple as MYSQL where the queries are very intuitive. What\u2019s more, is that MongoDB comes with a free tier cloud storage for all of us.", "The aim of this article is not to explain every single method provided by MongoDB.

In the free tier, we have 3 nodes. This means that your data is replicated 3 times on 3 different nodes. Whenever the primary node fails, another one of the 2 nodes will step up to be the primary node to provide you with the data. This is also known as fault-tolerance, wherein the case of a node failure, your data will not disappear.", "You can interact with the data using both Compass and PyMongo. Compass is a GUI and PyMongo is a library/framework that allows you to work on MongoDB with Python syntax.", "Congratulations! You have now successfully set up your MongoDB cluster, imported data and is now able to view your data using Compass. In the second part of this article, I will dive into the basics of the CRUD operation with PyMongo. Essentially, you will learn how to insert, read, manipulate and remove data in your database.
