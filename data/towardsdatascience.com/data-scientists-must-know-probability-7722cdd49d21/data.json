Often there can be a lot of different answers because the data represents our users and not all users are the same. Therefore, answers are not always straightforward. Probability helps me measure how confident I can be in my answer or my machine learning model. Probability is in the heart of many machine learning models and evaluation techniques, so in order to be a good data scientist, you must know how probability works. In this article, I want to help readers\u2019 cover a real world example of how to apply conditional probability and Bayes\u2019 theorem formula.", "Probability helps me measure how confident I can be in my answer.", "I believe Bayes\u2019 theorem is one of the most commonly used terms and concepts when it comes to probability. If you want to learn the basics of probability, I recommend you check out the resources I mentioned at the bottom of the article.", "Before diving straight in to our example, to define the probability of a specific \u201cevent\u201d, we write something like this:", "Here is one of the most commonly used example:", "In this article, I will be using an example from a question I got as a data scientist at my job.", "Q\u201cIf a user in the mobile browser favorited a site, what\u2019s the probability of the user coming back next week?\u201d", "Let\u2019s assign some random probability % to these variables.", "Note: Numbers are made up for this example.", "If there are two events, you want to make sure the events are independent or dependent. In the example above, the two events are most likely dependent because the probability of coming back the next week P(w) will most likely be affected if a user were to favorite a site on their browser P(f). This effect can be negative or positive.", "The example I covered before also touches on conditional probability. The probability of coming back in one week given that the user favorited a site, P(w|f).", "If the two events were independent, the definition of P(w|f) would be:", "However, as I said, the two events are most likely dependent. Therefore, the definition that makes more sense is:", "Using the % I previously provided, you can plug them into the formula to get the answer for what\u2019s the probability a user will come back after one week given that a user favorited a site.", "If a user favorites a website, it seems like they are more likely to come back. The likelihood (50%/40% = 125%) is key here, and this will help you understand whether the condition will increase the probability or not.", "All right, now that I know this. I\u2019m going to create a model that predicts whether or not a user will be back based on what the user does their first week. I tested my model and it is 85% accurate, which means it will produce a correct prediction 85% of the time (This is sometimes called recall). In my test results, I have a sample of 10,000 users and I know that 6,000 of those users came back after one week. If my model predicts that a user will come back within a week, what is the probability that the user will actually come back after one week?", "Take some time to think about this\u2026", "If you thought the answer is 85% then, I don\u2019t blame you. That seems like the most intuitive answer. However, I want to use a visual to help you understand why this answer is not exactly", "Looking at the visualization, there is also a chance a user could be predicted to come back even though they will actually not come back (This can be what you called \u201cFalse Positive\u201d). Accounting for the false positives, the calculation will look like this.", "Therefore, the probability that a user who is predicted to come back in one week actually coming back after a week is 89.5% (5,100/5,700 = 89.47%). The answer is close here to what our intuitions said previously, but this is not the case for all use cases. When the population is imbalanced, accuracy is not a good evaluation metric. Fortunately, in our example, the balance of users who come back vs. users who don\u2019t come back in the sample of 10,000 users were fairly balanced 60/40.", "I hope I was able to help you teach and show you a little more about the importance of probability. I recommend all aspiring data scientists to go out and learn more", "Your home for data science.
