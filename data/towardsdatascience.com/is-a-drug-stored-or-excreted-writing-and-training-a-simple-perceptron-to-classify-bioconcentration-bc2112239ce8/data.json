In this post I\u2019ll briefly cover the similarities between artificial and biological neural networks, the theory behind how perceptrons work, and lastly how to implement the algorithm in python to train it on a bioconcentration data set.", "In animals, a neuron receives input from the synapses of other neurons at its dendrites. These tree like structures take the input signals and amalgamate them in the cell body, also known as a soma. Once the summation of signals happens in the soma, gated ion channels will open or remain closed depending on whether the signal breaches a threshold value \u2014 causing the neuron to fire along the axon or remain static. The neuron either fires or it doesn\u2019t.", "There are a few components in the image I put together above that we should go over to understand the model better:", "Input & bias: The dendrite of the biological neuron accepts input as neurotransmitters from connecting synapses. The counterpart in the perceptron model is the input (a feature used for the classification) multiplied by it\u2019s respective weight. The weights are values which change over time when training the model as they update in the \u201clearning\u201d phase when an error occurs during training. A bias is added as a special input to shift the decision boundary by translating points left or right. The summation equation below shows how the inputs, weights, and bias fit together.", "In the image below is a sigmoid curve and if we were to change the weights we could alter the steepness of the slope but to actually shift the curve left or right you would need to add a bias. Translating all the points in a certain direction using bias can increase accuracy by helping separate the hyperplane.", "Activation function: The summation of excitatory and inhibiting ions in the soma of a neuron results in an action potential. If the action potential is excitatory and breaches the threshold value \u2014 a signal is fired. In an artificial neuron the activation function calculates the net output of the summed inputs. The perceptron is effectively the model\u2019s decision maker and uses the heaviside function, which is also known as a step function, to calculate a predicted binary output. Below is the step function that is most commonly used:", "Output: The biological neuron propagates a signal down it\u2019s axon if the threshold is reached, this is it\u2019s output. A perceptron\u2019s output too fires on an all or nothing basis and results in a binary classification of either 1 or -1.", "Note: A more in depth article on this material can be found here.", "The following is a rundown of the steps taken by the algorithm to predict and then learn.", "Note: Another great article explaining why the algorithm works.", "Note: I\u2019ll be dissecting and explaining code examples from the book \u201cPython Machine Learning\u201d while mixing in code of my own. I\u2019ll be going over each line of code for our perceptron.", "The very first line of code will import numpy since we need to perform vector multiplication and draw on random numbers. We then create the perceptron class and initialize it and set parameter values for \u201cepochs\u201d, \u201clearning_rate\u201d, and randomState.", "Here we define the fit function which takes x and y arguments.", "The next chunk of code is a loop that falls within the fit function that we just defined. However, we\u2019ll look at it separately line-by-line due to its many parts.", "The last block of the perceptron code will define the summation and prediction functions.", "I chose not to go with the classic data sets like Fisher\u2019s iris data set and rather chose to find one relevant to the work I\u2019m currently doing. This led me to a bioconcentration data set hosted by the University of Milano-Bicocca and can be found here.", "The data only needs a bit of touching up and is otherwise ready to use. In the following block of code is what I did to make the data usable with the perceptron model. The original data comes with 3 different classifications: (1) is mainly stored within lipid tissues, (2) has additional storage sites (e.g. proteins), or (3) is metabolized/eliminated [1]. Since our model will work with two prediction classes we can drop the (2) class label.", "We can now create our training data set to train the perceptron learning model:", "Below is the complete block of code for our perceptron learning model", "This data set was chosen on a whim, and for a classifier to be as accurate as possible, the predictive features should be able to separate the groups along a plane. We could perform a PCA or another form of dimension reduction to figure out the most important features but that isn't the focus of this tutorial. The point is to see a if we can write and train a perceptron on a given set of classification data and how it performs on that data. The code block below plots the results for our training and looks at the number of updates over epochs \u2014 how much adjustment we have to perform over passes on the entire training data set.", "We see that although the number of updates oscillates, there is a general downward trend over iterations, that is to say, our perceptron algorithm is getting more accurate with each pass over the training data. We can\u2019t say that it will reach zero (as it would with a less complex data set such as Fisher\u2019s Iris) but we can say that our simple perceptron learning algorithm \u2014 from the 1960\u2019s \u2014 did indeed \u201clearn\u201d.", "[1] F.
