I\u2019m gonna walk you through a foundational task that you as data scientist/machine learning engineer must know how to perform because at some point of your career you\u2019ll be required to do so. In the context of this article, I\u2019ll assume you have a basic understanding of what I\u2019m going to talk in the next lines. I\u2019ll be stacking layers of concepts as I move forward, keeping a very low-level language \u2014 don\u2019t worry if you fell a little lost between lines, later I will probably clarify your doubts. The main idea is for you to understand what I\u2019ll be explaining. That being said, let\u2019s get hands-on (Btw, don\u2019t miss any detail and download the whole project from my repo.)", "I\u2019ll start by defining the first unusual term in the title: Sentiment Analysis is a very frequent term within text classification and is essentially to use natural language processing (quite often referred simply as NLP)+ machine learning to interpret and classify emotions in text information. Imagine the task of determining whether a product\u2019s review is positive or negative; you could do it yourself just by reading it, right? But what happens when the company you work for sells 2k products every single day? Are you pretending to read all the reviews and manually classify them? Let\u2019s be honest, your job would be the worst ever. There\u2019s where Sentiment Analysis comes in and makes your life and job easier.", "There are several ways to implement Sentiment Analysis and each data scientist has his/her own preferred method, I\u2019ll guide you through a very simple one so you can understand what it involves, but also suggest you some others that way you can research about them. Let\u2019s place first things first: If you are not familiar with Machine Learning, you must know all algorithms are only able to understand and process numeric data (particularly floating point data), thus you cannot feed them with text and wait for them to solve your problems; instead, you\u2019ll have to make several transformations to your data until it reaches a representative numeric shape. The common and most basic steps are:", "This is how a very basic text cleaning Python function would look like (this is a very simple way, you can implement the one that best works for your purpose \u2014 out there are very complete libraries such as Gensim or NLTK):", "Now a very simple way to remove repeating words from your dataset, following the idea that the shortest and longest ones are usually useless:", "Finally, a function to detokenize all sentences (this because I\u2019ll use word embeddings and not this old-fashioned tokenizing method):", "To run everything in the right order, you just need to run this:", "At this point, you will have transformed your noisy text dataset into a very flat and simple one. In this particular case, you\u2019ll have gone from this:", "If you want to go even beyond, then take the stemming or lemmatizing paths, you\u2019ll get much better results. In this particular how-to, will keep it this way just you to get that it\u2019s totally possible to achieve great results skipping that step (if you\u2019re building your model in a business context then you\u2019ll be 100% in obligation to do so, don\u2019t skip it!)", "Alright, it\u2019s time to understand an extremely important step you\u2019ll have to deal with when working with text data. Once you have your text data completely clean of noise, it\u2019s time to transform it into floating-point tensors. In order to perform this task, we\u2019ll use word-embeddings.", "Word embeddings (or sometimes called word vectors) are learned from data and essentially are low-dimensional floating-point vectors (dense vectors, as opposed to sparse vectors obtained from processes such as one-hot-encoding) that pack information in few dimensions. Why would you use this method and not any other different and more simple? Because deep learning models converge easier with dense vectors than with sparse ones. Again, it always depends on the dataset nature and the business need.", "There are two ways to obtain word embeddings:", "Before moving forward, we need to take a previous step. We need to transform our array of text into 2D numeric arrays:", "The output you\u2019ll get would look like this:", "What does the previous step mean? Let\u2019s take the definition from the official Keras documentation, you\u2019ll get better the point:", "This function transforms a list (of length num_samples) of sequences (lists of integers) into a 2D Numpy array of shape (num_samples, num_timesteps). num_timesteps is either the maxlen argument if provided, or the length of the longest sequence in the list.", "Sequences that are shorter than num_timesteps are padded with value until they are num_timesteps long.", "Sequences longer than num_timesteps are truncated so that they fit the desired length", "It\u2019s extremely important you to keep in mind that no matter if you use TensorFlow or any other Astraction API such as Keras, you should get the same result at the end of your training. In this opportunity we\u2019ll use Keras for obvious reasons: It\u2019s extremely easy to implement. This is how you create an embedding layer:", "The above layer takes 2D integer tensors of shape (samples, sequence_length) and at least two arguments: the number of possible tokens and the dimensionality of the embeddings (here 1000 and 64, respectively). To be more figurative, just imagine the embedding layer is a dictionary that links integer indices to dense vectors. Finally, it returns a 3D floating-point tensor of shape (samples, sequence_length, embedding_dimensionality) that can now be processed by our neural network. Let\u2019s talk about that topic, particularly about Recurrent Neural Networks that are the best when processing text-related sequences is required.", "Usually other types of neural networks out there such as densely connected networks or convolutional networks have no memory, this means that every single input is processed independently with no relation with the other ones. This is the opposite of what you normally would do when reading a paragraph: when you\u2019re reading you keep in memory what you\u2019ve read in the previous lines , right? You have a sense of the whole meaning and this is exactly the same principle that RNNs adopt. They process sequences by iterating along the sequence elements and keeping information relative to what it has processed so far. The math that is under a RNN\u2019s hood is, to be honest, a topic that you should cover by yourself in order to understand its logic. I suggest you to give a read to \u201cLearning TensorFlow\u201d by Tom Hope (available here) which explains all the process in a very easy manner.", "In this article, I\u2019ll implement three RNN types: a single LSTM (long short-term memory) model, a Bidirectional LSTM and a very infrequent used Conv1D model. As a bonus, I show how to implement a SimpleRNN model but to be honest, it\u2019s not deployed in production anywhere because it\u2019s extremely simple.", "Coming back to our example, this is how the code would look like when implementing a single LSTM layer model with its respective embedding layer:", "There are a few things to highlight in the code above: when implementing a Keras Sequential model, it\u2019s all about stacking layers. LSTM layers (as well as all other RNN layers) can take several arguments but the ones that I defined are 15 which is the number of hidden units within the layer (must be a positive integer and represents the dimensionality of the output space) and the dropout rate of the layer. Dropout is one of the most effective and most commonly used regularization techniques for NNs and consists of randomly turning off hidden units during training, that way the network does not rely 100% on all its neurons and instead, forces itself to find more meaningful patterns in the data in order to increase the metric you\u2019re trying to optimize. There are several other arguments to pass, you can find the complete documentation here, but for this particular example, these settings will achieve good results.", "FYI, sometimes it\u2019s useful to stack several recurrent layers one after the other in order to increase the representational power of a network. If you want to do so then you\u2019ll have to return full sequences of outputs. This is an example:", "In our LSTM example I\u2019m stacking a Dense layer with three output units that would be the 3 possible classes of our dataset. In order to make probabilistic outputs, it\u2019s always good to use \u2018softmax\u2019 as activation function in the final layer. Use the next table when building a neural network and you feel confused:", "When compiling the model, I\u2019m using RMSprop optimizer with its default learning rate but actually this is up to every developer. Some people love Adam, some others Adadelta, and so on. To be honest, RMSprop or Adam should be enough in most of the cases. If you don\u2019t know what an optimizer is, it\u2019s simply the mechanism that constantly computes the gradient of the loss and defines how to move against the loss function in order to find its global minima and therefore, find the best network\u2019s parameters (the model kernel and its bias\u2019 weights). As loss function, I use categorical_crossentropy (Check the table) that is typically used when you\u2019re dealing with multiclass classification tasks. In the other hand, you would use binary_crossentropy when binary classification is required.", "Finally, I\u2019m using checkpoints to save the best model achieved in the training process. This is very useful when you need to get the model that best satisfies the metric you\u2019re trying to optimize. Then the classic model.fit step and wait for it to complete the training iterations.", "This is the validation score achieved by this NN architecture at its last epoch:", "Let\u2019s compare this with a more complex network.", "This is how our example\u2019s BidRNN implementation looks like:", "Let\u2019s understand better how a bidirectional layer works. It maximizes the order sensitivity of the RNNs: essentially it consists of two RNNs (LSTMs or GRUs) that process the input sequence in one different direction to finally merge representations. By doing this, they\u2019re able to catch more complex patterns than a single RNN layer would catch. In other words, one of the layers interprets the sequences in chronological order and the second one do so in anti-chronological order, that\u2019s why Bidirectional RNNs are widely used, because they offer greater performance than regular RNNs.", "The way they are implemented is not complex, it is just one layer inside the other. If you read carefully, I\u2019m using almost the same parameters but achieved about .3% more of validation accuracy on its overall training:", "It\u2019s a very good number even when it\u2019s a very simple model and I wasn\u2019t focused on hyperparameter tuning. I\u2019m sure that if you dedicate yourself to adjust them then will get a very good result. Unfortunately, there\u2019s no magical formula to do so, it\u2019s all about adjusting its architecture and forcing it to learn every time more complex patterns and control its overfitting tendency with more regularization. One important thing to highlight is that if you see your model accuracy/loss stuck around certain value, it\u2019s likely because the learning rate is too small and therefore making your optimizer to get stuck around a local minima of the loss function; make the LR bigger or simply try another optimizer.", "It\u2019s time to try another type of architecture which even it\u2019s not the best for text classification, it\u2019s well known by achieving fantastic results when processing text datasets. Let\u2019s get into it.", "I hope you\u2019re still with me, because this is one of the fastest models out there when talking about convergence \u2014 it demands a cheaper computational cost. I know by prior experience that it tends to overfit extremely quick on small datasets. In this sense, just will implement it to show you how to do so in case it\u2019s of your interest and also give you an overview about how it works.", "It uses the same principles as classic 2D ConvNets used for image classification. Convolutional layers extract patches from 1D/2D tensors (depending on the type of task and layer) and apply the same convolutional transformations to every one of them (getting as output several subsequences). I won\u2019t get deep in such explanation because that\u2019s out of the scope of this article, but if you want to fully understand how these layers work I would suggest to you check the book previously recommended. The most important fact of these layers is that they can recognize patters in a sequence \u2014 A pattern learned at a certain position in a sentence can later be identified in a different position or even in another sentence.", "This is how 1D ConvNets are implemented:", "Where Conv1D layers are in charge of computing the convolution operations while MaxPooling1D layers\u2019 main task is to reduce the dimensionality of every convolutional output. Once the convolution operation is performed, the MaxPooling window extracts the highest value within it and outputs patches of maximum values. It\u2019s important to highlight the importance of regularizers in this type of configuration, otherwise your network will learn meaningless patterns and overfit extremely fast \u2014 just FYI.", "To contrast how the previous model performs, this is the metric achieved at the last epoch:", "And its best validation accuracy obtained was around 82%. It overfits very fast even when I\u2019ve implemented very drastic regularization.", "At this point, the best model so far has been the Bidirectional RNN. Please keep in mind that these metrics were obtained with little-to-zero hyperparameter tuning. To understand in a better way how well its predictions are, let\u2019s look at its confusion matrix:", "From the above\u2019s image, we can deduce: 81% of positive ratings were classified as positive, 80% of negative ratings were classified as negative and 91% of neutral ratings were classified as neutral. These are not the best predictions, but are a good baseline to work on even better models. In a business scenario you would need to be close to 95% in the most easy cases.", "If you want to test how it works on an input made by yourself, just compute the next lines:", "Alright, we\u2019ve reached the end of this post. I encourage you to implement all models by yourself and focus on hyperparameter tuning which is one of the tasks that takes longer. Once you\u2019ve reached a good number, I\u2019ll see you back here to guide you through that model\u2019s deployment \ud83d\ude0a.", "There are several ways to do such a task. You can use the Google Cloud Platform, take the Azure path, even the cheaper way of Heroku, but let\u2019s be honest: most of the biggest companies are adopting AWS as their main public cloud provider and these guys have a fantastic platform to build, train and deploy ML models: AWS SageMaker; which has tons of documentation out there. I\u2019ll be posting another step-by-step well-explained tutorial about how to easily deploy models on it. I hope to see you there!", "I prefer to scroll on Medium rather than on Instagram.
