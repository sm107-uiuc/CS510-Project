However, traditional ML models can be still be broadly categorized into solutions of two types of problems.", "One relatively less explored application of Machine Learning is the ordering of data by its relevance, which becomes useful in Information Retrieval systems like search engines. These types of models focus more on the relative ordering of items rather than the individual label (classification) or score (regression), and are categorized as Learning To Rank models.", "In 2005, Chris Burges et. al. at Microsoft Research introduced a novel approach to create Learning to Rank models. Their approach (which can be found here) employed a probabilistic cost function which uses a pair of sample items to learn how to rank them. This function essentially tries to minimize the number of swaps required to correct an incorrect ordering of chosen items. Their paper further explores this approach by implementing this cost function through a neural network, optimized by gradient descent. This network, called \u201cRankNet\u201d, is also tested on some real-world data to show its effectiveness.", "As implemented in the paper, the working of RankNet is summarized below.", "The assumption that is mentioned in step 3 is nothing but the determination of the expected ranks of the two selected items. This rank can be determined by comparing the relevance rating of a particular item with respect to the entire set. Moreover, this relevance rating can be determined by either manually setting the relevance based on some assumptions, or by using human raters to sort the results based on their relevance.", "Retrieving the ranking for a set", "Burges and his colleagues demonstrated the effectiveness of this approach with some artificial data. They employed two ranking functions, a random 2-layer neural network, as well as a random polynomial function. After running the data for 100 epochs on a 5000 feature vector input, they garnered results, as shown below.", "Further, this approach was tested on real-world data \u2014 search engine results for a given query. A major thing to note is that since this model does not perform traditional classification or regression, its accuracy has to be determined based on measures of ranking quality. The ranking accuracy measure for the real-world example was chosen to be \u201cNDCG\u201d (Normally Discounted Cumulative Gain), which is a popular method for evaluating the effectiveness of a particular ranked set. NDCG yields a result between 0 and 1, with 1 representing the most optimal ordering of the items. After training six different ranking functions (including two different implementations of RankNet), the following results were obtained on the test set, for the given query/document feature vectors of the search results.", "Thus, we see the Mean NDCG of RankNet (both One-layer and Two-layer) being significantly higher than other ranking functions.", "Burges and his colleagues further evolved the concept of RankNet into models with even lower training time as well as higher accuracy.", "During the training procedure of the original RankNet, it was found that the calculation of the cost itself is not required. Instead, the gradient of the cost is enough to determine the predicted ranking for the pair of items. This can be visualized as arrows indicating the direction of movement of the particular item.", "Further, they obtained even better results when they amplified this gradient by the change in NDCG that came as a result of swapping the documents. Thus, LambaRank proved to be faster to train, coupled with an increase in accuracy as well.", "In another revision, a gradient boosted tree version of LambaRank was introduced. This has proven to be even more accurate than the previous two models in experimental data sets.", "Thus we have seen some state-of-the-art Learning to Rank techniques, which are very useful when we want to order a set of items in an Information Retrieval System. So the question arises, what\u2019s stopping us from going out and implementing these models? The answer is simple \u2014 NOTHING!", "(For those who are interested, my own implementation of RankNet using Keras and TensorFlow can be found at https://github.com/devanshgoenka97/RankNet)", "Your home for data science.
