For me, a good starting place was always finding an interesting dataset that triggers my curiosity.", "Well, this article is about looking for datasets to inspire you. When you stumble across an intriguing dataset, with so much potential that sparks the creativity within you and you can\u2019t help but using to build something great.", "Wherever you are on your data science journey, just starting out, or trying to grow your skills and maybe build new ones, there is no better way to improve a skill then practice it. The more projects you build, the more fluent in data science you will get, and the better and more appealing your profile will become.", "In order to increase your data science skills and establish a good set of skills needed to build a strong profile, you need to tackle the 5 aspects of data science:", "In this article, I will present you with five options of datasets\u2014one for each of the 5 aspects of data science. I will talk a little bit about the construction of the dataset, the formate of it, and some possible ideas of how you can use it to build some fantastic projects.", "These datasets can be used for building projects on more than one aspect of data science. So, use your creativity and start building up your profile \u2014 or grow it.", "There's no better place to start than with the \u2014 arguably \u2014 most famous datasets collection of them all, the MNIST datasets. Here, we will talk about two MNIST datasets:", "The MNIST dataset is a collection of handwritten digits. The dataset has a training set of 60,000 images and a test set of 10,000 images that can be used for model evaluation. The digits in the dataset have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.", "This dataset is excellent for both beginners who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods, as well as intermediate data scientists wanting to test their models on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.", "The original format of this dataset might be a little confusing for absolute beginners; luckily, this dataset is also available in an easy to handle CSV format.", "Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images.

This dataset includes many features, such as 1.5 million object instances for 80 object categories, 330K of images, 91 stuff categories, and 5 captions per image.", "COCO has amazing documentation, and you can explore the dataset online using an explorer before you decide to download it.", "Starting a new project can be somewhat tricky, especially if you\u2019re just starting with data science. When I first started, I couldn\u2019t decide on a project, simply, because I didn\u2019t have enough knowledge to choose a project and a dataset.", "One of the things that helped me is, browsing datasets websites (e.g. Kaggle) and reading about different datasets and how can they be used. That gave me the inspiration I needed to kick start new projects. I still do that now.", "The only time I didn't need to explore and browse different datasets, is when I had a set project with a specific dataset. Which was the case if I were employed by a company or a client.", "As my knowledge base grew, I developed an eye for good datasets and how to see their potential. Data always tells a story, you just need to listen to it.", "So, I hope this article inspired you to build a new project or browse the web for exciting datasets that inspire you to build something awesome.", "Your home for data science.
