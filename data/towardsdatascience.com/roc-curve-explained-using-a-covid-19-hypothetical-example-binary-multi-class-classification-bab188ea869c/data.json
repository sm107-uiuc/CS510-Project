What does it tell us? Why everyone is using them? How is it connected to the confusion matrix? Continue reading and you will be able to answer all these questions.", "A receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) curve is a plot that shows the diagnostic ability of a binary classifier as its discrimination threshold is varied.", "Before I dig into the details, we need to understand that this discrimination threshold is not the same across different models but instead it is model-specific. For instance, if we have a Support Vector Machine (SVC) then this threshold is nothing more than the bias term of the decision boundary equation. By varying the bias in a SVM model, we actually just change the position of the decision boundary. Have a look at my previously published SVM article for more details about the SVM models.", "The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. The true-positive rate is also known as sensitivity, recall or probability of detection in machine learning. The false-positive rate is also known as the probability of false alarm and can be calculated as (1\u2212specificity). It tells us how well our model can distinguish the classes.", "A lot of terminology, right? Hold on a second, I will explain all these terms in the next section using an example that will make you always remember all these terms.", "If you want to learn Data Science by yourself with the support of interactive roadmaps and an active learning community have a look at this resource: https://aigents.co/learn", "Let\u2019s imagine that we have a COVID-19 test that is able within seconds to tell us if one individual is affected by the virus or not. So the output of the test can be either Positive (affected) or Negative (not affected) \u2014 we have a binary classification case.", "Let\u2019s also suppose that we know the ground truth and that we have 2 populations:", "So, as said before, we assume that we know the ground truth i.e. we really know who is sick and who is not.", "Next, we use our covid test and we define a threshold (let\u2019s say 20). If the test value if above the threshold then the denote this person as affected (positive, covid-affected). On the other hand, if test value if below the threshold we then denote this person as non-affected (negative, covid-free). So, based on the output of the test, we can denote a person as affected (positive, blue population) or not affected (negative, red population).", "To digest all these, have a look at the figure below.", "But there is a catch! Our test cannot be perfect!", "Some people will be wrongly miss-classified as positive (covid-affected, we call this False Positives (FP)) or negative (covid-free, we call this False Negatives (FN)).", "Now that we have understood the terms TP, TN, FP, FN let\u2019s look back again at the definition of the ROC curve.", "The ROC curve is created by plotting the true positive rate (TPR) against the false positive rate (FPR) at various threshold settings. In other words, the ROC curve shows the trade-off of TPR and FPR for different threshold settings of the underlying model.", "The AUC (area under the curve) indicates if the curve is above or below the diagonal (chance level). AUC ranges in value from 0 to 1. A model whose predictions are 100% wrong has an AUC of 0.0 and one whose predictions are 100% correct has an AUC of 1.0.", "Using all the above terms, we can also construct the famous confusion matrix that consists of these metrics and then we can compute the True Positive Rate and the False Positive Rate as shown in the figure below for a binary classification case.", "Having estimated the True Positive Rate and the False Positive Rate (using the formulas from the above table), we can now plot the ROC curve. But one moment!", "The True Positive Rate and the False Positive Rate are just 2 scalars. How can we really have a curve in the ROC plot?", "This is achieved by varying some threshold settings. The ROC curve shows the trade-off of TPR and FPR for different thresholds.", "For instance, in the case of a Support Vector Machine (SVC) this threshold is nothing more that the bias term in the decision boundary equation. So, we would vary this bias (this would change the position of the decision boundary) and estimate the FPR and TPR for the given values of the bias.", "To learn everything about SVMs have a look at this post.", "The ROC curve is only defined for binary classification problems. However, there is a way to integrate it into multi-class classification problems. To do so, if we have N classes then we will need to define several models.", "For example, if we have N=3 classes then we will need to define the following cases: case/model 1 for class 1 vs class 2, case/model 2 for class 1 vs class 2, and case/model 3 for class 1 vs class 3.", "Remember that in our Covid-19 test example, we had 2 possible outcomes i.e. affected by the virus (Positives) and not affected (Negatives). Similarly, in the multi-class cases, we again have to define the Positive and Negative outcomes.", "In the multi-class case, for each case the positive class is the second one:", "In other words, we can think of this as follows: We ask the classifier \u201cIs this sample Positive or Negative?\u201d and the classifier will predict the label (positive or negative). The ROC will be estimated for each case 1,2,3 independently.", "The same holds for the confusion matrix. We would have one Confusion Matrix for each case.", "Now, you should know everything about the ROC curve and the confusion matrix as well as you should be familiar with the terminology such as TP, TN, FP, FN, TPR, FPR. Let\u2019s now build a python working example.", "In a previous post, I explained what an SVC is so here we will use such a model.", "In the iris dataset, we have 3 classes of flowers and 4 features in total. So the classification problem is not a binary case anymore since we have 3 classes. However, the following code will estimate and plot the ROC curve for our multi-class classification problem.", "To this end, the model will be used for class 1 vs class 2, class 2 vs class 3 and class 1 vs class 3. So, we have 3 cases at the end and within each case, the bias will be varied in order to get the ROC curve of the given case \u2014 so, 3 ROC curves as output.", "Let\u2019s load the dataset, binarize the labels and split the data into training and test sets (to avoid ovefitting):", "Finally, we build our model (SVC) and we estimate the ROC curve for the 3 cases: class 1 vs class 2, class 2 vs class 3 and class 1 vs class 3.", "Each time the positive class is the second one i.e. for case 1: \u201cclass 1 vs class 2\u201d, the positive class is class 2, for case 2: \u201cclass 2 vs class 3\u201d, the positive class is class 3 etc.", "Reminder: The ROC curve shows the trade-off of TPR and FPR for different threshold settings of the underlying model. If the curve is above the diagonal, the model is good and above chance (chance is 50% for a binary case). If the curve is below the diagonal, the model is bad.", "The AUC (area under the curve) indicates if the curve is above or below the diagonal (chance level).", "Now let\u2019s also estimate the confusion matrix.", "Having the predicted y_predand the ground truth labels y_test, estimate the confusion matrix:", "We can see that we can really predict the labels/class of all 3 groups (values mostly on the diagonal meaning high True Positive (TP) rates).", "Reminder: The confusion matrix shows you the TN, TP, FN, FP. Values on the diagonal is the counting of TP so the higher these values the better the predictive ability of the model.", "That\u2019s all folks!
