Indeed, facts show that we live in times when we can see:", "For instance, is the Eiffel Tower taller than the US Capitol? The answer cannot be found completely automatically on Google, because no existing web page discusses this explicitly, although the individual pieces of the answer are available.", "This is due to the difficulties of machine learning:", "There are some things that machine learning can do over human-generated text (spanning from social media to Shakespeare plots, like Romeo and Juliet) for understanding questions and answers, by using different limited logics: from propositional logic to full first order logic. But the amount of questions that a human can formulate and that we can respond are extremely limited (still nowadays) with respect to the questions that any human casually reading a text or watching a plot performance or movie can answer. And above all, there is a dangling question that AI can hardly respond: why?", "Most of the time, First order logic is not fast enough to compute (leaving alone Second or higher order logics).", "The idea proposed by Doug consists of splitting the two important ingredients in reasoning, to cope with the tradeoff between expressivity and efficiency:", "By separating the two, you can use extremely efficient languages for the heuristic part, while reserving very powerful (and less efficient) languages for the epistemological part. Therefore we have two languages in the game: the heuristic level language (HL) and the epistemological level language (EL).", "The other interesting contribution to reasoning is context: context should be a first class citizen in the knowledge process, because knowledge may be different in different contexts.", "The system is able to use ABDUCTION (or abductive reasoning) in contrast to DEDUCTION for proposing likely possibilities in answers, such as why something happens in a story.", "This connects to the history of Doug and of Cycorp. Back in the Seventies, a team of friends in Stanford was struggling with AI concepts. They decided to join logics, AI and experts systems, and worked on workarounds and engineering solutions over the EL-HL split.", "The work was mostly to educate systems by teaching them facts and logical rules, and then engineer the inference approaches, with a project spanning 3 decades and budgeting more than 200 MLN $, being able to build knowledge assets that feature hundred of millions of assertions.", "In practice, this includes these options:", "But the actual value of combining AI and KB is really broader.", "One of the main long-terms disruptive impacts of this contribution is to enable the possibility to move analysis power from correlation to causation. This may bring a totally new flavour to the entire field.", "This story is inspired by a talk by Doug Lenat, CEO of Cycorp, Inc. and AAAI Fellow, at the AAAI Spring Symposium at Stanford University during the AAAI-Make session.", "Your home for data science.
