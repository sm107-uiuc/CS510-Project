Lists are mutable or changeable and ordered sequence of elements. To know more about Python Lists you can visit the official Python Lists documentation. One thing you have to keep in mind is that often we must declare lists using [ ] brackets. The elements inside the [ ] are the values of the list. For example:", "Here the name of the list is \u201clist\u201d and the list values are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5. The advantages of lists are the values inside the lists need not be of the same type meaning:", "In order to check the variable if it is a list or not, use the \u201ctype\u201d method as follows:", "Let us create a list called \u201cname\u201d and then insert some values, later we can then access the elements inside the list using the index with the help of [ ] by placing the index values inside it. We can then calculate the length of the list by using the len ( ) method, just pass the name of the list as an argument to the len( ) method, finally we can also get the length of the individual elements inside the list by using the same len ( ) method but this time we should specify the index position as an argument.", "Assignment with a \u201c=\u201d on lists does not make a copy. Instead, the assignment makes the two variables point to the one list in the memory. Sometimes an assignment operator can be used to copy from one list to the other.", "Usually appending two lists can be done by using append( ) method, but appending can also be done by using a \u2018+\u2019 (here + doesn't mean addition) whereas + can be used to add or merge two lists into a single list as shown below.", "In Python the \u201cfor\u201d and \u201cin\u201d are called constructs, these constructs are easy to use, they are used whenever you need to iterate over a list.", "The \u201cif \u201c and \u201cin\u201d construct on its own is an easy way to test if an element appears in a list (or other collection), it tests if the value is in the collection, returning True/False. This also works for the string, characters in Python.", "The Range function in Python is used as a boundary in the looping constructs, the range function starts from 0 to n-1, it doesn't include the last number as shown below.", "Python has a standard while-loop which works similar to the For loop, first you have to initialize, then insert a condition and finally increment.", "Below are some of the most common list methods shown with an example.", "The list.append( ) just appends an element to the list but never returns anything, it just appends the element to the existing list.", "List.insert( ) operation is used to insert the elements inside a list with a specified index position.", "The extend method adds the elements to the end of the new list. It is similar to append but you have to pass the list as an argument whereas in append it's not necessarily true.", "The index operation in list searches the element in the list and then returns the index of that element. If the element is not present in the list then the index method returns a value error telling that the element is not in the list.", "The Remove method in lists searches for the element and then on matching removes the element present in the list. Also throws an error when the element is not in the list.", "As the name suggests the sort method sort the elements in ascending order. This method doesn\u2019t return anything.", "As the name suggests the reverse method reverses the entire list. This method doesn\u2019t return anything.", "The Pop method removes and returns the element at the given index. Returns the rightmost element if the index is omitted (roughly the opposite of append( )).", "Slicing the list means cutting down the list elements, it and can also be used to change sub-parts of the list.", "This is the most important technique, often we need to convert the string to a list in our projects, this is an easy approach that does the job for us. This below example was referred from geeksforgeeks.com. Here we are using the split method from the strings where the split method just splits the elements from the string and then broadcasts into a list as shown below.", "Sometimes when you try to convert the string to a list, then you get an error as shown below, to solve this you just have to change the name of the list to something else, here in the above examples I have taken the name of the list as \u201clist\u201d so this often creates a name collision with the list method, so If you are using Google Colab or Jupyter notebook this error often shows up then you have to restart the kernel and run all the cells again. So the solution is just to change the name of the list and then restart the kernel if you get this error.", "Hence above are the very important techniques or methods of Lists in Python. Most of the examples were referred from Python Lists from Google. I have written this in a simple way such that everybody can understand and master the concepts of lists in Python.
