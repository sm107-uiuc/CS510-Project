Then we will use widely popular face detection and manipulation library face-recognition by Adam Geitgey. We will customize the images with different colors and border shapes around the detected faces\ud83d\udd75. It is built using dlib\u2019s state-of-the-art face recognition with deep learning. The model has an accuracy of 99.38% on the Labeled Faces in the Wild benchmark.", "TL;DR This tutorial is for absolute beginners, even if you are a fresh graduate or someone looking forward to starting machine learning using python.
