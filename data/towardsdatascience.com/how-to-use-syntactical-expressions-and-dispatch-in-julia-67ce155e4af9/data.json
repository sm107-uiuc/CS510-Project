All of these basic skills are finally out of the way \u2014 which means that you can get to actually practicing and learning the fun stuff! While you might certainly need some practice to get there, and it will be a lot of work and a commitment to learning for the rest of your life if you intend to take it seriously, you are well on your way to being a great Julian developer!", "While previously we weren\u2019t going over anything that is specific to the Julia language, today is the day that will change. This would be an ideal spot for someone who has programmed before \u2014 but not in Julia to pick up, actually. This means that pretty soon we will be working with real packages and solving real problems, which is going to make these tutorials a lot more useful and fun!", "Of course, it is going to be difficult to become a programmer just by watching a few videos. Fortunately, we will be re-using and repeatedly reviewing all of the skills that we have learned in these videos. It might seem like certain things are easy to gloss over if you aren\u2019t paying enough attention at a moment \u2014 but don\u2019t worry, you will get it!", "Syntactical expressions are a fantastic tool in Julia that makes writing new functions to perform arithmetic incredibly scientific and easy to do. Often we can use these expressions to condense code that might otherwise take up ten to twenty lines into just one or two. In most languages, you would approach writing a function to calculate the mean like this:", "In Julia, we can even do a small operation like this a lot faster:", "While saving two lines might not be incredibly life-changing, this next example is a much bigger compression of code!:", "This normalize function takes the mean and standard deviation and puts it into a formula in order to normalize the data. This in statistics talk is called the data\u2019s \u201c normal distribution.\u201d Four lines is certainly reasonable for a function that does this, however, using Julia we could condense this entire code block down into just a single line using dispatch. All we need to do is put our calculations into that one line for-loop and setup a syntactical expression to connect it to a method, like so:", "The only downside to using this over the latter is that now the mean and standard deviation are going to be calculated each time this loop is ran. That means that at every tick, the first thing the processor is moving data to do is calculate the mean and then subtract it from the current iteration. This is also a great example of a judgement call \u2014 when do you need to conserve performance, and how much performance is lost whenever we change the loop?", "Syntactical expressions are an incredibly useful tool when used well. Furthermore, they can allow you to dispatch types and use those dispatch functions as data \u2014 therefore making the paradigm flexible.", "Multiple dispatch is the biggest feature of the Julia programming language. It even says it right on the Julia website,", "\u201c Julia uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm.\u201d", "Julia\u2019s approach to the technical problem of polymorphism in this instance becomes a versatile tool that allows the language to work inside of whatever paradigm it wants. There is a lot of things that dispatch can actually be applied to. Dispatch can even go as far as creating objects with methods as children, making Julia suddenly turn into an object-oriented programming language.", "While we won\u2019t be tackling the issue of bending the paradigm to do whatever we want today, we will be looking into how dispatch can be used to better your life in its most basic form. These two functions might be able to both run with the same type, but let\u2019s just pretend that running string() to change the type of a string to a string would destroy our performance, or makes the computer explode, or something like that.", "So we have two functions, one will cause our computer to implode if we pass a string through it, and the other one will return an error if we try to pass a symbol through it. In most other applications, the only option one would have in this instance is to call these functions separately \u2014 or alternatively, if these were custom-objects we could use decorators. Regardless, Julia solves this issue in a great way. Using dispatch, we can create two lines of code that will identify which type is being used and then call the correct function for said type.", "Now we can print both types:", "The Julia programming language brings a lot of interesting methods of solving programming problems to a very high-level and elegant version of a solution. That is one of the great things about the language that is hard to admire if you haven\u2019t used many other programming languages before.", "Versatile is a good word to use.", "What is really exciting is just how far along this point in the tutorials is! You could officially add dispatch to the list of things that you have learned \u2014 or at least become familiar with from these tutorials! Thank you so much for reading, watching, and leaving feedback! In the next tutorial, we will be going back over what we have already done and also ADDING OUR FIRST MODULE!", "Your home for data science.
