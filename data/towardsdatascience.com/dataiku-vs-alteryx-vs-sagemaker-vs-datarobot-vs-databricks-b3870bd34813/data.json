Usually companies have to use different tools and services to manage a machine learning solution end-to-end, including:", "The goal of managed machine learning services is to centralize these components into a single packaged solution.", "But not all managed machine learning services are fully comparable. Tools like AWS Sagemaker help you manage the complexity inherent in any machine learning solution, but still expect you to have engineers on your team who can build and understand the code. These tools focus more on the compute layer. Tools like Alteryx focus more on the presentation layer, and they try to hide the complexity, providing no-code user interfaces to integrate basic machine learning.", "More generally, these platforms often incorporate the dashboarding tools and/or workflow orchestration tools that we\u2019ve compared in previous articles. So tools like Alteryx can be thought of as a higher level of abstraction, enabling more unification at the cost of flexibility compared to using the lower-level tools directly.", "We\u2019ve compared the most popular managed platforms to help you make an informed choice about which one is best for you.", "As always, \u201cit depends\u201d \u2014 but if you\u2019re looking for a quick answer, you should probably use:", "[Do you want more articles like this? Sign up to our weekly newsletter.]", "Before we get into a detailed comparison, here\u2019s a quick overview of each platform.", "We\u2019ve given approximate grades to each library based on several criteria:", "These are not rigorous or scientific benchmarks, but they\u2019re intended to give you a quick overview of how the tools overlap and how they differ. For more details, see the head-to-head comparisons below.", "Dataiku and Alteryx are both managed machine learning platforms, but Dataiku focuses on the engineering aspects, while Alteryx focuses on analytics and presentation.", "Dataiku provides Data Science Studio (DSS), a cross-platform desktop application that includes a notebook (similar to Jupyter Notebook) for engineers to write code and a workflow orchestration tool (similar to Apache Airflow) to manage data and tasks. While it provides some user interfaces, there\u2019s still an emphasis on writing code. By contrast, Alteryx provides a better dashboarding experience but less flexibility: In Alteryx you use the UI to create no-code machine learning components.", "Both Dataiku and Databricks aim to allow data scientists, engineers, and analysts to use a unified platform, but Dataiku relies on its own custom software, while Databricks integrates existing tools. Databricks acts as the glue between Apache Spark, AWS or Azure, and MLFlow, and provides a centralized interface to connect these.", "Dataiku is a higher-level tool, with integrations for machine learning libraries like Tensorflow and an AutoML interface that can do machine learning on data in a spreadsheet format.", "Datarobot and Dataiku both provide AutoML: a no-code machine learning platform where you can upload your data as spreadsheets, choose a target variable, and have the platform choose and optimize a machine learning model for you.", "It\u2019s important to note that this is Datarobot\u2019s core focus, but it\u2019s only one component of Dataiku, which also offers a full suite of data science tooling, including an IDE, a task orchestrator, and visualization tools.", "Dataiku focuses on providing coding and analytics tools for data scientists and engineers, while Sagemaker focuses on the underlying infrastructure: the servers that run and serve these models. Dataiku provides an integration to Sagemaker, but Sagemaker is also releasing tools that directly compete with Dataiku: Sagemaker Studio and Sagemaker Autopilot.", "You can either use these platforms in combination, using Dataiku to build and manage your models and Sagemaker to train and serve them, or you can use Sagemaker for everything.", "Alteryx is a broader solution that provides analytics, data management, and dashboarding components as well as no-code machine learning. Datarobot has a narrower focus on no-code machine learning.", "Alteryx and Knime are similar tools, and their capabilities largely overlap. Alteryx is more commercial, offering only a paid platform, while Knime also has a free, open-source option. Knime lacks some of Alteryx\u2019s polish, but it offers more flexibility.", "Sagemaker gives you a way to deploy and serve your machine learning models, using a variety of machine learning frameworks, on AWS infrastructure. Databricks lets you run Jupyter Notebooks on Apache Spark clusters (which may in turn run on AWS).", "Databricks focuses on big data analytics, letting you run your data processing code on compute clusters. Sagemaker focuses on experiment tracking and model deployment. Both tools let data scientists write code in a familiar Notebook environment and run it on scalable infrastructure.", "Sagemaker includes Sagemaker Autopilot, which is similar to Datarobot. Both tools let you upload a simple dataset in a spreadsheet format, select a target variable, and have the platform automatically run experiments and select the best machine learning model for your data.", "Because this so-called \u201cAutoML\u201d is Datarobot\u2019s core focus, Datarobot has curated and tuned a wider library of models than Sagemaker. So Sagemaker is still catching up to Datarobot in this specific use case, but overall Sagemaker is a more full-featured, flexible platform for model building, deployment, serving, and experiment tracking.", "If you visit any of these platforms\u2019 websites, you\u2019ll see they make sweeping claims about how powerful they are and how easy they are to use. Keep in mind that they all aim to solve very difficult problems, and onboarding onto any of them will likely be a long and expensive process with some hurdles to overcome.", "All of these tools and services aim to offer a shortcut to data processing, machine learning, and analytics. But this means they\u2019re also more restrictive than you might expect. If machine learning is core to your business, then building your own pipeline is often still the best option. There are many excellent, mature, open-source platforms that you can use to build a fully custom solution.", "These managed machine learning platforms sell the concept that non-technical people can build machine learning solutions without engineers. But in practice, it\u2019s often experienced machine learning engineers who use these tools and services most successfully. People with a deep understanding of the underlying systems and tradeoffs can use managed platforms as a shortcut to building proofs of concept; because they understand the process the tool is designed to simplify, they know how to use it effectively. But those without this experience often find that managed platforms are too limited to meet their exact requirements and still too complicated for non-technical team members to use easily.", "If you\u2019re working on machine learning problems and need help, reach out to us.", "Your home for data science.
