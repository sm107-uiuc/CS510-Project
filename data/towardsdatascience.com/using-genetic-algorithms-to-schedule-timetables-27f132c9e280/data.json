Hence, I thought of expanding that reply into an article so that it will be of more use to the readers. Let\u2019s get started.", "A genetic algorithm is a search heuristic that is inspired by Charles Darwin\u2019s theory of natural evolution. This algorithm reflects the process of natural selection where the fittest individuals are selected for reproduction in order to produce offspring of the next generation.", "If you want to know more about genetic algorithms, you can read my article Introduction to Genetic Algorithms \u2014 Including Example Code where I have explained every phase with examples.", "To summarise, the 5 main phases of a genetic algorithm are,", "The following figure denotes the flow chart of how a general genetic algorithm works.", "In timetabling, we have to allocate time for the activities we have planned and coordinate resources in an orderly way so that we can obtain our intended results without having to violate any constraints. For example, a school timetable would coordinate students, teachers, classrooms, subjects and time slots. An exam timetable would coordinate students, invigilators, subjects, exam halls and time slots. A public transport timetable would coordinate transport methods (buses, trains, etc.), routes, arrival times and departure times so that passengers can plan their trips.", "A very popular scenario where genetic algorithms can be applied is in the process of scheduling timetables.", "Consider you are trying to come up with a weekly timetable for classes in a college for different groups of students. We have to arrange classes and come up with a timetable so that there are no clashes between classes. Here, our task is to search for the optimum timetable schedule.", "An individual is characterized by a set of parameters (variables) known as genes. Genes are joined into a string to form a chromosome (solution). We model our solutions as chromosomes.", "In our example scenario, chromosomes will be different lecture sessions for students taking different modules. Consider that we have to coordinate student groups, modules, lecture halls, the days of the week and time. You can represent a lecture session as,", "You can encode the lecture session as a binary pattern to a chromosome.", "You can give binary values for each value in each entity. You can change the encoding pattern as you wish. Given below is an example way you can encode the lecture session.", "Get the list of modules and assign binary values.", "Get the list of student groups and give binary values.", "Similarly, you can come up with coding schemes for every entity in the lecture session.", "Given below is a sample encoding of a lecture session.", "Individual bits are called genes. This chromosome has 20 genes.", "Different student groups take different classes within a week. Hence, you have to come up with different class combinations and create the initial population. You can decide upon the size of the population (number of classes).", "You have to encode these classes into chromosomes as mentioned before.", "As an example, you can formulate the evaluation function as the inverse of the number of class conflicts for student groups. Lesser the number of conflicts, more fit the lecture session is. You can pick a suitable evaluation function as you wish.", "Now you can perform crossover and mutation operations to maximize the fitness value for each lecture session.", "You can terminate the process when the population has reached the maximum fitness value. In our example, that is when the lecture sessions have a minimum number of conflicts.", "The method I have described in this article is very basic so that you can get a general idea about how to model the timetabling problem. If you want to read more, you can read many research articles where new and improved methods have been proposed to solve the timetabling problem using genetic algorithms. Some articles which I came across are listed below.", "The genetic algorithm is not the only way we can solve the timetabling problem.
