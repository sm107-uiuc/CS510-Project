If X and Y are independent, then we expect X and Y to move in the same direction about as much as they move in opposite directions away from their means, meaning covariance should be 0. If the covariance is positive, this means roughly that X and Y co-vary more than they contra-vary, and vice versa if the covariance is negative.", "Covariance may seem a bit obtuse, perhaps arbitrary. You may recognize some of its mathematical properties such as bi-linearity and symmetry:", "But it may be hard to picture in your head exactly what it represents. But it turns out if you are familiar with linear algebra, there is a simple (and somewhat beautiful) geometric description of sample covariance. We\u2019ll get to this picture by a sequence of simple transformations.", "Step 0 (Background): We should establish our background. We start by collecting a sample with N observations, where each observation records the values of two continuous variables: X and Y. We label the value of variable X on observation i as X\u1d62, and the value of variable Y on observation i as Y\u1d62. To make it concrete, perhaps X\u1d62 is the height of the i-th person in your sample, and Y\u1d62 is the weight of the i-th person in your sample. We want to know: are these two variables related to each other in some way?", "Our example data might look like this:", "Plotted on twin axes, this data looks like this:", "Notice as we move from observation to observation, the orange and blue points seem to move together. This indicates a significant amount of covariance between height and weight in this data.", "Step 1(Adjustment): Subtract the observed mean value from each variable, and rescale by the square root of N-1 (one less than the number of observations):", "The reason for subtracting the mean is fairly straightforward: we only care about how X and Y are varying away from their means. Division by the square root N-1 is a bit more complicated, but we can think of it as a normalization step: we want the expected sum squared difference from the mean for each variable across our sample to not depend on how large our sample is. This normalization step allows us to more easily extract statistically relevant information and compare samples with differing number of observations. The reason for using N-1 instead of N is called Bessel\u2019s correction, and is necessary if we want the expect sum squared difference from the mean for each variable to be an \u201cunbiased estimator\u201d of the actual population variance for that variable.", "But you don\u2019t need to understand any of the previous paragraph to understand this transformation: we are just shifting and rescaling our original random variables, and the resulting adjusted variables X\u0303 and Y\u0303 both have mean 0.", "Step 2: Up until now we have been thinking of X and Y as properties or functions (i.e., height and weight act as functions assigning a real number to every person). But we can also think of X\u0303 and Y\u0303 as determining vectors x and y living in the N-1 dimensional vector space V defined by:", "Here the i-th coordinate of x (resp. y) is just the value of X\u0303 (resp. Y\u0303) for the i-th observation. The vector space V inherits an inner product from \u211d\u1d3a (the standard dot product), so V is not only a vector space, it is N-1 dimensional inner product space.", "Using the same data as above, we can make a plot of these two vectors x and y corresponding to \u2018adjusted height\u2019 and \u2018adjusted weight\u2019 for our N=3 observations:", "Step 3: Observe that the sample covariance of X and Y is exactly equal to the inner product (dot product) of the corresponding vectors x and y in V! That is:", "If this doesn\u2019t feel that geometric to you, recall that the dot product in linear algebra is intricately connected to the Euclidean notions of length and angle. First, the square root of the dot product of a vector with itself is just the length of that vector. Second, the dot product of two vectors is the product of their lengths times the cosine of the angle between them. In symbols:", "Combining this with definitions from statistics of \u201cstandard deviation\u201d and \u201ccorrelation\u201d, we obtain the following two identities:", "What does this mean? It means the standard deviation is nothing more than the length of the corresponding vector of observations (after adjustment), and correlation is just the angle between two such vectors of observations (after adjustment) is just the cosine of the angle between them!", "So these notions of standard deviation and correlation, which are usually derived from covariance, are really just fancy names for the length and (cosine of the) angle between two vectors of observations!
