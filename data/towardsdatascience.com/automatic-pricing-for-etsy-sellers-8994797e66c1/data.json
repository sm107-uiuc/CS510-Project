Many of these sellers are new to the website and may not be aware of the market or their competitors and pricing techniques for their products.", "I made a tool that gives a price estimate for sellers\u2019 products. This tool will provide a competitive price for the products and check whether the products are currently over or underpriced.", "Note: I used the price of the item in creating clusters. If it\u2019s an existing item, I used the listed price. For new sellers uploading new items, I ask them for an estimate price and the model will tell them whether it\u2019s an over or under-estimate.", "I collected data using the Etsy API. Etsy has over 60 Million products in its marketplace as of December 2018. To scale the scope of my project, I collected information on about 300k items from the \u2018Jewelry\u2019 section of the website.", "These products spanned across about 20 countries. I standardized the listing price of all to US Dollars. Other attributes collected from the products\u2019 webpage, are \u2014 material they\u2019re made of (gold, silver, pearl etc.), the taxonomy of the product (earring, necklace, engagement rings etc.), whether this product is vintage, made recently or custom made to order, and many more.", "I also collected some popularity metrics for the existing sellers\u2019 products, such as the number of favorites and views.", "1 Items are sold at the listing price \u2014 The sales data is kept private by Etsy so we assume that the products are actually sold at the price listed on the website.", "2 Price estimates for products that cost < $1000 \u2014 There are many rare, vintage products on Etsy. Vintage engagement rings with rare gemstones can cost up to $10k\u201320k!!I chose to provide the price estimate for the majority market and ignore the extremely expensive vintage items (~2% of products).", "3 Taxonomy is accurately represented \u2014 Sellers provide the \u201ctaxonomy\u201d or the category for their products. For example, Jewelry \u2192 Earrings \u2192 Dangle & Drop Earrings. This feature is used later in the model and it impacts the price estimation. Incorrect classification of these items would cause the price estimate to be way off.", "I want to provide a price estimate to the sellers whenever they upload a new product to their shop. To do so, first, I want to find \u201csimilar\u201d products (using k-prototypes algorithm for clustering products together). Then, I want to use this \u201ccluster\u201d label as a feature, along with other attributes, in a Linear Regression algorithm to predict the price of the item.", "Most of the features I used for clustering were categorical features. For example, \u201cmaterial\u201d has many values such as gold, silver, diamond, pearl, etc. Also, each product can have more than one material value.", "To cluster the jewelry items to find \u201csimilar\u201d ones, I used K-Prototypes algorithm. It\u2019s a variant of the more popular k-means algorithm.The significant difference between the two is the way they handle the categorical data.", "K-Prototypes uses k-means (Euclidean distance) on the numerical features and uses k-modes (dissimilarity measure) on the categorical features. Instead of calculating \u201ccentroids\u201d for clusters using mean, it calculates \u201cprototypes\u201d for each cluster as a representative.", "In my dataset, I had many level 1 subcategories \u2014 Earrings, Necklaces, Rings, Bracelets, Anklets etc. Each category has various subcategories such as Earrings have Hoop Earrings, Stud Earrings etc.", "Features defining a cluster \u2014 Category, SubCategory, Material, Who made the product (seller, third party seller), Year product was made (after 2000, custom made, vintage), Price of item, Customizability, Number of views, Number of favorites.", "I tried two approaches. First, clustering all subcategories together. The clusters I got were overlapping and not well defined.Second, I tried a two-tiered approach. I separated the dataset for each category and then clustered each one separately. This targeted clustering gave me purer, more separated clusters. This makes sense because, intuitively, the price of a gold pair of earrings and a gold necklace would be in different ranges.", "Similar to k-means where we can use the inertia to find the optimal \u201ck\u201d, I used the cost function from the k-prototypes to find the optimal number of clusters. I ran the algorithm for 3 to 25 clusters and for Earrings, and got 20 as the \u201ck\u201d with least cost value.", "Below is an example of a cluster I got for Earrings \u2014", "This photo describes a cluster that is mostly Gold earrings, made by the seller, after the year 2000. They are generally not customizable, and the average price of earrings in this cluster is $370.", "Next, with these clusters, I moved on to the regression world. Along with other features, I used these cluster labels as features in the regression model.", "I tried a couple of approaches. First, with a vanilla Linear Regression using scikit-learn for a baseline.", "I got a Mean absolute error of $13.1. This means, my price estimate would be approximately $13 off from the optimal price for these jewelry items.", "This is a good baseline. Next, I used an XGBoost Regressor to see if I could improve on the baseline model for performance.", "Indeed! XGBoost model definitely did a little bit better on the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) as well as on the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).", "The reason I have looked at both MAE & MAPE is the wide price range for the products ($1\u2013$1000). Let\u2019s dig into that a little more.", "A $12 error in prediction is not much if I am looking at say, $500 necklaces. However, that\u2019s a high error if I am looking at $20 earrings. So, to investigate this difference, I broke down the error by price range of items.", "So, XGBoost did a little better than the vanilla Linear Regression. There is, however, a tradeoff in selecting my final model.", "Linear Regression is more interpretable while XGBoost is more accurate in prediction.", "If the sellers are flexible in what items they can sell, Linear Regression would be more helpful. The coefficients would tell what sells best. However, if a seller is just selling what they make or have in inventory, prediction accuracy is more important for them.With this in mind \u2014 I decided to move forward with XGBoost as my model for price prediction.", "XGBoost regressor provides feature importance for all the features used in the model. It is a relative ranking of all features.", "I used the labeled data from clustering for regression. That is, in my model, cluster labels were also features along with other product attributes.", "Clusters were ranked higher than individual attributes when I looked at the feature importances.", "Interactions between individual features are important. As clusters explain these interactions well, XGBoost ranks them higher than any individual feature.", "So for example, \u201ccustomizability\u201d is an important feature. If it\u2019s a customizable earring that might increase the price. But if it\u2019s a customizable silver earring vs. customizable gold earring would change the price by different amounts.", "I created a tool using Flask which takes product attributes as input, assigns it to a cluster in real-time. The regression model uses this and provides a recommended price.", "This tool can help new entrepreneurs on Etsy price their items competitively and get started with their business on Etsy.", "Pricing algorithms or segmentation are not specific to just Etsy products. Any marketplace business can utilize these algorithms. Some such applications are pricing of Airbnb properties, pricing restaurant items on DoorDash etc. Job boards such as LinkedIn can use these techniques to provide estimate salary based on job descriptions.", "k-prototypes algorithm , Github , LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
