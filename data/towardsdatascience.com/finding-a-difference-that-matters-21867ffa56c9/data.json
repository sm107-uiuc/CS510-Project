Decisions shouldn\u2019t be made on \u201cthis looks different enough\u201d when there are ways to put statistical rigor behind the findings. The results can be surprising in both directions \u2014 small differences can have significance; large differences can lack it.", "As I learn about these concepts in the MSBA program that I\u2019m pursuing, I thought a case study to drive home the concepts would be fun to do.", "Project code is on Github here.", "Are Boston neighborhoods all equally expensive?", "A previous article that I wrote tried to predict housing prices in Boston, the city where I live. A critical factor in improving performance was adding a variable for the neighborhood where the property was located.", "If neighborhood matters, that means that we should be able to first prove statistically that there are differences across the mean values, then go to the next level and understand how neighborhoods compare to each other.", "For the purposes of simplicity, I\u2019m going to extract the neighborhoods that are most expensive and centrally located: Fenway / Kenmore, Back Bay, Beacon Hill, West End, North End, Downtown, and South End:", "I\u2019ve also trimmed the values to the middle 80% by removing the top and bottom 10% of the values by neighborhood to account for outliers and extreme values. As the analyses are run on the mean, which is affected by outliers, we want to create the most representative data set possible. We\u2019ll be analyzing price per square foot as the proxy for most expensive.", "Let\u2019s start by looking at the distribution of the data:", "We see some variation between groups. Beacon Hill\u2019s median value is highest, but Downtown\u2019s 75th percentile is higher than that of Beacon Hill. West End, North End, South End, and Kenmore all have similar distributions but various degrees of separation between the 25th and 75th percentiles. Which are really different? Could you say with confidence?", "When looking at the mean, we see a little bit more variation than the box plot. Visually, we would say Beacon Hill is most expensive and the North End is least expensive. Does this hold true?", "ANOVA, or Analysis of Variance, measures the likelihood that the mean is the same across a series of groups within the data. It does this by measuring the \u201cbetween group variance\u201d and \u201cwithin group variance\u201d.", "The between group variance sums: The mean of each group subtracted from the overall data set mean, squared, divided by the degrees of freedom.", "Let\u2019s bring that into English. The mean of all values in the trimmed data set is $788.55. The means by neighborhood are in the chart above. For each of those means, we subtract $788.55, square the result, and sum those. The degrees of freedom is the number of sample means (7) minus one.", "Simply put, for each group, this is the number of groups (7) minus 1 times the group\u2019s variance. We then sum each of those values and divide by the total number of observations (25,028) minus the number of sample means (7).", "The F-value, the statistic associated with ANOVA, is the between group variance divided by the within group variance and creates a distribution from which we calculate the likelihood (p-value) that all groups have the same mean:", "The way to interpret the above is if the p-value (Pr(>F)) is less than our significance level (conventionally, 0.05), we \u201creject the null hypothesis\u201d that all of the means are equal and conclude that the mean values between groups is different.", "This does not tell us which groups are different, just that there are differences.", "This finding leaves me with questions. Mainly, which are different?", "Pairwise comparisons and Tukey HSD (\u201cHonestly Significant Difference\u201d\u2026yes, that\u2019s really the name) are a way to look at the specific pairs of values and determine the significance of their difference.", "Again, let\u2019s make that real. Is Beacon Hill more expensive than Downtown? Is Kenmore more expensive than the North End?", "The way to interpret the pairwise table below on the left is for each pair (i.e. North End and West End in the top left), what is the probability that the means are equal? Lower values means it\u2019s less likely that the means are equal.", "For the Tukey HSD, which calculates the difference of means and creates a confidence interval around that difference, look for whether the 95% confidence interval (\u2018lwr \u2019and \u2018upr\u2019) contains 0 in the range. If it does, then the means are not significantly different because 0 \u2014indicating no difference \u2014 is a plausible value. Otherwise, the differences are significant. If \u2018diff\u2019 is negative, the first neighborhood is cheaper than the second, and vice versa for positive.", "I\u2019m more of a visual person, so let\u2019s look at the Tukey HSD in a graph:", "Beacon Hill looked more expensive than downtown. Now, we can say it is. The 95% confidence interval does not contain 0 and the difference is statistically significant. We now know with confidence that, in 2018, the assessed values on a per-square-foot level were highest in Beacon Hill, followed by Downtown then Back Bay.", "In fact, the only pair that is not statistically significant among our sample neighborhoods is Kenmore and the North End; we cannot conclude that the mean values of these two neighborhoods is different on a per-square-foot level.", "The use of ANOVA and related statistics in business is wide-reaching. For example, if we\u2019re looking at performance of various companies in a market, the first question we want to ask is:", "If all mean values are statistically the same, then the company has to look beyond performance to actually move the needle on customer wins (service, breadth of offering, etc.). In other words, if product performance is a baseline criteria to win a contract, where should the next level of investment capital go to actually differentiate?", "Once we\u2019ve established where the opportunity to differentiate is, we want to know:", "That\u2019s when we can proceed with the pairwise comparison or Tukey HSD to determine differences between companies. Is the score of 5.95 for Group A in the chart at the beginning of the article actually different than 5.83 for Group C?", "The result is understanding within a given market of:", "I\u2019m a firm believer in the practical application of learning and, while fun to run an analysis on the neighborhoods that I know and experience every day, the implications for business and what these can do is much more significant and interesting to explore.", "Your home for data science.
