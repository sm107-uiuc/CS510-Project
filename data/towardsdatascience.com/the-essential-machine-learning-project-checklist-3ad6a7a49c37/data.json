It\u2019s meant to be kept near your desk or a few clicks away as a reference to help you see the big picture.", "There are a lot of challenges and obstacles that can and will come up while you\u2019re working through your dataset, and it can be easy to feel overwhelmed if you\u2019re not used to it. If you start feeling lost, use this checklist as your North Star.", "Is this an end-all-be-all? Absolutely not.", "Can you do things in a different order? Yes, of course.", "Will this checklist help you? Yes, if you like bringing structure and order into your problems.", "This was written for anyone that is either just getting started with Python for Machine Learning or anyone that needs a refresher on what an ML workflow can look like.", "In this blog post, I\u2019m going to explain what you should be doing at every stage of the checklist.", "In this Github Repo, I created an EXERCISES .ipynb and a SOLUTIONS .ipynb that are based on a simple Airbnb machine learning project. I\u2019ll be giving a few code examples that are from the SOLUTIONS file. Download if you want to follow along.", "I can hear your eyes rolling at me.", "Come on, dude. Let\u2019s get to the coding part.", "If you insist on skipping this, go right ahead, but doing this properly will save you hours and headache, I promise!", "Let\u2019s say your manager, Amanda, hands you an Airbnb dataset. It has 106 features, and she tells you that we want to better understand rental listings.", "OK. First, does she want me to cluster them? Does she want me to make a dashboard? What questions does she want me to answer? What\u2019s the goal?", "Figure out what your objective is, and try to gameplan the different ways you can get to your objective.", "Is there a data dictionary or schema you can print or keep handy? Take advantage of that.", "Take 1\u20132 hours to understand what each of those 106 features are. Write down features you plan on removing, features whose names don\u2019t make intuitive sense, and features that look like they might need a lot of cleaning.", "Is this event-level, where one listing can have multiple rows \u2014 each with a timestamp and an event? Or is this unit-level, where each row uniquely identifies one rentable unit?", "Get familiar with what you\u2019re working with before you even start coding.", "Understanding and answering questions like these will help you start moving in the right direction. It\u2019s like looking at a map before stepping into the maze.", "It\u2019s good practice to keep all your imports at the top of your analysis. Whenever you need a library or function you haven\u2019t imported, go back to the top and import it there.", "Import your dataset(s) now, and if you have to join them, try to wait until you\u2019ve finished Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) before you do so.", "This section is broken up into 5 subsections because of how long it is.", "You know how people say Data Scientists spend up to 80%-90% of their time cleaning data? Yeah, that\u2019s mainly because of this part.", "Make sure you take your time. Be thorough here. Once you finish this part, you\u2019re well beyond halfway to a working ML algorithm.", "Take a second to drop pure duplicate rows or investigate conflicting IDs from your dataset(s). It\u2019s easy to forget, but this is a step you should always take.", "Take an inventory of your data types. Generally, there are 6 data types that you might encounter, in decreasing order of frequency.", "Start by separating your data into the numerical data types and everything else. This can be done with the following:", "Skim through your numerical data first. Most often, the only problem here will be missing values (which we will deal with later).", "Now, look through your categorical data. There will probably be a lot of problems that you need to take care of. Some of them being\u2026", "Don\u2019t start cleaning as soon as you see a problem. Let\u2019s not get ahead of ourselves.", "Make a to-do list of the problems you can see now. You might not catch them all, so if another cleaning problem comes up later, just add it to this list.", "In my EXERCISES notebook (pictured below), I took some time to write these down before I started cleaning.", "Heads up: If you added \u201cfill missing values\u201d to your cleaning to-do list, remove it for now. Don\u2019t do it yet. I\u2019ll explain why in a later step.", "Once you have a comprehensive cleaning to-do list, finish them one at a time. Here\u2019s an example of how I unpacked a feature with multiple values.", "Once you\u2019ve finished your cleaning to-do list, it\u2019s time to visualize.", "Note that the things you find in this section can and will uncover things that you will want to add to the cleaning to-do list.", "If you identify any outliers or transformations you want to apply to your data, you can apply it now, but it\u2019s better practice to do this after you\u2019ve split your data into training and testing.", "If you want, check out how your data is distributed with histograms, distribution plots, or bar plots. Maybe explore relationships between features.", "Use this section to see if you can answer the original business questions that was asked of you. You can\u2019t perform any Machine Learning yet, but not all problems require Machine Learning in the first place.", "Take advantage of data viz libraries like Matplotlib or Seaborn. Maybe explore interactive visualizations using Bokeh or Plotly. The world is your oyster.", "Here\u2019s an example of how I tried to understand if there is some relationship between recency of reviews and the pricing of an Airbnb listing.", "Before we move on from EDA, we have to address one more issue: missing values. Unless you\u2019re using a fancy algorithm like XGboost, you have to address missing values so your data is ML-friendly.", "Put simply, you have two options: remove or impute (AKA fill).", "In this section, remove missing values if you think it\u2019s appropriate, then strategize for how you want to fill them, but don\u2019t impute them yet.", "Generally, it\u2019s good practice to treat the imputation of missing values as another hyperparameter that you want to tune. So, you want to run your imputation strategy after you train/test split your data. If you want, you can also treat your removal of missing values the same way (i.e. remove missing values after train/test split).", "This way, when you test your entire machine learning workflow on your validation set, you can also see how changing your imputation or removal strategy affects your workflow\u2019s performance.", "2. Impute them (strategize now, impute later)", "For each strategy you use, make note of which features you want each strategy applied to. This makes imputation easier after you split your data.", "It\u2019s common to use anywhere between 80%-90% of your data for training/validation and save the rest for test (depending on how much data you have).", "If you want to use Cross Validation or K-Fold Cross Validation, separate your validation data from your training later when you\u2019re selecting a model or tuning your model.", "Everything you do from here onwards can be evaluated and tuned. Tuning is not exclusive to model hyperparameters.", "Now that you\u2019ve split your data into training and testing, we need to turn our data into an ML-friendly format. This section is divided into 4 parts, and by the end of it, you\u2019re ready for Machine Learning.", "Now we execute our imputation strategy and make sure there are no more missing values in your training and testing data.", "Tip: Use scikit-learn\u2019s SimpleImputer() or other estimators to fill your missing values. Using estimators/transformers like these allow you to fit them to your training data then use them to transform your training and testing data.", "Here\u2019s an example of filling a set of features with zero\u2026", "Note that in practice, we can impute entire sets of features at once. This was done on one feature at a time for simplicity in the EXERCISES .ipynb.", "Once you\u2019ve taken care of all of your missing values, use this section as an opportunity to engineer any more features that you think will be useful for your ML model.", "Again, treat this as a hyperparameter you may decide to tune.", "Feature Engineering can sometimes improve your models much more than extensive model hyperparameter tuning.", "Note that whenever you engineer your own features (specifically, if you perform division or logarithmic operations), you open the possibility of creating invalid infinite values or NA values.", "Once you\u2019re happy with the features that you have, you now have to resize/scale/transform your numerical variables or convert all of your categorical or text features into numbers.", "Let\u2019s go through these one at a time:", "If you have very skewed data, it may be a good idea to log-transform or square-transform to make your data appear more normally distributed.", "If you suspect outliers negatively affect your models\u2019 performance, remove outliers now.", "Not all ML algorithms require features to be on the same scale, but some do (Linear Regression, Neural Networks, K-Means Clustering, etc.). If this is the case for you, you have to scale your features. Some options include Standardization, Normalization, and Minimum-Maximum scaling.", "There are generally three types of categorical data, and here is how you can approach each one:", "Without going too deep into the world of Natural Language Processing, there are generally these basic steps you can take when dealing with text data:", "Finally, now is when we perform some dimensionality reduction.", "Not only can this improve your models\u2019 prediction performance, but it can also decrease computation time.", "Here\u2019s an example of removing features with high correlation:", "Depending on your problem, pick the appropriate models that you think can be effective.", "Once you\u2019ve picked some model candidates, use methods like K-Fold Cross-validation to identify the 2\u20133 most promising models!", "Use standard techniques like Grid Search or Randomized Search to identify hyperparameters that perform the best.", "If you\u2019re up for it, explore libraries like hyperopt that take advantage of Bayesian statistics to tune your models. This is basically a \u201csmart\u201d Randomized Search, which is basically a \u201cfaster\u201d Grid Search.", "Notice how this blog post is 90% data cleaning, exploration, and preprocessing, but it\u2019s only 10% machine learning.", "When you start a Machine Learning project, it can feel like it takes forever to reach a simple working model. It\u2019s fun to try different models, learn about advanced hyperparameter tuning, etc., but it can feel soul-draining to grind through datasets before you can get to that point.", "Cleaning and preprocessing is not romanticized as the sexiest skill of the decade. However, I hope this has shown you how crucial and complex it is to stay organized and to take your time whenever you have to do this.", "If you\u2019ve made it this far into the blog post, thank you for reading! I hope you enjoyed this and got something out of it.", "Remember to check out the checklist here or the GitHub repo for a practice lab, solutions file, and the checklist\u2019s accompanying .ipynb template.", "Your home for data science.
