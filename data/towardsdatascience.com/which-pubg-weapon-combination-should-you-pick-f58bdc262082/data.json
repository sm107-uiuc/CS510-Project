To give a general idea of how the game works: you parachute from a plane, then you run into buildings and start searching for protective gear, ammunition and weapons, then you either kill others or be killed by others, and the last team to survive wins the Chicken Dinner. The concept sounds simple enough, yes? Then you run into a building and find yourself staring at five different guns with names that give no clue on how they\u2019re different from one another. Every player can equip themselves with two guns, but how was I supposed to know which two to pick? I probably wasn\u2019t picking the right ones, since I kept getting killed by my opponents even though I started shooting first on many occasions. So I decided, why not take this chance to brush up on my Python skills (you know you\u2019re really rusty when you actually have to Google \u2018shortcut keys to run code on Python\u2019) and hopefully find something that could give me a better chance of taking home that Chicken Dinner? Just a quick discretion: it\u2019s been nearly two years since I last worked on a project using Python, so suggestions on how to code things in a better way are definitely welcomed! As always, my code is hosted on GitHub.", "I searched around for ready datasets on PUBG weapon statistics, but ended up finding none (Kaggle has a dataset on player statistics derived from the official API, which would serve as an interesting dataset for other analyses). I did, however, find websites that provided weapon statistics, so I proceeded to do some web scraping of the official PUBG Wiki using BeautifulSoup. I won\u2019t be going into details on the web scraping process because I\u2019d like to focus more on the data analysis parts, so I\u2019ll only be highlighting some parts.", "Although there\u2019s a page that gives the statistics for all weapons, I wanted to be able to categorise them into their respective types (for example, whether they were Assault Rifles or Light Machine Guns), so I ended up scraping from the respective page for each weapon type before merging the 8 dataframes into a single dataframe.", "I also cleaned up missing and weird data by replacing them with data from other sites (refer to the credits at the end of this article) that listed comparable values for other weapons that did not require any replacement in the current dataset.", "Following that, I converted all numerical columns to float datatype to allow for arithmetic operations in subsequent data analyses, before exporting the dataframe as a csv file.", "The following summarises what each feature means (the information is copy and pasted from the PUBG Wiki with minimal changes)", "Direct damage applied before armour and other mitigating factors", "The speed at which the bullet leaves the muzzle in meters per second. Higher numbers mean less lead required against distant moving targets.", "How much force is applied to a ragdoll when it is shot. Higher values mean a stronger push.", "The maximum amount of ammunition that can be held in a magazine.", "The minimum amount of time in seconds that must pass before the weapon can be fired again.", "The modes this weapon can select. A weapon with Single, Auto in this field indicates that it can select between single fire mode or automatic fire mode.", "If applicable, how many shots are fired in a single burst.", "The minimum amount of time in seconds that must pass before another burst can be fired again.", "The type of ammunition that the weapon accepts.", "Also known as bulk, or the amount of inventory space taken up.", "What is attachable to the weapon itself. Examples of attachments would include a Scope, which would allow for long-distance sniping.", "The amount of damage done to the body when: no armour is equipped, a level 1 vest is equipped, a level 2 vest is equipped and a level 3 vest is equipped, respectively.", "The amount of damage done to the head when: no armour is equipped, a level 1 armour is equipped, a level 2 armour is equipped and a level 3 armour is equipped, respectively.", "A variable that I created to reflect which type of weapon it belongs to.", "Based on the descriptions, it does seem that the more important weapon features are: body and head damage (if a weapon inflicts higher damage, it is more likely you can kill your opponent), initial bullet speed (a faster bullet speed would mean that your bullet is likely to hit your opponent before theirs hit you), time between shots (you usually need multiple shots to kill your opponent, so a shorter time between shots would increase your chance of defeating your opponent), ammo per mag (if you can carry more bullets per mag, you don\u2019t have to waste time reloading so often).", "Now that all the nitty gritty details are ironed out, it\u2019s time for the fun bit. Let\u2019s try to find some trends among the different features by plotting a correlation matrix.", "A quick glance of the correlation matrix shows that the body damage of different levels are perfectly correlated with each other, and so are the head damage of different levels. Hence, we can just choose one of the levels to look at, let\u2019s just use BDMG 1 and HDMG 1. Body damage and head damage are highly correlated with each other too, which is definitely no surprise, but for now, we\u2019ll keep both variables in our correlation matrix just to be safe. What\u2019s surprising is the low correlation between damage and body and head damage. Since body and head damage are the factors that directly impact a player\u2019s health, we\u2019ll just remove damage from the correlation matrix.", "Looking at the \u201cdecluttered\u201d correlation matrix, it appears that there is a tradeoff between damage and time between shots (higher damage guns have a longer time between shots), damage and speed (higher damage guns are slower in bullet speed), damage and ammo per mag (higher damage guns can carry less ammunition per magazine). Among these 3 tradeoffs, the first two tradeoffs are more critical to winning a fight, so we\u2019ll focus on them instead. Also, given that body damage and head damage are highly correlated, I\u2019ll simplify things further by looking only at head damage from this point onwards. In short, we\u2019ll look at 3 variables: head damage level 1 (HDMG 1), initial bullet speed (SPD) and time between shots (TBS).", "Let\u2019s first plot a heatmap by weapon type. Before I show the actual heatmap, I\u2019ll quickly summarise the abbreviations of the different weapon types.", "This further reiterates the trends that we found earlier \u2014 higher damage guns tend to have slower bullet speed and have longer time between shots (we can just take shotguns as an example). As mentioned at the start of this article, each player can equip themselves with 2 guns, so I wanted to find out which pairings are the most advantageous in light of these 2 tradeoffs.", "I started off by plotting a heatmap to compare among the different weapon combinations. This seems to paint a similar picture where there is a tradeoff between damage and speed and damage and time between shots, but it\u2019s not super clear, so perhaps a correlation matrix might depict things a little better.", "As we can see, the biggest tradeoff is between damage and time between shots, followed by damage and speed.", "When tradeoffs are involved, the best combinations are those that are Pareto efficient. What exactly is Pareto efficient? Simply put, if you have 2 objectives, a Pareto efficient combination is one where you cannot obtain an improvement in one objective without making yourself worse off in the other. Let\u2019s say you have 2 objectives, X and Y, where a tradeoff exists between these 2 objectives.", "Point A is not Pareto efficient, because there exists a point (for example, A\u2019) where you are better off in at least one of the objectives without being worse off in the other. Points A\u2019 and A\u2019\u2019 are both Pareto efficient, because it is impossible to obtain a higher value for one objective without becoming worse off in the other. For example, going from Point A\u2019 to A\u2019\u2019, we get a higher X but a lower Y. A Pareto front just connects all the Pareto efficient points.", "We have 2 tradeoffs in our case, so let\u2019s take a look at them separately. We\u2019ll start off with the larger tradeoff between damage and time between shots.", "As seen above, the Pareto efficient combinations are:", "We can\u2019t say that one of these combinations is better than another, but if I want a combination that fares pretty equally in both damage and time between shots, perhaps it might be a good idea to pick either combination 2 or 3.", "What about the tradeoff between damage and speed?", "In this case, the Pareto efficient combinations are:", "Again, we can\u2019t conclude that one of these combinations is better than another, but if I want a combination that fares pretty equally in both damage and speed, it might be a good idea to pick combination 5 or 6.", "At the end of the day, it really depends on whether you want to prioritise the tradeoff between damage and time between shots, or the tradeoff between damage and initial bullet speed. Then, the Pareto efficiency analysis will provide some weapon combinations that you can choose from, depending on whether you favour a combination that fares a lot better in one objective compared to the other, or one that fares quite equally in both objectives. I would go with the latter, since my goal of conducting this analysis is to find a pair of guns that complement each other by having different strengths.", "That being said, I hope this analysis helps you with winning that Chicken Dinner!", "Credit for provision of web scraping reference code"], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
