What skills do I need as data scientist and how to get a job in data science."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["When I started my journey in \u201cdata science,\u201d the world was straightforward:", "I studied mathematics. I completed my master\u2019s in mathematics. I did my Ph.D. in mathematics.", "The data exploration world was divided into mathematics, Operations Research, and computer science.", "Today, the world is more complicated.", "The students in my lecture about data analytics are from many different departments and disciplines. Some have a mathematics or physics background, while others come from computer science. Half of the attendees come from engineering, natural sciences, management, and humanities.", "Several students already attended lectures in this area, others are professionals, and for some, it is the first brush with this topic.", "This variety perfectly reflects the plurality of data science today.", "My lecture bridges the academic world to the unadorned practice.", "And the students have many, many questions, especially about the field itself.", "Where should I enter the professional world? What positions are out there? What is critical to consider when looking for a job? What is the reality of work versus what is the advertisement?", "So, I decided to summarize and publish them to a broader audience.", "I have been working in this field for more than 20 years now. My work has always been with data, data management, making sense of them, extracting the insights, predict, optimize, learn, automate, and finally, give the fundamentals for decision-making.", "While writing my Ph.D., I was at the statistics institute and had the chance to meet many big names in statistics, pattern recognition, and machine learning. Statistics and machine learning were almost synonyms at the time, and data science did not exist.", "All the explanations of differences between these fields came later.", "For example, while working at the statistics institute, the research had different angles. When a doctoral candidate completed its Ph.D., he/she had the choice in what subject he/she wanted to receive the Ph.D. title. Some chose computer science, some engineering, other environmental science, or \u2014 like me \u2014 mathematics.", "So, am I telling you that nothing has changed in the last 20 years?", "Much has changed and is still evolving. Let\u2019s start looking at the original interplay of statistics, machine learning, AI, and computer science and how it has evolved into data science.", "Statistics, Computer Science, or Machine Learning?", "Let\u2019s start with statistics. You probably associate statistics mostly with inference \u2014 finding properties of a population-based on data \u2014 and prediction. That\u2019s correct for roughly half of the statistical world. The other half is a bit more complicated and could fill books. I am focusing on a very limited extract.", "In statistics, two schools of statistics exist, the frequentist and the Bayesian school.", "Very generally spoken, the frequentists see the long-run frequencies of occurrence as the only truth defining a probability. By making repeated measurements, the frequency of any measured value gives the likelihood of that value. Everything can only be estimated from that data. The real value is not known but, eventually, any of the measured values. One counts and calculates frequencies without any prior assumption.", "Bayesians see a probability as a degree of belief and a measure of plausibility. Data is the reality and adjusts the belief, i.e., the a-priori assumption. Our knowledge about an event relates to the probability. That is where the condition in the Bayes formula originates. For Bayesians, the unknown \u2018real\u2019 value can be described by a probability.", "Is the one better than the other? No, it\u2019s not. They are just two perspectives of our world.", "And then there is, of course, the intersection: Empirical Bayes.", "In empirical Bayes, we are learning from real evidence, represented by data. Or in short: algorithms are learning from data \u2014 statistical learning.", "We are turning now to machine learning. Machine learning is a field that was closely related to AI from the fifties until the eighties. Like the original AI, machine learning was based on logical, symbolic, and knowledge-based approaches. But for solving practical problems, probability-based approaches are needed. Thus, in the \u201990s, machine learning drifted away from the original AI and focused on practical, data-based learning with methods from probability theory and statistics and moved close to these fields in research and collaboration \u2014 not only for methodological approaches but also in personal cooperations. It became its own recognized discipline and developed into today\u2019s data-based learning algorithms.", "My Ph.D. was in the non-parametric empirical Bayes world with latent, i.e., hidden layers, and I developed a new algorithm for learning from data. It was statistics, as well as machine learning.", "You can see that the difference between \u201cstatistics\u201d and \u201cmachine learning\u201d is very overlapping, and often there is no separation possible.", "Is one better than the other?", "The transition from one field to the other is fluent. Every subject has its advantages and disadvantages, and cross-fertilizing is common.", "No. Finally, the \u201clabel\u201d does not matter. What matters are the methods, applications, and, most important, the value creation.", "Yes, it matters. Like every new emerging field, machine learning, deep learning, and data science are new developments, new methods, and contain new philosophies.", "It is in human\u2019s nature to reject new, boundary-moving ideas and developments.", "To get acceptance and appreciation of an area of specialism, you need to show the value of your work. You have to label it differently because people want an identity. It represents the new philosophies and gives people a home.", "It is a natural and valid development. Change and inventions are our daily life and should be accepted.", "And now, let me bring data science into the game.", "The last 30 years a lot of technological changes happens:", "Technology became affordable for the masses, and with that, the massive generation of data came in parallel.", "We did not need to be any longer careful with information production, sharing, and optimizing both. We could just produce, transmit, and store it.", "All these opened up the opportunity for new possibilities.", "In the nineties, machine learning could find its destination because of technological improvements.", "The massive amount of data made it possible to learn from them, and it enabled us to develop new algorithms to solve high-dimensional problems.", "\u201c[\u2026] many things have changed. One is just the amount of data [\u2026]. The amount of data has increased, and the complexity has increased, also the methods [\u2026]. The methods are changing so fast; you have also to pick up the new methods [\u2026]\u201d \u2014 Edvard Moser, Nobel Laureate, to the question if the nature of science has changed", "The New Paradigm of Data Science", "With this, the paradigm of working with data shifted. It shifted in science, and it changed in the business world. The world could base results purely on data and the many patterns in data. And both statistics and machine learning are part of that story.", "In business, understanding evolved towards data and fact-based driven decision making.", "This change needed a new way of thinking: a new paradigm of well-thought-out science based on data to make decisions in research, science, and business: data science.", "Knowing all background and historical development, it does not matter if people are naming it machine learning, statistics, or data science. Relevant is the content of the work, not the label.", "We have seen the (often confusing) variety of topics that are embraced by data science.", "What is now data science in reality?", "I typically use the typical steps in processing data for the explanation.", "The modern, simplified data architecture \u2014 a data architecture defines the data and information flow based on rules, policies, and governance \u2014 contains the steps: data sources, data capture, data storage, data curation, data exploration, data provisioning, and data consumption.", "What is the meaning behind these words?", "Data sources: Working with the different data sources of relational, streaming, structured, and unstructured data.", "Data capture: Working in Data Staging, a transient storage place, i.e., with cloud, file share, drop zones, and in Data Ingestion with batch, ad hoc, and real-time data.", "Data Storage/Repositories: The various options of a data storage layer to store raw data, in-process data and curated data, e.g., cloud, NoSQL, Datamart, and so on.", "Data Curation: Containing the standardization, validation, and protection of data and metadata to manage and maintain them.", "Data Exploration: Exploring the data with statistics, advanced analytics, and machine learning and ensures data democratization.", "Data Provisioning: Providing access and tools, creating, preparing, and enabling processes to bring the data to the users.", "Data Consumption: Reports, business intelligence, digital marketing, customer relationship management (CRM), data analytics, machine learning, apps, bots, and business analytics.", "This list shows that we have quite a zoo of different data tasks until finally, we can produce and present the insights from data.", "For each step, we need specialized data experts.", "Depending on who you are talking to or how companies are advertising a data scientist role, each stage can be sold as a data science job.", "The different views on what data science contains are:", "No 1: data science includes all these data steps from data sources to consumption.", "No 2: data science contains the tasks from data capture, data curation, data exploration, data provisioning, to data consumption.", "No 3: data science contains only parts of data curation, data exploration, and data consumption, i.e., it includes data preparation, data cleansing, machine learning, advanced analytics, and building a data product.", "Depending on with whom you are speaking, there is one or the other definition used.", "Technology consultancies mostly mean no 1.", "No 3 is the part that sells great in the market. It is the advertisement of fancy methods, the radiation of the fun factor. All the \u201cdata science\u201d MOOC courses and job ads sell no 3.", "Beware: this is currently a maximum of 20% of the work in the data science field!", "It is a fact that high fluctuations of data scientists in the job market can be observed. One of the main reasons is that the job does not meet people\u2019s expectations. The mismatch of expectations is often caused unintentionally but by a lack of understanding of the data science field.", "You can find many line managers that want to hire \u201cdata scientists\u201d because they think, with a small team of data scientists, they could have Google and Amazon within their firm. But many of them do not know what data science contains, and not a few hired data scientists end up as business analysts with Excel files.", "Based on my practical experience and the technological advancements that blur the boundaries between the different data topics, I tend to define data science as no 1.", "That means for you: it is ALWAYS essential NOT just to believe in the beautiful descriptions in a job add or what a line manager is telling you.", "Ask until you have found out what the offered \u2018data science\u2019 job contains. I am not saying that all the non-machine learning jobs are not exciting. On the contrary, there are many exciting and well-paid data jobs.", "The good news: that allows many people to enter the data science field.", "You do not need to be a Ph.D. in machine learning and a great programmer. You do not need to compete with all these coding nerds. Find your niche to enter. Then, develop yourself.", "Bring this all together, follow my advice:", "Advice #1: Be not confused by all the buzzwords and all the people explaining all the tiny differences. Gain the big picture of the subject, explore where you are interested, and start with your abilities.", "Advice #2: Beware the advertisement! If you are looking for entering the data science field, do not care about how it is labeled. Look under the surface and ask, ask, ask. It\u2019s better to ask questions like a four-year-old than have a misalignment in expectations.", "Advice #3: Find your niche. Not all people in the data science field need to be machine learning geeks, outstanding programmers, nor having an academic background. Explore the different entry options, take a starting point, and develop yourself in the different directions of this great discipline.", "Advice #4: Have fun! Not all days as a data scientist are electrifying. Be open-minded and take everything as an opportunity to learn something new. You can have a lot of fun in this field.", "Your home for data science.
