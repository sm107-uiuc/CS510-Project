It will take in the data passed by the views.py file of Users app and will help display the data to the user and take user input via forms.", "So, we put all our templates in the following location: templates/users inside of the users\u2019 folder. It is Django\u2019s naming convention to put data there as Django looks for templates in that location.", "We will deal with templates one by one. There are 12 of them. We won\u2019t go into detail much as its mostly HTML and CSS classes and we would talk only about the logic part which we use in templates to define who has access to what. So, let\u2019s begin:", "Let\u2019s start with the login part. This template will let users sign in into our website. This displays the Login Form and we are using the crispy forms to stylize our forms using Bootstrap4. In Django, forms are very easy to render.", "We have a submit button and forgot password option, Also, we have a link to the registration page.", "We are extending the layout template from our Feeds app. Each template extends the layout which contains the header and footer part. Don\u2019t worry for now about the layout.html file since we would cover it in Part 5 of the tutorial series.", "Next, we move to the registration page for our website. This page will let users sign up into our website. It also displays the form and then the submit button. We have a link to the login page for existing users.", "Next, we have the Logout page. It just displays a message telling the users that they have been logged out of the website. They are given the option to log in again.", "This is the form to let the user request password reset. User should submit their email address and click on the reset button. Then they would be sent a link to their email address.", "This page displays the message that the reset link has been sent to their email address. We also give a button which opens up Gmail for the user.", "This page opens up when you click on the reset link sent to you. You can make a new password here and then click on the button to change the password.", "This page shows that the user\u2019s password has been reset, and can log in using his new credentials now.", "This is probably the most complicated one, with lots of stuff going in. First, we can see the {% block searchform %}, which has a search bar to search for users. It is displayed in the website's navbar and is not a part of the profile.html. It is just extending the navbar part so that the search form does not display on each page.", "Now, coming to the profile part, we can search; first, we have a card which displays our profile details such as profile pic, the number of friends and the number of posts shared.", "Now we have placed a restriction for only the user whose profile we are looking at can view the friends list and not anyone else. The posts shared can be seen by anyone. So, we have put a check there ( {% if request.user == u%}), which checks for the current user equal to the user whose profile is being viewed.", "Next, we have an option to Edit Profile if the current user is the user whose profile is being viewed. This restricts anyone else from updating our profile.", "We also have various options, such as Add Friend, Cancel Request, Reject Request, Accept Request, Unfriend depending on the conditions.", "If the current user is the user whose profile is being viewed, we get two lists below.", "This page contains the forms we require to update our profile. We can update our email, username, profile picture and bio. It has a submit button to update the profile and take us back to the profile page.", "Here we display all our friends and we get an option to unfriend them. All our friends are displayed as a list. We also display a card containing the current user\u2019s info in the side.", "This page displays all the users who came up when we use the search bar to search for users using their names. This list contains all the search results and we have an option. We also display a card containing the current user\u2019s info in the side.", "This list contains the users recommended to add as friends. It's to look and find new people and increase your friends. We also have the option to Add Friend or Cancel Request for all those users. We also display a card containing the current user\u2019s info on the side.", "So, that\u2019s all for the Users App Templates. It was a lot of HTML content. Hope you are not bored. But we had to do it to keep the tutorial coherent. We have two parts left now, where will be discussing the Feeds app and its templates. Those will handle all the logic and rendering of the posts, likes, comments etc.", "I hope you enjoyed reading the tutorial. Thanks a lot!", "A new series based on Django Rest Framework, which you should check out to enhance your Django skills:", "A similar Django-focused series (Building a Job Search Portal) which will teach you some amazing new concepts, is:", "The next part of the tutorial is:-", "A collection of resources to learn Web Development can be found here:-", "Your home for data science.
