Maybe it\u2019s because Shakespeare is literally written in\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["I\u2019ve never liked high school English class.", "Maybe it\u2019s the fact that assignments are always super subjective. Maybe it\u2019s because the books that we\u2019re forced to read are long and boring. Maybe it\u2019s because Shakespeare is literally written in another language.", "Or maybe I\u2019m just bad at writing essays. \ud83d\ude22", "What ends up happening because I don\u2019t really like English class is that I stop paying attention to what my teacher is saying and I don\u2019t read the books we\u2019re supposed to read. As a result, I get a bad mark on the assignments and tests and my marks go down.", "So now I need to salvage my average, the two things I can do are:", "The second option sounds a lot cooler at this point.", "I\u2019ve learned a bit about neural networks before, you can check out my article on Convolutional Neural Networks for image recognition or my article on applying CNNs to classify skin lesions. Anyways, one problem that neural networks have struggled with is sequential data and temporal data. Traditional neural networks need to have a fixed input and output size.", "It\u2019s like if you had a video of a guy falling down the stairs and you wanted to train a neural network to classify what happens in the video. A regular neural network might be able to tell that the guy was standing up in the first frame of the video. Then it might be able to look at the frames in between until it gets to the last frame of the video and it sees a guy that has fallen down. But once it gets there, it\u2019s forgotten whether or not the guy was standing up in the first place.", "A Recurrent Neural Network would be good for solving this kind of problem because of how they work. On a high level, RNNs work by looping into one another. The neural network does a forward pass and then on the second forward pass, it takes in some of the information from the first iteration to get more context to make the second prediction.", "The information from the beginning can essentially be transferred throughout the entire network. Now our network can understand if someone actually fell down the stairs!", "As I mentioned before, RNNs are cool because they don\u2019t need fixed inputs or outputs, they can accept inputs and produce outputs of sequences.", "Up till now, RNNs have seemed perfect, right? We use this new type of network to operate over sequences of data in a much better way than what we could do with traditional networks. But one problem with RNNs is the vanishing/exploding gradient problem.", "When you update your model using backpropagation and calculate the gradients of the loss (how wrong your model is), the gradients get smaller and smaller the further back you get in the network. This basically means the more layers that are in the network, the less efficient training becomes. The exploding gradient is basically the opposite, if a gradient is very large, it backpropagates like an avalanche, and since RNNs go through many sequences and iterations, the problem of vanishing/exploding gradients is present.", "One solution to this problem is the use of LSTMs, Long Short Term Memory cells. It contains a bunch of mathematical formulas that helps RNNs solve the vanishing gradient problem and also makes predictions more accurate. When working with an LSTM, think of there being four pieces of information: long term memory, short term memory, an event and an output. The LSTM cell provides an output based on an event and considers the long term memory and the short term memory while making the prediction.", "Conceptually, an LSTM contains four gates: a forget gate, a learn gate, a remember gate, and a use gate. The Long Term Memory gets passed into the forget gate where the unneeded information is forgotten and the Short Term Memory and event go into the learn gate where the useful information is kept. The LTM, STM, and event get joined in the remember gate which then gets stored in the updated LTM, and the three pieces of information also pass into the use gate, where a prediction is made (STM).", "Of course, this is all super simplified. But the main takeaway should be that LSTMs are super useful when it comes to working with RNNs.", "Now that we have a basic understanding of how RNNs work, let\u2019s come back dto the original problem: how do I get out of doing my English homework?", "One way we can accomplish this is by utilizing a one to many RNN. We can train a neural network on a bunch of different essays and perform sampling on the model to generate a new essay we\u2019ve never seen before!", "Let\u2019s use Keras, a high-level API for developing deep learning models. This follows the example code in the Keras Github repo for text generation with LSTMs.", "We\u2019ll start by importing all of the necessary libraries and modules.", "Any corpus of text will work, but for my project I\u2019ll be using Nietzsche\u2019s writings. We\u2019ll import the text file, do some preprocessing, and vectorize the values.", "Now it\u2019s time for the actual model. It consists of a single LSTM and uses the Adam optimizer.", "Now to define two functions, sample: which is a helper function to sample an index from a probability array, and on_epoch_end: which is a function that is invoked at the end of every epoch and prints text generated by the model.", "We\u2019re almost there! Lastly, we\u2019ll write the callback which is where we\u2019ll see the text output and fit the model to the data.", "And that\u2019s it. Training all of this took around three hours on my laptop, you can also train the model on Google Colab with a GPU runtime. Theoretically, the generated texts should start sounding coherent after about 30 epochs so let\u2019s take a look at some of the outputs of the model.", "\u201cpatience are first developed \u2014 our sense, that the world of the process as in the same form to the reverence, and the master of the synthesion and the same tempo of the sensues itand and as the all tame and the except of the free of the contradition of existe not that the morality and want of the place to all man of the tempope\u201d of all moralexclive the soul to the good has always to his stands has of the chrison to danger of the super\u201d", "\u201ccould regard eventhe emotions of hatred, or do the conduct, and an instances of the has one wele be enterer of the state of the religion in the soul, the represens and according and can be the feelings of the above all religions and a struggle of the senses well entiblent stands and can all suffett of the conduct of the soutes of his subject, and dependers for the religion that is not as a feelings of whom suphriated the sense of the st\u201d", "Well\u2026 It\u2019s definitely not amazing. But isn\u2019t it cool that all of this was generated by a neural network? No doubt with a better architecture and more extensive data, you could get results that might be indistinguishable from what a human would write.", "Even though I might not be able to get a neural network to write out my English essays for me just yet, I think that with a bit more experimenting and testing, I can cheat my way out of at least part of my assignments.", "In my opinion, Natural Language Processing is seeing some awesome breakthroughs right now, and playing around with text generation is actually super fun.
