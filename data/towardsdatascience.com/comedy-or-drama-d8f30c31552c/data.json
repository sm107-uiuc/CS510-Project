This is a classic example of how businesses are using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to develop Data-Driven products. Both Supervised and Unsupervised variants of NLP, have always intrigued me to dig deeper and look into these black-box models. As an experimental use-case to learn more, I have tried to develop a Genre Classifier (version 1.0.0) that predicts whether the film is a Comedy or a Drama from its plot/synopsis. Let\u2019s get started.", "I have based this project on the IMDB Dataset. The original datasets contain a ton of information from the language of the film to the cast details. For my current use-case, I will only be limiting myself with the plot and the genre of the movie. The original dataset contains 26 genres, however, I decided to take it one step at a time and aim to fit a binary classifier first on 2 classes i.e Comedy and Drama. This is how my raw data looks:", "The first task is to convert the text into a language the machine can understand. These include a plethora of steps such as Tokenization and Embedding, each with different flavors. If you are new to NLP, this article will bring you up to speed with the general techniques to approach NLP problems.", "Being an avid user of the Keras library, the text was processed and tokenized using Keras. For my word embeddings, I chose GLoVe. While Keras Embedding gives you the flexibility to use several word embeddings, the performance boost from the pre-trained Glove Embeddings was unmatched.", "An important takeaway for any Data Science project is GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out), no amount of model development will be able to compensate for garbage data. This Kaggle kernel will show you exactly how choosing the right text preprocessing and Word Embeddings can make a difference to the final model. Once we have the data ready we can proceed with the model construction.", "Trying different permutations and combinations, for what seemed like centuries, I finally constructed a Bidirectional LSTM Neural Network which gave me a reasonable performance (85% accuracy on the test set).", "The softmax activation function in the final Dense layer returns the probability distribution of the potential outcomes. So for example, if the model returned a probability distribution of 70% Comedy and 30% Drama, the movie plot will be classified as a Comedy.", "Now, this is where things get interesting. I tried my model on different plots from some of my favorite films. Since there are so many of them I have shortlisted the ones where the model performed exceptionally well. Let\u2019s start with the excerpts from one of my favorite comedy films.", "\u201cTwo days before his wedding, Doug and three friends drive to Las Vegas for a wild and memorable stag party. In fact, when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning, they can\u2019t remember a thing; nor can they find Doug. With little time to spare, the three hazy pals try to re-trace their steps and find Doug so they can get him back to Los Angeles in time to walk down the aisle.\u201d", "As some you may have guessed, it is the synopsis of \u2018The Hangover\u2019. My model came up with the following prediction for the plot.", "Trying it on another of my favorites, Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s drama film \u2018Blood Diamond\u2019, yielded the following results.", "\u201cAs civil war rages through 1990s Sierra Leone, two men, a South African mercenary and a Mende fisherman become joined in a common quest to recover a rare gem that has the power to transform their lives. With the help of an American journalist the men embark on a hazardous trek through rebel territory to achieve their goal.\u201d", "These were quite accurate predictions. However, it isn\u2019t always sunshine and rainbows, as the model is far from perfect!. The driving engine of an NLP model is the vocabulary and its corresponding spatial association with other similar words. And, just like the human brain, this engine has to be tuned and trained to understand the context in which the word was used. This was something my model could not delineate clearly. It struggles a little when it sees out of context words. For example the movie \u2018Joker\u2019.", "\u201cForever alone in a crowd, failed comedian Arthur Fleck seeks connection as he walks the streets of Gotham City. Arthur wears two masks \u2014 the one he paints for his day job as a clown, and the guise he projects in a futile attempt to feel like he\u2019s part of the world around him. Isolated, bullied and disregarded by society, Fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the Joker.\u201d", "Possibly influenced by the word \u2018comedian\u2019, the model misclassifies the above as a \u2018Comedy\u2019 whereas the film, in reality, is completely the opposite.", "On the bright side, there are advanced techniques to deal with this problem, which I will be exploring next in my quest to build a Multi-Class Classifier. Thank you very much for reading. I will upload a documented Colab Notebook soon, so you can use this as a base to improve it and/or try out your ideas.", "Your home for data science.
