It is able to automate a huge number of current processes that are a part of jobs today. There are two key general approaches to machine learning: supervised and unsupervised. Both can be used to solve many classification or regression problems.", "Suppose we want to predict, for example, \u201cIs Jonathon in the US\u201d. Then you would use supervised learning. In supervised learning, the learner has a dataset of features and, for each of the labels, there\u2019s a set of training instances. The key is to choose the ideal classifier such that it learns what the data should be predicting, given the training examples.", "Imagine a crime detection system. We want to compare a description of a high profile crime and a similar low profile crime in the future with their expected results. This is an example of supervised machine learning. Here is an informative blog post to learn more about NLP and machine learning and see the code used to help generate that future search history.", "When using unsupervised machine learning, we don\u2019t have anything like an labeled data set (yet). Instead, we have an unlabeled \u201csource\u201d data set. To predict a crime we need to learn what the historical reasons have been for a number of crimes. We use data mining methods to identify factors that have a strong association with crime.", "But machine learning also consists of a process of creating a dataset from unlabeled data. We apply some machine learning methods to create a set of unlabeled data points. Those points serve as labels for our classification task. This process is called training.", "Now that we have an unlabeled data set and a set of training examples, we can run the classification task. At this point, the classifier doesn\u2019t know what is the predicted label (the class to which it should assign the data points). It just knows how to predict it. But some classifiers may require to run many more training examples in order to converge. This is called learning rate.", "We can use a classifier based approach which relies on a pairwise link structure between some input features and our output label. An example is a decision tree. The tree just consists of a tree directory which is the features (class labels) for each of the desired feature links.", "For example, we might want to predict the length of the message in the post in each of the categories of interest. But a user just wants the title. So, the tree directory might have just one entry for each category. Each entry would describe one class of messages, and each tree entry would give some tree links for which the sum of values from the left axis plus the right axis was higher than a number we picked. The values were computed from some random sampling.", "This will work for some class labels. However, with additional training examples it becomes almost useless. We end up with lots of tree entries for the wrong categories, and that will cause none to converge.", "Now, consider a world where we live in a city with WiFi. In order to detect activity and movements in that urban environment, there is lots of data and lots of ways of communicating that data. Instead of just issuing a warning on TV sets, for example, we might be able to use cameras. Each of the pairs of markers on the image sensor may indicate activity in that neighborhood. Using these features, a system could classify activities and activities could be detected accurately. To do this, a system has to learn the activity pattern on a background and predict where the user is. This will take lots of examples to converge.", "As for each data point, one can train a machine learning model, so that the model is able to predict the \u201cfuture class\u201d of a data point. The training can be done with backpropagation. Usually, regression problems also involve some sort of object detection problems. So, a combination of object detection and machine learning is required.", "In some cases, the model learning problems are too complex to solve with supervised machine learning techniques. In other cases, human machine learning experts have to implement and implement the model. But, for training the model, we can use some machine learning algorithms like Gradient Boosting, support vector machines, AdaBoost, Residual rank learning and to some extent, Random Forests.", "Machine Learning is great tool for classifying, predicting and generating insights from data, both labeled and unlabeled.", "As a Machine Learning Engineer (or Data Scientist, there\u2019s no universal standard for job titles here) you will be solving real world problems based on data. Your data may include images, audio files or text documents. The first step will always be cleaning of your data to make it easier to use and implement machine learning algorithms on it. Then comes the time to explore data and think about algorithms you might want to use to succeed.", "Finally, if you want to have an overview of what it means to be a Data Scientist, then have a look at my book Data Science Job: How to become a Data Scientist which will guide you through the process.", "If you want to read more about Machine Learning and Data Science, have a look at my other articles:", "Your home for data science.
