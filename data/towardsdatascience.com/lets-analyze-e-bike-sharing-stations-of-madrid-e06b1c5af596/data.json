I will also try to classify each station in the Madrid neighborhood.", "Please note that the figures, the dataset, the maps and the Python notebook discussed in this article can be found (for free of course) on GitHub.", "The company Empresa Municipal de Transportes de Madrid provides lots of data in an open format on the Open data EMT Madrid. This dataset, limited to the BiciMAD service, concerns the hourly situation of the stations for the months of July, August and September 2018 and the details of the individual rentals from April 2017 to September 2018. As this analysis concerns the stations, the most interesting files are without any doubt the first ones.", "Let\u2019s download the Situaci\u00f3n estaciones bicimad por d\u00eda y hora de Septiembre de 2018 archive to find out what data we have. Unlike data related to the rentals of bicycles, there is no guide explaining the fields and how the data were pretreated before being extracted, saved and uploaded online", "The file is a RAR archive that contains a single JSON file. Each line of the file is a separate JSON file entity, that contains two elements at the first level: the date-time and a series of data related to the situation of the stations at that specific time.", "The data have a good level of detail (hourly) and would allow a more in-depth analysis if the availability of months covered more than just three months. Considering the seasonality of the city\u2019s tourist flow and the continental climate of Madrid, which is characterized by high temperatures during summer and low temperatures during winter, I cannot consider these three summer months as significant to estimate the rest of the year.", "In this regard, as our goal is to build a registry of the stations, I considered the most updated data available, that is the first row of the September 2018 file, which is the situation of 2018\u201309\u201330T23:42:38.647290\u2033", "At first glance it is evident that the data (in terms of columns) we need less than those provided by EMT, taking into account the purpose of this work and all the considerations made so far.", "The first step of the analysis consists of mapping each BiciMAD station in the neighborhood it belongs to. This has as a side effect, a verification that all the GPS coordinates of the stations are geographically within the metropolitan area of Madrid.", "In practical terms, it is necessary to find a list of Madrid neighborhoods and their boundaries in a lat / long coordinate system, to construct polygons using the available data and to evaluate which of these each station belongs.", "What is the top web site for downloading free geographical data? Obviously Open Street Map!", "From this table, I could find the tag used to identify neighborhoods in Spanish cities, which is 9, so I generated a GeoJSON file from Madrid data which has admin_level=9 AND boundary=administrative.", "At this point, I have defined three Python functions that can generate polygons and verify that each station belongs to one of them.", "The results of this elaboration are saved into this CSV file, it will be useful for future applications.", "The second level of analysis has been conducted considering the number of bicycle bases for each station and, contrary to my expectations, they are made up almost of standard modules, in fact, the number is always between 18 and 30.", "As it is easy to verify, in the case of particularly barycentric points for cyclist flows (for example close to other nodes of the transport network), the company that manages BiciMAD bikes has positioned more than one stations rather than \u201cat the logical level\u201d consider a single station with more bases.", "At this point, I can also make some general assessments considering the total number of e-bike that the network can support (which is the total number of bases considering that every time a user should have al least one bases where park a bike), 4095 bases and evaluate their distribution in the individual neighborhoods.", "As was easily expected, the Madrid Center neighborhood contains the largest number of seats. This is evident as it is in this district that the tourist flows are more concentrated and moreover it is here that we expect that the flows of workers who use the BiciMAD service to commute to work.", "As a \u201cbonus\u201d I decided to generate a map of the individual stations, this with a dual purpose: to give an easy tool to view roughly any areas of Madrid not covered by the stations and to provide not Madrid people with a representation of their location, to facilitate their life in case they decide to go to the Spanish capital city and use the BiciMAD service.", "The map, generated with Folium module, is available here.", "Your home for data science.
