Manipulating and transforming matrix indices is an exceptional ability to comprehend as a data engineer. The idea is to learn math beneath it. When you understand the algorithm, all you need to do is playing with indices to get the answer.", "In this post, I would share step by step the algorithm to implement the Matrix Factorization function. The code snippet would be in R; however, you can generate the code in any language you prefer.", "Matrix factorization is a significant approach in many applications. There are supercomputers built to do matrix factorizations. For instance, radars that track flights utilize a strategy called Kalman filtering. At the core of Kalman Filtering is a Matrix Factorization activity. Kalman Filters are illuminating straight frameworks of conditions when they track your flight utilizing radars. Another great example is Google, where Matrix factorization applied to develop a collaborative filtering model.", "Matrix factorization algorithms work by decomposing the original matrix into two matrices one is the upper triangle ( U ), and the other is the lower triangle ( L ). In this tutorial, I would stick with the factorizing the square matrix A into LU, as demonstrated below.", "Please Note: For simplicity, We don\u2019t have to worry about permuting rows of A, and can assume that A is less than 5x5. Finally, the matrix entry point (the pivot) is not equal to zero. The goal of this tutorial is to understand the math and can execute it into code. The more complicated version will be posted in a separate article soon.", "Matrix A is a square i by j matrix, factorized into L and U matrices. The goal is to obtain zeros in the upper-right corner of the matrix \u2014 (L), and zeros in the lower-left corner of the matrix \u2014 (U).", "In this case, we need to find a way to reduce the mentioned values into zero. It is essential to understand that we have to factorize the matrix without row exchange \u2014 we need to keep row order. In this case, we would use the row reduction method from linear algebra.", "To understand more, let\u2019s have an example, suppose we have a square matrix with a dimension of 3 X 3, as illustrated below.", "To get the zeros in the lower-left corner of this matrix, we would do the following:", "What I\u2019ve done here is that I divide 4 over 2 \u2014 which is called the multiplier, then multiply it with the first row. After that, deduct the first row from the second row. Finally, put the results in the second row.", "Repeat these steps into the third row. Note that the first row should remain the same.", "Now, we need to reduce 6 into 0. We can do that by implementing the following:", "Note that I used R2 instead of R1 because I don\u2019t want to lose the zero I got in the third row. Accordingly, I applied the equation to the second row alternately.", "The L-matrix is direct and straightforward. It is an echelon diagonal matrix \u2014 ones in the diagonal, and zeros in the upper-right corner. The reminder values would be the multipliers we had by row reduction with the U-matrix located in the same indices.", "So the L-matrix final value would look like that:", "After understanding the math, it is time to build a generic computer program to factorize any matrix with comparatively large in dimensions.", "The basic idea is iterating over columns of the matrix then loop through every row to derive the multiplier. We started j at 2 because we need to keep the first row the same. We set a condition that only executes when the row is higher than the column because we want to move diagonally. We continuously want to keep the zeros we got from reduction.", "Here is the algorithm implementation using R-language. You can implement the same using any language you prefer.", "The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n2) because of executing two nested for-loop \u2014 reference.", "Try to keep solving matrices challenges and learning math tricks to beat that kind of interview questions. It is helpful that you can catch the algorithmic pattern once you see the problem. Doing so would help you ace the interview and leave a good impression to your interviewers.", "Finally, I hope this post would benefit other people in the interview process. I would appreciate it if you can resolve the challenge by yourself in different languages or using different algorithms.
