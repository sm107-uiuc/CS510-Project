What we saw was an uneven, shifting, modular structure. Many characters clustered into dense cliques who co-appeared primarily with each other, linked by a few characters whose co-appearances cut across them, linking characters who did not tend to co-appear through relatively short paths. All the characteristics are signature of a \u201csmall world\u201d network.", "It\u2019s easy to see how such social structures might emerge quite commonly. People tend to form \u201ccommunities\u201d in which everyone knows everyone else, members of each community tend to have a few relationships to people in other communities, and a few people \u2014 political and community leaders, for example \u2014 are connected to people across many communities.", "In Episode 2, we\u2019ll look into this topology in more detail and quantify some of its key features \u2014 density, clustering, bridging, and path lengths \u2014 to draw firmer conclusions about the co-appearance network and prepare to dig into the network positions and advantages of individual characters.", "The small-world effect first emerged in Stanley Milgram\u2019s (1967) classic study, which described an experiment in which letters were passed from acquaintance to acquaintance and from which he concluded that many pairs of apparently distant people were connected by very short chains of acquaintances. The typical length of this chain in his study was roughly six, a number that has passed into folklore and been immortalized in John Guare\u2019s (1990) play Six Degrees of Separation. Although biases were present in Milgram\u2019s study\u2014for example, letters that took longer paths were more likely to be lost or forgotten\u200a\u2014\u200ahis results are usually taken as evidence of support for the hypotheses that most pairs of people in a population can be connected by a short connecting path of acquaintances, even in large populations that contain social structures such as insular communities or geographical and cultural barriers. Milgram referred to this phenomenon as the \u201csmall world effect\u201d. More recently, Watts and Strogatz (1998) formalized this depiction, defining a small world as a network that exhibits a combination of short paths and social structure, the latter being characterized in terms of high network clustering. These two conditions are now taken as the standard definition of a small world, and reveal the significance of network topologies for understanding nature and workings of small worlds. (Adapted from Baum et al., 2004).", "How dense (or conversely, sparse) are the connections among characters? We can answer this question by considering the relative numbers of nodes (characters) and edges (co-appearances) comprising the network. These are shown in Figure 1, by episode.", "The number of characters grows quickly during Seasons 1 and 2, and then more slowly as character introductions slow and deaths mount. After peaking at 126 during Season 6, the number of characters falls precipitously, as story lines converge, leaving some characters behind, and others to die. At the end of Season 7, fewer characters remain than appeared in the first episode of Season 1. (Perhaps unsurprisingly \u2014 of the 44 characters introduced in the first episode only 13 appeared in the Season 7 finale!)", "The number of co-appearances follows the same general pattern, keeping the average number of edges per character relatively constant at between 8\u20139, although larger, between 13\u201316, during Seasons 1 and 7.", "Together, the ratio of edges to nodes indicate a relatively sparsely-connected, or low density\u00a0network. That is, a relatively small fraction of possible edges (i.e., if all nodes had edges with all others) is realized. Consider, for example, episode 35 in which co-appearances among 110 characters created 1,092 edges. While this may seem like a large number, it represents a density of only 9% of 11,990 possible edges (i.e., 110*109). Figure 2 shows network density between 8\u201310% during Seasons 2\u20136, after falling from over 30% early in Season 1. Density jumps during Season 7, reaching nearly 50% in the final two episodes. This jump coincides with the transition we observed in Episode 1 as the graph collapsed into a single clique when the previously separate story lines merged and their central characters allied in the face of growing White Walker threat.", "Despite its overall sparsity, the graph of the co-appearance network nevertheless revealed an uneven structure, with densely-clustered regions that were sparsely linked. But, how clustered \u2014 and so unevenly connected \u2014 is the co-appearance network?", "To answer this question, we can compute the network\u2019s clustering coefficient, which measures the ratio of \u201cclosed triplets\u201d \u2014 triangles with all edges drawn \u2014 to \u201copen triplets\u201d \u2014 triangles with an edge missing. The coefficient is 0 if all triplets are \u201copen\u201d, and 1 if all \u201cclosed\u201d. Where we see clustering in a network graph, we can thus expect to find many triangles. A high proportion of \u201cclosed\u201d triplets in the co-appearance network means that characters tend to co-appear with each other.", "Figure 3 shows clustering coefficients by episode as well as clustering coefficients for \u201crandom networks\u201d with the same numbers of edges and nodes as the actual network in each episode. Clustering coefficients for the random network, which tend to be small, give a benchmark against which to assess clustering in the actual network (Watts & Strogatz, 1998).", "Clustering coefficients for the co-appearance network range between 0.7\u20130.8, but slightly higher at the start of Season 1 and end of Season 7 (when network density was also higher). This means that between 70\u201380% of the network\u2019s \u201ctriplets\u201d were \u201cclosed\u201d. Clustering coefficients are far lower for the random networks, between 0.08\u20130.09, except at the start of Season 1 and end of Season 7. So, clustering coefficients are 8\u201310 times larger for the actual co-appearance network.", "Now that we\u2019ve quantified the clustered network regions, let\u2019s look into the connections that cut across and link them. In the Episode 1 graphs, these \u201cbridges\u201d appeared to result from a few characters co-appearing with characters who tended not to co-appear with each other \u2014 they formed \u201copen\u201d triads linking otherwise disconnected characters by a short path.", "We can quantify the nature of these bridges by considering distributions of betweenness and degree centrality in the co-appearance network. In the charts of these distributions given below, only main characters (regular and recurring) are included; minor characters score low on both measures, adding many observations near zero.", "Betweenness measures the extent to which a character lies on the shortest paths between other characters, with higher scores indicating more shortest paths. The distribution, shown in Figure 4, is highly skewed. Most main characters lie on no shortest paths, a few lie on a few shortest paths, and a very few lie on many. This skewness makes a small number of characters individually significant, their high betweenness conferring on them the potential to control flows of information and resources.", "Degree is the number of other characters a given character co-appears with. Again the degree distribution, shown in Figure 5, is skewed, though less severely. Most main characters co-appear with 10 or fewer other characters per episode, a few with 10-20, and a very few with more than 20.", "The difference in these distributions\u2019 skewness reflects some high-degree characters lying on few shortest paths. Such characters occupy densely clustered regions of the graph; Daenerys Targaryen is an example. Mother of Dragons aside, low-degree nodes tend to belong to dense clusters and those clusters to be connected to each other by high-degree (and high-betweenness) nodes.", "This skewness has implications for the length of paths between nodes in a network. When skewness is high the \u201cdiameter\u201d of a network\u2014the maximum distance between nodes\u2014is largely unaffected by increases in network size (Cohen & Havelin, 2003). The skewness of these distributions thus implies relatively few steps between characters in co-appearance network.", "Path length is the final Small World puzzle piece. We can compute the length of paths between characters by summing all the shortest paths between them and dividing by the total number of paths. The chart below shows the result, by episode. And, again as benchmark, for random networks with the same numbers of nodes and edges. While, as we have seen, random graphs tend to have small clustering coefficients, they also tend to have relatively small average path length (Watts & Strogatz, 1998).", "As Figure 6 shows, the average path between characters is 2\u20133 steps, except during Seasons 1 and 7, when it is below 2. While somewhat longer than the short paths characterizing the random network, the bridges thus do result in the short distances the skewness anticipated. Along these short paths, information is able to quickly reach otherwise distant regions of the network in just a few steps.", "Quantitatively, we have found the character of the co-appearance network to be highly modular, with clustering higher and average path length nearly as short as random networks with the same number of nodes and edges. We can use these insights to compute the Small World Quotient (Q) to quantify the \u201csmall-worldliness\u201d of the co-appearance network topology.", "Q compares the clustering coefficient (CC) and average path lengths (PL) of actual (a) networks with random (r) networks with the same number of nodes and edges. Specifically, Q = [CC(a)/CC(r)]/[PL(a)/PL(r)]. The more a network has CC(a) >> CC(r) and PL(a) ~ PL(r), the more \u201csmall-worldly\u201d it is, and the larger Q. If Q > 1, the graph is said to be a Small World.", "We know from our earlier investigations of clustering and path length that CC(a) is 8\u201310 times larger than CC(r) and that PL(a) ~ PL(r), so we anticipate Q > 1.", "Figure 7 confirms this. Q rises from 2 to 8 during Seasons 1 and 2, then ranges between 5-8 until it peaks around 9 in Season 6 before declining rapidly. By the end of Season 7, Q has fallen close to 1, the Small World collapsing as the alliances forming among the central characters in the face of the White Walker threat folds the network into a single clique.", "Well. That confirms it, then. It is indeed a Small World of Ice and Fire\u2026 Well, for most of its seven Seasons.", "In the next episode (link below), we\u2019ll turn our attention to the characters comprising the network. Who is advantageously positioned within the network? Who has lost or squandered an network advantage? Who has the power to control flows of information and resources? Who can command trust and loyalty? And how did they come to possess (or lose) these network advantages?", "New to GoT Season 7.5?
