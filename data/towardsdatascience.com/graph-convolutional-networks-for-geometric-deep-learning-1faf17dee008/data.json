The kernel aggregates the pixels into a values in grid format to prepare it for pooling.", "Once again, a \u201cscanner\u201d type of operation is performed, but instead of aggregating a bunch of pixels, pooling singles out only the most important values (max pooling) or averages all the values (mean pooling) and uses that to construct a grid of values for flattening.", "Flattening simply takes the final grid structure of the pooling operation and truncates them into an array that can then be put through a forward feeding neural model, which finally outputs a prediction.", "Convolutions on graphs however, is much more challenging. Graphs are not so simply manipulated due to their irregular structure. Images are represented on a 2 dimensional Euclidean grid, where a kernel can move left, right, etc. Graphs are non-euclidean, and the notion of directions like up, down, etc. don\u2019t have any meaning.

So the ultimate question is:", "How do we generalize convolutions for graph data?", "The key to generalizing the convolution is the kernel/filter. We will see that the biggest difference between Graph Learning approaches is in the kernel, or what the kernel is operates on.", "At a high level, convolutions aggregate information from surrounding or adjacent entities.

This subfield is known as Graph Signal Processing (GSP).", "GSP is the key to generalizing convolutions, allowing us to build functions that can take into account both the overall structure of the graph and the individual properties of the graph\u2019s components.", "GSP uses signal processing functions like the fourier transform, which is usually a tool reserved for signals/frequencies, and applies them to graphs. It is the graph fourier transform that allows one to introduce the notion of a \u201cbandwidth\u201d or \u201csmoothness\u201d to a graph. In the spatial sense of the term, smoothness just means how close the each value of a collection of things are, relative to each other. In the spectral sense, it\u2019s a bit more complicated.", "Analogous to smooth time signals, which have a narrow frequency band width, a graph that exhibits clustering properties will have a narrow band width in the GFT (signals vary less within clusters of highly interconnected nodes). In other words, a clustered graph would be sparse in the frequency domain allowing for a more efficient representation of the data (frequency, non-euclidean, and spectral domain mean the same thing). For a bit of spectral intuition, you can find a great summary in this great article.", "In GCNs, node features and attributes are represented by \u201csignals\u201d. We can then use concepts in signal processing to learn from the data. Usually, a signal isn\u2019t just the node or edge feature taken as is, but rather it\u2019s a function that is applied to the feature.", "Convolutions can be computed in by finding the eigendecomposition of the graph Laplacian. Eigendecomposition is a way of factoring a matrix into a set of eigenvectors and eigenvalues. This is also called spectral decompositoin, hence the name Spectral Graph Convolutional Networks. Calculating the eigenvectors of the Laplacian, returns the Fourier basis for the graph. Since the calculation is performed on the Laplacian, there will be as many eigenvectors as graph nodes. Directly solving a decomposition is intensive, hence many approaches opt to approximate the spectral decomposition instead. For a in depth understanding of spectral decomposition, Machine Learning Mastery has a great post about this operation.", "The original paper on spectral graph theory was the inspiration for this entire family of graph learning methods. These are some of the most popular.", "ChebNets is one of the first and most important papers on spectral graph learning. Spectral convolutions are defined as the multiplication of a signal (node features/attributes) by a kernel. This is similar to the way convolutions operate on an image, where a pixel value is multiplied by a kernel value.", "The kernel used in a spectral convolution made of Chebyshev polynomials of the diagonal matrix of Laplacian eigenvalues.

Finally, T stands for the Chebyshev polynomials of the kth order.", "The kernel equals the sum of all Chebyshev polynomial kernels applied to the diagonal matrix of scaled Laplacian eigenvalues for each order of k up to K-1.", "The original ChebNet paper also introduces pooling methods, another key component of the complete vanilla convolution, by using graph coursening. This additional step increases efficiency and brings graph convolutions a step closer to their vanilla cousins.", "ChebNet implicitly avoids computing the eigendomposition opting to approximate it instead. In this regard, ChebNets are very similar to the Graph Convolutional Network by Thomas Kipf et al. GCNs are essentially a first order ChebNet (first order and second order+ are explained in my previous article), with some other simplified operations to reduce complexity.", "First order simply means that the metric used to determine the similarity between 2 nodes is based on the node\u2019s immediate neighborhood. Second order (and beyond) means the metric used to determine similarity considers a node\u2019s immediate neighborhood, but also the similarities between the neighborhood structures (with each increasing order, the depth of which nodes are considered increases). The order that is considered within a convolution is denoted by K (k for the smallest order), in most papers.", "ChebNets does not limit K to any value, and so the model is capable of learning a given node\u2019s any-order neighborhood. GCNs however, limit their K values to 1, thereby limiting a convolution\u2019s range to 1st order similarity.", "Among the most cited works in graph learning is a paper by Kipf and Welling. The paper introduced spectral convolutions to graph learning, and was dubbed simply as \u201cgraph convolutional networks\u201d, which is a bit misleading since it is classified as a spectral method and is by no means the origin of all subsequent works in graph learning.", "In Kipf and Welling\u2019s GCN, a convolution is defined by:", "Where g\u03b8 is a kernel (\u03b8 represents the parameters) which is applied (represented by the star) to x, a graph signal.

The D to the power of -1/2 are parts of a renormalization trick to avoid both exploding or vanishing gradients.", "Equation 1 and 3 are the the components that are wrapped in an activation function (Relu, Sigmoid, etc.). The combined result is the layer-wise propagation rule that makes up a single layer of a GCN. The key innovation is the use of the Fourier transform, a popular operation in quantum mechanics (in the study of Q-bits) and signal processing (in the study of waves).", "ChebNets and GCNs are very similar, but their largest difference is in their choices for value K in eqn. 1. In a GCN, the layer wise convolution is limited to K = 1. This is intended to alleviate the risk of overfitting on a local neighborhood of a graph. The original paper by Kipf et al. further explain how this makes the architecture linear with respect to the Laplacian, simplifying the overall model complexity.", "At a high level, GCN uses the graph Fourier transform to aggregate neighboring node features and attributes. These features and attributes are represented as signals, which are component decompositions of the latent graph. This is analogous to how component frequencies are decompositions of a sound wave; component frequencies are node features (as signals), and the sound wave signal is a latent graph.", "GCNs performed well in node classification tasks and other graph applications, but the main drawback is how eigenvalues tend to cluster together in a very small range, with large gaps in between each cluster. The same can be emphasized to a lesser degree for ChebNets. This is problem later solved by CayleyNets.", "The biggest drawbacks to Spectral Convolutions is their tendency to be very computationally expensive. The kernel is defined in Fourier space and graph Fourier transforms are notoriously expensive to compute. It requires multiplication of node features with the eigenvector matrix of the graph Laplacian, which is a O(N\u00b2) operation for a graph with N nodes.", "And so the problem that IBM researchers set out to solve was how to improve the computational efficiency while still retaining the best possible results. FastGCN was thus born out of the need for scalable spectral graph convolutions. The project essentially modified the original GCN architecture to be able to use Monte Carlo (biased random sampling method) approaches to consistently estimate the integrals, which allowed for batch training, reducing the overall training time.", "Simplified Graph convolutions (SGCs) on the other hand, approached the problem differently; instead of improving computational efficiency, perhaps reducing computational complexity is the natural solution. Their experiment results are on shown on the diagram to the left. The premise behind their hypothesis:", "\u201c We hypothesize that the nonlinearity between GCN layers is not critical \u2014 but that the majority of the benefit arises from the local averaging.\u201d", "The project removed the nonlinear transition functions between each convolutional layer. The final softmax activation allowed for probabilistic outputs that can be optimized with stochastic gradient descent.", "CayleyNets improves upon ChebNet\u2019s high computational expense problem using a secret ingredient. As indicated by the name, this approach uses the Cayley transform (represented by unit half-circle) to fix the problem.", "At a high level, the transform helps \u201czoom\u201d into skewed datapoints as shown in this wacky GIF.", "Cayley polynomials share similar properties with the Chebshev polynomials in ChebNets, including the useful notion of localization (note that in both approaches, \u201cpolynomials\u201d refers to the function that acts as the kernel/filter).", "Cayley has proven to perform better on a wide range of Graph Learning tasks due to their ability to detect narrow frequency bands of importance during training, and to specialize on them while being well-localized on the graph.", "Thanks to a parameter (h) in the Cayley kernel/filter, smaller eigenvalues on the spectrum can be spread apart, allowing the kernels to specialize in different frequencies. This is visualized in the 3 diagrams from the original paper demonstrating the normalizing power of the parameter (h), where the marks indicate the eigenvalues (red being that which holds important info).", "Side by side, CayleyNets (orange) mostly outperformed ChebNets (blue), whilst requiring less parameters.", "MotifNets was a different approach that built upon the original GCN model by introducing the notion of \u201cmotifs\u201d. Essentially, the mode partitions input graphs into motifs which are unique substructures of x length, such that any graph in the dataset can be built by some combination of the motifs.", "These motifs are of size x = 3. Notice that the motifs take into directionality of edges into consideration, a detail in graph theory that has been omitted in previous graph learning approaches. This is especially useful for applications that have an intrinsic notion of direction such as social networks, transportation networks, and energy grids.", "ChebNet is a instance of MotifNet with a single Laplacian of an undirected graph, in which a matrix of Chebyshev polynomials is used. Each convolutional layer of a MotifNet has a multivariate matrix polynomial (a fancy kernel where each element is a polynomial with multiple variables), which is applied to and learns from the motif\u2019s Laplacian matrices.", "Despite the efficiency of ChebNet and GCN, both methods struggle when dealing with graphs containing clustered eigenvalues, a phenomenon typically concurring in community graphs. In this regard, MotifNet strives to fix the same weakness as CayleyNet.", "Robust, reliable, and researched, spectral convolutions kick-started interest in Graph Learning and Geometric Deep Learning as a whole. Even Yann Lecun and other researchers at the forefront of this niche have made contributions.", "However, spectral methods have no shortage of weaknesses and drawbacks, but that\u2019s a topic for another post.", "The beauty of GraphSage is its simplicity. The model is holds top-tier and remains competitive in terms of performance, even with newer or more powerful models. It is especially powerful because it scales well with large, dense, homogenous, dynamic networks.

The original paper proposed 3 aggregation functions", "The target node uses the aggregated neighborhood node features to make a prediction via neural network, which can be a task like node classification, or structure/context determination. This is where the learning happens. This 3 step process is repeated for every node in the graph in a supervised manner. A visual representation to the approach is shown below:", "Experiments showed that pooling aggregation performed best, as well as being the most efficient to compute. The effectiveness of GraphSage is why it is one of the few Graph Learning models currently implemented in a real-world application. Pintrest, the photo sharing website, currently uses GraphSage (albeit modified and renamed PinSage) to predict relevant photos based on the user\u2019s interests and search queries.", "MoNet has seen much success in further research and development, with the original paper becoming the inspiration and spawn point for numerous approaches and architectures including Geodesic CNNs (GCNNs), Anistropic CNNs (ACNNs), Spline CNNs, and Diffusion CNNs.", "The original MoNet paper had a 3-fold contribution", "MoNet\u2019s generalization first considers variable x as a point in the manifold or node in a graph depending on the application, task, and input.
