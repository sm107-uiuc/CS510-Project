Well, that\u2019s the idea behind Ai4 Healthcare.", "Ai4 Healthcare is a two day conference in NYC that focuses on bringing data practitioners, medical clinicians, and business leaders together to facilitate the discussion around the use of artificial intelligence in healthcare. The event featured over 85 speakers, plenty of networking opportunities and technical/non-technical \u201ctrack\u201d guidance on which talks to attend. Being as I was writing for Towards Data Science and am an engineer myself, I focused mostly on the technical talks.", "My observations at the conference very clearly indicate that Ai4 Healthcare represents a much needed conversation between all of these professionals to ensure that the goals of the clinicians and technologists align. The most common goals I noticed were:", "Imagine a world where physicians can spend a meaningful amount of time with patients. What impact would that have on the healthcare landscape? How would medicine be impacted if physicians didn\u2019t feel as stressed? How would patients fare if the cost of healthcare wasn\u2019t so high? The American Medical Association (AMA) has been thinking about these very aspects of practice and how the integration of artificial intelligence into the practice of medicine can help move toward such a future.", "In the United States, the average spend per capita on healthcare is around $10,000 per year (Figure 1). On top of that it value being double the spend of many wealthy nations, it\u2019s believed that approximately 25\u201330% of that is wasted on various systemic inefficiencies. Luckily increasing efficiency is one of the major strengths of data science. One question we might need to first answer is from where do we get the data?", "Since the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), the adoption of electronic health record systems (EHRs) dramatically increased (Figure 2). ARRA included funding that would help with the switch to EHRs. It also tied Medicare reimbursements to \u201cmeaningful use\u201d of EHRs by January 2014.", "While there are concerns about the use of EHRs, there are multiple benefits. EHRs provide unprecedented access to patient information \u2014 which allows for coordination of care, increased efficacy in diagnosis and safer care. Additionally, EHRs provide a wealth of information that can be utilized to improve the standard of care, improve the quality of care, or even find disease outbreaks earlier.", "Another concern of the AMA is the wellbeing of physicians. Physicians face burnout at a rate nearly twice that of the general public. Figure 3 highlights the main sources of burnout, as per the Medscape National Physician Burnout, Depression & Suicide Report (2019). At the top of the list we have: too many bureaucratic tasks; too many hours at work; and EHRs.", "The AMA sees the term Augmented Intelligence as the way forward. This conceptualization of artificial intelligence focuses on using artificial intelligence in an assistive role, in order to emphasize that its design enhances human intelligence rather than replacing it. Augmented intelligence would feature machine learning models that can reduce the workload of clinicians \u2014 either by helping in diagnosis or reducing time spent doing administrative work. The conference featured two products that aim specifically to reduce the time spent charting \u2014 Suki and Saykara.", "The AMA has an entire section of their site dedicated to the role of artificial intelligence in the healthcare system.", "Dr. Prakash Gatta dreams of a day where patients can have access to high quality standardized surgical care irrespective of their location. Gatta is a proponent of robot assisted surgery (disclaimer \u2014 he works with Verb Surgical and Intuitive Surgical). In his vision of the future, robotic-assisted surgical systems provide a fantastic platform to enable the standardization of hospital operating equipment.", "Robotic-assisted surgery has numerous benefits including shorter hospitalization, reduced pain and discomfort, faster recovery, reduced risk of infection and reduced blood loss. Additionally, robotic-assisted surgery can reduce costs through the aforementioned improved outcomes and shorter hospitalizations (although a quick search indicates it\u2019s still debated if the cost is lower than traditional laparoscopic surgery). Gatta showed a video of a robotic surgery and described how prior to the laparoscopic/robotic version of the surgery it would have been a major procedure with a long recovery. [Here\u2019s a video of Gatta presenting another robotic surgery, if you\u2019re curious]", "The connection to AI comes from the data generated by the robots. As Gatta pointed out, every movement is a data point. He envisioned a future where the robot would be able to anticipate a surgeon\u2019s next move, either providing feedback or preparing for the next step in the surgery. Additionally, he posited that the system could predict outcomes in real time based on how the surgery was performed. For example, the machine would know that a particularly important step in the surgery took more or less time than average for the surgeon \u2014 providing valuable predictive data.", "All taken together, the prospective standardization of surgical equipment and integration of robust data can be utilized to drive forward the standard of care. Perhaps, in time, Gatta\u2019s dream of access to care will be realized.", "When an algorithm indicates a medical image has a malignancy, what should happen? Should a radiologist blindly believe the result? Why should a radiologist even trust a predictive model in the first place?", "This was a recurring question at the conference \u2014 one I felt was at least partially addressed in a talk called Explainable AI for Training with Weakly Annotated Data featuring work done at Philips by Evan Schwab.", "Medical Images, like chest X-rays (CXR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computed tomography (CT), pose a unique challenge in the field of computer vision. While the positioning of the subject within the image is consistent, the number of training images available is limited and when they are available they typically have limited annotations. In addition, the stakes of being correct are high \u2014 potentially as high as someone\u2019s life.", "The end goal is to create an end-to-end pipeline that accurately automatically classifies and localizes critical findings in the chest X-rays without the local ground truth being annotated (a \u201cstrong\u201d annotation).", "Images from MIT\u2019s MIMIC-Chest X-Ray Database were labeled using natural language processing (NLP) to provide a \u201cweak\u201d annotation, i.e., this CXR has pneumothorax. These images were then processed using patch sampling (to preserve image resolution) and fed into a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). Using a multi-instance learning framework, the model is able to combine the information from each set of patches.", "The resulting predictions allow for a patch by patch classification of the image. This provides explainability as regions predicted to have the malignancy are indicated in the CXR that can be presented to a radiologist, allowing the radiologist to determine the accuracy of the model. Below is a selection of results from the talk.", "Throughout the conference, I made it a point to try to have a quick chat with as many people as possible. I wanted to know what brought them to the conference, their roles and how far they had come. The conference organizers helped everyone out by providing access to Brella, which is a networking app, and building networking breaks into the schedule.", "Brella made it easy for an introvert like me to request meetings with people that I might not have otherwise had the opportunity to meet. Likewise, I styled up my profile to see if I\u2019d be able to entice some of the other attendees to tell me their story.", "I met a number of really interesting people in the field. They traveled from all over the country to be at the conference \u2014 California, Arizona, Rhode Island, Connecticut, Philadelphia, even one from down the road from where I work \u2014 and their reasons for coming varied.", "I found the conference to be an amazing experience. I believe that it provided an excellent opportunity for conversation between professionals in all areas of healthcare and AI. A few of the attendees I had spoken told this conference was the only one they had been to that was this hyper-focused.", "This hyper-focused nature \u2014 along with the diversity of the attendees and speakers \u2014 provided a robust backdrop to have an honest conversation about the state of AI in healthcare and its potential future.", "I\u2019m an AI Enthusiast and Software Developer. As a trained chemist, I spent most of my chemistry career in computational biophysical chemistry before becoming a teacher. Through teaching, I learned the importance and art of storytelling and clear technical writing. Connect with me on LinkedIn or start a conversation on Twitter.", "If you\u2019re in the healthcare and AI field and want to collaborate on an article please let me know.", "Your home for data science.
