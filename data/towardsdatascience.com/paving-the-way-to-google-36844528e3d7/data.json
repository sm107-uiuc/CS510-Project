From financial organizations to technology giants and from New York and Washington D.C. to Seattle and San Francisco I was open to new adventures. In the meantime, at the end of each step and each interview, I thought about what I, as a candidate, and the interview team could have done better.", "What you are about to read is not exactly a roadmap to how to land the next position but more like a recollection of my thoughts about the whole process.", "Most of what I am about to tell have already been published as LinkedIn posts. I know a lot of people are already going through or about to start the path I finished just a couple of months ago and my hope is that my notes on finding the right company, dealing with rejection, preparing for interviews, etc. make their journey more exciting than mine.", "Here is a list of topics I discuss:", "It is not easy but it is worth it!", "Recruiter emails, intro calls, technical questions, weekend projects, on-site visits, rejection letters, negotiations and so on seemed like a never-ending process; a loop I was repeating over and over again.", "The process is exhausting but at the end, at least for my case, was rewarding and well-worth the efforts. I learned a ton and frankly, I became a better data scientist along the way. Interviewing companies in different industry segments, size and location, and discussing a variety of exciting problems they want to hire you for was eye-opening. Every interview helped me prepare for the next one by giving me a better prospect on the needs, the challenges and the expectations.", "Job hunting is a lot like online dating; there are many singles out there but too few matches. Your job is not to marry the first one that goes on a date with you but to find the one with mutual interests and long-term prospects.", "My criteria for evaluating a position!", "What are your criteria for picking the future organization? The brand, the location, compensation package, the job description, the projects you will be working on or even the perks and benefits and flexible work hours; which one has the most important factor? If you had multiple options in a variety of companies, what would you pick and why? Here is my take:", "How can you help companies find you?", "That\u2019s why you need to become your own advocate & help companies separate the signal from noise. The truth is that no one knows your goals and ambitions better than you and a list of skills & projects on your resume simply won\u2019t do it justice.", "If you want to increase your chances of getting hired in the right role & the right company, here are a couple of things to try:", "\u2014 worked in [\u2026], \u2014 gained 3 years of experience in [\u2026], \u2014 defined and measured product metrics, \u2014 become experienced with [\u2026] \u2014 trained machine learning models, \u2014 prepared [\u2026] analysis, \u2014 extensively collaborated with business teams, and \u2014 built analytics dashboards.", "I applied for this position [job ID here] and I hope you will consider my application. Best Your name, Current title", "The ultimate interview tip: forget solutions, build systems!", "The tip is the realization that in most interviews, candidate and interviewer are seeking two different things: while the candidate focuses on the solution, the interviewer is seeking the system. The former relies on technical abilities while the latter is about the process you build to demonstrate them.", "The system is a step by step process you use in order to help the interviewer understand your approach to evaluate and solve the problem and communicate your thinking and your ideas. Something she is way more interested in than just the right answer! If the solution is the story, your system is how you tell your story and it\u2019s the best testimonial to your depth of knowledge and how well you communicate it.", "As an example, I discuss my system for answering a technical question, like a SQL problem:", "Technical skills for becoming a data scientist: my take!", "I used to ask what skills should I acquire and how much should I know to transition to a career in data science. And most of the time the answers were not good enough!", "Leaving how you want to learn them to you, here is my take:", "My system for preparing for technical interviews", "To all my friends experiencing rejection", "I feel your pain & frustration! I went through the same process a couple of weeks ago and I have been rejected by many companies. When confronting frustration, we normally blame ourselves for not being good enough. However, at least for the majority of the people I know, it is far from the truth. Through many interviews, which for a while seemed never-ending, I came to the realization that most of my frustration was with two groups of companies:", "Don\u2019t blame yourself for something you do not have much control over! Instead, learn from every interview, move on and get ready for the next one. There are many companies out there that need your talent, passion and hard work. The more experience you gain, the better you manage any circumstances.", "You are absolutely right on all accounts above. But ONLY for the first half an hour after the rejection! After the first 30 minutes, and before forgetting about the content of the interview and possible flaws in your performance, from the way you framed the problem, your approach to the SQL question or not being familiar with the company/product well-enough, think carefully about what went wrong! Write it down and make sure you take care of it. The truth is there are many things that can go south during an interview and it\u2019s okay! What is not okay is to make the same mistake twice! You just don\u2019t have time for that\u2026", "There are many great companies out there so don\u2019t worry if you messed up an interview!", "In early days, a couple of interviews that I screwed up with some of the technology giants left me in despair. I was afraid that if it continues like that, I will run out of great options and may have to end up somewhere that wasn\u2019t a step forward in my career. Meanwhile, I already had a position in a great company working with an amazing group of people and didn\u2019t want to change my job under any circumstances.", "A couple of things helped me overcome this fear. For example, a simple search on LinkedIn shows a myriad of opportunities from great but less-known organizations with interesting and sometimes disruptive technologies that many of us have never heard about. The truth is that the world is not limited to Facebook or Google. In fact, there are more-than-you-can-even-imagine companies out there that have a healthy culture and supportive teams willing to help you grow and be the best of you.", "Base your important decisions, including taking on a new role, on your hopes rather than your fears: if you are seeking and haven\u2019t found the right organization yet, don\u2019t give up. Keep looking!", "Want to get hired? Work on your technical skills! Want a promotion? Learn institutional knowledge!", "Domain Knowledge & Institutional Knowledge: When my past company\u2019s CEO encouraged me to work on Declined Transactions as my first project after joining the team, I was disappointed! Right out of academia, I was hoping for a complex project like building the best machine learning model. Instead, I was assigned to calculating the ratio of declined to all transactions, to oversimplify it. What I did not know was that my assignment was, not if the most important, but one of the most important problems in Payment Industry.", "What I was missing was not technical skills. Technically, I was capable of doing any type of analysis. 14 publications in 3 different fields of science and in a variety of demanding topics from Cosmology to Nonlinear Optics and Computational Biochemistry, winning multiple research awards and working on my data science skills for about a year, I was ready to do what it takes to showcase my technical abilities; to shine! The missing piece was not math and stats. It was the domain knowledge and business acumen!", "In addition to technical capabilities, data scientists need to develop other skills that allow them to identify the projects that impact the business and empower the stakeholders and prioritize them over any other type of work. To get there, i.e. to develop business acumen, the coexistence of two pieces are necessary; domain knowledge and institutional knowledge!", "Domain knowledge helps you understand the main concepts of your industry sector. Institutional knowledge, on the other hand, focuses on the company you work for: its vision, its competitive advantage, how it operates & generates revenue, its priorities, the history and future plans and so on.", "A domain knowledge expert in Payment Industry may identify fraud and declined transactions as very important problems. Institutional knowledge helps the expert pick one over the other based on which aligns better with the company\u2019s vision.", "Talking to experts in your field, people in your company, subscribing to newsletters, reading the company documents, all and all can help you develop your domain and institutional knowledge.", "Listen to the conversations carefully, remember names and master important concepts mentioned and repeated over and over. And be patient!", "And here is the good news: I have come to the realization that while we get hired for out technical skills, what makes us irreplaceable is the institutional and domain knowledge. It is not normally difficult to replace someone with someone with better technical skills, but it would be very difficult to replace someone that knows the domain well and the institution she works for very well. Therefore, while in the short run, your competitive advantage is your technical skills; in the long run, your domain and institutional knowledge become the one!", "Meet candidates at their comfort zone!", "I argue that If you want to see the candidates at their best, evaluate them in their comfort zone: a suggestion to interviewers!", "During the interview process, phone or on-site, the candidates\u2019 brains are processing a zillion different things at once. Under these circumstances, if your judgment is solely based on their capabilities in understanding problems and challenges related to the new role, you have not evaluated them to the best of their abilities.", "Instead, I suggest that a part of the interview should focus on moving to candidates\u2019 comfort zone and challenging them by asking detailed questions about their past work. This indeed should go beyond a short introduction that normally takes place at the beginning of the interviews.", "This will help build a more comprehensive picture about candidates\u2019 cognitive and technical abilities, their thought process and approaches to the problem, how they deal with challenges and how they are presenting them to you.", "While this requires experienced interviewers, it makes the process fair and helps organizations attract applicants who may end up being a better fit for the role.", "Your home for data science.
