Even more aspects of a Data Scientist\u2019s processes are complicated as well. When you build your models you are relying on the education of development, statistics, software engineering, and much more. Consequently, there needs to be a way to digest this complicated, yet useful and significant data. The main method a Data Scientist can not only communicate to themselves, but also to non-technical stakeholders, is the use of visualizations. I will be describing some of the main reasons Data Scientists need to know data visualization techniques below, rather that be from the exploring of data to the explanation of model results. Please continue reading if you would like to know the top four reasons why a Data Scientist should know how to visualize.", "As a Data Scientist, you cannot simply start a project without getting the green light from stakeholders first. Some of the stakeholders will not understand Data Science concepts and processes at all \u2014 until you explain them well. It is up to you to prove to them that a process could occur including automation and prediction.", "For example, you want to start a project that will help the company classify clothing items quickly on an e-commerce website. In order to get \u2018buy-in\u2019, or proof that this process will be beneficial, you will have to outline the process, the expected resources need, and likely results.", "Here is a simplified written out way of what you would want to describe visually after:", "To summarize this process, you could create a visualization that better describes the proposed process, as well as the timeline involved. There are several ways to approach this visualization. You could create a proof-of-concept by utilizing products like PowerPoint, Google Slides, or some more involved products including Jira, Lucid Charts, Draw.io, and ProductPlan.", "Explaining complicated processes more easily with visualizations ultimately helps both the Data Scientist and stakeholders to reach their end goals.", "Now that we have solved the problem of explaining a complex process to others, we also now know how to solve explaining results to others in an easily interpretable way. The answer, of course, is data visualization. For this example, we assume that we have built a model already and need to explain the results to stakeholders. One of the easiest and best ways to explain results is through simple charts. For example, we will look at results from a model in terms of amount per group. A quick way to show how The United States is performing by the state is through the use of heatmaps. You can color code depending on your respective scale for example. This type of visualization is easier to understand rather than a file with an overwhelming amount of columns with long values.", "Below is an example of a chart you can make to show the results with a heatmap:", "There are countless tools one can use to describe their data visually. Here are some popular ones:", "In the same way that displaying Machine Learning algorthim results to stakeholders is beneficial, so is visualizing data analysis to yourself and your team. The same tools from the above section can also be utilized for this use case. It is important to get a sense of your data before implementing the steps in your Data Science process, like Machine Learning algorthim comparison. You can compare data \u2014 its columns and rows, visually as well.", "Below is an example of how you could arrange different charts for dissecting your data:", "Another way to easily visualize your data is by using Pandas Profiling [5]. With one line of code, df.profile_report(), you can display common and powerful charts, like descriptive statistics through histograms, heatmaps, and matrixes. Below is an example of visualizing your exploratory data analysis with variable examination and correlation plots. These visuals are great for diving into the data to gain a better sense of abnormalities, trends, and relationships between features. This visual analysis can save you time on incorporating possible features into your Machine Learning algorithm as well (before performing feature engineering).", "Data Scientists and Stakeholders may have the most fun and use out of this reason for using visualization. After all the hard work is put in, you can see how your model is performing. You can set up alerts for when accuracy or an error metric like root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) is above or below a certain threshold. Perhaps, you will notice that your model is doing worse as time goes on, suggesting that you either need more data or you need to change something else about your model to make sure that it is similar or better to where it was before.", "Here are some ways you can visualize model performance trends:", "Data Science can be complicated, but there are ways to improve its understanding by means of data visualization. We have covered several reasons why a Data Scientist should not just know programming and statistics but also know visualization techniques.", "Here are the four main reasons I discussed:", "Thank you for reading my article! I hope you found it both interesting and useful. Please feel free to comment down below on the reasons why you use data visualizations as a Data Scientist.", "I am not affiliated with any of these products.", "Your home for data science.
