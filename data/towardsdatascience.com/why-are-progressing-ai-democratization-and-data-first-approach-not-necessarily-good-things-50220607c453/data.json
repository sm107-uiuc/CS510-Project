Artificial Intelligence (or Artificial Stupidity, as I will explain later) and democratization are everywhere. Your fridge is \u201cintelligent\u201d, your smartwatch is \u201cintelligent\u201d, your car is super \u201cintelligent\u201d. Not to mention computer software and your CRM system \u2014 they are so \u201cintelligent\u201d that if you believed in that hype, you should pack, change job and let AI sell and buy stuff. We don\u2019t need humans anymore. Or, maybe we actually do need them.

Everyone (ok, almost everyone) knows that, even after the famous win in Go, computers are only following orders than are intelligent, and an intelligent car is intelligent until\u2026 it starts to rain or someone puts a sticker on a STOP sign and it cannot recognize it anymore. The so-called \u201cintelligence\u201d stops there.", "This post is not about negating what we have accomplished in Artificial Intelligence, especially after 2006, when deep learning was really shown to work pretty well in deep belief nets. It is about getting back to earth with what AI can do for us in sales, marketing and many other areas in life and business. It\u2019s also about showing that blindly following \u201cdata-first\u201d approach can be very badly and is definitely misleading.", "The reality is far from what all the \u201cAI start-ups\u201d and \u201cdata-driven leaders\u201d want us to think.", "Many \u201cAI entrepreneurs\u201d like to claim nowadays, to sell their \u201cAI-backed products\u201d, that computers rule our business and lives. The fact that computer won in Go is their favorite mantra and in those \u201cAI fanatics\u201d\u2019 words proves ultimately that computers are intelligent. Sure, winning in Go is a great achievement! But claiming that it proves that computers now have intuition is pretty misleading. First, it proves that reinforcement learning (as one of machine learning techniques) works. Second, it proves that a distributed network with enough GPUs can now win against humans in Go. Third,\u2026 there is no third. AlphaGo won (and keeps on winning) in Go against every human on Earth. Yet, it cannot differentiate a square from a circle and it could not win in Tic-Tac-Toe.", "And if you now say \u201cOh yeah, it sure can! It\u2019s enough to reprogram it\u201d you support the whole idea and the thesis behind this article \u2014 the computers follow orders and are obedient, but definitely not intelligent. And, as for the end of 2019, machine learning, including deep learning, is just about finding models and patterns (quicker than humans can), and not about intelligence at all.", "Ok, let\u2019s get to the main thesis of this article \u2014 that further AI democratization and \u201cdata-first\u201d approach are risky and dangerous.", "The simple definition of \u201cdemocratization\u201d is that everyone gets equal chances and access to a particular resource. In \u201cAI democratization\u201d, we obviously mean equal access to \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d resources. They include, but are not limited to:", "And the last bullet point is the most dangerous\u2026 I\u2019ll explain why in a moment.", "The recently famous data-first approach is putting data in front of all business activities. Also, it\u2019s stating that data is new gold. Or, it\u2019s saying that data is the most important asset. Or, it\u2019s any other overstatement similar to these ones heard in the IT and business world every day in 2019.", "Isn\u2019t data important? Of course, it is. But data without understanding is nothing. And that\u2019s why I wrote this article\u2026", "The AI platforms provided by big-techs (Microsoft, Salesforce, Google, and others) reached in 2019 a level that soon can bring more harm than good. Namely, everyone can \u201cdo AI\u201d with simple drag & drop and with no understanding of the underlying principles whatsoever. As long as democratizing development with low-code platforms is helping companies worldwide, democratizing AI is not. There are several reasons why and I\u2019m listing them below.", "The fact that everyone can do AI after a 2-week online course and \u201cwith a few clicks\u201d means exactly what it says \u2014 everyone now can do AI. Not only people with great domain knowledge, people with great statistical skills, people who understand correlation and causation. Everyone. And that is dangerous.", "\u201cData scientist\u201d has been for last 3 years the sexiest job in the world, encouraging many people to switch to become data scientists. Data scientists without any knowledge about the topic they want to research whatsoever.

And these people, thousands of them, use simple online AI tools to\u2026 make conclusions about data. The problems? Here you are:", "One can say that democratization also happened with code development and programmers are not needed to build motherboards, then to code in assembler. And that\u2019s totally true. But single software developers who don\u2019t understand underlying computer architectures are not even remotely as dangerous as self-proclaimed data scientists who discover tumors without even knowing why they chose the algorithm they did.", "With AI democratization people started to believe that numbers and data are everything. And, in fact, without proper understanding, they are just\u2026 numbers and data. The democratized AI platforms do not verify whether data you put into the model is true, valid or relevant. They allow you to put anything into the model (wrongly selected, in many cases) and\u2026 they provide predictions. And, since AI is democratized to the level it doesn\u2019t require any math skills whatsoever, we end up with predictions based on wrong data and wrong models. What\u2019s worse, all those \u201cAI startups\u201d and \u201cdata scientists\u201d very often convince us that the predictions are valid because \u201cthey\u2019re backed by AI and machine learning\u201d.", "Since democratization of AI gives access to AI to everyone it means that the AI is as smart as the person who plays with it\u2026 We don\u2019t even need to delve deeper to adversarial learning or purposeful model challenging methods to show that predictions made by \u201cdemocratized AI\u201d are very often invalid and simply stupid. Not because AI online platforms are stupid. It\u2019s because people are encouraged to play with machine learning, as it was a simple Data-In-Data-Out mechanism with fancy name, without understanding the basic principles behind it.", "Yes, easy visualization of data is one of the most cited reasons why people put their attention to \u201cdemocratized AI\u201d platforms. There is nothing wrong in visualizing data (a picture is worth a thousand words), but what\u2019s wrong is\u2026 drawing conclusions about correlations where there are no real correlations. Nice, colorful charts allow all their users to see relations. And relations are not always causations.", "How many times did I hear in last month that another \u201cAI startup\u201d can show me predictions how much our customers would buy in 2020 based on historical data? And you? In all cases it was so easy for me to show that predicting future customer behaviors and orders requires much more than running clustering to segment customers and then polynomial regression to show probabilities of increased / decreased orders. That\u2019s a pretty simple example, but\u2026 all those platforms are very rarely anything more than this simple example. And yes, they call themselves \u201cAI-backed sales / digital marketing engines\u201d :-D.", "Imagine you are a data scientist in a company and you want to prove your hypothesis with machine learning. What do you do? You play with the model so long that it finally proves that hypothesis. And then what? You show it to your board of directors or your customers as a great knowledge discovery made by machine learning.", "And if this \u201cknowledge discovery\u201d is only for your company, so be it. But I wouldn\u2019t like to get data from such a data scientist to predict whether what\u2019s seen on an image is a cancer or just an image anomaly.", "First, let me explain what I understand by data-first approach. I am not saying about gathering data, using historical data or using structured / unstructured data for analysis to help your company grow. What I mean by the bad data-first approach is what we can hear more and more often \u2014 that data and only data should define how you run your company, how you should amend your processes and how you should choose your customers.", "Too often, nowadays, we encounter the problem with \u201cdata-first, hypothesis later\u201d approach, usually hidden by smart guys behind \u201cwe offer knowledge discovery with our top notch cloud AI platform\u201d.", "Do you see what\u2019s happening here? They use data to create a hypothesis (by knowledge discovery) and later prove this false hypothesis with\u2026 the same data. Nice. But not so smart. And separating bad datasets into training and testing datasets is not a solution\u2026 :-).The main problem with \u201cdata-first\u201d approach is that it encourages amateurs to find correlations and causations where the relations between data points are weak. Proof?", "Consider a \u201cleading AI marketing\u201d platform (you name it; there are numerous examples worldwide). Let us play with it a bit. Let\u2019s input our historical customer data (as complex as it can handle with valuable predictors) and a random set of data from Kaggle or any other public source of statistical, time-series based data.", "The above exercise was a perfect way to learn from one of the AI platforms that the customers who should be our sweet spot are those who fulfill ALL below conditions:", "Bad enough? Will you, as human, even infer anything that stupid? What if this great \u201cAI-backed company\u201d representative would tell you that in order to achieve those great results they had run:", "Does it sound more believable? It does. And they might have done it exactly in this order and reached exactly the above conclusions. It\u2019s known that people tend to believe more scientific words. Even, if they are nothing more than bullshit in a particular context.", "Why do you think the results are worth nothing? It\u2019s simple \u2014 none of those platforms understand data, they just see numbers. And if they are asked to do \u201cthe knowledge discovery\u201d, they do.", "Of course, one might argue that I put bad data on purpose. And yes, I did. But how can you be sure that such bad data is not used and it is properly validated, when you allow any user to drag & drop their data to an \u201cAI, super cool machine learning platform\u201d that ensures \u201cto use AI to give predictions\u201d? I hope you now see what I mean. It\u2019s not about intelligence yet. It\u2019s about more complex, quickly computed statistical and econometrical models (yes, some of them inferred from data in model-based machine learning, but still just models).", "Democratizing AI without forcing its users to understand basic principles is doomed to discover correlations and make \u201cdiscoveries\u201d that are not only bad and stupid, but foremost dangerous. And as long as these stupid predictions and discoveries pertain to sales and marketing and there are people who want to use them \u2014 fine.
