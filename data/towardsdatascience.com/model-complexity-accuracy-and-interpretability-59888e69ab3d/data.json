However, they do not end up being highly interpretable. In this article, we will be looking into the relationship between complexity, accuracy and interpretability.", "I am currently working as a Machine Learning Researcher and working on a project on Interpretable Machine Learning. This series is based of my implementation of the book by Christopher Molnar: \u201cInterpretable Machine Learning\u201d.", "Part 1: Model Complexity, Accuracy and Interpretability", "We will be using real world dataset to showcast the relationship between complexity, accuracy and interpretability of a Machine Learning model. We will try out Machine learning models of increasing complexity and see how accuracy increases and interpretability decreases with it.", "Part 2: Unboxing the \u201cBlack Box\u201d Model", "We will be using the most complex model as our final model as it gives very high accuracy and implementing Model-agnostic methods to interpret this model using the \u201cInterpretable Machine Learning\u201d, refer here:", "In real-world, while working on any problem its important to understand the trade-off between Model Accuracy and Model Interpretability. Business users want Data Scientists to build models with higher accuracy while Data Scientist face the issue to explain to them how these model makes predictions.", "What is more important?? \u2014 Having a model that gives best accuracy on unseen data or understanding the predictions even when the accuracy is poor. Below we have a comparison of traditional models accuracy vs their ability to be interpretable.", "The graph shows some of the most used algorithms of Machine learning and how interpretable they are. The complexity increases in terms of how the Machine learning model works underneath. It can be parametric model (Linear Models) or non-parametric models (K-Nearest Neighbour), Simple Decision trees (CART) or Ensemble models (Bagging method \u2014 Random Forest or Boosting method\u2014 Gradient Boosting Trees). Complex models mostly give better accuracy in their predictions. However, interpreting them is more difficult.", "Goal of any supervised machine learning algorithm is to achieve low bias and low variance. However, its not possible in real life and we have a trade-off between Bias and Variance.", "Linear Regression assumes linearity when in reality the relationship is quite complex. These simplifying assumptions give high Bias(train and test errors high) and the model tends to be underfit. High bias can be reduced by using a complex functions or adding more features. Thats when the Complexity increases and accuracy increases. At a certain point, the model will become too complex, and tend to overfit the training data i.e. low Bias but high Variance for test data. Complex models like Decision Trees tend to overfit.", "There is usually a tendency to overfit a Machine learning model, hence, to overcome this we can use resampling technique (Cross Validation) to improve the performanceon unseen data.", "In use cases when the impact of the prediction is high, understanding \u201cWhy\u201d a certain prediction is made is really important. Knowing the \u2018why\u2019 can help you learn more about the problem, the data and the reason why a model might fail.", "This dataset contains daily counts of rented bicycles from the bicycle rental company Capital-Bikeshare in Washington D.C., along with weather and seasonal information.", "Goal: Predict how many bikes will be rented depending on the weather and the day.", "The number of bike rides increases over the period of 2 years from 2011 to 2012.", "Windspeed and humidity have slightly negative correlation. Temp and atemp carry the same information and hence are highly positively correlated. So for building the model, we can use either temp or atemp.", "Dropping features like causal, registered as they are same as total_count. Similarly, for features like atemp which is same as temp, dropping one to reduce multicollinearity. For categorical features, using OneHotEncoding method to transform into a format that works better with regression models.", "We will be going through models with increasing complexity and see how the interpretability decreases.", "Linear regression involving multiple variables is called \u201cmultiple linear regression\u201d or \u201cmultivariate linear regression\u201d.", "Goal of multiple linear regression (MLR) is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variable. In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression that involves more than one explanatory variable.", "Regression comes with some assumptions that are not practical in real world datasets.", "To interpret Linear models is easier, we can look into the coefficients of each variable to understand its effect on the prediction and also the slope of intercept.", "The intercept represents the value of y(target) when none of the features have any effect(x=0).", "Coefficients corresponding to X.columns helps us understand the effect of each feature on the target outcome.", "Decision trees work by iteratively splitting the data into distinct subsets in a greedy fashion. For regression trees, they are chosen to minimize either the MSE (mean squared error) or the MAE (mean absolute error) within all of the subsets.", "CART \u2014 Classification and Regression Trees:", "CART takes a feature and determines which cut-off point minimizes the variance of y for a regression task. The variance tells us how much the y values in a node are spread around their mean value. Splits are based on features that minimize the variance based on average of all subsets used in decision tree.", "Decision Tree Regression results gives better fit to the data.", "Decision tree has a better fit to the model than Linear Regression. The R square value is about 0.67.", "Feature importance is based on the one that reduces the maximum variance for all the splits the feature was used. A feature might be used for more than one split or not at all. We can add the contributions for each of the p features and get an interpretation of how much each feature has contributed to a prediction.", "We can see that features: hr, temp, year, workingday, season_Spring are the features that used to split the decision tree.", "Boosting is an ensemble technique in which the predictors are not made independently, but sequentially. Gradient Boosting uses Decision tree as weak models.", "Boosting is a method of converting weak learners into strong learners by training many models in a gradual, additive and sequential manner and minimizing Loss function (i.e squared error for Regression problems) in the final model.", "GBR has better accuracy than other Regression model because of its Boosting technique. It is the most used Regression algorithm for competitions.", "The result from GBR is as below:", "The Gradient Boosting Regressor gives us the best R2 square value of 0.957. However, to interpret this model its very difficult.", "Ensemble models definitely fall into the category of \u201cBlack Box\u201d models since they are composed of many potentially complex individual models.", "Each tree in sequentially fashion is trained on bagged data using random selection of features, so gaining a full understanding of the decision process by examining each individual tree is infeasible.", "Your home for data science.
