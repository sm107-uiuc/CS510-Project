Many people told me that they found my article helpful and inspiring, so next, I wanted to share my journey in deep learning. If you are interested, you can read my previous article below.", "Through learning data science, I became exposed to machine learning which made me interested in deep learning and AI. However, I didn\u2019t know how I could learn it because it seemed so complicated.", "It was around this time last year that I found out about a scholarship Udacity created with Bertelsmann where recipients could be awarded a chance to complete a deep learning, data analyst, or cloud computing nanodegree at no cost.", "Side Note: The scholarship for this year has just opened up and you can apply here. You can also check out other available ones on Udacity\u2019s scholarship page.", "I ended up applying for the scholarship, was accepted, and moved on to be awarded the deep learning nanodegree!", "Let me tell you how I did it and how it helped me to learn deep learning.", "The first step is applying for the scholarship. You have to choose which track you want to pursue(AI, Data, or Cloud), so I chose the AI track. As part of the application process, you have to answer some questions such as:", "The application process would likely be different for different scholarships, but these are the ones I had to answer.", "Udacity then selected 15,000 people to participate in the challenge course and I was one of them!", "Since I chose the AI track, the challenge course I did was the Intro to Deep Learning with PyTorch course. This course teaches you the basics of deep learning, and how to build your own deep neural networks using PyTorch. The syllabus includes:", "I liked the course because it allowed me to go from having basic Python/data science skills to being able to implement my own AI code that could classify photos, generate text, and other cool things. They also provided all the notebooks you need to train/run the neural networks, which make it easier to learn.", "There were two requirements needed in order to be awarded the nanodegree.", "If you spend a few hours a week working on the challenge course, you should be able to complete it in the 3.5 month timeline. Not to mention that nothing is graded, so it is really up to you to make sure you have completed the course. Technically you can just click through all the lessons without completing it, but that leads us to the second requirement.", "Udacity creates a Slack workspace for each track of the scholarship program and expects students to participate in it. This requirement is likely there to make sure people aren\u2019t just clicking through the course in order to complete it and actually goes through the material.", "It means you have to help other students out, either technically and/or to engage with the community.", "There are many ways to do this including:", "What participation does not mean is:", "Udacity regularly clarifies the participation aspect of the program and stated that if you spend about 15 minutes a day looking through Slack and answering people\u2019s questions, or posting quality content, then you should have a good chance of receiving the nanodegree.", "Many people hypothesized that they have a Slack extension that can help them visualize the top students, but this was not confirmed because that info was not made available to us. The most likely way they gauge the participation is through their community managers (CM) who are also in the Slack workspace. Those CM\u2019s monitor the day-to-day activity of the channels and develop a pretty good idea of who the students who consistently contribute high quality content to the community are.", "There are some Udacity created initiatives that you can take advantage of in order to increase your community participation.", "Shortly after the start of the challenge course, your CM will put out a call for student leaders (SL). As the Slack community is so large, it becomes difficult for the CM\u2019s to keep track of everything, and that is where the SL\u2019s come in. There will be several SL\u2019s for each Slack channel and they will be dedicated to ensuring the intent of the channel is realized. The SL\u2019s are also expected to create initiatives for the channel they are assigned to.", "For example, if you are a leader for a technical channel, you would help answer technical questions, and create initiatives to help students understand/learn the concepts better.", "For me, I was chosen to be an SL for the #Introductions channel so my team created a challenge where students shared personal details about themselves to help get to know one another better. We also organized a form to collect everyone\u2019s social media pages to allow for further connections.", "The initiatives you create are largely up to you, so be creative! For example, we created a picture collage of all the students which helped instill a sense of community.", "To become a student leader, you have to apply and be chosen. A part of the application process will be to share what leadership experience you have, why you would be a good leader, and to choose your channel preference.", "A study jam is a one to two day event where SL\u2019s as well as other student volunteers spend a large amount of time helping others get through the course material. There is actually an SL dedicated to organizing the study jam, and their job is to plan the event including recruiting others to lead/organize webinars, ask me anything sessions (AMAs), and presentations on the day of. There is also a lot of work needed before the event to manage logistics and marketing, so there are many ways to get involved.", "This is a very good opportunity to get some participation points!", "Every week, there would be an AMA session where a CM allocates an hour of time to answer any non-technical questions that students have. Usually these would be during business hours during when the CM is working, so it might limit who can attend depending on their timezone. However, this is a very easy way to increase your participation as usually the questions are easy to answer. Many questions are also quite repetitive, so you can further increase your community engagement by creating nice posts/guides to answer these common questions.", "Some students even created a bot that automatically transcribed all the questions and answers so people who missed the session could refer back to it.", "Udacity encourages students to study daily and to document their work on a special #60DaysOfUdacity channel.", "You can document which part of the course or other coding work you did and even add in aspects of your daily life. I saw many student\u2019s share motivational stories/pictures that definitely added to their participation as it spurred more conversations.", "Although having to always contribute on Slack can get tedious (I think I spent more time on Slack than the challenge course!), it is still an invaluable experience. Not only did I make friends that I still keep in contact with, but the willingness of everyone to help each other learn and grow is what truly made this experience memorable.", "Everyone might have started out helping each other on Slack because of the participation requirement, but by the end, they continued because they really wanted to see each other succeed and reach new heights. I think this community instilled in me a dedication to help others.", "To summarize, the key to being awarded the nanodegree is to:", "After I got access to the deep learning nanodegree, I had about 6 months to complete it.", "You will notice that the nanodegree has many topics that are the same as the Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch course, so many lessons were actually already completed when I logged in.", "Besides the new lessons the nanodegree has, the main difference is the projects and evaluation by Udacity reviewers. Once you completed a project, it would get reviewed and you would be provided feedback to help you improve on it.", "If you downloaded all the content provided from Udacity\u2019s Github page for the challenge course, you actually have access to material for the above projects. So even if you didn\u2019t get awarded the nanodegree, you could still work on the projects yourself.", "You also get access to a student community within the Udacity platform where you can communicate with other people taking the nanodegree to ask questions. It is similar to the Slack community, but less organized in my opinion so I didn\u2019t end up using it.", "Finally, there is a forum where you can post questions and have Udacity mentors answer them which can be very helpful.", "The Slack community closes down a few weeks after the challenge course ends, and everyone was bummed out about it, but one of the students created a new workspace so that we could continue the community afterwards and stay connected. That new Slack community is still going strong to this day! So this provided another platform where we could get help on the nanodegree.", "Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t able to complete the nanodegree in time because, life happens, but I was able to save some of the content so that I can work on it more slowly at my own pace. I look forward to sharing more projects from what I learn from the nanodegree with you soon! I am also planning on applying for the upcoming Udacity x Bertelsmann scholarship, so maybe our paths will cross there?", "This was a pretty long post. If you\u2019ve made it all the way here. Thank you for reading!", "I\u2019ve been wanting to write this article to share how you can get a Udacity scholarship/free nanodegree for a while. I hope that by sharing my experiences and the steps I took, it will help you to discover your own path to learning.", "If you have any questions or comments, feel free to leave your feedback below.
