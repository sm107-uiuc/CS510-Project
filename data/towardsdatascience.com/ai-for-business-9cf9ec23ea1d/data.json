First I\u2019ll talk about the problems with AI right now, then the problems with understanding and applying AI in business scenarios, finally a first glance on the solutions I\u2019m thinking.", "Since the beginning of humanity as a society, we\u2019ve been trying to find a way to work better and smarter. Artificial Intelligence(AI) it\u2019s one of those things we image will help us in many ways to improve our daily lives.", "I\u2019m going to give a very simple definition of AI. But first I need to talk about it\u2019s parts = Artificial and Intelligence.", "If we think of Intelligence as the ability to accomplish complex goals, something complex as something having many parts related to each other in ways that may be difficult to understand, and understanding as the ability to turn complex information into simple, useful information, then we can say:", "Intelligence is the ability to accomplish complex goals by understanding the parts that form the main goal.", "We humans do this by modeling. This is the process of \u201cseeing\u201d the \u201creality\u201d, the world around us, and then creating a higher level prototype that will describe the things we are seeing, hearing and feeling, but it\u2019s a representative thing, not the \u201cactual\u201d or \u201creal\u201d thing.", "So we humans (hopefully there are not bots reading this) model the world and use our intelligence to understand the way things work and use that understanding and knowledge to solve difficult and complex problems.", "The artificial part here means that humans are not the ones (directly) using intelligence, but a machine, or software or algorithm. These algorithms are not programmed as usual, where you tell them exactly what to do. They are learning through data.", "If we take the above diagram and we add a business flavor to it, then we are trying to apply AI for business.", "Here the A-BSPF is the Agile Business Science Problem Framework. You can read more about it here:", "Here we need to get the data from the world or \u201cnature\u201d and the business. Then we need data from the business itself, and define a problem within it. It\u2019s very important that you read the above article to understand how to do this in a systematic and agile way.", "For me the problems companies face when trying to use AI are not exactly in the AI or Model step, but in the first steps. Defining the business case, get and analyze the data they have and getting data from the outside world.", "\u2026 but it all starts with the data. As you can image, data is an important asset (maybe the most important one) for companies right now. So before you can apply machine learning or deep learning [and AI], at all, you need to have it, know what you have, understand it, govern it, clean it, analyze it, standardize it (maybe more) and then you can think of using it.", "That\u2019s why I proposed a shift into a Data Fabric, then join that with end-to-end tools for AI. You can read more about it here:", "Everyone wants to be disruptive, and use data for everything, before even knowing why. That\u2019s just crazy. We need to get out of this space. I really recommend to read in this point to read this article", "by Tyler Elliot Bettilyon and then go back. As he said:", "We are drowning in technology that was created for its own sake, then aggressively marketed, lobbied, and otherwise pushed to reluctant consumers.", "The ideas of \u201ccreative destruction\u201d and \u201cdisruption\u201d are enshrined as de facto good among the investor and CEO class of Silicon Valley \u2026", "Before trying to be disruptive in every way, get things done! Solve your data problems, and really think on a way you can use it to answer them.", "If you read my articles, you may figured out that they all have a purpose and they follow a path. That was me trying to get to this point. I work everyday trying to help people and companies success in their path to AI and data science. Now I\u2019m taking that to the next level. So I have three announcements:", "Soon I\u2019ll talk about how to do ML and AI in general with this technologies.", "Please if you have any suggestions let me know :)", "If you have questions just follow me on Twitter:", "Your home for data science.
