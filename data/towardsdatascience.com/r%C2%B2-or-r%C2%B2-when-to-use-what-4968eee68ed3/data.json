You are hard at work just when your data scientist walks in saying they discovered a little-known data stream providing daily Walmart parking lot occupancy that seems well correlated with Walmart\u2019s historic revenues. You are understandably excited. You ask them to use the parking lot data alongside other standard metrics in a machine learning model to forecast Walmart\u2019s stock price.", "The data scientist returns in a few hours claiming that after careful validation of the model, its predictions are strongly correlated with the true stock price. Do you accept the model without any further investigations?", "Correlations are good for identifying patterns in data, but almost meaningless for quantifying a model\u2019s performance, especially for complex models (like machine learning models). This is because correlations only tell if two things follow each other (e.g., parking lot occupancy and Walmart\u2019s stock), but don\u2019t tell how they match each other (e.g., predicted and actual stock price). For that, model performance metrics like the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) can help.", "In this article, we will learn:", "Correlation coefficients help quantify mutual relationships or connections between two things. Some well-known correlated quantities are weight and height of humans, house value and its area, and, as we saw in the above example, a store\u2019s revenue and its parking lot occupancy.", "One of the most widely used correlation coefficients is the Pearson correlation coefficient (usually denoted by r). Graphically, this can be understood as \u201chow close is the data to the line of best fit?\u201d", "Notice how the figure above has missing numbers on the axes? That is because the Pearson correlation coefficient is independent of the magnitude of the numbers; it is sensitive to relative changes only. This property is usually desirable since variables rarely have the same magnitudes. E.g., Walmart\u2019s stock price is tens of dollars whereas the numbers of cars parked in front of its stores are in the thousands.", "However, due to its insensitivity to actual magnitude, the Pearson correlation coefficient can be misused to give a false sense of confidence when two things are indeed expected to have the same magnitude.", "To make matters worse, some people take the square of the Pearson correlation coefficient to bring it between 0 and +1 and call it r\u00b2. But this is not to be confused with the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) which is explained below.", "Unlike the Pearson correlation coefficient, the coefficient of determination measures how well the predicted values match (and not just follow) the observed values. It depends on the distance between the points and the 1:1 line (and not the best-fit line) as shown above. Closer the data to the 1:1 line, higher the coefficient of determination.", "The coefficient of determination is often denoted by R\u00b2. However, it is not the square of anything. It can range from any negative number to +1.", "Since R\u00b2 indicates the distance of points from the 1:1 line, it does depend on the magnitude of the numbers (unlike r\u00b2).", "The Pearson correlation coefficient (r) is used to identify patterns in things whereas the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2) is used to identify the strength of a model.", "By taking the square of r, you get the squared Pearson correlation coefficient (r\u00b2) which is completely different from the coefficient of determination (R\u00b2), except in very specific cases of linear regression (when both the grey lines from the above figures merge making the blue and orange lines equivalent).", "Thus, the Pearson correlation coefficient or its square should rarely be used to evaluate a model\u2019s performance. This is explained using 3 examples in the figure below.", "If you want a math-y explanation of the difference between r\u00b2 and R\u00b2, check out this excellent article by Deepak Khandelwal.", "Your home for data science.
