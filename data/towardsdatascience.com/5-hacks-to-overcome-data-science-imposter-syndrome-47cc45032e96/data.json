Imposter Syndrome is extremely common in Data Science and many other fields, to say the least). It entails an intense feeling of incapability by the practitioner (in this case yourself), which in turn results in the practitioner feeling as though they are a fraud.", "Many readers of my last post \u201c3 Tips to Transition Into Data Science From Any Field\u201d reached out to me to inform me how inspired they felt, however, they\u2019ve been struggling to rise above the imposter syndrome trait I mentioned. Consequently, I\u2019ve decided to put together some \u201chacks\u201d I\u2019ve personally used to rise above my own imposter syndrome and will share them with you in hope that they may help you also. Before we talk about how to overcome it, let\u2019s first discuss why we feel like imposters in the first place.", "Unfortunately, It\u2019s often implied that being a magician is a prerequisite for Data Scientists so when you cannot pull a rabbit out of data you're inadequate. Talkless of the immense pressure bombarding us to remain up to date with the latest trends in the field. The accumulation of these reasons leads one to focus on all of the tasks they are consciously incompetent at performing, hence further fueling the feeling of inadequacy.", "It\u2019s fair to say, many of the reasons people feel like they are imposters are a result of a narrow focus on things that are out of ones control. Rising above imposter syndrome is a prerequisite to excel as a Data Scientist and with these 5 hacks, you would be well on your way to having a flourishing career in Data Science.", "Sounds counter-intuitive right? Imposter Syndrome never entirely leaves you! The nub of imposter syndrome is the comparisons we make of ourselves to other people and what we think they know. I remember earlier in my career when I came across a podcast of a 17-year-old boy speaking about Cyclic Generative Networks \u2014 something I still don\u2019t understand to this day \u2014 and I tuned out after 5 minutes because of my jealousy and feeling of inadequacy kicked in.", "In no way am I saying this is a solution, in fact, quite the opposite because when I realized I was being petty, I tuned back in to listen to the young man speak and he later went on to say he doesn\u2019t understand Hyperparameter tuning \u2014 something I understand modestly \u2014 and instantly my mood changed.", "The point here is, the moment I heard what the young man was speaking about, I instantly assumed he had mastered the field and seldom faced the struggles I found myself constantly battling with. Essentially, I had compared this one podcast to my whole experience as a Data Scientist and concluded that I was inadequate, much like the Instagram effect \u2014 where people post up exciting lifestyles which in turn makes those without such freedom or luxury feel miserable about their entire life. They\u2019ve compared the experience someone has put into a few pictures to their entire life and ruled their life is not good.", "Data Science is one of those fields that you will never really master and there are always new things to learn. New papers come out every day claiming there is a way to beat the current state-of-the-art. New tools come out every day to make the workflow easier. New people from various backgrounds enter the field every day. As a result, there will always be people who know something that you don\u2019t know, and someone who can do something better, faster, prettier than you.", "The thought of not being number 1 may be depressing to someone that\u2019s used to their being winners and losers \u2014 coming from a footballing background, this resonated with me heavily. Yet, as time has passed, I\u2019ve realized the fact there are no winners and losers is somewhat liberating. It allows you to focus on the things you can control like the skills you possess and your current knowledge base. In turn, you can accept that there will be no feeling of arrival when you reach a certain point. You will never feel like you know everything and you are comfortable performing any task, but you will grow and definitely have more confidence to back yourself when faced with a goliath of a task.", "Back when I played football, my manager always told us to celebrate whenever we scored a goal, even in training! The idea seemed insane, but we did it either way. It\u2019s now been 6 years since I dropped football, and I am still grateful for that advice my manager told me and I\u2019ve ensured I translated it everywhere in my life.", "Many people get so lost in the big picture that they miss the little things that will get them there and often times end up giving up right before the breakthrough. Becoming a Data Scientist, Working at a top company, earning your first 6 figure salary, etc, these are all that I regard as the \u201cMain Event\u201d. The main event is usually where we see our future selves and serves only as a guiding light for the steps we take.", "\u201cWhat tends to happen is that people become to focused on the main event, forgetting that there are little steps that must be taken to get there.\u201c", "The amount of progress you\u2019ve made is insignificant, all that matters is that you are closer to the main event than you were before. Acknowledging the small success you\u2019ve had is good because you feel the accomplishment that motivates you to want to create more success.", "My manager wanted us to celebrate goals we scored in training so we were determined to want to score when we reached matchday and boy did it pay off!", "If you realize that you haven\u2019t been celebrating your victories when progressing in your Data Science career, be sure to take 10 minutes after reading this to reflect on your successes, and from this day on set a day each week where you simply reflect on the progress you\u2019ve made in your journey. I also find it may help to keep a small portfolio of your accomplishments, just for yourself.", "I once shared this on my LinkedIn\u2026", "There were some opposing arguments to this post yet I remain firm on my stance. However, that is not to say that someone doesn\u2019t have a preferred learning style. My point is that I personally feel as though only watching youtube tutorials, or reading Data Science books, or taking courses isn\u2019t enough to fully conceptualize something (IMO).", "Many people simply read a book or watch a youtube tutorial about a concept and feel as though they\u2019ve grasped what they learned, which is most definitely not the case. Trying to involve as many of your senses as you can during the learning process will allow your brain to make better impressions of the world from what you're learning.", "On that note, try to make every experience a learning one and see how you can relate it to machine learning. For example, when I am practicing my handstands I like to think of my posture as trying to take the derivative of a function \u2014 these little things are what helped me grasp various topics like Gradient Descent.", "I find that a lot of the self-induced imposter syndrome I suffered from in the past was a lack of clarity when considering my future. Uncertainty can be the cause of much anxiety and stress in one's life, talkless of how emotionally draining it is. If one is not careful, these negative emotions compound and leads to a neverending spiral of \u201cwhat-if\u201d that reinforces the imposter syndrome.", "To combat this, the solution is quite straightforward but also difficult at the same time. The idea is to set goals you\u2019d like to attain and plan your career path. I believe the difficulty of this part is that Data Science is such a massive field that there are many paths that one could potentially take. My response to that would be to find someone that you like and copy their path.", "Find who\u2019s results it is you\u2019d like to replicate and reverse engineer the process they took to reach where they are!", "Last but most definitely not least, the Growth Mindset! There is lot\u2019s of information on the fixed and growth mindset and why it\u2019s better to adopt a growth mindest so I am not going to spend too much time trying to break it down.", "Essentially, people with a fixed mindset believe that their qualities are fixed and they have no means to change them. Hence, they believe talent is the only way to became successful and if you aren\u2019t talented then you can\u2019t be successful.", "Whereas, people with a growth mindest believe that their talents can be developed with hard work, strategic planning, valuable input from others. This belief makes them to constantly seek opportunities to better themselves and they enjoy the process.", "Can you see why it\u2019s better to adopt the growth mindset?", "Learning Data Science is difficult and will take some perseverance as well as grit before you begin to see some results working in your favour. If you feel as though you\u2019ve been facing imposter syndrome, try applying these hacks and see how you get on.", "Let\u2019s continue the conversation on LinkedIn\u2026", "If you are interested in starting your own blog on Medium, check out my Youtube channel where I share my insights from my experience blogging.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url": "https://rsci.app.link/?%24canonical_url=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fp%2F47cc45032e96&%7Efeature=LoOpenInAppButton&%7Echannel=ShowPostUnderCollection&source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Open in app"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign up"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign In"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2Fnew-story&source=---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------new_post_sidenav-----------", "anchor_text": "Write"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/search?source=---two_column_layout_nav----------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign up"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?operation=login&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&source=post_page---two_column_layout_nav-----------------------global_nav-----------", "anchor_text": "Sign In"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/?source=post_page-----47cc45032e96--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/?source=post_page-----47cc45032e96--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Towards Data Science"}, {"url": "https://kurtispykes.medium.com/?source=post_page-----47cc45032e96--------------------------------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://kurtispykes.medium.com/?source=post_page-----47cc45032e96--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "Kurtis Pykes"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fsubscribe%2Fuser%2F5ba760786877&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&user=Kurtis+Pykes&userId=5ba760786877&source=post_page-5ba760786877----47cc45032e96---------------------follow_byline-----------", "anchor_text": "Follow"}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F47cc45032e96&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&source=--------------------------bookmark_header-----------", "anchor_text": ""}, {"url": "https://medium.com/m/signin?actionUrl=https%3A%2F%2Fmedium.com%2F_%2Fbookmark%2Fp%2F47cc45032e96&operation=register&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Ftowardsdatascience.com%2F5-hacks-to-overcome-data-science-imposter-syndrome-47cc45032e96&source=--------------------------bookmark_header-----------", "anchor_text": "Save"}, {"url": "https://unsplash.com/@alexiby?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral", "anchor_text": "Alex Iby"}, {"url": "https://unsplash.com?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=referral", "anchor_text": "Unsplash"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/3-tips-to-transition-into-data-science-from-any-field-6baaecdcac2d", "anchor_text": "3 Tips to Transition Into Data Science From Any Field"}, {"url": "https://towardsdatascience.com/the-specialized-data-scientist-will-win-in-the-long-run-22c47342aa00", "anchor_text": "The Specialized \u2018Data Scientist\u2019 Will Win in The Long Run"}, {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/posts/kurtispykes_machinelearning-artificialintelligence-deeplearning-activity-6716996243228241920-27qZ", "anchor_text": "LinkedIn"}, {"url": "https://www.linkedin.com/in/kurtispykes/", "anchor_text": "Kurtis Pykes - Data Scientist - Freelance, self-employed | LinkedInView Kurtis Pykes' profile on LinkedIn, the world's largest professional community.
