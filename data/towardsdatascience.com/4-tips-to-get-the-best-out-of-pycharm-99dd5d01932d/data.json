When I started using it several years ago, I was programming a recommender system for my graduation project. I had simply followed a recommendation from my project coach and had absolutely no idea what the advantages of the editor were. I knew it was integrated with Anaconda, which made my life somewhat easier but that was it. To be entirely honest, I did not know much about Version Control at the time either. 3 years later, I am still sticking to PyCharm, but this time, I have my reasons.", "The choice of editor usually does not matter much when you are simply experimenting with Machine Learning or coding for short projects that do not require complex folder structures or scripts organized in modules. The problems and preferences usually come up when projects become larger, with several scripts, modules, tests and programmers collaborating on the same scripts. This is where, I believe, the extra features of PyCharm can be a wonderful help for any Python programmer.", "I am only mentioning features available in the community version, not in the professional one. So anyone should be able to use these features in the free version of the software.", "I will describe 4 features of PyCharm that had a truly positive impact in my last Python projects:", "Any programmer knows how painful it is when they can see a function used in the code but cannot find its definition anywhere. They know its name and they know how it looks. This \u2018Waldo\u2019 function seems to be doing something crucial, but when the scripts are numerous and/or pretty long, it might be a hassle to find out where that function was defined in the first place.", "PyCharm has a really nice feature that allows looking for the occurrences of a keyword anywhere in a project! It is similar to CTRL-F, but better.", "Location: Edit > Find > Find in Path or using the shortcut CTRL-Shift-F", "The \u201cFind in Path\u201d feature in Pycharm can be extremely handy when I need to find the first reference to a variable or function. It also has several options to change the scope of my search if I want to include libraries or only a certain module! Another handy feature,\u201cReplace in Path\u201d, works the same way. It can replace automatically all occurrences of a keyword in my project/module/scope.", "I love this feature because I am simply lazy and rather impatient. One can always figure out whether the function is imported or not, go into the folders to find the right module (if the function is in one) and then scroll through the script until the function definition is found. But time and patience are often scarce so any help is welcome when it comes to navigating large projects easily.", "It is important to mention that this feature is rendered useless if you keep giving the same meaningless names to your functions or variables, such as \u201cx,y,z\u201d, \u201cresult\u201d and \u201cdf\u201d. I would advise to give meaningful names to the variables and functions before the project grows even larger and for the sake of the next programmers that might have to work on it.", "Understanding the importance of Version Control comes with using Version Control. Luckily, PyCharm is extremely easy to use with Git. Whether you like to use the command line or a GUI, the options are there. You can use the options in PyCharm, under Version Control to commit and push to your branches, revert to a previous version of your script as well as comparing branches (even though I do not use that one often). You can also easily see which branch you are in at the bottom right corner of the screen.", "Location: VCS > Git > Resolve Conflicts", "The \u201cResolve Conflict\" feature of PyCharm remains the BEST FEATURE EVER (and I am not even exaggerating). It saved me a lot of headaches when I had to resolve multiple conflicts in several scripts. When a conflict happens after merging a branch locally, PyCharm will display in red all files with conflicts. After opening the \u201cResolve Conflicts\u201d window at the location mentioned above, PyCharm displays my branches version, the merged version and the version of the branch I am trying to merge next to each other, in one window. For each change or conflict, I can decide which part of the conflicting code to take in my merged script. When several programmers work on the same project, merge conflicts happen very often so I absolutely love this feature in PyCharm.", "Location: Right Click on my script name> Move Right", "I often need to go back and forth between different scripts when I am writing a new one or updating an existing one. It is often needed to have a look at the code conventions we used, the name of a function defined in another script or the way I have coded something previously. PyCharm has this case covered as well. It allows you to split and move your windows in order to display one or more scripts next to the one that you are currently working on. It really helps if you also want to have some sort of consistency in the way the code works and looks.", "Debugging can be quite a painful task when I am working on a large project and something is not right in the output. Finding out why and where my dataframe is getting some duplicates values might require countless different print statements at several spots in my code and I might end up getting lost in the number of printed variables and dataframes in my output window.", "Location: Right Click on my script name > Debug \u2018test\u2019", "By using breakpoints and the debugger mode, you can easily evaluate your variables at any place in your code. Anytime your code stop at a breakpoint, the debug window will show what the value of each variable is and it allows you to look inside your dataframes as well. You can also click on the little calculator to write expressions on the temporary variables. If you navigate through the code by using the arrow that I (tried to) highlight, you can also see how the content of your variables evolves, line by line. For more details, you can also find a very clear tutorial on how to use the debugger on jetbrains.com.", "My recent stories related to Data Science:", "Your home for data science.
