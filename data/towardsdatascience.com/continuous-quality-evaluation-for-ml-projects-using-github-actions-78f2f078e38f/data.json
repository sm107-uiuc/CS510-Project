I and my team have taken 2nd place in Sberbank AIJ competition 2019 which is one of the largest ML contests in Russia (100 teams, 45k$ prizes). This year the task was to solve the Russian language high school graduation exam consisting of many different Natural Language Processing (NLP) subtasks each of which requires a separate ML model. It leads our team to the urgent need for an automatic quality evaluation system. Based on my production experience I\u2019ve built such a system and I\u2019d like to share it here.", "All the code from this post is available in the Github repository: https://github.com/vladimir-chernykh/ml-quality-cicd", "In the last few years, the ML field has been growing extremely fast. Because of that growth and the consecutive need to do everything as fast as possible many projects lack testing. At the same time, classical software development is far more mature area and has lots to learn from (Software 1.0 vs Software 2.0). Proper testing of the product is one of such things. One can learn more about testing and its different types starting from these links [1, 2, 3, 4]", "While classical algorithms and applications are deterministic, most Machine Learning based counterparts are inherently stochastic.", "It introduces one more type of tests which might be not that relevant previously: algorithm quality tests. They evaluate how accurate the model can solve the underlying task, e.g., predict stock prices, distinguish between cats and dogs in images, etc. For sure, there were approximate and stochastic algorithms since a long time ago, but with the rise of ML, they have become ubiquitous (+ many classical algorithms have theoretical bounds on their quality).", "The quality evaluation is crucially important when it comes to production deployment. One needs to know how well the model performs, its applicability scope and weak sides. Only then the model can be used efficiently and benefit the product.", "Almost every Data Scientist knows how to evaluate the quality of the model in the development environment, e.g., Jupyter notebook, IDE of choice, etc. But for production purposes, it is important not only to know the current quality metrics but also to keep track of their changes over time. There are at least three ways to tackle this issue:", "Each of these options has its usage scenarios. First two options work well when there are not many changes to the model and they happen rarely. Whilst the last approach is inevitable when the model changes frequently and one wants to have a stable and convenient way of tracking it. In what follows the last approach is called continuous.", "One of the convenient ways to implement continuous evaluation is to use Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) system. There are many options available at the market:", "The ultimate goal of all CI/CD systems is to automate build, testing, merging, deployment, etc. The whole CI/CD pipeline works in conjunction with code repository and triggered by the specific event (usually commit).", "Recently GitHub launched its own CI/CD system called GitHub Actions. Previously I used Jenkins for several production-grade CI/CD systems. AIJ competition was a perfect chance to experiment with the new tool and I decided to give it a try. There are a couple of points about Actions that stand it out:", "For a more comprehensive and detailed description please look in the official docs.", "To illustrate how the system is built and how it works I would use the toy example and build a model to solve the Boston House Prices task. In practice, this system was applied to the AIJ competition NLP task.", "The real-world practical task from which this continuous quality evaluation system has arisen is about solving the Russian language exam at AIJ competition.", "The peculiarity of this competition is that there are many completely different subtasks (27) which we end up solving with different models. Examples of subtasks are:", "There were 3 different automated metrics (Figure 4) and each subtask was judged by one of them. The final ranking is based on the sum of the metrics across subtasks.", "We have been solving these subtasks one-by-one and often returned to the one we had solved before to improve it. Thus we urgently needed an automatic system that keeps track of changes in metrics for particular tasks as well as the aggregative metric.", "I do not describe the exact solution of the AIJ contest here because it is too bulky and complicated. It would distract from the main point of the article. But getting into the context under which the system was build might benefit the understanding of the system and decisions being made.", "This is the regression problem where one needs to predict the price of the housing facility based on different factors such as the number of rooms, neighborhood crime rate, etc.", "This is one of the \u201cdefault\u201d classical datasets.

E.g., launch a script from the command line with the path to the data and location to store results.", "To do evaluation, I would use the hold-out technique and split the whole dataset into train and validation subsets. Cross-validation (CV) can also be used in this particular case for the Boston House Prices task because the models used here are simple and fast.

In this task, one file can contain more than one data instance. It\u2019s easier to work with CSV when one row contains one instance and not a list of many. Thus the next step is to transform the answers into a more convenient format.", "Note that this stage fully depends on the data. This transformation should be rewritten correspondingly for each new task and data structure.", "After the answers have been received and are stored in the appropriate format one needs to join ground truth values to the answers properly. It would allow us to compute all the metrics both instance-wise and globally.

GitHub manages the whole lifecycle of the VM and the user should not bother about it.", "All the pipeline definitions should follow a few rules:", "Let\u2019s build a workflow that performs the evaluation process and prints the results. The specification is located in the evaluate_github.yml file in the repo.", "The pipeline is triggered on each push that happens to the Master branch and has changes to specified files. VM runs ubuntu-18.04 and has the following list of packages installed. There are also other systems available (see the full list here).", "The first step is to execute publicly available action called checkout (more details here). It checks out the code from the parent repo to the VM. The next step is to perform the evaluation. This is done using make evaluate as discussed previously. Finally, the metrics are printed to stdout.", "As soon as the YAML config is pushed to the repo the pipeline would be triggered on each suitable event. Results of the pipeline run can be found under the \u201cActions\u201d tab in the upper tab menu of the repo.", "The successful pipeline run is shown in Figure 11. As one can notice, the metrics are the same as in Figures 6 and 9.", "GitHub-managed VMs are a great method for workflows that do not require lots of resources. All VMs have only 2 CPUs, 7GB of RAM and 14 GB of disk space (link). It\u2019s ok when one runs a toy task like Boston House Prices prediction. But for AIJ contest we quickly ran out of resources which made it impossible to use for the evaluation. And for many ML applications, these resources are not sufficient. This leads me to the solution described in the next subsection.", "Assume now, that there is a workstation that one wants to use to execute the workflow. How do accomplish that?", "One can use VM spun up by GitHub for any purpose, not only for launching the pipeline directly. In addition to that, GitHub allows users to store secrets and use them during workflow execution. The secret might be any piece of information which is stored securely at GitHub and can be passed to the VM.", "A combination of these two ideas makes it possible to connect to the remote workstation using SSH and execute all the necessary steps there.", "To do that let\u2019s first add three secrets to the GitHub:", "After initializing all the necessary secrets one can use them in the GitHub Actions pipeline definition. The code for the described workflow is available in the evaluate_remote_ssh.yml file in the repo.", "The trigger conditions and initial checkout step are the same as in the previous example. The next step is to init the SSH private key. Note how the secret is passed to the environmental variable using special context placeholder {{ secrets.<SECRET_NAME> }}. Once the ssh credentials are initialized, one can make an archive with code at the GitHub VM and load it to the specified path on the remote machine using scp command. Note that the archive is named after the commit hash GITHUB_SHA which is available by default as an environmental variable (see here for the full list of default env vars). After that, the evaluation is carried out by running make evaluate and the results are copied back from the remote machine to the GitHub VM.", "Remote connection via SSH solves the problem of insufficient GitHub VM resources. But it also introduces too many extra commands needed to accomplish the goal in comparison with GitHub VM execution (31 lines vs 5 lines). To resolve this issue and take the best of both worlds one might use recently released the beta version of self-hosted runners.", "The core idea behind it is to expose the remote machine to the GitHub Actions for pipeline execution using special software (more info on installation here).", "After establishing the connection one can use the new runner natively in the pipelines via runs-on instruction of the YAML configuration file.", "Below the pipeline for the self-hosted runner is defined.", "Note how runs-in: self-hosted instruction tells GitHub Actions to run on custom remote machine added previously (Figure 14).", "The YAML configuration is almost the same as the one for GitHub-managed VM except for the few steps.", "All the evaluations done in this post are shown to be consistent and give the same metrics for the same MeanRegressor baseline model.", "Now let\u2019s change the model sequentially to RandomRegressor, LinearRegression, and LGBMRegressor to see how the metrics are changing. I have implemented the special dashboard for this purpose using the Dash Python library. One can get code details here in the repo. The dashboard is launched manually at the special remote machine specified by the DASH_SHH secrets in GitHub.", "The folder which is tracked by the dashboard corresponds to the folder where CI/CD self-hosted pipeline stores its results. The dashboard itself is available at the port 7050.", "Each commit shown in Figure 16 triggers all 3 described CI/CD pipelines. All of the executions went well which is indicated by the green mark near the commit.

It also might be improved in many ways, e.g.:", "The described continuous quality evaluation workflow can easily be ported to any other CI/CD engine by rewriting config files into the appropriate tool-specific format.", "GitHub Actions has its pros and cons. The big advantage is the tight integration with GitHub and the availability of on-demand GitHub-managed VMs. This is convenient in case one uses GitHub and totally unacceptable if not. The main drawback is the restricted amount of builds (2000 minutes) for private repositories. For big projects, it leads to the need for a paid premium account or usage of another CI/CD instrument. If one has faced the minutes overflow issue, I would probably choose the latter option as the way to go.", "In my opinion, GitHub Actions is a good option for small/medium scale projects which need an easy-to-setup CI/CD engine and do not want to care much about the infrastructure for it.
