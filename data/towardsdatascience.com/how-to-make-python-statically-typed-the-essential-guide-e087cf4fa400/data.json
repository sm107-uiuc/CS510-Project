This makes it easy and fun for beginners, as there\u2019s no need to think about data types. Still, static typing has some benefits. Today we\u2019ll explore how to make Python as statically typed as possible.", "Don\u2019t feel like reading? Check out a video on the topic:", "So, what\u2019s the deal with dynamically typed languages? In a nutshell, it means there\u2019s no code compilation, so the Python interpreter performs type checking as code runs. As a result, variable types are allowed to change throughout the application.", "It may sound like an advantage, but it can lead to strange and hard-to-track errors as the code base gets larger.", "On the other hand, statically typed languages perform type checks upon compilation (think C or Java). Further, they give you some feeling of safety, as you can immediately tell the type of parameter going into each function.", "Just a quick disclaimer before we start \u2014 Python will always be a dynamically typed language. There\u2019s nothing you can do to make it static as Java or C. PEP 484 introduced type hints, so we\u2019ll have to work with that.", "The article is structured as follows:", "Type hints are just that \u2014 hints. They show you which data type is expected, but nothing is stopping you from ignoring them. We\u2019ll later explore how to force type checking by the Python interpreter, but let\u2019s cover the basics first.", "Let\u2019s make an example without type hints. Below is a function designed to add two numbers and return the sum. Python being Python, we don\u2019t have to specify data types for parameters nor for the return value:", "The printed results from the function calls are 15, 15.3, and BobMark, respectively. To introduce the type hints, we have to do the following:", "Here\u2019s how to add type hints to our sum_numbers function:", "The function is a bit clearer to look at now, but we can still pass any data types \u2014 indicating that hints are just hints, not an obligation.", "Here are type hint recommendations, according to PEP 8:", "We\u2019ll see how to force type checks later.", "We can also provide type hints for variables. Once again, these are just hints and do not affect how the code runs.", "Here\u2019s a quick example of how to add type hints to variables:", "Nothing is stopping you from assigning a value of 32.95 to the variable age, or assigning no to is_premium. Hints only indicate that you shouldn\u2019t.", "Everything we covered thus far is great, but what if you want to declare a list of strings or a dictionary where both keys and values are strings?", "That\u2019s where the typing module comes into play. With it, you can use any more complex data types, such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples. You can also declare your own data types, but that\u2019s a bit out of the scope for today.", "Let\u2019s now use the typing module to declare a list of names, and then a dictionary of emails, where each email belongs to a single name. In all cases, the data type is a string:", "A lot more verbose, but feels safer. Further, let\u2019s see how to make a function parameter to be a list of integers. It\u2019s pretty straightforward:", "You now know how to use type hints to declare a variable of any data type, but how to force type checks on runtime? Let\u2019s explore that next.", "I\u2019m not aware of any methods of forcing type checks in the Notebook environment \u2014 so we\u2019ll switch to scripts. I\u2019ve made a file called static_typing.py, but feel free to name yours as you wish.", "Before proceeding, we\u2019ll have to install a library called mypy. It is used to force type checks on runtime, just what we need. To install it, execute pip install mypy from the Terminal.", "We are now good to go. The static_typing.py script contains the following code:", "From the Terminal, execute the script in the traditional way \u2014 by writing python static_typing.py", "The code will run without throwing an error. This is equivalent to what we did earlier in the Notebook. But we don\u2019t want that. With mypy, we can force the type checks. From the Terminal, execute the following: mypy static_typing.py:", "As you can see, the program crashed. Just the behavior we wanted, as the function expects two integers, but we didn\u2019t provide that data types in the function calls.", "And that\u2019s all you should know for starting out. Let\u2019s wrap things up in the next section.", "Let\u2019s end this article with a couple of pros and cons of using type hints.", "To conclude \u2014 type hints are not required but are good practice, especially when working on large codebases \u2014 even if you decide not to use mypy.", "What are your thoughts on type hints? Do you always use them, or just when the codebase gets larger? Let me know in the comment section below.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
