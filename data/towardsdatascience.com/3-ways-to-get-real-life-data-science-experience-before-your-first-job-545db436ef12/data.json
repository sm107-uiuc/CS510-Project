By completing these projects, you\u2019ll develop a strong understanding of SQL, Pandas, and machine learning modeling.", "With that said, let\u2019s dive into it!", "If you want to be a data scientist, you have to have strong SQL skills. Mode provides three practical SQL case studies that simulate real-life business problems, as well as an online SQL editor where you can write and run queries.", "To open Mode\u2019s SQL editor, go to this link and click on the hyperlink where it says \u2018Open another window to Mode\u2019.", "If you\u2019re new to SQL, I would first start with Mode\u2019s SQL tutorials where you can learn basic, intermediate, and advanced SQL techniques. Feel free to skip this if you already have a good understanding of SQL.", "The objective of this case is to determine the cause for a drop in user engagement for Yammer\u2019s project. Before diving into the data, you should read the overview of what Yammer does here. There are 4 tables that you should work with.", "The link to the case will provide you with much more detail pertaining to the problem, the data, and the questions that should be answered.", "Check out how I approached this case study here if you\u2019d like guidance.", "This case is more focused on product analytics. Here, you\u2019ll be required to dive into the data and determine whether the user experience is good or bad. What makes this case interesting is that it\u2019s up to you to determine what \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 means and how the user experience will be evaluated.", "One of the most practical data science applications is performing A/B tests. In this case study, you\u2019ll dive into the results of an A/B test where there was a 50% difference between the control and treatment groups. Your task for this case is to validate or invalidate the results after a thorough analysis.", "When I first started developing machine learning models, I found that my lack of Pandas skills was a big limitation to what I could do. Unfortunately, there aren\u2019t many resources on the internet that allow you to practice your Pandas skills, unlike Python and SQL\u2026", "A few weeks ago, however, I came across this resource \u2014 this is a repository full of practice problems specifically for Pandas. By completing these practice problems, you\u2019ll know how to:", "If you can complete these practice problems, you should be able to confidently say that you know how to use Pandas for data science projects. It will also help you out significantly for the next section.", "One of the best ways to get data science experience is by creating your own machine learning models. This means finding a public dataset, defining a problem, and solving the problem with machine learning.", "Kaggle is one of the world\u2019s largest data science communities with hundreds of datasets that you can choose from. Below are a couple of ideas that you can use to get started.", "This dataset contains data on various wines, their composition, and their wine quality. This can be a regression or classification problem depending on how you frame it.
