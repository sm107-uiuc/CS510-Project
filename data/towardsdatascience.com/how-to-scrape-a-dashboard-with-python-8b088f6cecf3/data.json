We\u2019re going to learn how to scrape data from a dashboard using the Selenium and Beautiful Soup packages in Python. The Selenium package allows you to write Python code to automate web browser interaction, and the Beautiful Soup package allows you to easily pull data from the HTML code that produces the webpage you want to scrape.", "Our goal is to scrape the Fort Bend County dashboard that visualizes the COVID-19 situation in Fort Bend County in Texas. We will extract the history of total tests performed and the daily case counts reported so that we can estimate the percent of positive cases in Fort Bend County.", "Note that all of the code in this tutorial is written in Python version 3.6.2.", "The first step is to import the Python packages, modules, and methods needed for dashboard scraping. The versions of the packages used in this tutorial are listed below.", "The next step is to write Python code to automate our interaction with the dashboard. Before writing any code, we must look at the dashboard and inspect its source code to identify the HTML elements that contain the data we need. The dashboard source code refers to the HTML code that tells your browser how to render the dashboard web page. To view the dashboard source code, navigate to the dashboard and use the keyboard shortcut Ctrl+Shift+I. An interactive panel containing the dashboard source code will appear.", "Notice that the history of total tests performed and the daily case counts reported are only visible after clicking the \u201cHistory\u201d tab in the \u201cTotal Numbers of Tests Performed at County Sites\u201d panel and the \u201cDaily Case Count\u201d tab in the \u201cConfirmed Cases\u201d panel, respectively. This means that we need to write Python code that automatically clicks on the \u201cHistory\u201d and \u201cDaily Case Count\u201d tabs so that the history of total tests performed and the daily case counts reported will be visible to Beautiful Soup.", "To find the HTML element that contains the \u201cHistory\u201d tab, use the shortcut Ctrl+Shift+C and then click on the \"History\" tab. You will see in the source code panel that the \"History\" tab is in a div element with ID \"ember208\".", "Following the same steps for the \u201cDaily Case Count\u201d tab, you will see that the \u201cDaily Case Count\u201d tab is in a div element with ID \u201cember238\u201d.", "Now that we have identified the elements we need, we can write code that:", "Now, we need to parse the HTML source code to extract the history of total tests performed and the daily case counts reported.

We will divide the cases reported by the tests performed and calculate the 7-day moving averages. It is unclear from the dashboard whether the reported positive cases include cases that were determined through tests not conducted by the county (e.g. tests conducted at a hospital or clinic). It is also unclear when the tests for the positive cases were conducted since the dashboard only displays the reported case date. That is why the positivity rates derived from these data are only considered a rough estimate for the true positivity rate.", "Your home for data science.
