My first math competition was at the age of 23. I was quite good, but it was barely not enough to get into the finals. Right now, I am focusing on data science while I am studying computer science in a graduate program.", "My dream of becoming a data scientist started at the end of my bachelor\u2019s degree in Information Systems and Management. On one hand, I feel overwhelmed by my colleagues which are usually better mathematicians than I am. On the other hand, I think a bachelor\u2019s degree which focuses on business and technology is beneficial to my journey. The reasons for my believes are based on mandatory business classes I had to attend during my undergraduate studies.", "Knowledge Management is the backbone of each successful product. If I think of the thousands of documentations which are made for any software library I use, it becomes clear that this topic is essential. For example, can you imagine how to use the Python Pandas library without its documentation? Another example is how I had to introduce a knowledge management strategy while I was working as a data analyst. As a growing team, we had the problem that new team members don\u2019t know anything about our dashboards. To remember and explain every piece of knowledge seems impossible. For me, it was beneficial to learn some fundamentals of knowledge management, especially if you have to decide what is implicit knowledge and explicit knowledge.", "Data science is not only about dealing with data. It is also to give some advice when it comes to interpreting the data to improve the business processes. During my internship, I realised how complicated those business processes are. Without the knowledge from my class, I hadn\u2019t the opportunity to understand what they are talking most of the time. No matter how good I was in interpreting data, I had to know where our data comes from and why we use it. In the class, we learned the fundamentals of those processes. This gave me an idea of how to use data to improve it. Even dough the course was not about data science at all.", "In this class I heard the terms vision and mission for the very first time. I love it to discuss data science use-cases and applications with friends and family. It seems that you can present your ideas better if you have a vision and a mission in mind, especially if those friends don\u2019t know anything about data science.", "Almost every kind of data within an enterprise comes from an ERP-System. Luckily we had the chance to work with an ERP-System to understand how users produce data you will work with as a data scientist. Unluckily, I was not interested because loosely speaking, I was young and stupid. If I were there again, I would try to understand it better. Especially the human-machine interaction because I think the reason for lousy data quality is connected with those systems.", "Here I learned the fundamentals of ETL and Data Warehousing. Learning about ETL can be seen as my very first experience with data science. I can\u2019t tell how often I have to deal with those topics now. If you have worked in a department which deals with big data, I think you know that. Maybe some students don\u2019t. So, please don\u2019t make the same mistake as I did in the ERP-Systems Seminar. Listen carefully. It will help you a lot if you know how data management works at a company.", "At some point, I got hooked about data science. I chose classes only related to this field. Within one year, I attend online courses, had my first Kaggle competition and learned more about statistics. While I am studying, I work as a Data Analyst at a German engineering company.", "To get even more experience, I decided to attend a Hackathon as a data scientist. I felt well prepared before we got our final task.", "\u201cCreate another product or brand for our company.\u201d", "I thought they would give us a data set or more specific tasks because they have asked for different professions such as Business Gurus, Idea Generator, Data Scientists, etc. I was wrong we haven\u2019t specific tasks, and they asked us not tink of too technical products. Even I was a little bit disappointed because I had different expectations, I tried to be open-minded. I used the knowledge from the classes I had described in the first part and the experience from my jobs and internships.", "After a second-place and four weeks of hacking, I decided to work on my business skills again. Even if I still think it is essential to have strong technical skillsets like Python and Linux, I believe that the following five topics are crucial for a data scientist.", "After the first week, it was clear that the companies from the Hackathon expected from us a product that fits there strategy. It was quite challenging for me to link my ideas about data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence to there strategy. I wish I had a stronger feeling of how to adapt an application to a particular strategy.", "The company expected from us to be entrepreneurs or at least to think like an entrepreneur. I have thought about product ideas before, but I had no clue how to pitch, how to evaluate those ideas. One of my teammates had a startup already. And I was impressed by the passion which she had for it. I try to use this passion as a motivator. Even if I don\u2019t invent a startup, to feel like an entrepreneur was quite fun. And for me having fun is the most crucial factor if it comes to a successful career.", "Peoples who tend to be creative, inventive, have unique perspectives and sharp intellect are the ideal managers. At least in the 90ties.", "This is a quote by the tv-show \u201cHow to sell Drugs online fast.\u201d It was quite funny, but I think there is some hidden truth. In our hackathon group, we always had to deal with argues and misconceptions. I think to learn about leadership is quite important. If I think of a modern manager, I think of a coach. Also, I believe that being a coach is hard, and so I have to work on it as soon as possible.", "I thought already a lot about disruptive technologies. At the same time, I learned that it is one thing to know about technology, but another thing is to see how this will change a market. I hope I will better understand this relationship in the future to know how to use a specific technology.", "It is not enough to have a good idea. You have to convince your stakeholders. I got a first impression of how consumer communication works while I worked as a software engineering intern. At the Hackathon, I learned that this field is growing. It would be better to know how too sell and present your products online in any detail. Otherwise, it will be impossible to launch any product by yourself. I was just impressed by how skilled my team mates were even some of them have a PhD in a completely other field.", "I will work on these fields while I attend the PowerMBA Course. I can\u2019t say if this course will fit to my expectations. So far, I have a strong feeling that it will be beneficial and encourage you to look at these fields as well. It doesn\u2019t matter which courses you take to get into the field as long as you make your first baby steps to improve.", "I am happy that I had the chance to learn about Knowledge Management, Informationmanagemnt and ERP-Systems before I started with Data Science. I think it doesn\u2019t matter where you are at your career; it can be beneficial to learn more about the fields which I had presented. I am happy as well that I had the chance to meet people at the Hackathon who showed to me that a good data scientist is also a generalist. They appreciated my knowledge which I already had, and they encouraged me to work on my business strategies, entrepreneurship, leadership, disruptive technologies and digital marketing skills. I believe if you think of being very good at data science, you should have a look at these topics as well. Again, good is not the same for everyone. But I still hope this gave you some insights if you wan\u2019t to increase your skill set.", "Thanks for reading this article. If you liked it please clap or leave a comment.
