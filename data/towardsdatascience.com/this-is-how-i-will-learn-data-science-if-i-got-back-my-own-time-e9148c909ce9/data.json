Thanks to the power of computation, the huge amount of data, algorithms that uncover patterns in the data, and light-hearted communities on the internet that give us a lot of learning resources for learning Data Science and Machine Learning. This field is also classified as a multi-disciplined field, where you should know programming, statistics, and also domain knowledge that you encounter (i.e. Biology, Economics, Urban Planning, etc.). Even Harvard said that this field is the sexiest job of the 21st century because the impact of the data gives to the companies and also the people.", "Fast-growing means you should learn a lot of things, but how much should you learn? Is Machine Learning from online courses enough? Or should I read the research paper also? Well, those steps are great, but not that useful. Let me give you my story when learning this field for the past 2 years.", "The moment I\u2019ve been introduced to Data Science is when my senior invites me to compete in a Data Science Competition with him and also with his friends. Without further, I said yes, but for the first time I did the project, I don\u2019t have any idea what I\u2019ve done. I\u2019m just so blinded and just say yes back then, but not fully understand it. Although I don\u2019t understand a lot, at least I understand the workflow of the data science itself. Short story, We\u2019ve won 3rd place in that competition, and that\u2019s my first achievement in my campus life.", "After I won those courses, I became eager to learn more about Data Science, buying lots of courses (seriously, don\u2019t buy too much!), attending seminars, watching MOOCs, and also reading Twitter for expanding my knowledge on that field. Doing those things changed my mind on how Data Science impacted our society and I have a lot of insights from it, but there\u2019s one big problem. I can\u2019t do any single projects!", "I feel so frustrated and also overwhelmed because of a lot of learning resources that came on me, but then I\u2019m not feeling that I can do these things. Suddenly, I stopped competing in any competitions and took a break for a little while. After that hiatus, I came back to compete, another Data Science Competition with my friend. And that time, I don\u2019t try to learn anything, instead, I\u2019m just focusing on workflow what I will do. If I find myself an obstacle, I try to find an answer using the internet. You know what? Suddenly my skills are improving so much rather than learning through a lot of courses on the internet. Because of that, my team reached the semifinals, but sadly the event was postponed because of the Coronavirus. It\u2019s okay, at least my skill is improving even further after that and I\u2019ve gained my confidence because of it.", "From that experience, I conclude things that I can advise to you those who want to learn Data Science,", "This is important if you want to start your journey on Data Science. You have to learn Statistics, Programming, and the essential tools that are used for conducting the process. Don\u2019t learn too much, or you will get burned out and also feel overwhelmed by a vast amount of resources.", "Whatever is papers, articles, books, even tweet from the expertise. I would recommend using Twitter for enhancing your knowledge and also gain insight into what happens right now, seriously Twitter has opened my mind a lot about Data Science and Artificial Intelligence.", "By doing projects, you will enhance your skill a lot. What I mean is that you will learn a new skill set based on your projects. By doing that, It will make it stick to your head rather than you taking a course on that skill, but doesn\u2019t have a meaningful thing to use.", "I will be honest to you, learning data science and machine learning is not easy. But, if you want to learn it, learn it effectively! Just learn the fundamentals and then do some projects, trust me, your skill will improve a lot more than before. If you add with some readings on your time, it will increase your insights and drive them into a project that excites you. The learning curve will be steep and there are ups and downs that you will encounter, but if you make it, you will be proud and will appreciate yourself even more.", "Your home for data science.
