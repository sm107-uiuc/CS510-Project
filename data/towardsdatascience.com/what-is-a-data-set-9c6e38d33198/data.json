Perhaps you will identify with Sam or Pam. The first character, Sam, is a researcher and data scientist. The second character, Pam, is also a well-trained and highly skilled professional.", "Following the anecdotal story, this article proceeds to define what a data set is. The constituent components of a data set. How a data set is constructed. And, how a researcher or data analyst can apply an analytical technique to produce a summary of the data. The analytical technique discussed in this article is known as a cross-tabulation.", "Sam, who is a researcher and data scientist meets with Pam, who is an experienced colleague. Sam and Pam need to discuss adding a section to a quarterly report that is due in a few weeks. Sam has yet to be involved in this report but has agreed to help with portions of the analysis.", "The source of Sam and Pam\u2019s frustration is that the two do not yet have a shared vocabulary.", "In preparation for the meeting, Sam asks Pam to bring a copy of relevant original data sets. Sam and Pam thought they understood each other. But they soon realize they have not. At the meeting, Sam provides a printout similar to the following image and offers it as the original data.", "This image (Figure 1) is a cross-tabulation of educational institution type and institution size. It shows how many of each institution type (listed along the rows) existed in each of the size categories (listed across the columns).", "As it turns out, a cross-tabulation is not an original data set. A cross-tabulation can operate as a data set. But a cross-tabulation is not \u2018original data.\u2019", "A cross-tabulation is an analytical technique. The table that results from a cross-tabulation is the output of applying the analytical technique. So, of course, Sam asks again for the original data set. Then, of course, Pam, thinking that she has already provided the data set is frustrated.", "The source of Sam and Pam\u2019s frustration is that the two do not yet have a shared vocabulary. They were not yet communicating effectively. Because Sam and Pam did not have a shared vocabulary they are not only frustrated but their data-related project will also suffer.", "A data set consists of roughly two components. The two components are rows and columns. Additionally, a key feature of a data set is that it is organized so that each row contains one observation.", "Rows and columns are what they sound like. This image (Figure 2) is an extract of the data used to produce the cross-tabulation shown above. These data are from the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS).", "In this example, the rows shown are institution identification number (united), institution name (instm), state abbreviation (stabbr), institution size (instsize), and institution type (sector). Researchers and data scientist refer to these columns as variables, or sometimes as dimensions.", "A key feature is that each row corresponds to one observation. An observation is tangibly related to the process of collecting the information. In the table above, for example, to populate information across the rows, a scientist will observe the first institution and ask \u201cwhat is its name, state, size, and sector.\u201d For Alabama A & M University the answers are \u201cAL,\u201d \u201c5,000\u20139,999\u201d, and \u201cPublic, 4-year or above.\u201d", "For each institution, there is one row. Since there is one row for each institution, this data set is suitable for conducting an analysis where the unit of analysis is an institution of higher education. The next section applies an analytical technique known as cross-tabulation.", "Figure 1 applied an analytical technique known as cross-tabulation to the data shown in Figure 2. The cross-tabulation references two columns or variables (sector and instsize).", "Applying the cross-tabulation technique is simple. To start out, the researcher draws a table that has one row for each institution type and one row for each institution size category. Then, as shown in Figure 1, for the upper left cell the researcher will count and report the number of institutions that are both private 4-year institutions and under 1,000 in student enrollment. Moving down and across the table, the process repeats until all cells are full.", "In my career as a researcher, and then as a data scientist, I have found myself explaining the meaning of \u201cdata set\u201d too many times to count. Building a shared understanding of key terms and phrases such as data set is an important aspect establishing a data-driven culture.", "This article explained and illustrated a data set. Specifically, this article illustrated the process of populating a data set by observing something in the world and then recording the characteristics of the thing being observed. Thus, data sets hold data at the most rudimentary level.", "Likewise, this article also compared data sets to the output of an analytical technique known as cross-tabulation. Populating the data set required observation of the world. Unlike the process associated with populating a data set, it is possible to populate a cross-tabulation without directly observing the world. The cross-tabulation can be built by referencing the data set.", "When Sam explained to Pam what a data set was, and why it was necessary to provide the assistance Pam sought, the two learned and grew together. The next time these two worked together they move through their project more efficiently and with much less frustration.", "Thanks for reading. Send me your thoughts and ideas. You can write just to say hey. And if you really need to tell me how I got it wrong I look forward to chatting soon.
