These companies all look like framing classic problems in robotics in specific contexts related to the foodservice industry. They don\u2019t need to push the limits of the research frontier \u2014 they need to put research in the right place.", "What does this mean for the food we get? I think restaurants that adopt these will take a 10% hit on peak flavor and experience for the potential of 100% consistency.", "Pick and place is a classic problem in robotics. I\u2019ve heard multiple of my colleagues rant at the boredom of this problem, but it comes up everywhere: logistics, manufacturing, delivery, cooking, etc.", "You have and object in position A, and it needs to move to position B.", "This ultimately is what 90% of cooking at scale is. Ingredient i needs to go into dish j at time t. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a good mechanism for robots to feedback based on taste (e.g. the magic of salting a dish from 0 to perfect and getting many flavors to emerge), but I do think robots can repeat these tasks.", "I for one would be totally happy if a robot was making my sandwich at a subway, maybe I am just a clean freak. (Not that I eat at subway, but you get the point.)", "Interested in pick and place? Read more about it here, or maybe watch this video, or check out my colleagues at Berkeley. What makes it hard:", "I wrote about progress in this area here.", "This is a solved problem. I remember watching talks in my internship at Facebook about how the robots can navigate spaces without a map: they just need a goal. When you give a robot a map, it\u2019s an easy problem.", "This seems like an amazing way to keep social distancing rules intact.", "Strap the robot with redundant sensors, tell it to stop moving when an unknown object is too close (customer), and get to a table to deliver food. Remember: a restaurant owner can scan their floor-map and upload it to the robot, so it knows exactly where to expect chairs, tables, other robots, etc.", "Does this mean my food will never get left out to chill off on the kitchen-server border? Sadly, no.", "Scroll time a tab on this website and you see a complex robot hand. Either this startup has some research it isn\u2019t sharing, or it\u2019s trying to build hype. Robots are just starting to solve tasks like Rubik\u2019s cubes and finger twirling, and they expect it to soft beat eggs with a whisk?", "I do think there\u2019s a time when this will all be doable, but having robots do all the dextrous tasks of cooking is not on the menu for the next few years (I think it needs a decade).", "There have been many attempts to capture the novelty of robotics by opening human-less restaurants or coffee shops. The automating of the food to the table takes more coordination than a few robots in a restaurant. Looking at this in the context of the supply chain could be the more valuable venter \u2014 figure out how to automate and optimize the supply chain with humans out of the loop.", "I love the takeaway of the last article that \u201cmaybe we still want to be served by humans,\u201d which I think is a neglected point as we push to automate. I think we need to make sure automation is doing good for all (physical, emotionally, and more) before we just pour money into the checking accounts of a few technology brands.", "As an AI researcher and a cook, maybe this is my calling?
