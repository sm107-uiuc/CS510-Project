It is run three times a year by Pivigo, a London-based tech consultancy, in a fully remote or (not this year) in person way. Participants, organised in teams (4\u20135 people), are assigned a data science project with a commercial partner.", "Why is S2DS useful to aspiring data scientists? In today\u2019s job market, and I have seen it very clearly in my research, advertised job openings usually list previous work experience as required, and employers seem to be reluctant to hire junior candidates. S2DS provides bite-sized data science work experience, a clear and demonstrable achievement, and a chance to get a sneak-peek in the industry.", "How does it compare to other courses, on a surface level? Compared to other bootcamps, S2DS is relatively cheap, and short in time (5 weeks), although very intense, with extra work hours in weekends and evenings often required. It does not come with its own learning material, however a list of recommended books and courses is provided beforehand, most of them free.", "My team was made of other 4 members, all with a background in scientific academic research, similar career paths, and balanced skill-sets. We were assigned a technical mentor from Pivigo, and a project mentor from the partner company, with whom we had meetings at least twice a week. For other issues concerning the programme, a community coordinator and a programme manager were available.", "The programme mainly relies on Slack for communications within teams and across the cohort, in a well organised and easy to pick-up way, and all meetings were done via Zoom or MS Teams. Use of project management tools and Scrum/Agile methods is encouraged, and in our case we had two short stand-up meetings per day, and managed our project tasks with the GitHub Project interface.", "Besides project work and team meetings, the project offers daily Q&A social meetings, in which people from different team can chat and discuss about various topics. Socialisation is encouraged during weekly events, such as chat roulettes and a pub quiz, while useful seminars and panel discussions with industry experts are also organised.", "At the end of the programme, we had two final presentations, one within S2DS and one with the project partner, in which we demonstrated the outcomes of our work.", "Our project partner was the Food Standards Agency, a non-ministerial government department responsible for protecting public health in relation to food in England, Wales and Northern Ireland.", "The aim of our project was to build a pilot tool to explore online marketplaces, and identify optimal strategies to search and collect information about potentially hazardous food sold online.", "As regards the data ethics review, we have analysed the issues concerning web data collection and analysis, such as treatment of sensitive personal information, ethical web scraping, and bias of any kind in data, and applied the analysis\u2019s findings in our app implementation.", "Note that another team in a previous S2DS programme had already worked on the project, developing a tool to collect information from three marketplaces, clean it, store it in a database, and create a data dashboard with some descriptive visualisations.", "We built on top of their effort, keeping the general structure but completely overhauling the single components of the app, plus adding the ad classifier and new interactive dashboard functionalities.", "Note that, due to the confidentiality of the project, I cannot disclose any of the code that has been developed in the programme, or provide a link to the repository.", "This module is based on Scrapy\u2019s spiders, which are classes that define how a marketplace website is scraped, for instance by specifying the url, and the html tags of the information to be extracted.", "The module is initiated by a user command, containing search parameters such as location, keywords, radius of search, etc. (depending on the marketplace), which calls the spider for each website to be scraped. Spiders are specific to single websites, but they are written according to a common specification, in a way that makes their integration seamless.", "This module receives the data collected by the scraper module, and cleans and re-formats the text to produce a uniform output from a potentially heterogeneous input, coming from different websites/marketplaces.", "The preprocessor output is similar to the scraper output, with additional fields, such as cleaned versions of the ad title and description.", "This module has been trained to classify ads as food or non-food based on their content. It is based on a LinearSVC algorithm, and is optimised to minimise false negatives, i.e. food ads classified as non-food.", "The model input is prepared by tokenising and vectorising the ads text by means of dedicated functions within the widespread scikit-learn and NLTK libraries. Training is achieved by manually labelling a set of ads from the marketplaces.", "The classifier is able to reliably predict the ads class, with an overall accuracy (as defined by the F1-score) of 89.6%. The model also assigns a score to each word as a measure of their importance in the prediction, which can give an indication on the ads content.", "The model algorithm was chosen by comparing it to other classifiers, such as Naive Bayes classifier or SGD. In a future version of the project, the model might be changed to classify or cluster according to different criteria, or changed to unsupervised methods, to avoid manual labelling.", "This module accesses the reference database (SQLite format in its current version) and updates it. It is based on a bespoke class that works as a wrapper for SQLite commands.", "Our data dashboard is based on the R Shiny package, and provides several interactive tools to explore the data from the database. For example, the user can get a map with the geographical distribution of selected adverts in different cities, where the size of the bubbles in the chart represents the absolute number of adverts retrieved for each search term and city.", "The dataset can be filtered by location, keyword, and date of data acquisition. The filtered dataset can then be used to create location-specific wordclouds.", "The dashboard can be used to produce a bar plot of word frequency within the dataset as filtered by location, keyword and date, and the number of words to be included in the plot is also customisable.", "The dashboard can be used to display the ads headings and descriptions in the filtered dataset, providing the user of a useful tool to explore the database.", "The choice of Shiny for our dashboard implementation is based on the pre-existing version of the dashboard, which we used as a starting point, and on its flexibility and ease of use.", "The core of the app is a database of ads collected from online marketplaces. In the simplest user case, the user may visualise the information already present by initiating the online dashboard.", "In another scenario, the user may expand the database by collecting new information from online marketplaces, by initiating a command containing search terms and parameters. The data collected by the scraper is then processed, classified and stored in the database.", "In the last scenario, the user may update the classifier with new data, by retraining the model with manually labelled data.", "It was a markedly positive and enjoyable experience, with a lot of valuable work produced and a clear sense of achievement at the end of it. The interaction with our partner organisation had a lot in common with typical industry consortium projects mechanics, at least according to my experience.", "Other bootcamps might provide a closer one-on-one mentorship, however I did not have any difficulty in getting help when I needed. Regarding the absence of learning materials, each project has specific needs and learning where to find the right learning material is an important skill, one that a researcher must have.", "Is it going to help in my job search? The jury is still out on this. While the experience is definitely valuable, and the skills acquired are useful, job market conditions remain tough.", "With the programme now done, I am focusing on showcasing the project work through this blog post (and possibly follow up with more), and by sharing the code, which may or may not be possible depending on the project partner\u2019s policy.", "In my opinion, it would be perhaps useful if Pivigo could actively keep track of past S2DS alumni, to have updated statistics about their career advancement months and years after attending the programme, and show potential career paths to people fresh out of S2DS.", "Does S2DS help with networking? S2DS provides access to a network of alumni and meet-ups that can definitely be useful for career advice and advancement. In pre-COVID times, I attended a few of those meet-ups, and they were interesting and well organised. Online meet-ups are nowhere near as effective, but it is still important to appreciate the organisational effort and make the most of current times.", "Please DM me, comment and connect on LinkedIn if you have any questions regarding S2DS, on the project hereby described, or on anything else.", "The achievements described in this post would not have been possible without the contributions of my awesome team-mates Christian Fernandez-Garcia, Emanuel Blei, Lucia Bandiera and Moumita Aich. All the pictures and results shown come from our work within the team.", "I am a Data Scientist currently looking for new opportunities.
