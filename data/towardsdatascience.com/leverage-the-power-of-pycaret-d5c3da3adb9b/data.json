The perfect reader is aware of the need for automation and doesn\u2019t want to spend so much time seeking the optimal algorithm and its hyperparameters.", "As machine learning practitioners, we know that there are several steps involved in the life cycle of a complete Data Science project and these include Data Preprocessing \u2014 missing value treatment, null value treatment, changing the data types, encoding techniques for categorical features, data transformation \u2014 log, box cox transformations, feature engineering, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), etc. before we can actually start the model building, evaluation and prediction. So we use various libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib scikit-learn, etc in python for accomplishing these tasks. So Pycaret is a very powerful library that helps us in the automation of the process.", "Once Pycaret is installed, we are ready to go! I am going to discuss a regression problem here and Pycaret can be used for many problems such as classification, anomaly detection, clustering, Natural Language Processing.", "I am going to use the Laptop Prices dataset here which I have obtained from scraping Flipkart website.", "The setup() function of Pycaret does most of the correction, which is normally done with many lines of code \u2014 is done in a single line of code! That\u2019s the beauty of this amazing library!", "We use the setup variable, and in the target, we mention the feature name (dependent variable)-here we want to predict the Price of the laptop so that becomes the dependent variable.", "Training all the regression models. So after this, we can create any model-either CatBoost or else XGBoost regressor model, and then we can perform hyperparameter tuning.", "We can see that our Gradient Boosting Regressor (GBR) model has performed relatively better when compared to all the other models. But I have performed the analysis using the XGBoost model as well, and this model performed better than the GBR Model.", "As we have identified the best model to be XGBoost so we create xgboost model with the help of create_model function and mention the max_depth(number of iteration for which the model will run)", "So after creating the model with a depth of 10, it runs 10 iterations and calculates the MAE(Mean Absolute Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R2(R2_score-R squared value), MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) in every iteration. Finally, it displays the mean and standard deviation of all the errors in these 10 iterations. Lesser the error better is the machine learning model! So in order to reduce the error, we try to find out the hyperparameters which can minimize the error.", "For this purpose, we apply the tune_model function and apply K-fold cross-validation to find out the best hyperparameters.", "The model runs 5 iterations and gives us the mean and standard deviation of all the errors. The mean value of MAE after 5 iterations was almost the same for both GBR and XGBoost models, but after hyper tuning and making the predictions, the XGBoost model had less error and performed better than the GBR model.", "Making predictions using the best model", "Checking the scores after applying Cross Validation (we mainly need the Mean Absolute Error). Here we can see that the MAE for the best model has come down to 10847.2257 so the Mean Absolute Error is approximately 10,000.", "Checking all the parameters of the xgboost model", "The distances (errors) between the actual and predicted values", "We can clearly see that my model is overfitting as the R squared for training set is 0.999 and test set is 0.843. This is actually not surprising because my dataset contains a total of only 168 rows! But the main point here is to highlight the excellent features of Pycaret as you can create plots and curves with just one line of code!", "The value of R squared for the model is 0.843.", "These 2 plots also show us that the model is clearly overfitting!", "By this plot, we can see that Processor_Type_i9 (i9 CPU) is a very important feature for determining the price of the laptop.", "Splitting the dataset into training and testing set", "Making the prediction on the unseen data ( Test set data)", "Saving the transformation pipeline and model", "So this is the final Machine Learning model that can be used for deployment.", "The model is saved in the pickle format!", "For more info, check the documentation here", "In this article, I have not discussed everything in detail. But you can always refer to my GitHub Repository for the whole code. My conclusion from this article is that don\u2019t expect a perfect model, but expect something you can use in your own company/project today!", "Shout out to Moez Ali for this absolutely brilliant library!", "Connect with me on LinkedIn here", "The bottom line is that the automation lowers the risk of human error and adds some intelligence to the enterprise system. \u2014 Stephen Elliot", "I hope you found the article insightful.
