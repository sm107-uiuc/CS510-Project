Since then, the country has opened the economy and moved down to the lowest alert level. Although the country has been on alert level 1 for more than two months, mobility data indicates that there is still significantly less activity than before the onset of the lockdown. People are still spending substantially more time at home.", "To provide insight into how covid-19 is affecting mobility across the world, Google has been providing community mobility reports since February this year\u00b9. Using Google Maps data and mobility between the 3rd of January and 6th of February as a baseline, Google measures the collective change in both frequency and duration of visits across six categories of locations relative to the baseline. There is a single baseline value for each day of the week. The six location categories are: residential, workplaces, public transport stations, parks, grocery and pharmacy, and retail and recreation.", "South Africa has occupied five covid-19 alert levels since the initial lockdown in March\u00b2. Alert Level 5 severely restricted mobility by banning almost all gatherings and only permitting travel for accessing and delivering essential services, or the purchasing of groceries and medication. The level also enforced a curfew between 8pm and 5am. Alert Level 4, beginning on the 1st of May, continued to severely restrict gatherings with parks and restaurants remaining closed and the same curfew remaining in place. The government encouraged people to work from home the entire year and required essential services workers to carry travel permits throughout the first two levels.", "Beginning on the 1st of June, alert level 3 saw the eventual opening of restaurants, parks, and provincial borders for leisure travel. The sale of alcohol was allowed at the start of the alert level but prohibited during the last month. The curfew was also eased to between 10pm and 4am. Alert level 2 began on the 18th of August and saw a further relaxing of restrictions, including the reintroduction of alcohol sales. However, gatherings remained heavily restricted. During alert level 1, which started on the 21st of September and continues today, gatherings of no more than 250 persons (or 500 persons if outdoors) are permitted provided the venue does not exceed 50% of its total capacity. The curfew has also been further extended to between midnight and 4am.", "Table 1: Average percentage change in visit frequency and duration from baseline (ignoring public holidays)", "The clearest illustration of how covid-19 has affected mobility in South Africa can be seen by observing the mobility trends for places of residence and work. During level 5, people spent 32% more time at home and 64% less time at workplaces, relative to the baseline. As the restrictions were relaxed through to level 1, both these numbers dropped by about two thirds. The graph below shows this progression over time, and the gradual return to the office for some. People are currently spending 11% more time at home and 17% less time at workplaces. This is likely almost fully accounted for by the work-from-home trend and job losses, both of which have been ubiquitous with the year 2020.", "Figure 1: Mobility trends for places of residence and work", "In addition to staying at home for work, South Africans seem to be heeding the general calls to stay home. In public transport locations Google include bus, train, and taxi stations. Unsurprisingly these locations have consistently seen the largest decline in visits during each alert level. Travel remains low, currently averaging 29% lower than the baseline. The retail and recreation category includes restaurants, cinemas, cafes, and shopping centres. These locations were only allowed to open in alert level 3. The reopening in this category was gradual. Some retailers are still unable to reopen and none are permitted to operate at full capacity. At present, retail and recreational activity stands at 14% below the baseline.", "Figure 2: Mobility trends for public transport stations", "Figure 3: Mobility trends for retail and recreational locations", "Among the categories that saw declines, parks, which include national parks and beaches, have seen the least fluctuation during the lockdown. The category does however remain far below the baseline. It is somewhat surprising that the time spent at parks declined further to 29% below the baseline during level 1 compared to 14% below in level 2. Leisure activity tends to increase during the festive season, particularly as more time is spent at parks and beaches during the hot summer months. Since the data analysed here ends in early December, observing more mobility in the month may paint a more predictable picture.", "Figure 4: Mobility trends for parks", "The only category for which mobility has returned to pre-lockdown levels is grocery and pharmacy. Although time spent at grocery stores and pharmacies also saw a rapid decline during level 5, it has since returned to the baseline level. Visits to these locations were classified as essential throughout so it is not unexpected that it would be the first to return to what was previously considered a normal level.", "Figure 5: Mobility trends for grocery and pharmacy", "The approval and roll out of vaccines in some parts of the world provides some hope for the recovery of mobility, but South Africa is far from the front of the line. South Africa has just entered its second wave of covid-19 infections and tighter restrictions may follow. People have spent more time at home this year, more so than strictly required. However, it remains to be seen which of these trends will hold during the festive season and into the new year.", "The code I used to conduct the analysis and produce the graphs can be found in my repository here: https://github.com/ValentineChisango/SouthAfrica_Mobility", "[1] For more information about Google\u2019s mobility reports, visit https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/", "[2] For more information about South Africa\u2019s covid-19 alert system, visit https://www.gov.za/covid-19/about/about-alert-system", "Your home for data science.
