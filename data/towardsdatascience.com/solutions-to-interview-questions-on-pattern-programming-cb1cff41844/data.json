So, python will be the language of choice for this article.", "However, the language used will not matter much, and only the interesting logic behind solving these problems is important. Today, we will be looking at a few of these basic questions.", "So, without further ado, let us get our hands dirty and start coding!", "The above pattern is the first type of question that we will solve in this article. Most of these pattern type questions can be solved with two or three iteration operations quite easily.", "On closer observation, you can notice that after the first number is printed the cursor jumps to the next line, then after the printing of 2 numbers the cursor again moves to the next line, and so on.", "Our logic for solving this pattern will be quite simple. We will have 5 rows, and then we will move the cursor subsequently after the printing of the numbers equal to its row number.", "By this, I mean that for the first row, 1 number will be printed, the second row will print 2 numbers, and so on.", "Note: There are multiple solutions to the problems that are addressed in this article. These are the codes and methods which I have chosen. You can feel free to solve them in any way you feel is more comfortable to your programming style.", "you can choose the number of rows according to the user\u2019s input by defining a user-defined variable as follows:", "The logic I suggested previously is implemented in the code block. The most crucial point to remember is that the inner loop is always implemented first. After that, the outer loop gets executed. The range function always includes the first number specified and ignores the last digit considering the n-1 value instead. (where n is the last digit, in this case, it is 6).", "In this program, we are specifying the number of rows that are going to be interpreted accordingly. After that, we are running the inner loop, which executes according to the number of rows we have. And we are printing \u2018j\u2019 because each time the value is reset to one, and it prints the values respective to the increasing order of the rows.", "Note: For the rest of the article, I will be using a default of 5 rows. You can choose either of the two methods you prefer.", "The second pattern program that we will solve is quite similar to the first half-pyramid question. The only difference here is that we need to print the number equivalent to the number of rows, and the number needs to be interpreted according to its respective value.", "This means that the number \u20181\u2019 will be interpreted first and will only be printed once. The number \u20182\u2019 will be executed second and will be printed twice, and so on.", "In this program, we are specifying the number of rows that are going to be interpreted accordingly. After that, we are running the inner loop, which executes according to the number of rows we have.", "After this, we will print \u2018i\u2019 each time the execution is completed. \u2018i\u2019 specifies the ith row as well as the number \u2018i,\u2019 which has to be printed for each consecutive iteration. This means that the number \u20181\u2019 will be interpreted first and will only be printed once. The number \u20182\u2019 will be executed second and will be printed twice, and so on.", "The next pattern program should be quite simple as we have already solved two similar questions previously. This can, in fact, be done in two approaches.", "Both the methods to solve them are as mentioned in the previous two questions. The only replacement is to use the asterisk \u2018*\u201d replacement instead of the numbers \u2018i\u2019 or \u2018j.\u2019 Note that other symbols like hash \u2018#\u2019 can also be asked, but the methodology remains the same.", "Both the code blocks are shown above are valid ways to solve this pattern program.", "We are calculating the range up to the number of rows and then executing the desired value of asterisk equivalent to the number of rows. The moving of the cursor to the next line is followed by the code suggested with the inner \u2018j\u2019 loop of the code blocks.", "The next pattern program we will encounter is the inverse half-pyramid of the numbers. Here, we have five rows similar to the previous questions. We have to start with the maximum number of rows mentioned all the way to the bottom containing only one number.", "For the next few pattern programs, we will use the logic of backward iteration of using range(N, -1, -1), which represents a reverse implementation of the iterating numbers.", "The code block above shows two consecutive for loops to perform outer and inner iterations in a reversed manner. Here, we are starting with the 1st row, and we are printing five numbers backward. This implementation will result in decreasing order of the number of rows until we reach the sustainable end for the number of loops.", "This pattern program is the second variation of the previously solved inverse half-pyramid question. The logic is simple. There are five rows and we are printing the number of rows equivalent to the numbers of each row in a reversed order.", "Even for this pattern program, we will use the logic of backward iteration of using range(N, -1, -1), which represents a reverse implementation of the iterating numbers.", "The code block above shows two consecutive for loops to perform outer and inner iterations in a reversed manner. Here, we are starting with the 1st row, and we are printing five numbers backward.", "The numbers printed in this implementation will result in decreasing order of the number of rows until we reach the sustainable end for the number of loops, and each number printed is equal to the reversed order of the loop.", "Even for this pattern program, we will use the logic of backward iteration of using range(N, -1, -1), which represents a reverse implementation of the iterating numbers. The logic is similar to the previous two pattern programs that are explained accordingly.", "The explanation is similar to the previous two inverse half-pyramid pattern programs. We are just printing the symbol instead of the row or column number.", "This is the final half pyramid implementation of this article. We are printing each number accordingly in ascending order. The rows and columns will be incremented, as shown in previous pattern programs. However, we will use an incremental count for calculating the increasing numbers.", "Here, in the above code block, we have assigned a count with the variable \u2018num\u2019 that will start with 1 and keep increasing accordingly. The number of rows and columns will be handled respectively with the \u2018ith\u2019 and \u2018jth\u2019 for loop. I would recommend trying out the reverse implementation as well for the same question.", "The Final pattern program that we will analyze how to solve today is the full pyramid with an Asterisk. You can feel free to try this out with numbers as well on your own for a better conceptual understanding.", "We will use an extra variable for the calculation of the spaces required according to the problem. The computations for the rows and columns will remain almost the same as processed in the previous pattern programming questions.", "In this pattern program, we have used the number \u2019n\u2019 for input from the user. The \u2018k\u2019 variable is used for calculating the number of spaces accordingly. Once the number of spaces is calculated, we will subtract the remaining spaces. The \u2018i\u2019th row and \u2018j\u2019th column are calculated similarly to all the other pattern programs.", "In this article, we managed to cover most of the basic pattern programming questions that might be asked in interviews and how to solve them systematically.", "There are lots of patterns possible in the world of programming, and there are tons of patterns more that you can construct by using a programming language of your choice.", "If you guys are interested in these, then I will also make a part-2 covering more such similar pattern programming questions that could potentially be asked in interviews.", "Also, the viewers can feel free to let me know if you have any queries regarding the solutions to the problems that we solved today. Also, feel free to suggest more question patterns that you think I should cover in the future.", "Check out some of my other articles that you might enjoy reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope you guys enjoyed reading this article. I wish you all have a wonderful day ahead!", "Your home for data science.
