In practice, this Algorithm should be useful enough for us to classify our data whenever we have already made classifications (in this case, color), which will serve as a starting point to find neighbors.", "For this post, we will use a specific dataset which can be downloaded here. It contains 539 two dimensional data points, each with a specific color classification. Our goal will be to separate them into two groups (train and test) and try to guess our test sample colors based on our algorithm recommendation.", "We will create two different sample sets:", "We can observe that our train data is classified into 3 clusters based on colors.", "Even though we know the original color classification of our test data, we will try to create a model that can guess its color based solely on an educated guess. For this, we will remove their original colors and save them only for testing purposes; once our model makes its prediction, we will be able to calculate our Model Accuracy by comparing the original versus our prediction.", "Below is a step-by-step example of an implementation of this algorithm. What we want to achieve is for each selected gray point above (our test values), where we allegedly do not know their actual color, find the nearest neighbor or nearest colored data point from our train values and assign the same color as this one.", "For this, we will use a method called \u201ccross-validation\u201d. What this means is that we will make predictions within the training data itself and iterate this on many different values of K for many different folds or permutations of the data. Once we are done, we will average our results and obtain the best K for our \u201cK-Nearest\u201d Neighbors algorithm.", "As seen in the plot above, we can observe that our algorithm\u2019s prediction accuracy is in the range of 88%-95% for all folds and decreasing from K=3 onwards. We can observe the highest consistent accuracy results on K=1 (3 is also a good alternative).", "As seen by the results above, we can expect to \u201cguess the correct class or color\u201d 93% of the time.", "Below we can observe the original colors or classes of our test sample.", "Using our algorithm, we obtain the following colors for our initially colorless sample dataset.", "As seen in the plot above, it seems even though our algorithm correctly classified most of the data points, it failed with some of them (marked in red).", "Finally, we can visualize our \u201cdecision limits\u201d over our original Test Dataset. This provides an excellent visual approximation of how well our model is classifying our data and the limits of its classification space.", "In simple words, we will simulate 160.000 data points (400x400 matrix) within the range of our original dataset, which, when later plotted, will fill most of the empty spaces with colors. This will help us express in detail how our model would classify this 2D space within it\u2019s learned color classes. The more points we generate, the better our \u201cresolution\u201d will be, much like pixels on a TV.", "As seen above, the colored region represents which areas our algorithm would define as a \u201ccolored data point\u201d. It is visible why it failed to classify some of them correctly.", "K-Nearest Neighbors is a straightforward algorithm that seems to provide excellent results. Even though we can classify items by eye here, this model also works in cases of higher dimensions where we cannot merely observe them by the naked eye. For this to work, we need to have a training dataset with existing classifications, which we will later use to classify data around it, meaning it is a supervised machine learning algorithm.", "Sadly, this method presents difficulties in scenarios such as in the presence of intricate patterns that cannot be represented by simple straight distance, like in the cases of radial or nested clusters. It also has the problem of performance since, for every classification of a new data point, we need to compare it to every single point in our training dataset, which is resource and time intensive since it requires replication and iteration of the complete set.", "Your home for data science.
