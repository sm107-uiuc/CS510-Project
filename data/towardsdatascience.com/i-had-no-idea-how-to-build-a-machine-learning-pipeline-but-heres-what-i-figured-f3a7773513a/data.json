Also, I could barely find any specific information or code out there on this topic, hence I decided to write this topic.", "This article will present a basic structure of how a simple ML pipeline can be created (More information may be supplemented over time).", "As the word \u2018pipeline\u2019 suggests, it is a series of steps chained together in the ML cycle that often involves obtaining the data, processing the data, training/testing on various ML algorithms and finally obtaining some output (in the form of a prediction, etc). Unlike a traditional \u2018pipeline\u2019, new real-life inputs and its outputs often feed back to the pipeline which updates the model. This article by Microsoft Azure describes ML pipelines well.", "Simply put, ML has become so widespread so quickly that accuracy of models has become equally important as the ability to access, scale and store these models. A ML pipeline is essentially an automated ML workflow.", "(Pipelines have now become available on platforms like Azure Machine Learning Pipeline and Amazon SageMaker. While they represent a fast and efficient way for data teams to build and deploy, this article does not address these aforementioned services.)", "In building and deploying ML models, efficiency is key. However, understanding the nuances and pains will help us understand why an automated workflow is very much preferred, especially when we talk about scalability and ease of tracking changes.", "Besides having a proper structure and a way to segregate different parts of the ML stack (data processing, feature selection, etc), it is worth mentioning that logging changes are also an important part of ML model deployments. Here are some reasons why:", "This is essentially a bash script to do the following (non-exhaustive):", "This should be the main file which executes bulk of the code. This should include code to parse the configuration file (in step 5). An example could be as such (example taken from Martin Thoma \u2014 huge shoutout for the help!):", "After which, this file can be used to run code in other scripts that may be created for data preprocessing, feature selection, parameter tuning, etc. This file forms the backbone of the other files.", "Typically, model configuration (to tune hyperparameters, etc) has always been written in the code block itself. However, it is becoming a practice to maintain these configurations in a separate configuration file as they can be processed more easily and removes the need to tamper within the actual code block. These are typically .yaml files. The following should be configurable from the configuration files:", "An example of how a .yaml file would look like:", "6. Any other python modules/classes/scripts created", "This can range anything from data preprocessing, feature selection and basically anything you would need to do to process the data.", "Having a proper folder structure is important as this becomes a lot neater and clearer to anyone else who is trying to understand how the project works.", "Every machine learning model would have an evaluation metric, usually in the form of cross-entropy (a.k.a. log loss), mean squared/absolute error or simply accuracy (or precision/recall). These metrics can be output to the console to help the user determine if the model is improving or not, or can be logged to a text file.", "Hope this helps out anyone who is trying to understand why Machine Learning pipelines are important and how to create one!", "Support me! \u2014 If you like my content and are not subscribed to Medium, do consider supporting me and subscribing via my referral link here (NOTE: a portion of your membership fees will be apportioned to me as referral fees).", "Your home for data science.
