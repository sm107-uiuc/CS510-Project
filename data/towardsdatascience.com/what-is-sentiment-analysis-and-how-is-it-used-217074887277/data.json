Can you remember?", "Maybe you sat next to the one crying baby\u2026 or maybe you were given a free upgrade and enjoyed more leg room.", "Maybe the flight attendant spilled coffee on you\u2026 or maybe they were pleasant and made you feel at ease.", "Or maybe you don\u2019t even remember your last flight because nothing memorable happened\u2014probably a good thing!", "Regardless of your experience, you might receive a survey sent out by your airline. They want to know how the flight was through your perspective.", "Some survey questions may ask you to rate a service from 1\u201310, like how helpful the flight attendants were, or how clean the bathrooms were.", "They may also ask open-ended questions\u2014\u201cTell us about your experience and anything we can do to improve.\u201d", "Let\u2019s look at United Airlines as an example. According to their most recent fact sheet, United had 162 million passengers last year.", "If we can assume that their marketing department randomly sends out a survey to every 30th person, and gets a response rate of 5%, then:", "That\u2019s a lot of data! That\u2019s 270,000 cells in a spreadsheet with free-text answers to what United can do to improve their service.", "The opinions contained in this data are incredibly valuable to management for figuring out how to make their passengers happier.", "Unfortunately, for many companies the next step is to have a room full of interns split and scour the spreadsheet. Or worse, the spreadsheet is pushed into a dark corner never to be seen again.", "However, to save intern sanity and the insights waiting to be revealed, we can leverage the fascinating method of sentiment analysis.", "Sentiment simply describes an opinion about something \u2014 whether an event you read about in the news, the book you bought from Amazon, or your feelings about your dog after they made a mess on the carpet.", "We could probably call the practice opinion analysis, but this doesn\u2019t sound as catchy does it?", "Opinions can be fleeting and ever-changing. Your pet is the beast who ruined a carpet one minute, and is a lovable fuzz-ball of energy the next.", "In our airline example, there are likely hundreds of opinions scattered among the passengers on any given flight.", "In an attempt to wrangle the scattershot opinions of the masses, natural language practitioners have refined Sentiment Analysis to derive meaning from the unstructured and incredibly varied nature of opinion data.", "Sentiment analysis can label our data in various ways to make it easier to gain insight from our otherwise messy unstructured data.", "The first and most often used metric is polarity.", "Polarity simply refers to whether language is positive, negative or neutral. Much of sentiment analysis is concerned with boiling text down into a number\u2014say, between -10 and +10, indicating the polarity of a statement.", "While \u201cthese peanuts are salty\u201d may register as 0 (neutral polarity), we may expect \u201cthese wonderful peanuts saved my marriage\u201d may register as +10 (positive polarity).", "Meanwhile, \u201cthese rancid peanuts are gross\u201d elicits a -8 (negative polarity).", "Sentiment analysis can also label text as subjective or objective.", "Subjective text implies opinionated text\u2014not necessarily provable or fact-based. Opinions about how good or bad carrot cake is falls into this category.", "Objectivity on the other hand covers fact-based language not influenced by personal opinion\u2014like \u201ccarrot cake has carrots\u201d.", "Filtering for subjectivity is especially useful when parsing customer feedback or reviews. We don\u2019t care that the airplane took off, we want to know how the take-off was.", "Finally, there is feature-based sentiment analysis. Consider the below product review:", "Notice how there is some conflicting sentiment in this text. If we tried to summarize the polarity as a whole, we might end up with something fairly neutral.", "However, when we break the text into its features, we can get a much clearer and more usable idea of what this customer likes and dislikes.", "Feature-based (or aspect-based) sentiment analysis is concerned with finding who the opinion-holder is, what the object is that is being evaluated, and what the actual opinion is.", "In the above example, this method may be able to pick out that this customer loves the Nike brand, and thinks these shoes are cute and comfy. However, the system also sees that horrible blisters and waste of money are the negative factors associated with the shoes.", "By breaking these features out, we may be much more likely to predict a 1-star review. We may even be able to recommend other Nike shoes that are cute and comfy, where \u201cno blisters\u201d is a feature we\u2019ve extracted from reviews.", "Given the scattered nature of opinion, and the general messiness of written language, we should pay our respects to the brave souls who first began trying to make sense of the chaos.", "A study of the historical use of sentiment analysis shows that 99% of all papers on sentiment analysis take place after 2004. This is in large part due to increased computing power.", "The above graph from Google Trends shows search volume since 2004. Red is customer feedback, and blue is sentiment analysis.", "While customer feedback has always enjoyed prominence as an important topic, sentiment analysis has quickly caught up and even surpassed it.", "Some interesting historical findings from this study shed light on some of the first attempts to use sentiment analysis:", "In broad strokes, modern sentiment analysis took hold in the 2000\u2019s. One of the first general-use tools applied cross-domain to many issues was called the \u201cGeneral Inquirer\u201d. The tool was first developed with US grants in the 1990\u2019s and became widely available for academic research around 2002.", "The General Inquirer was a set of hand-coded techniques, including mapping words to a variety of categories. The biggest category is Negative (with words like awful, terrible, horrendous, etc.).", "Stepping further into the 2010\u2019s, the above cited study shows a word cloud formed from sentiment analysis papers. The bottom half represents keywords pre-2013, and the top half represents keywords since:", "There is a distinct shift from \u201cweb\u201d to \u201csocial\u201d, and a shift to deep learning techniques like neural networks. These state-of-the-art models take us right up to the present day.", "Some of the earlier attempts, including the General Inquirer, used \u201cknowledge-based\u201d techniques like creating a custom dictionary of hard-coded words with an \u201cunambiguous affect\u201d.", "In other words, these techniques focused on words that rarely have a double-meaning. These words almost always indicate good or bad, like \u201chappy\u201d, \u201csad\u201d, \u201cafraid\u201d, \u201cbored\u201d. You may also see these referred to as lexicon-based approaches.", "One downside of knowledge-based techniques is that, depending on the context of your dataset, a general knowledge-based dictionary may miss out on important words.", "For example, an article about cancer may talk about \u201cunstoppable growth\u201d. In this context, this is bad.", "But in the context of an article about startup businesses, \u201cunstoppable growth\u201d is considered good.", "To get highly accurate results for each type of data you\u2019re looking at with the knowledge-based approach, you may need to tailor your hard-coded dictionaries. This can be time intensive.", "There are some methods of knowledge-based techniques that try finding context-specific keywords automatically. One example relies on conjunctions like \u201cand\u201d or \u201cbut\u201d.", "Let\u2019s say we see a sentence about \u201cpatient deterioration and unstoppable growth\u201d. Because deterioration is found in the negative dictionary, we can infer that unstoppable growth is also negative.", "This proximity of words (which also implies how they are related) is also called co-occurrence.", "Knowledge-based techniques contrast with later more sophisticated \u201cstatistical\u201d techniques and machine learning approaches. These methods rely more heavily on inference gained through large amounts of text.", "If co-occurrences can be wrangled from text manually, or maybe inferred with automatic rules-based approach, then a statistical approach is leveraged in a more automated way that can scale to billions of data points.", "With this statistical approach we use a massive amount of data to make inferences about co-occurrence relatively quickly.", "If a word is often found among polar-positive words, we assign a positive polarity to that word, too. Same for negative words.", "We keep iterating and training over a large corpus of text\u2014say, all articles in Wikipedia. Ultimately, the outcome is a weighting for most words in the English language that we can then use for predicting sentiment of new text.", "Note that this works for context-specific natural language, too. In our earlier medical text example, we would train our model on only a corpus of medical literature to capture polarity of subject-specific keywords.", "Much of the statistical approach still relies on the meanings of individual words\u2014keeping a sort of scoreboard for the sentiment of a given text.", "But we must also consider the interactions between words. Semantic analysis models are more accurate when considering the meaning of many words in a longer phrase or sentence. Of course, this means we must train more complicated models that use more computational resources and take longer to run.", "\u201cA friend told me I would love this sandwich.", "Even though I normally love good peanut butter, the type used here is not creamy enough.", "The jelly is good but there\u2019s just not enough of it.\u201d", "This PB&J review has lots of mixed signals. We\u2019d assign a relatively positive polarity to it if we focused on only the words themselves without the phrases they\u2019re used in. There\u2019s a lot of \u201clove\u201d and \u201cgood\u201d, for example.", "While a deeper dive of neural networks is outside the scope of this discussion, it is important to know that these models can hold and weigh millions of features about the text in order to ultimately provide a prediction on polarity.", "For example, a trained neural network may analyze the text sentence-by-sentence and word-by-word.", "If \u201cEven though\u201d is used earlier in the sentence, the model may discount positive sentiment for the rest of the sentence. Similarly, \u201cgood but\u201d will likely be discounted, and \u201clove this sandwich\u201d may be correctly attributed to the customer\u2019s friend instead of the customer themself.", "Nicely done! If you\u2019ve made it this far, you\u2019ve gained a good understanding of what sentiment analysis is and how it works behind the scenes to extract extremely valuable insights.", "Needless to say, NLP is rapidly growing and changing\u2014sentiment analysis along with it. By the time I publish this there will probably be another breakthrough in methodology that allows even greater accuracy.", "In the meantime, if you are interested in learning more about sentiment analysis, one of the best things you can do is to start exploring and practicing hands-on. Come up with a problem you think could be solved with one of the methods we\u2019ve described above, and get coding!", "Your home for data science.
