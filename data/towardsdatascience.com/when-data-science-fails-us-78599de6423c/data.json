Timelines have been changed, customer interactions transformed and internal communication dematerialized. As a result, all of our models that were based on previous years and historical wisdom have been questioned and challenged. What is their relevance in today\u2019s environment?", "\u201cHow do we reconcile the need to use the past as a guide with our recognition that the future may be different?\u201d The signal and the noise", "A common practice in data science is to examine available historical data in order to draw useful conclusions for better planning.", "\u2018Studying the European market of the 90\u2019 would certainly be of great help to a historian; but what kind of inference can we make now that the structure of the institutions and the markets have changed so much.\u2019 Nassim Taleb", "A dataset is a tabular representation of what has happened in the past. But this representation is also accompanied by uncertainties, biases, and errors. In addition, it represents only a subset of the phenomenon you are studying and may not reflect the subset that is relevant to your problem (data availability).", "Several caveats should be noted when reviewing the historical data:", "In this context, similar inputs can lead to different results.", "When designing clinical trials, an important step is the selection of the patient population. Which population category should be selected? Which age group, what is their condition, their origin, their biomarkers? How can we ensure that this sample is as close as possible to the target customers to whom we want to provide the drug, without missing anyone?", "Conversely, if your sample does not accurately represent the population, your drug may be less effective than what your trial showed. For example, if you develop a drug for people with breast cancer, but do not include diabetics with obesity in your sample, you may later discover that these people do not respond well to treatment and cannot use it.", "The same applies to the use of historical data to build inferences, but the limitations are even more subtle to grasp. If you look at all the past data on financial loans, you may think that they reflect the general trend and that the future is likely to be the same. However, these financial loans may have been made only to people with sufficient wealth and did not take into account the rest of the population since they are not even included in the dataset.", "When the pattern is primarily a reflection of variance and randomness, the causality identified will be misleading to understand the actual behavior of the phenomenon. This is what happens to some very successful traders who benefit from the variance of trading results as Nassim Taleb points out in his book \u201cFooled by Randomness\u201d. [1]", "\u201cMany are so unoriginal, they study history to find mistakes to repeat\u201d Nassim Taleb", "The challenge may be even more subtle, as a recent study found that some models trained to detect pneumonia on chest x-rays had poorer results on actual data not visible in the training set. This is partly due to the difference in image acquisition and processing.[2]", "This is what we call the covariate shift. When the distribution of your input variables is different in your production model (real setting) compared to your training set.", "Models are built not only from data but more importantly from the subset of available (vs non-available) data that we decide to focus on. This decision influences the direction the model takes in learning and can lead to more discrimination.", "In her article, Laura Bronner sheds light on the misleading statistics published on the violence against the black community. [3] Many of the published statistics relate to the number of deaths per encounter with the police. However, these statistics hide the discrimination that occurs before, when police had discretion over who they engaged with on the street. The denominator of the measures should not be the encounter, but the population.", "Similarly, in his interview with HBO, Donald Trump said that the U.S. has performed well compared to other countries, using the number of deaths per infected metric.", "Around the 14'-15' of the interview, Trump tries to defend the poor performance of the United States in the fight against the pandemic by using this statistical flaw. The diagram below highlights the statistical flaw in his reasoning.", "In this example, country B has both more infected cases and more death for the same population. For two similar countries with a comparable population, rational thinking would suggest that country A managed the pandemic better than country B.", "However, if you look at the ratio of deaths per infected person, as shown by the test results, the story is different. That\u2019s what Trump did in the video. In the example above, country A has a death rate of 0.23, while country B has a rate of only 0.2.", "This metric will either highlight better testing capabilities or a higher infection rate of the global population. This makes it difficult to understand how a country was able to better contain the spread of the virus and its mortality.", "Web bias happens because of the skewed nature of web activities. A study by Ricardo Baeza-Yates [4] showed that:", "This shows that most of the information we see comes from a minority set of sources, a pattern also called the wisdom of a few: a small set of well-selected users is a good proxy for predicting activity. However, further analysis has shown that many of the top users come from software or publish low-quality content. It is clear that raw user data cannot be used to make inferences as such.", "\u201cAt the very moment when the present least resembles the past, it makes little sense to look back in time for clues about the future\u201d J. Peter Scoblic", "If the future seems radically different from the past, then basing all your decisions about the future on what you have experienced so far no longer works. You are missing opportunities because you don\u2019t see how the world is changing.", "In a world where the future seems really different from the past, this ability to recognize patterns might even be a disadvantage, because you\u2019ll assume that you know what\u2019s going to happen next, but you\u2019ll be wrong. You will make incorrect assumptions about the future.", "\u201cHistory teaches us that thing that never happened before do happen. [\u2026] History teaches us to avoid the brand of naive empiricism that consists of learning from casual history facts\u201d Nassim Taleb", "Even if I have seen something like this before, it might be different this time. Therefore, instead of making assumptions about what\u2019s going to happen, how can I quickly learn about new trends, how can I know if my ideas about what\u2019s going to happen are good or bad?", "Depending on your needs some tools can be valuable:", "A scenario is a big \u201cwhat if\u201d question that will have a major impact on the future", "Most models rest on the assumption that we can predict the future, but in today\u2019s complex, ever-changing environment, sometimes, we cannot.", "[1] Nassim Taleb, Fooled by Randomness: The Hidden Role of Chance in the Markets and in Life.
