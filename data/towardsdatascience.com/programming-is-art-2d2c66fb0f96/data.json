In this argumentative piece, Jacob Bergdahl proposes programming as an art form, through thorough discussion of the term, its misconceptions, and what makes art\u2026 art!"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/art", "anchor_text": "Oxford dictionary", "paragraph_index": 4}, {"url": "https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/art", "anchor_text": "the rest", "paragraph_index": 9}], "all_paragraphs": ["I strongly consider myself to be a creative person. It\u2019s one of my key strengths. I equally enjoy the process of creating new concepts, as I do building the implementation. It could be anything from writing a song on my trusty guitar to creating a new design in Adobe Illustrator. From drafting a business model to building a level in Super Mario Maker 2. From cooking up a new dish with ingredients to me unknown, to establishing an AI strategy. Sometimes I just create things without any real purpose \u2014 sometimes the joy is in is the creation, not the result. Not all art must be shared, sometimes the beauty comes just from the peace of mind of creating something.", "Art has a way of showing itself in all sorts of strangely ordinary places. Before enjoying a meal, I like to take a moment to appreciate its features. When sitting at a caf\u00e9, I enjoy observing my surroundings, with art being found in every human expression, in every corner of any room. Sometimes when I listen to music, I close my eyes, and let my creativity run wild to the sound of the melody.", "I truly believe art is everywhere. When I share this viewpoint with others, many appear to agree with me.", "But then there is programming. There is a strange stigma surrounding programming, one that states that it isn\u2019t a form of creativity, but exclusively a form of logic. But more severely: a notion that programming isn\u2019t art. As you can probably guess based on the title of this article, I will propose arguments suggesting the opposite.", "Please allow me to start with the least interesting, but often requested, bit: the definition. If we are to discuss whether something classifies as art or not, it is only natural and expected to first examine its definition, however I do not intend to spend much time here. Should we go to the roots of the term, the Oxford dictionary provides an array of definitions for one to enjoy, and for now we shall look no further than this widespread dictionary.", "1 [mass noun] The expression or application of human creative skill and imagination, typically in a visual form such as painting or sculpture, producing works to be appreciated primarily for their beauty or emotional power.", "The first definition, unlike all of the following definitions presented in the dictionary, argues that the primary product of art is emotional power or beauty. I find this rather odd. How can that be, when the primary purpose of a finely crafted throne is to seat powerful people, the primary purpose of a vast castle to house humans, and the primary purpose of a most delicate dish to be eaten? Are these works not to be considered art if their primary purpose is to be used in a functional manner? Surely, whoever wrote such a definition cannot have strolled the inner streets of Vienna, where every building is a majestic piece, for otherwise they could not have come up with such a narrow definition.", "1.1 Works produced by human creative skill and imagination.", "Thankfully, one mustn\u2019t move their eyes further than a handful of pixels to budge the dictionary, for the second definition, and all that follow, are rather wide. One could argue that every work produced by humans involve creative skill and imagination, thus every pencil, phone charger, and toilet roll is also a potential work of art. Everything created by a person requires some amount of creativity when it is first created. Subsequent creations of the same item may not, however, if they follow a strict formula with clearly defined rules. Thus only the first pencil, phone charger, and toilet roll may be a work of art, as every subsequently made item from the same manufacturer is probably created in a factory, following strict instructions. For programming, however, every product requires unique instructions, as no two features are exactly the same.", "I could go on with the definitions, but I will leave the rest for you, for I think you will find that Oxford\u2019s three following definitions do not allow for any surprises, instead repeating the same thoughts with different words, all of which allow for programming to be interpreted as art.", "Why, then, do some not consider programming to be a form of art? Perhaps it is indeed due to the lack of natural beauty in lines of code? But how beautiful is a rock on the side of the road until a sculptor turns it into a statue? How beautiful is a collection of notes until a musician puts it to play? And how beautiful is a tuna fish until a chef turns it into a dish? So I ask you: how beautiful are lines of code until they have formed an application? Individual elements do not always present a natural beauty, but the sum of the elements put together into a thoughtful collective piece of work do.", "Thus, beauty in the parts cannot be the answer. Logic, then? Programming is made of logic, and logic isn\u2019t art, right? Some minds are rational, while others are emotional. Some are drawn to logic, other to conventional beauty. Yet Leonardo da Vinci created art built on scientific foundations, a musician develops tones that logically follow each other, a chef logically combine ingredients that complement each other. Most works of art are actually the result of a logical process, of selections of elements that complement each other. Logic and art often go hand in hand.", "Most works of art are actually the result of a logical process, of selections of elements that complement each other.", "So logic cannot be it either. The learning curve, perhaps, and the misconceptions that follow it? Indeed, becoming an artist or musician by trade requires countless hours of training, yet any child can sing a made-up song or compose a drawing in a matter of seconds \u2014 no training required. Perhaps that it was art truly means? The effortless input of emotions, both great and small, to instantly receive a creative work in return? Though you\u2019d be amiss, for programming is none different. The sweat of your creative brow is presented instantly in a likewise manner. The creative process is no different, and the learning curve non greater.", "Mathematics, then? While programming and mathematics are actually two very different fields of study, there is another misconception that the two are alike one another, and that mathematics cannot be art, thus programming also cannot be. Nothing could be further from the truth, however, for mathematics has been an ingredient in art for millennia. Artist have used mathematics to sculpt, draw, dance, and compose, since the Greek empire, long before the birth of Jesus Christ.", "Maybe the product of the creative input in itself, then? Add colors and received a painting. Add tunes and get a song. What do you get if you input lines of code? Absolutely anything and everything. Gorgeous animated films, epic video games, and beautiful interfaces with which you interact every day. While the product of programming doesn\u2019t matter, for it is art all the same, programming is created works of art with which you interact every day.", "Hopefully I have convinced you that programming is a form of art by now, and if I have failed to do so, the rest of this article will not persuade you either, but it will perhaps encourage you to try programming yourself, if you haven\u2019t already.", "There is a final misconception, one that says that programming is exclusive for the few. The misconception may say that you need some gift from birth, perhaps a logical mind, or a preference of mathematics, in order to be able to write code. Not so. Much like anyone can draw a painting, so too can anyone write code.", "I have never taken singing lessons. Yet I love to sing. But I only really do so in the comfort of my home. Rare are the people who have ever heard my singing voice, and blessed are those who haven\u2019t, for it isn\u2019t particularly good. But I don\u2019t sing because I\u2019m good at it, nor do I sing because I want to be good at it. I just do it because I like it. It may sound obvious, but it bears mentioning that you don\u2019t have to do something with the intention of becoming amazing at it. You can just try doing it for fun. I often hear the mindset that people don\u2019t want to try programming out of belief that they will never get good at it. Maybe you will, maybe you won\u2019t. So what? You may not develop an innovation. You may not choose programming as a professional craft. But you don\u2019t need to do either of those things to enjoy creating art.", "Before you go, here\u2019s another topic for another time, elevating the discussion further. The painting below was made by artificial intelligence. It was sold at an auction for $432,500. Is art made without any input from humans still art? For without a human in the process, was there truly any creativity and imagination involved, or was it all an automated logical process executed by a simple computer? But aren\u2019t humans too computers, following logical processes, in creating works of art? Well, that\u2019s a debate for another time.", "Your home for data science.
