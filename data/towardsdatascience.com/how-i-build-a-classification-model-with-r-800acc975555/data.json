It is used in a lot of fields nowadays such as marketing, where we can classify visitors of a sales site according to their appetite to buy. We were just talking about it in a previous article.", "In this one we will take a set of flowers and their characteristics. We are going to analyze the different characteristics of these flowers and try to see if they are correlated. This will help us to create a classification model that each time we give the characteristics of a flower we can tell which species it is.", "For this analysis we will use a dataset that comes from Kaggle a very famous dataset bank. This one indexes 150 flowers to which one associates a species and some characteristics.", "Let\u2019s see what we can find in this dataset just by using the summary function.", "We can see here that we have three different species: Setosa, Versicolor and Virginica with 50 records for each species. We can also see that petal length feature has a very high range compared to the others. If we go deeper, we can say that the high difference between the first quartile and the median could be caused by a species that has some very little petals. Enough speculation! Let\u2019s dive into this dataset together.", "It will be interesting to study which characteristic(s) discriminates each species and to what extent.To do this we will start by analyzing each species in relation to the others, in order to determine if one of the characteristics is not in the average. If so, we will analyse this characteristic more precisely.", "We\u2019ll begin by analysing if one of the features of the Setosa is far from the mean.", "We begin by saving the mean of the features concerning the Setosa species in one variable and another with all flowers that are not Setosa. Then, we can plot it.", "We can immediately see that the petal length feature seems to discriminate against the Setosa. Now we\u2019ll only analyse this feature.", "Let\u2019s compare the Petal length distribution of Setosa against the all flowers.", "It\u2019s blatant! The Setosa have much smaller petals than average. It even seems that this unique feature discriminates our species. We can check this information quickly with R.", "Indeed, 100% of the flowers with petals of less than two cm are Setosa.", "Let\u2019s do the same thing with Versicolor:", "In this case, we can see that none of the averages of the Versicolor species features deviate too much from the average. So we won\u2019t go into detail about this species right away.", "Hmm, it\u2019s seems that the Petal of the Virginica flowers are above the mean, let\u2019s analyse the distribution of the Virginica\u2019s petal length against all the flowers.", "As we can see, it seems that the Iris of the dataset with large petals are mainly Virginica. We can verify this by looking at the proportion of the flowers with petals larger than five centimeters that are Virginicas", "95,6 % are Virginicas, this proportion is enormous and allows us to discriminate this species.", "As we have seen, 100% of the flowers with petals smaller than two cm are Setosa and 95.6% of the flowers with petals larger than five cm are Virginica. So it seems logical that Versicolor is in between. Let\u2019s check this out:", "85% of the flowers that have petals between two and five centimetres are Versicolor.", "We can quickly see that the missing 15% is with the Virginicas.", "So we can see that the size of the petals is a characteristic that seems to discriminate quite well all the Iris species. So it will be very important to use it when we build our model.", "In this part, we will try to find correlations or decorrelations. First, we will look if, within the same species, certain characteristics influence others. Then we will compare some characteristics for all flowers.", "The corrplot function allows us to have a correlation table. We can apply this function to our dataset by isolating flowers of the same species.", "These correlation tables allow us to do more analysis:", "By comparing the different features that we have on these flowers and by categorizing them by species, we will be able to see if any feature other than the petal size seen earlier allows us to discriminate between species.", "We will start by displaying the size of the sepals according to their width. We\u2019ll do the same with the petals, and we\u2019ll end up displaying the petal size according to the sepal size.", "We can see that the first graph does not allow us to classify the species, on the other hand the two others show a fairly clear demarcation between the species. The Setosa species have clearly smaller petals and sepals than the others. The Virginica species has the longest and thickest petals and sepals. The Versicolor species is in between and mixes somewhat with the Virginica species.After this long analysis of the different features and their correlations, we will be able to build a model that guesses the species of one of these flowers according to its characteristics.", "If the analysis is well done, the creation and training of the model should not take too much time. To do this we will use Python, we will start by loading our data, differentiating labels and features. We will then build two sets of data, one to train our model and one to test it. Finally, we will train our model and test it with the test data set.", "The data is now loaded! We have on one side X which contains the features we saw earlier and on the other side y which contains the name of the species of the flower, this is what we want to make our algorithm guess.", "Splitting data will allow us to test our model on data it has never seen before.", "Scaling the data often perform better results. We use sklearn to do so.", "Because classes are well separated, the KNN model can be a good fit", "We obtain some pretty good result with this model!!", "We could see with a simplified example that to obtain a good classification model, it is important to find features that allow us to discriminate our classes (here the species). With only four different features, we were able to predict in 95% of the cases the species of the flower. So we can easily imagine that applications like PlantNet that allow us to identify the species of a flower thanks to its smartphone, use more features and get more precision on a larger number of different species.", "Your home for data science.
