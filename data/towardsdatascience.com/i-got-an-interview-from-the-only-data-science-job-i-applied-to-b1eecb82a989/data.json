I had no prior experience and only been learning data science for about 3 months.", "I began to grasp the concepts of Data Science in the beginning of March when the pandemic really started to surge in the United States. For the past few years, I\u2019ve always wanted to learn data science but I could never find a method that helped me retain information. I\u2019ve tried various online courses and resources, but unfortunately nothing worked for me. I began to feel hopeless and that I was never going to understand and absorb the information in this field.", "That was until I found out that doing small side projects made things stick for me. After following various YouTube tutorials such as Ken Jee\u2019s Data Science Project from Scratch Series, things finally started to click. I soon realized how massive the field is and how much information I really didn\u2019t know. I felt overwhelmed and didn\u2019t know where to start and that was okay because nobody does. There is not one straight path to becoming a data scientist, many who are currently in the field created their own paths.", "I remembered hearing from someone that the best projects are those that correlate with topics you are interested in. After thinking about that, it made complete sense. By doing a project in a niche I was familiar in, it would be much more fun and I would be able to engineer unique features into my data. Not only that, it\u2019s easier to learn when you\u2019re doing a project you enjoy, compared to a project you don\u2019t know much of the background on or have much interest in.", "I\u2019m a huge car enthusiast so I decided to do a machine learning project that predicted the price of used cars. My knowledge on vehicles played a huge factor for me being able to engineer several features that allowed me to produce more accurate models. I will be writing a separate article on that project soon.", "During the time period that I was working on this project, I was browsing LinkedIn one day and randomly saw a job posting for a data science position. The thing is, it wasn\u2019t just any job posting, it was a data science position for a well known company that sells aftermarket car parts that I was familiar with. At that moment, I was not looking for jobs just yet, as I was still just learning and I was scared to apply because it had over 200+ applicants.", "I applied anyway and within a week they had contacted me for an interview.", "The part most of you have been waiting for. How did I get called so quickly with little to no experience? The answer is quite simple actually.", "My passion made me stand out from everyone else.", "I previously stated that I\u2019m a car enthusiast. Their business is all about creating the ultimate car enthusiast experience by creating and improving car parts for people who want to push their vehicles to their liking. I didn\u2019t just apply because it was a data science job, I applied because it was a data science job within a field I\u2019m extremely passionate about. I already knew their business and exactly what they do (I\u2019ve bought several of their products before too).", "Shortly after I applied, I messaged one of the data scientists on their team on LinkedIn and introduced myself. I told him that I applied for the position and that I am also a car enthusiast who is a big fan of their products. That turned into a nice conversation and I highly recommend trying to reach out to employees that work at companies you are applying for. A few days later, I received an email from them asking if I\u2019d be available for a virtual interview.", "When the day of the interview came, the first thing the interviewer said to me was that the data scientist that I messaged mentioned my name to him and said he has to speak to me. I left such a good impression when I spoke to the other data scientist that the interviewer already heard about me before he even saw my application which was huge. My passion and excitement for the field caught their eye and that\u2019s something employers love to see.", "Unfortunately, I could not continue with the job because they required me to relocate in order to continue with the hiring process which is something I couldn\u2019t do at that time. I\u2019m still grateful for the opportunity to even have that interview so young in my data science learning career.", "My advice to those applying for jobs, is to try to apply for a data science position in a niche you genuinely care about. Doing side projects is a great way to gain experience and it supplements you with something to talk about! Employers want to see what you did and more importantly what impact did it have.", "Lastly, never give up. No matter how confused you get or how lost you feel, keep going because there is light at the end of every tunnel.", "Your home for data science.
