In one of my graduate classes, however, I came across the notion that influencers may be overrated. The basic idea is that influencers tend to concentrate in large sub-networks. If you rely on them to promote your product, you risk missing many smaller satellite networks (more detail here). This is a wake-up call that many intuitions that we take for granted may not be corrected, and, if implemented hastily, could be costly in the long run.", "Over the weekend I decided to test several seeding strategies on different datasets. As it turns out, there is no simple answer as to whether influencers are overrated. The growth dynamics heavily depends on the structure of the graph clusters, node embeddings, and how influencers connect with the rest.", "Two datasets \u2014 Facebook politicians and Deezer music streaming\u2013\u2013were particularly illustrative. After running the GEMSEC graph embedding algorithm, the two datasets are visualized by the top 3 principal components as shown above. Can you guess which of the following seeding techniques work best for each dataset?", "This post will focus on high level discussion, and leave the implementation details to the end.", "Real world social-network datasets were used to train the GEMSEC model. The datasets are avaialble in the repository. Here I focused on two datasets:", "The only information available in the dataset is edges between nodes. We know who is connected to whom, but we don\u2019t know why they are connected, or how similar they are. If we were to model information spread, we need some kind of similarity measure to estimate how likely one person will spread the information to another. In a music service, the similarity can be music taste. In a social network, the similarity can be a proxy of intimacy (shared conversation, photos, etc.)", "To get around this limitation, I trained the GEMSEC graph embedding model to directly learn node embeddings while clustering them at the same time (hence the name Graph EMbedding with SElf Clustering). Let me waive the mathematical details, which is available in the original paper. The important point is that we now have the graph structure and the node embeddings.", "The diffusion process is modeled like a random walk. The probability of infection is correlated with the cosine similarity between two nodes. I made the simplifying assumption that nodes with negative cosine similarity will not infect each other.", "In the beginning, only the seed nodes are infected. The seed nodes are placed in a queue. Every time a node is dequeued, it tries to infect all its neighbors. Newly infected nodes (including the old node itself) are appended to the queue in a breadth-first-search fashion.", "The result is summarized in the two plots below.", "What causes the difference in influencer seeding? The primary reason is that influencers are not equally powerful in all clusters. If we only choose the top influencers, only 12 out of the 20 clusters will have qualified influencers. By stratified sampling, we are forcing clusters that have less powerful influencers to be seeded.", "A second reason is attributed to the graph structure. The politician dataset has very polarized, clearly distinct, and well-separated clusters. The Deezer music streaming dataset is more blurry. This is understandable, people can enjoy different music genres, but politicians stick to specific (and often opposite) political stances. The density plots for the top influencers\u2019 neighbor nodes clearly demonstrate the polarized pattern: politicians\u2019 friends are all alike; music lovers forge friendships across clusters.", "Graphs are among the hardest and most profitable problems to work with. The purpose of this blog is not to propose any universal truth, but to illustrate some perspectives from which you could inspect your own graph datasets. Some details worth your attention are:", "First, clone the GEMSEC repository to your workstation. The datasets are also available in the repository.", "Second, create the environment with the required packages. You can simply run my gemsec_env.yml file.", "To replicate my result, run the commands in the experiment.sh file.", "It\u2019s recommended that you use a multi-core-CPU virtual machine. The algorithm supports multi-threading.", "Plots, summary statistics, and animation codes are available here.", "The following blogs covers topics relevant to AB testing, and more in-depth review of key concepts mentioned in this article.", "[1] B.
