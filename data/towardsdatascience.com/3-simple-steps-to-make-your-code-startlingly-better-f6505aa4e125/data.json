You\u2019ve got a feature you\u2019ve been working on all day and you\u2019re stuck on a bug that you can\u2019t figure out \u2014 ya know the kind of bug that make ideas like: \u201cMaybe I should just throw the whole computer away and go make desks for a living\u201d sound like a good idea. But you grit your teeth, and you get through it.", "You finally arrive at a solution. It\u2019s ugly as hell and you know it, but it works\u2026 for now.", "As developers, we\u2019ve all been guilty of this. We\u2019ve made a program that works but unfortunately is a mockery of our craftsman/craftswoman spirit.", "I\u2019m going to share with you 5 simple tips I\u2019ve picked up that will make a huge impact on the quality of your code.", "When writing a program the naming of your functions is extremely important. It can have a huge effect on how difficult or easy it is to understand your code.", "A well-named function communicates your intent and will make your code read more like natural language. While a poorly named function will obscure what the programmer\u2019s real intention was.", "Here\u2019s a quick example to illustrate my point. Can you tell me what this function is doing?", "After reading through the code line-by-line you could probably reason that the code is attempting to update a user. The title handleEdit begs the question \u201cwhat the heck are we editing?\u201d", "Now check out this example with the updated name.", "Do you see that? The code is unnecessary to determine what this function is doing. It\u2019s a function that is going to be updating the user. The name clearly states my intention.", "Which brings me to the next point.", "Naming your variables to reflect your intent can have a wonderful effect on how your code reads.", "Consider this example. This code intended to have the user confirm they wanted to deactivate their account. Here\u2019s the original code.", "It\u2019s not bad. It does communicate that we are relying on some sort of response. But it reads robotically. Here is the updated version.", "This is much better. You don\u2019t even have to read the original variable to fully understand the condition we are checking for.", "Comments come in many forms. Some are useful, providing rich context and information that may be very domain-specific and can be incredibly difficult to communicate through code alone. These comments are important and can save you and others who have to work your code valuable time.", "However, most comments are training wheels. As we leave behind a trail of non-expressive names for our variables and functions, we rely on comments to help us navigate our way to a program that works.", "Comments help us feel better about our poorly written code or worse they restate the obvious. You should write your code to be as expressive as possible because when your code reads like natural language comments will just get in the way.", "Software development is as much an art as it is a science. As developers, it is our loftiest goal to craft code that doesn\u2019t just work \u2014 but to craft code that we can read without stress, code that is easily maintained, and code we can take pride in.", "I would like to close by giving a quick nod to Robert Cecil Martin author of \u201cClean Code A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship\u201d, this article was largely inspired by testing out how effective design principles shared in his work were for me. If you found this article useful I highly advise you to add this book to your reading list!", "Your home for data science.
