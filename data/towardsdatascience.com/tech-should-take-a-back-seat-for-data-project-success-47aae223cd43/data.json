I worked with an elite set of handsomely-paid developers, at the peak of the Big Data revolution.", "Cutting-edge, as we were, managing the technology, wasn\u2019t our biggest challenge. Our top challenge was understanding the business context and what to do with the technology.", "As a dev, I shouldn\u2019t be expected to configure complex infrastructure, build and operate pipelines, and also be an expert in credit market risk.", "Time and again, I witnessed business analysts sidelined in favor of data engineers, who spent all day battling Open Source technologies with little or no context of the data or the intended outcome.", "The technology-first focus often led to Resume++ where technologists were empowered and enamored with technology rather than focusing on business objectives.", "The result was slow progress, project failures and budget overruns. This especially hurt businesses during the 2008 crash and we\u2019re seeing that impact again in 2020 with COVID.", "The greatest success and innovation I\u2019ve witnessed is when end users (business users, data analysts, data scientists) are given the correct tooling and the access to explore, process, and operate data themselves.", "Modern data platforms are distributed, generally Open Source, and their tooling, if any, isn\u2019t enterprise-ready. Therefore, organizations must turn to hard-to-find and highly-skilled engineers. Unfortunately, these engineers have a limited understanding of the data and the business context.", "Some organizations with \u201celite\u201d R&D will develop self-service tools at a huge expense. For those without the \u201celite\u201d resources, these technologies are much less accessible. This exacerbates the divide between the web-scale companies (Google, Spotify, Uber, Amazon etc.) and the rest of the industry.", "Technology should be an enabler to deliver data products.", "To achieve this, best-of-breed technologies should be available in a \u201cdata mesh\u201d type architecture with a decoupled self-service and governance layer. This allows end-users to apply DataOps practices to operate data and applications without infrastructure knowledge. Workloads should include data cataloging, RBAC controls, data masking, and the ability to create virtual workspaces that allow teams to explore, process, and move data through low-code applications.", "Cloud providers have created \u201ctechnology intensity\u201d offering managed solutions for Apache Kafka such as AWS MSK and Azure HDInsight and Kubernetes. So, the role of data engineers should shift away from building pipelines and operating data infrastructure, to focus on delivering self-service tooling that allows end-users to operate data themselves and build \u201cdata intensity.\u201d", "My co-founders and I created Lenses.io to help every organization transition to the new data economy.
