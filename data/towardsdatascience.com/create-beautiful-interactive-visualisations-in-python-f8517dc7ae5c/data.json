What sets Plotly apart are the interactivity of its plots, the richness and variety of visualisations, its relative simplicity, compared to say Matplotlib and the ability to deploy visualisations as web apps using the Dash module.", "There are many different parts to the Plotly suite of tools and when I first started using them I found it a little difficult to navigate. In this article, I want to give a brief introduction to the core elements of Plotly including the standard plotting module, Plotly express and Dash. Alongside some simple code, examples to get you up and running quickly with these tools.", "Plotly visualisations are rendered as HTML files. If you are working in a Jupyter Notebook and would like to render the images directly you need to install the ipywidgets package.", "Or if you are using JupyterLab.", "Plotly works with data structures known as figures which can either be represented as dictionaries, in which case you use the plotly.io module. Or as graph objects rendered via the plotly.graph_objects module.", "Graph objects are generally considered to be a better choice over dictionaries as they allow for precise data validation, support higher-level convenience functions for updating already constructed figures and the syntax of graph objects makes for more compact code.", "Let\u2019s import a toy data set and explore the basic functionality for standard plotting. The below code imports the Boston house prices data set, a popular toy data set for regression analysis from the scikit-learn library.", "The first few rows of the data are shown below.", "Let\u2019s use the graph objects module to explore the relationship between house price and the number of rooms. You will notice that I am using the helper functions I mentioned above to add titles to the visualisation.", "The standard plotting modules are useful if you need to create a bespoke visualisation. However, if you want to create something quite standard like the scatter plot shown above then the plotly.express API is by far the best choice.", "This module allows you to create entire figures in one line of code for most common visualisations. It also allows you to easily control colours, style and labelling with ease.", "We can create the above scatter plot with just one line of code using this module. Colour, labelling and style controls are all available with the px.scatter function and the axis labels are automatically added.", "There are a large variety of options and controls for the \u2018out of the box\u2019 charts provided by plotly.express, you can explore all options here.", "As an example, the below code creates a histogram to show the distributions for the CHAS variable. I have used the histnorm option to apply normalization to better visualise the distribution and the hover_data option to control the interactions on hover.", "Dash, also part of the Plotly suite of tools, is a framework for developing dashboards for data analysis and all Plotly visualisations can easily be embedded within the application.", "Dash needs to be installed separately.", "It is possible to display Dash applications in Jupyterlab however you need to install this JupyterDash extension.", "Alternatively, Dash will host the application on localhost, the address will be shown in the output when you run your code.", "Whenever fig.show has been used to display a visualisation, using either Plotly express or standard plotting, you can pass the same plot to Dash.", "The layout of a Dash app is determined using app.layout which uses a combination of dash_core_components and dash_html_components to add charts, tables, interactivity and text to the dashboard.", "The code shown below creates a basic Dash app using the chart we created withplotly.express. The resulting dashboard is shown below.", "One of the most useful aspects of Dash applications is that you can make your dashboards interactive by using callbacks. The core components module contains a wide range of different interactive components including dropdowns, sliders and text boxes.", "The below code adds a dropdown to the dashboard which allows you to filter on the RAD feature to view the distribution for each unique value. The resulting dashboard is shown below the code.", "I have recently found myself moving to use Plotly as my go-to visualisation library as I find the quality of analysis you can achieve with such relative ease can\u2019t be matched by any other Python plotting library at the moment. This has become even more the case since Pandas added Plotly as an available backend for their plotting functionality.", "I previously wrote this article outlining how to use Plotly as the backend for Pandas visualisations. This is particularly useful if you want to put together some very quick analysis piece.", "I send out a monthly newsletter if you would like to join please sign up via this link.
