The purpose of this document is, therefore, to introduce and explain concepts and tools that are required to understanding the level of exploiting the tempered stable distribution for their own purpose. I will not get into the nitty-gritty of each type of fat-tail distribution, rather I try to explain the related statistical and mathematical concepts/issues in an intuitive way with some application in finance. I hope there is a useful takeaway for all the readers from different backgrounds. Feel free to ask any question through the email at the very end of this document.", "In part 1, we discuss what it means for a random variable to have a \u201cfat-tail\u201d distribution.", "To understand the fat-tail, we need to answer the following two questions.", "To talk about the tail, we need to determine how far is far to decide how far from the middle is far enough to say it a \u2018tail\u2019. In other words, where does the tail start? It depends! Unfortunately, there is no single answer.", "Consider the normal distribution. Note that there are two tails: right and left. If we want to describe the \u2018right\u2019 tail of the distribution from the one standard deviation from the mean, for example, then the shaded part refers to the right tail of the normal distribution.", "Formally, we can describe the tail as follows:", "for a large value of \u2018x\u2019. Now, we know the concept of the \u2018tail\u2019.", "Think about the uniform distribution over [0,1]. Does it have a tail? In this blog, it says not every distribution has a tail.", "If you want \u201c the behavior of the tail\u201d to describe the characteristics of the pdf when \u2018x\u2019 gets large, then bounded distributions do not have tails. Nevertheless, some features of tails can be quantified. In particular, by using limits and asymptotic behavior you can define the notion of heavy tails. SAS blog", "I will explain the (exponentially) bounded / not bounded distribution below. Please remind yourself of the uniform distribution when you get there!", "The tail part of distribution has been the main concern for risk management. For example, the two most heavily used risk measures for distribution of return or loss are Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected shortfall (ES)", "Just see how the quantity VaR and ES are related to \u2018tail\u2019. Do not need to understand the math or meaning behind them.", "\u201cBe aware that the below graph is a distribution of Loss not Return!\u201d", "Think about distribution of loss, L, equivalently (negative) return, on some asset over a given holding period. For the sake of understanding, we assume that the random variable of losses on tomorrow follows the normal distribution:", "Then, we can calculate the VaR in the following way:", "Through the second line, we can easily check that the VaR is just a quantity related to the fat tail. For more details about the VaR, check chapter two of the book \u201cQuantitative Risk Management: Concepts, Techniques and Tools\u201d and Eric Zivot\u2019s lecture note on his website.", "Similarly, we can see that expected shortfall is a quantity related to the tail part of the distribution:", "In the fourth line, it says \u201cES is the expected loss in the upper \u201ctail\u201d of the loss distribution. Similar to VaR, in the case of normal distribution, it is convenient to calculate the ES now that it is just a mean of truncated normal distribution.", "If anyone curious about why we divide by 1 \u2014 \u03b1 , this is just a normalizing constant (or scaling factor) to make sure that the integration of the truncated loss distribution is one, which is a requirement for it to be a probability distribution.", "Back to the story of \u2018tail\u2019, I just wanted to emphasize that the tail distributions are widely used as risk management tool.", "Since we figured out what the \u2018tail\u2019 is in distribution and where it is used, now it is time to talk about the \u2018fat\u2019 part. We all know that normal distribution does not have a fat-tail. Instead, we were taught to use the student-t distribution and log normal distribution when modelling the financial return series to take into account the \u2018fat-tail\u2019 property. But we need to know the definition of fat tail. Unfortunately, there is no universal definition for the term fat.", "I will try to explain the fat-tail in the language of English, Graph, and Math. Hope you enjoy at least one of the three.", "It is convenient to use the exponential distribution as a reference. The pdf of the exponential distribution approaches zero \u2018exponentially\u2019 fast. That is, tail of the pdf looks like (but behaves differently from) the exponential distribution.", "I will show you 4 different graphs that show what happens in the far right tails of a set of different distributions as below:", "I will not explain each of these distributions. Instead, let\u2019s just enjoy the graph of these distributions to feel what is going on in the tail part. The first graph shows the part of the whole graph whose \u2018x\u2019 lies in [0,5]", "With the figure 5 above, we cannot tell how the tail behaves. But, here are a few things that are worth mentioning", "Let\u2019s look at how it looks when \u2018x\u2019 lies in [5,8]. Be aware that the values in y-axis get much smaller.", "A: The most upper line would have the thickest tail! (But not quite!!!) And you will see why!", "Beforehand, let\u2019s examine the important facts of figure 6 above.", "Let\u2019s see how it looks when \u2018x\u2019 lies in [8,100]. Again, be aware that the values in y-axis get much much smaller.", "Fat tail distribution is a subclass of the heavy-tailed distribution. It means although every fat-tailed distribution is heavy-tailed, the reverse is not true (e.g., Weibull). According to Jay Taylor\u2019s lecture notes, he differentiated the heavy and fat in the following way.", "We can interpret it as when \u2018x\u2019 gets large, the speed of exponentially increasing is faster than the speed of decreasing probability on heavy right tail. Take time to think about it!", "See how it connects to the English definition.", "If the heavy right tail is not heavy enough, i.e., it decays super fast as \u2018x\u2019 goes to infinity, then equation 1 converges to zero. The obvious example is uniform distribution over [0,1] as we discussed above. Once \u2018x\u2019 exceeds the one, the probability of X greater than one becomes zero so that it is exponentially bounded. Another popular example is the normal distribution. Let X be a standard normal. Draw a series of graphs for the different lambda values to get", "We can see that it converges to zero so that tails of the normal distribution are exponentially bounded.", "The \u2018~\u2019 means same up to constant. Or the tail part is proportional to the power law. Precisely, it means the following.", "Feel free to skip if math is \u2018heavy/fat\u2019 for you.", "Therefore, the tail part of fat-tailed distributions follows a power law (which is \u2018x\u2019 to the power of minus alpha). For those who are not familiar with a power law, do not worry now. Think of the graph when alpha equals two.", "Remind yourself that tail part looks similar to power-law as we have seen in figures 5\u20138 above. I will explain power law in more detail from [Part 2] of this series.", "We went over the concept \u2018fat-tail\u2019 in this document intuitively, graphically, and mathematically. To understand the \u2018tempered stable distribution\u2019, it is necessary to have a fundamental understanding of the fat-tail. Hope this document was helpful to improve your understanding.
