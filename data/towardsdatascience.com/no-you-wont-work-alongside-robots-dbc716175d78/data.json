The world was in shock. It seemed computers, thus far thought to be little more than glorified calculators, had finally intruded upon the human domain of imagination and creativity.", "The worry was in vain. Deep Blue had no capacity for ingenuity. It won by brute force alone, evaluating 200 million positions each second. It was an abomination to compare such a rudimentary algorithm to human originality. While the mindless machine toiled in trial-and-error, Kasparov was gently beckoned towards promising moves by his subconscious. He had intuition, it was still just a roid gutted abacus.", "Like countless other AIs before it, Deep Blue, too, had to dampen its ambitions. Instead of replacing us, it was merely to complement. Kasparov realized that \u201cwhat computers are good at is where humans are weak, and vice versa.\u201d Encouraged by this insight, he organized a tournament where humans and machines could play as partners. And sure enough, a man-machine pair, one intuiting, the other calculating, proved its superiority to any purely artificial opponent. Even if with just a single buttock, we humans could still justify our sitting on the game stool.", "The fable of Deep Blue is often recounted as proof of the preordained complementarity of humans and computers. \u201cSure, machines are getting smarter day by day\u201d, the carbon-silicon symbiotics concede, \u201cbut aspiring only to vapid tasks we find mundane anyway, they\u2019ll never replace us in full. ATMs didn\u2019t render bank tellers obsolete. Instead, the devices freed clerks up for more meaningful work, like providing financial expertise.\u201d", "The sentiment that humans and computers are inseparably intertwined, neither complete without the other, is as old as computing itself. Already in 1843, Ada Lovelace, the author of the world\u2019s first computer program, declared that the precursor of the modern computer with which she worked \u201chas no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can follow analysis, but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths.\u201d", "\u201cLady Lovelace\u2019s objection,\u201d as Alan Turing would later put it, was brought to the mainstream roughly a century later by the cybernetics pioneer Norbert Wiener. While his MIT colleagues Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy were on a quest to create intelligent machines that would exceed humans in every respect, Wiener believed a more fruitful path was to \u201cdevise machines that would work well with human minds rather than try to replace them.\u201d", "With a conviction perhaps more appropriate to a religious leader than to a level-headed scientist, he preached: \u201cThe more powerful the computer, the greater the premium that will be placed on connecting it with imaginative, creative, high-level human thinking.\u201d", "Among the many researchers taken by Wiener\u2019s gospel was Joseph Licklider. A versatile scientist as comfortable in technology as in psychology, Licklider was a master in imagining ways how people and machines could work together in collaborative partnerships. He pioneered the notions of decentralized networks and time-sharing, both of which were integral in the creation of the modern Internet.", "But of all Licklider\u2019s contributions, it was his landmark 1960 paper \u201cMan-Computer Symbiosis\u201d that left the biggest crater in Silicon\u2019s Valley spiritual landscape. \u201cMost of the significant advances in computer technology \u2014 including the work that my group did at Xerox PARC \u2014 were simply extrapolations of Lick\u2019s vision, \u201d attested Robert Taylor, the founder of PARC\u2019s Computer Science Laboratory.", "luckIn the late 70s, Jobs and Wozniak would bring some of those advances, which included the mouse and graphical user interface, together into Apple 2, the world\u2019s first mass-marketed personal computer. Finally, computers had made their way into the homes of everyday Americans, not to make a mockery of, but to amplify their owner's intelligence. Likening the new machine to a tool, Jobs would dub it the \u201cbicycle for the mind.\u201d", "Software visionaries taking the baton from Apple were of a similar disposition: humans were to be empowered, not supplanted. Microsoft would create programs that\u2019d free office workers from the horrors of manual document management. MATLAB would help scientists perform rote calculations, allowing them to test original hypotheses at unprecedented speeds. Google Maps would bridge the gap from bits to atoms, assisting us in navigating the real world.", "Even IBMs Watson, the Jeopardy!-playing computer that dominated its human opponents in the show, was developed with augmentation in mind. For a while, at least, it found its home alongside medical doctors, helping them make sense of the myriad of symptoms their patients exhibited. As John Kelly, the director of IBMs Research said: \u201c\u2026 in the era of cognitive systems, humans and machines will collaborate to produce better results, each bringing their own superior skills to the partnership.\u201d", "In the present day, with intelligent assistants in the palm of our hands, our metamorphosis into Licklider\u2019s prophesized man-computer symbiote is as complete as ever. But even though the history of computing relates countless tales of comradeship between men and machines, we mustn\u2019t delude ourselves into thinking the latter\u2019s incorporation into the workforce has been unequivocally beneficial for all.", "While the technologists of the digital age were swept up in the excitement of the PC revolution, their friends in the social sciences department were pulling their hair out. It seemed the sharp rise in economic inequality the western world had experienced since the 1970s coincided perfectly with the advent of the personal computer.", "One way to measure wealth inequality is by using the concept of skill, or a person\u2019s level of formal schooling. For better or worse, this seemingly crude approximation correlates well with workers\u2019 pay. Now, economists plotted each and every occupation\u2019s change in average pay (or in the share of total employment) over the last few decades as a function of the job\u2019s required skill level. What they saw startled them. For the first time in history, the graph was contorted into the shape of a U.", "New technologies, it seemed, helped both the low-skilled and high-skilled workers, but did little for those with middling skill. \u201cThe traditionally plump midriffs of many economies, which have provided middle-class people with well-paid jobs in the past, are disappearing,\u201d as the economist Daniel Susskind put in his recent book \u201cA World Without Work\u201d. We can see this trend clearly in the following figure:", "\u201cAs a share of overall employment, there are now more high-paid professionals and managers \u2014 as well as more low-paid care workers and cleaners, teaching and healthcare assistants, caretakers and gardeners, waiters and hairdressers. But there are fewer middling-pay secretaries and administrative clerks, production workers and salespeople\u201d, Susskind writes. What\u2019s more, while the labor market has become two-tiered, it\u2019s particularly the wages of the high-skilled group that have soared.", "To make sense of the new economic reality, a group of three MIT economists put forth a theory that has since become eponymously known as the \u201cAutor-Levy-Murnane (ALM) hypothesis.\u201d First, the men recognized that many middle-class jobs are largely composed of routine tasks, ones that could be accomplished by following explicit, easy-to-articulate rules. Second, they observed that such tasks were particularly amenable to automation, for following a clear set of instructions is precisely what modern computers excel at.", "The ALM hypothesis thus drew a connection between the hollowing out of the labor market and the widespread adoption of Licklider\u2019s man-machine complementarity thesis. It showed that even partial automation of our cognitive faculties has a deleterious effect on our employment outlook. Yes, men and machines now indeed worked alongside one another in the office. But a single such pair proved so productive that for each, there were ten people relegated from wearing a suit to wearing an apron in McDonald's.", "For the time being, at least, there was a silver lining. Economists agreed that low and high-skilled jobs are safe. There are no discernible formal rules that dogwalkers and taxi drivers on one end of the spectrum, and engineers and doctors on the other end, follow. Such tasks, which lack an explicit instruction manual that can be translated into computer code, are immune to automation. That is, until recently\u2026", "Around the time Ada Lovelace proclaimed her skepticism of computers to ever \u201coriginate\u201d anything, her contemporary, the author Mary Shelley, conceived of a different contraption entirely. Her Frankenstein\u2019s monster was not only capable of imagination, but a whole host of chiefly human endowments. In starkest contrast to Ada\u2019s objective machinery, the creature felt emotion, its colossal capacity to love \u2014 and to the readers\u2019 horror, to hate \u2014 challenging even that of our own.", "Shelley\u2019s literary musings were formalized in rigorous mathematics in 1956 at the now-legendary Dartmouth workshop, where a group of like-minded scientists, propelled by their Frankensteinian desire to create machines much closer to their image than what Licklider and his followers deemed practical, laid the groundwork for an area of research they dubbed artificial intelligence . The workshop's proposal that \u201c\u2026 every aspect of learning or any other feature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it\u201d was to serve as the new field\u2019s main tenet.", "The exact means by which intelligence was to be simulated was left unspecified. Soon, a few fundamentally different approaches rose to prominence, and the nascent discipline split into two.", "The majority of researchers believed human knowledge could be distilled into software directly. They tried to take note of all the possible logical rules experts followed when performing a task, and laboriously hard-code these into the computers by their own hand. It\u2019s this method of which IBM\u2019s DeepBlue and Watson are examples of, and of which the economist\u2019s ALM hypothesis is based on. Such techniques bore great fruit in solving algorithmic problems most of us find mentally taxing, like theorem-proving, but proved wholly inadequate when faced with tasks humans do subconsciously, like recognizing the outline of a cat from a soup of pixels.", "The other, smaller group of scientists foresaw those limitations early on. Instead of going out of their way to model the mind as a fixed combination of facts and rules, they tried to get computers to learn how the world works on their own.", "The machine learning camp stormed out of the gates strong. In 1958, just two years after Dartmouth\u2019s workshop, the Harvard psychologist Frank Rosenblatt took inspiration from the workings of our own brain and developed a simplified model of a biological neuron capable of learning to recognize digits. The perceptron, as the model came to be called, was followed with a wave of excitement, The New York Times going as far as to exclaim it \u201c\u2026 will be able to walk, talk, see, write, reproduce itself and be conscious of its existence.\u201d", "The initial hype notwithstanding, a single neuron could only do so much. What gives the brain its immense capabilities are millions of neurons, organized into a deep stack of layers, with each successive layer forming an ever-better understanding of what was perceived by the senses. Organizing Rosenblatt\u2019s perceptrons in such a hierarchical structure, however, proved to be more difficult than expected. It was unclear what the different layers of neurons ought to be communicating to each other in order to form a shared understanding of the world. For the next several decades, little progress was made.", "Things picked up again in 1980s, when several independent researchers, the Turing Award laureate Geoffrey Hinton chief among them, discovered just the right kind of signal to be sent through the hierarchy of neurons. With the major hurdle overcome, a frenzy of research followed. In 1989, another Turing-award recipient, Yann LeCun, developed a crude model of the human visual cortex that was able to recognize hand-written numbers. Eight years later, the German scientists Juergen Schmidhuber and Sepp Hochreiternd elevated neural networks into the domain of sequences, bestowing on them the ability to comprehend long stretches of text, audio, and DNA.", "Unfortunately, in the early 2000s, research hit yet another roadblock. While great progress had been made on tasks like image and speech recognition, the models\u2019 performance was nowhere near that of a human. It became apparent that further progress would require much, much bigger models. The human brain consists of billions of neurons forming trillions of connections, but their artificial counterparts had parameters only in the tens of thousands. Even so, those relatively small models were already up against the limits of contemporary CPU hardware. Researchers were at an impasse.", "A solution came in 2012, when Hinton\u2019s protegee Alex Krizhevsky realized that the mathematics underlying neural networks was almost identical to that in computer graphics. At the core of both were huge matrix multiplications, something the gaming industry had invested billions of dollars into optimizing. Driven by this insight, Krizhevsky ditched general-purpose CPUs for graphics cards. The latter supported models an order of magnitude larger than anything that had been conceived of to date, leading to Krizhevsky\u2019s Usain Bolt-like dominance in all leading image recognition competitions of the year.", "Other researchers quickly caught on, kicking off an arms race to ever-larger neural networks. Warehouses upon warehouses of graphics cards were built, in which enormous models with over a hundred million parameters now reside. Over the last few years, these immensely powerful models have surpassed humans in tasks as diverse as speech transcription, object detection, and video-game playing. They even generate music and create art. In short, they\u2019ve finally shed the shackles of unoriginality and have stepped into the realm of intuition and creativity. Surely, Ada is turning in her grave.", "This new technological landscape leaves little room for humans. The ALM hypothesis, developed in the early 2000s, didn\u2019t take into account the machine learning revolution. The assumption that computers are only restricted to tasks for which there are clear instructions no longer holds. The safe-haven that was promised for low-skilled laborers and high-skilled experts is disappearing.", "Take food delivery, for instance. In no other area has the man-machine symbiosis been as exemplary as here, with machines crunching the numbers to find the best routes, and people doing the actual legwork. But as computers on wheels are proving their superiority over teenagers on wheels, this primordial arrangement has started to crumble. Autonomous delivery robots are flooding the streets, and soon, there\u2019s no longer any part of the delivery process to which humans could meaningfully contribute. Machines are taking over the entire pipeline.", "Or take medical diagnostics. DeepMind, Alphabet\u2019s artificial intelligence wing, has developed a neural network that outperforms ophthalmologists in diagnosing more than fifty eye diseases. It has also come out with an algorithm capable of spotting breast cancer in x-rays as accurately or better than radiologists. Even more strikingly, a team in Oxford has used machine learning to develop a \u201cfingerprint\u201d that can be used to predict a fatal heart attack years into the future. The trend is clear: the diagnosticians of the future will be made of silicon.", "Examples like these are not some lone peculiarities, but the norm. The machines, now superior to us in both brute-force calculation as well as in intuitive pattern-matching, are rendering us redundant. We no longer add value to the collaboration. As robots are pouring out onto the streets to work, we are pushed there en masse to beg. One can only hope they throw us a quarter or two.", "Building robots by day, thinking hard how not to become one myself by night."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
