Classification is the task of putting things into categories. For example, classifying images into those of dogs and cats, labelling whether an x-ray has a fracture in it or not, and, more controversially, whether someone will repay a loan or not.", "And also watch this 4 minute video:", "In most cases, classification is done by drawing decision boundaries between data points. For example, in this graph, we can draw a decision boundary like this to separate the Xs and Os. If a point is above this line, we classify it as an X and if it\u2019s below it then we classify it as an O.", "Let\u2019s look at a real problem that can be solved using classification. Can we classify movies into their Motion Picture Association of America ratings (that is, G, PG, PG13 or R) just by looking at two variables about them: their audience rating on iMDB, and their global earnings at the box office? In other words, do these variables hold any predictive value for MPAA ratings?", "Let\u2019s plot out the data for 48 movies here. The Box office earnings will be on the X-axis while the iMDB rating will be on the Y-axis. We have coded the MPAA ratings as numbers from a scale of 1 to 3 with 1 being PG and 3 being R. In order to better visualize this dataset, we\u2019ll color the PG movies green, the PG 13 movies orange, and the R movies red. As we can see, it\u2019s almost impossible to separate the movies into their MPAA ratings using simple decision boundaries.", "Enter K-nearest neighbors. K-nearest neighbors or KNN for short is both a classification and regression method that is based on the simple premise that data points that are close to each other tend to have similar values or outcomes. For example, if all your neighbors have cars then it might be a good guess to think that you also have a car.", "Mathematically speaking, in order to predict the outcome of a particular point, KNN picks K of the closest data points to that point and averages their outcomes.", "For example, let\u2019s hop back to our movie dataset and pick a movie whose MPAA rating we want to predict. \u201cBombshell\u201d is a 2019 drama about 3 women at Fox News who set out to expose the network\u2019s CEO of sexual harassment. Of course, knowing this context offers valuable information about the movie\u2019s rating, but let\u2019s say we only have these 2 pieces of information about the movie.", "Before we make any predictions, let\u2019s take a step back and look at our axes. Because KNN relies on the Euclidean distances between points, one important step of this process is to make sure our axes are scaled appropriately. We want the vertical distances to matter just as much as the horizontal distances. In our movie example, we scaled up the IMDB and scaled down the box office earnings such that both axes have a range of about 50 points. It\u2019s very important to scale your axes each time you use KNN.", "As we can see on the X axis, it received an audience rating of 6.8 on iMDB and here on the Y axis we see that it grossed almost 60 billion dollars at the box office. KNN would look for the K nearest neighbors, where we picked K to be 5 in our case but this could be tuned up or down as needed. The 5 closest movies are R rated \u201cLong Shot\u201d and \u201cMidsommar\u201d, PG13 rated \u201cJudy\u201d and \u201cHarriet\u201d and G rated \u201cA Beautiful Day in the Neighborhood\u201d. KNN would then take the weighted average of these 5 MPAA ratings, where movies that are closer on the graph to \u201cBombshell\u201d get weighted more heavily than those that are farther. Voila! We predict the rating of \u201cBombshell\u201d to be R. Not only is this accurate, but our model also correctly predicts the MPAA rating of all movies in the test set almost 88% of the time!", "There you go! KNN is another simple machine learning model that works surprisingly well on complex problems. Let us know in the comments what kind of problems you are going to apply this algorithm to!", "Your home for data science.
