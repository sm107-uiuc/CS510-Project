The recruiter has given you a set of extremely vague instructions at this point. You might find yourself at 2 am staring at the computer, resembling the man in the photo above.", "\u201cThe project should only take a few hours to complete, but we will give you a week to hand it in\u201d", "This part of the interview process should not be this difficult. I am here to help you pass the data challenge and successfully make it to the next part of the interview process.", "Remember they do not want you to build the most successful model, they have huge resources that are spending months to create viable models for the problem at hand. They are more concerned with how you approach a complex problem, your code, comments, explanation, and organization.", "Below are the 7 steps to follow in your data science project.", "Other useful information to help with your project.", "Start with why. Why would this project be important and who benefits from a well-defined model and solution? Why does the company care?", "Take the opportunity to showcase your ability to identify the business need for the data challenge. Usually, the company will give you a topic related to their business. This is your chance as a Data Scientist to bound the project to a meaningful story.", "As a credit card provider it is important to have safeguards in place to battle fraud. For the 2019 fiscal year fraudulent transaction have accounted for $1.5 million dollars [gathered from the data]. Not only is there a monetary loss but there is also a impact to our customer\u2019s trust in the company to protect them \u2026", "Remember that a significant amount of your time (in the job) will be used to wrangle the data. Use this section to create some graphs and insight into the data.", "Always remember to explore missing data. Missing information is part of the process, and being able to identify it is crucial. Things to look for:", "This is not the time to create new features. Instead, use this section to set the foundation.", "You should take the time to identify how you would handle the missing data either dropping them (make sure to check the target variable distribution when dropping it) or imputing the values (mean, median, mode).", "How will we determine that our model performance is successful? Success is a relative term. A model is successful when compared to the current process. For instance, you can build a model with 95% (65%) accuracy, but if the current method has 97% (55%) accuracy you didn\u2019t (did) add value.", "This section will be used to create a baseline model. This model will be the foundation so that other complex models can be compared. Since this is your \u201cfirst try\u201d at the problem, it does not need to be overly complex or fine-tuned. You can preface this section by stating that you will throw the data at a model (simple model) and see how well it does.", "When choosing the baseline model (or any model) you must explain why you choose the modeling technique. There is no correct answer, but having an answer will demonstrate that you thought about the problem before modeling.", "\u201c This model is both simple and intuitive and will be a good baseline before moving on to more complex models. The simplicity has the advantage when interpreting the model to business stakeholders.\u201d", "Finally, display the success metric (RMSE, Precision/Recall, Confusion Matrix, ROC curve) and (once again) explain it. Do not be alarmed if the model is not performing well.", "You can now begin to create some new features from the existing data. As a reminder, they are not looking for some abstract world-winning feature. Create a handful of features that you believe are important and explain why you think they will help in improving performance. Some of these features will stem from the EDA section, where you gain insight into the dataset.", "Continuing on our fraud example here are two features:", "Up to this point, you have set the foundation for the business problem. Now you are at a crossroads, you can augment the baseline model by tuning the hyperparameters and implementing the new features or run a different model (E.g. changing from logistic regression to a random forest). Whichever choice you make, make sure to explain the reasoning behind it.", "I tend to do both, time permitting.", "Once again highlight the success metric and explain the results. Fingers crossed that the model is performing better than the baseline.", "Almost there, just hold on a few hours longer! You are probably tempted to go back to step 5 and tweak the model some more to get the \u201cperfect\u201d results, but there is no such thing as perfect in this assignment. Instead, outline what you would do as a next step if you spent more time on this assignment.", "As you are outlining the next step, also include a brief description of how you think it would increase model performance.", "Remember that you are telling a data story. Reiterate why this project is important and the problem you want to solve. Summarize the insight you gathered in the exploratory section and how well the model performed. Lastly, explain how your model will solve the problem.", "Before you send out that project, be sure to do some last-minute tasks. Proofread your presentation, make sure you have comments throughout the code, and that it is well organized.", "Thank you for reading, for your comments, and feedback. You can reach me on LinkedIn!", "Your home for data science.
