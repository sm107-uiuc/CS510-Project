Let\u2019s dive in!", "To frame the context I would say my LinkedIn use is quite passive: I\u2019m barely reacting or posting, I mostly read and watch my feed. I am not paying for any premium service. On average I would say I log in four to five times a week.", "LinkedIn gives you the possibility to download a copy of your data. To do so go to settings & privacy and then scroll down to Get a copy of your data. You can select some specific data but I prefer to download everything. Once the archive is ready (it took ~2 hours) you will receive a mail notification. You can return to your LinkedIn profile at the same place and Get a copy of your data and download the zip archive.", "Let\u2019s first focus on the file Ad_targeting.csv.", "Considering the name of the file I presume it contains the data shared to Ad businesses. More info here: business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ad-targeting.", "My ad profile is quite detailed and accurate. I\u2019m a French male between 25 and 34 years old, working in a 11\u201350 employees company in the computer software industry. My personae fits me, most of the interests and skills are corrects.", "Here is the raw data. Let\u2019s see what my ad profile looks like:", "At first glance it could be scary to see all this data, but no one but me filled the blanks. I want to be visible to others as accurately as possible in LinkedIn. This is the price to pay to gain this accuracy. On the one hand it allows LinkedIn to push me the content I like to see. I do not want to be contacted by job opportunities that are not linked to my profile. On the other hand I receive ads correlated to my interests as I am more likely to click them.", "Among the downloaded files there is one named connections.csv. It records all new connections with the following features: name, email, company, position, and connection date.", "I now have almost 1000 connections, let\u2019s see when I had new connections:", "The graph above displays weekly connections number. One can see than my network growth is a bit spiky. But let\u2019s consider the weekly accumulated curve:", "The cumulated sum plot indicates that my network growth is evolving quite constantly: just above three connections per week. The trend at the beginning (left part of the curve) is quite different as I was adding contacts I already had. And during the last few weeks I was willing to grow my network.", "From the same data we can explore the frequency of new connections per weekday:", "The graph above shows that most of the days I have no new connection (in average 0.4 connection/day). This is why violins are stretched to the bottom line. From violins shapes one can see that I am more likely to have new connections on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.", "Data enrichmentFrom my connections names I can create a new column gender. LinkedIn could easily do the same by analyzing each profiles. Most of the time it should be accurate. In my network I have 1/3 female and 2/3 male connections. I explain this imbalance by the fact that I\u2019m evolving in the software engineering sphere, which is imbalanced.", "Lets generate again the previous graphs considering genders:", "From the cumulated curves above we can observe that both males and females curves seem to follow the same evolution. The slope for the male curve is higher than the female one, but they have both a constant growth:", "Now we can focus on the distribution per week day per gender:", "From the graph above we can see that the female half violins are even more stretched to the bottom.", "Now that we have just considered connections, we can focus on names:", "From the bar plot above we can see the first name frequency among my network. The male/female imbalance is again visible here as the most present first names are mostly male names. I had to make a choice for first names that are not gendered (eg. Camille suits both male and female). One could tell from the first names that my connections are mostly french.", "Last names are also very biased because my network is not representative. As my last name is Leprince it is also the most frequent last name I have among my connections. Nevertheless there are some last names frequently observed in France. It would have been easy to guess my country from my connections names.", "Your home for data science.
