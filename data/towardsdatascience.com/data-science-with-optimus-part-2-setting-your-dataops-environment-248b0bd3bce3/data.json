It requires an Agile mindset and must also be supported by an automated platform which incorporates existing tools into a DataOps development pipeline. DataOps spans the entire analytic process, from data acquisition to insight delivery.", "So DataOps (from Data Operations) for me can be thought as the intersection of these fields:", "And its functional components will be:", "You can read more about some of these topics in my friend Andreas Kretz\u2019s publication:", "We will create a simple (but robust) DataOps environment in the platform using the tools: TravisCI, DVC, Git and GitHub.", "Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.", "In data science git is like our internal manager with a great memory.

DVC doesn\u2019t require Git and can work without any source control management system, but for the best experience we recommend using DVC on top of Git repositories.", "There are errors right now with some configurations in MatrixDS for DVC, so in order to run DVC you\u2019ll have to do it in a different folder, not in /home/matrix. For that do this (I\u2019m assuming you have the original project in the default folder):", "So to start using DVC with our repo we just type:", "If for some reason, that doesn\u2019t work for you on MatrixDS, install DVC for linux:", "If for some reason you get the error:", "Ok, so if you ran dvc init on this repo you\u2019ll see:", "Then commit your work (if you change the folder you may need to configure Git again):", "Travis CI (Continuous Integration) is my favorite CI tool. Continuous Integration is the practice of merging in small code changes frequently, rather than merging in a large change at the end of a development cycle. The goal is to build healthier software by developing and testing in smaller increments.", "The hidden concept here is automatic testing of what you are doing. When we are programming we are doing a lot of stuff all the time, we are testing new things, trying new libraries and more, and it\u2019s not uncommon to mess things up. CI helps you with that because you will begin doing your work, commit a little bit of it with Git, and you should have the necessary tests to see if the new piece of code or analysis you made impacts (in a good or bar way) your project.", "There\u2019s a lot more to know about Travis and CI tools, but the plan here is to use it, you\u2019ll learn on the way. So the first thing you have to do is to go to:", "and create an account with your GitHub profile.", "Then you will go (I\u2019m assuming here that you have successfully forked the repo from GitHub at this point) and then on https://travis-ci.org/account/repositories you will choose ds-optimus:", "If everything went well you\u2019ll see something like this:", "Ok so right now this is empty because we don\u2019t have anything to test yet.
