Check out our book: The Analytics Setup Guidebook.", "A couple of weeks ago, I met with a junior software engineer I\u2019d not seen for a few years. The last time I\u2019d spoken to him was when I offered him a place at my (then) company \u2014 an offer he eventually turned down. \u201cI want to work with machine learning and data,\u201d he had said back then, \u201cAnd I think this other company would give me a better opportunity to do so.\u201d", "He was absolutely right, of course. My old company didn\u2019t have much of a data capability; he wouldn\u2019t have been able to learn the skills he wanted at the role I was offering him. But in our most recent meeting, he told me that it took a few years before he could get into \u2018real\u2019 data science at the other startup: \u201cWe\u2019re only now starting to build up a data department, and I\u2019m shifting from general software engineering to data science things. I\u2019m really happy about that!\u201d", "Data team careers are different from careers in software engineering, product management, or user interface design", "There\u2019s an interesting truth that\u2019s buried in his experience that I think is worth exploring here, in greater detail. My friend\u2019s experience is a reflection of an underlying reality: data team careers are different from careers in software engineering, product management, or user interface design. They are different because they depend on the surrounding context of the organization, in ways that careers in the latter three categories do not.", "In software engineering, product management and design, job requirements are broadly similar. Sure, software engineering in a services company is marginally different from software engineering in a product company, but by-and-large, software people have rather similar responsibilities. This is also true for UI/UX designers \u2014 and slightly less true for product managers \u2014 but these roles are largely clustered around the same sorts of experiences.", "Contrast that with a data analyst or a data scientist working in a data team. Their lived experiences differ vastly according to the organization their team is in. Certain companies demand that their analysts do proper data modeling. Others deal solely in free-form SQL queries, and share those queries in a Google sheets. Some lucky ones perform machine learning and statistical analysis. But still others expect their data analysts to be nothing more than SQL-and-Excel-exporting-monkeys.", "Is it any wonder, then, that we get blog posts written by analysts leaving data because of \u2018lack of impact\u2019?", "Why is this the case? The answer is obvious: unlike software engineers, product managers, or designers, data team members serve internal users, not external ones. This means that your day-to-day experiences and your learning opportunities depend greatly on the organization you are joining. It means that you cannot assume that all data team roles (at different companies) are equal. And it means \u2014 as far as your career is concerned \u2014 that you must develop an ability to evaluate the data maturity of organizations before you choose to work for them.", "Emilie Schario has a great blog post over at GitLab on the three levels of data analysis. Companies exist in one of these levels, and they must advance from one level to the next. The three levels are, in order:", "I\u2019ve provided a quick summary of Schario\u2019s three levels, but I encourage you to read her post in full. Schario focuses on leaders within the organization, however, and she goes on to discuss a few ways to advance along the three levels.", "I am not as interested in talking about that. My question is simpler: let\u2019s say that you are a data analyst, or a data scientist. You\u2019re looking for your next job. It\u2019s clear that you should pick organizations based on their data maturity \u2014 if you want to learn machine learning or use regression models, you should pick companies at the \u2018prediction\u2019 tier; if you want to make a huge impact on business decisions, you want to work at a company that\u2019s firmly on the \u2018insight\u2019 tier.", "How do you identify which level the company is currently on?", "(A more sophisticated form of this is to identify companies that are just about to transition from one level to another, for this is when you get the most learning opportunities. And that\u2019s not to mention the opportunity to make your mark on the organization as it grows into the new level.)", "But how do you do this? How do you identify which level the company is currently on?", "What you want is to ask what I\u2019ll call \u2018 head-fake questions \u2018. A head fake is a move in American football where a player turns their head to look in one direction, but runs in another direction instead. A head-fake question is a question that pretends to ask about one thing, but in reality is asking about something else.", "For instance, if you\u2019re interviewing with a venture-funded startup, you might ask \u201ctell me about the changes you\u2019ve experienced at the company over the last year.\u201d", "An acceptable response to this question is a thoughtful answer about the ways the company has grown. Another good answer is \u201cwow I can\u2019t believe how much we\u2019ve done/how much has changed/how far we\u2019ve come when I think about it.\u201d", "A worrisome answer is \u201chonestly, it\u2019s about the same.\u201d When venture-funded startups stagnate, they die, so you might want to follow-up with additional questions about the recent history of the company.", "This is a head-fake question because it is difficult to guess at what you\u2019re really asking for. On the surface, you\u2019re asking for information about life at the company. Your interviewer might think that you\u2019re trying to get a gauge for the culture, or that you\u2019re trying to evaluate what it\u2019s like to work there. Or perhaps they think you want to get a feel for the growth opportunities in the organization. The reality, of course, is that you want to evaluate the growth rate of the startup, since this affects your time there (and your career) in material ways.", "Similarly, when you ask questions to evaluate the data maturity of a prospective employer, you\u2019ll want to ask questions in a way that doesn\u2019t completely reveal your intent. Here are a few suggestions, though you should obviously tailor your questions to the specific industry you\u2019re operating in:", "In practice, of course, the questions you\u2019ll ask should be adapted for the norms of your specific industry. At Holistics, we work with companies in Asia as well as companies from the West, and we notice that Western companies in general appear more data-driven than Eastern ones. Speaking broadly, companies with low margins tend to be more reporting-driven than companies with high margins; tech companies tend to be more data-driven than non-tech ones, and companies from the US are more data-driven than companies outside. Your questions should reflect the base realities in your given job market.", "But really, if there\u2019s a single idea you should take away from this piece, it is that data team careers depend very much on the realities of the company you\u2019re working for. If you want to learn data science, pick a company that does data science; if you want to feel like you\u2019re making an impact as an analyst, pick a company that\u2019s data-driven in their decision making. Use the three levels of data analysis to figure which tier a prospective company belongs to \u2026 and do so before you start working for them.
