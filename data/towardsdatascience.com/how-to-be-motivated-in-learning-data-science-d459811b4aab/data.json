Moreover, you don\u2019t instantly become a data scientist just by mastering data visualization with Scikit-learn or know all the Machine Learning terminology. It takes months and years of practice and hands-on experimentation with imperfect data. It is an amalgamation of soft skills (hacking skills) and hard skills (communication).", "That said, learning it will be one of the best investments of your life. The fact that it is hard to learn and even more difficult to master makes this field very valuable in the years to come. It\u2019s also worth understanding that you can\u2019t just learn data science since it is a combination of many skills, all you can do is improve on those skills.", "Now before I get into the life-changing advice to being motivated and burning passion, I believe that if you contently find yourself needing the motivation to learn Data Science, then you probably shouldn\u2019t follow this path at all. An individual who is really passionate about data and loves to analyze things with hacking skills and mathematics should be willing to learn data science continuously. Every day should be seen as an opportunity to learn.", "If you constant find the yourself needing motivation learning data science, then you shouldn\u2019t be pursuing it in the first place.", "Nonetheless, here are 7 ways you can ignite the fire inside of you and start feeling fired up to achieve your goals. Highlight important ideas that speak out to you, contemplate on them, take the time to think, and have a nice read.", "First and foremost, money should not be your primary goal or motivation. Now I say this because you might have decided to get into data science because of the lucrative salary and incredibly high demand. According to Glassdoor, Data Scientists have an average salary of $120,495/yr and a high of $163,000/yr.", "\u201cMoney is usually attracted, not pursued.\u201d \u2014 Jim Rohn", "Though society promulgates the idea that the impetus for a college degree is to be hired in a prestigious company with a profitable job, in order to make a living and pay off your debts, etc. Even so, I believe money shouldn\u2019t be one\u2019s motivation for getting into data science or any job in general.", "That\u2019s because, in my opinion, money does not promise you motivation in the long term. Sure you might be all fired up at your new Data Science job at Uber or Facebook and you\u2019re doing well financially, but if what you\u2019re doing isn\u2019t what you enjoy, sooner or later, you\u2019ll realize that money isn\u2019t worth your precious life when it can be spent on fulfilling the purpose and mission God has given you. By the same vein, many data scientists are leaving their jobs mainly because their expectations did not meet reality. So think hard and ruminate on this.", "Goals are the bedrocks of your development and success. Without them, it would be akin to running a race without a finish line. Having no goals connotes the absence of meaning in your life. So it\u2019s palpable that having goals is important.", "Even if you already have goals, the challenge is to ensure that they are goals that are unique to you and you only. Don\u2019t ever set goals based on what others say or do. It should agree with your vision for your life and something no one can talk you out of.", "\u201cIf you want to be happy, set a goal that commands your thoughts, liberates your energy and inspires your hopes.\u201d \u2014 Andrew Carnegie", "It\u2019s also good to separate your goals into short-term and long-term so that you can something to work towards. Short-term goals can provide you with short bursts of impetus that drives you to push hard to achieve the long ones.", "Say your goal is to get a job related to data science. Short-term goals would be something like learning basic Python and networking with data scientists, and long-term goals would be getting a job in data science and becoming a full-stack data scientist.", "One advice is to try out the Notion app which has great templates for setting goals, To-do lists, notes and many more. It\u2019ll be very useful as a reflection tool to remind you about your goals and for daily reflections, whether you are working towards your goal or not. Try it out now!", "Creative visualization depicts the methodology of using the power of your imagination to visualize your desired outcome and construct a mental picture for you to rewire your brain. This allows your mind to have something to strive towards, like a lighthouse guiding ships towards safety with their beam of light.", "It is an indispensable tool used by many successful people \u2014 consciously or unconsciously \u2014 to give them hyperfocus to realize their dreams and aspirations. By envisioning themselves being successful, they literally attract to them success.", "\u201cVisualize what you want to do before you do it. Visualization is so powerful that when you know what you want, you will get it.\u201d", "If you\u2019re deciding to get into Data Science, then you must have a dream job or company, GAFA companies \u2014 Google, Apple, Facebook, and Amazon are prominent technology companies that many data enthusiasts are eager to get into.", "To illustrate, if your dream is to become a lead data scientist, envision yourself as one at one of the GAFA companies, managing a team of data scientists, ML engineers, and big data specialists, planning data projects, building predictive models, etc.", "Try it now, go ahead. Close your eyes and imagine yourself in the final stage, visualize every process down to the minutiae details. Take some time to do this every day, and even your wildest dreams may come true.", "Though habits have a stigma of being bad and detrimental to a person\u2019s life, such as smoking and even a casual scroll on Instagram, habits can be good too. Professionals see habits as something that gives structure to their life and fixate certain essential routines in their lives. For example, Bill Gates reads a lot, in fact, he reads 50 books a year. By making reading a habit, it has become second-nature to him. His intense curiosity and willingness to learn engendered the habit of reading that makes him the person he is today.", "In the book The Power of Habits by Charles Duhigg, he mentions the key to achieving success is by understanding how habits work. All people who climbed up the ladder of success reached the top because they focused on the underlying patterns that shape their lives and construct habits that nurture success.", "\u201cChampions don\u2019t do extraordinary things. They do ordinary things, but they do them without thinking, too fast for the other team to react. They follow the habits they\u2019ve learned.\u201d\u2015 Charles Duhigg", "There are myriads of habits that you should start picking up in your learning phase to better prepare yourself in the future. First, assemble a list of resources with A-class content from trustable sources, that way, you have a distinct channel to keep up with the latest news in data science daily and skip all the garbage on the internet.", "Next, pick up the habit of asking lots and lots of questions. As a data scientist, your job is to be a scientist and make hypotheses on data. It\u2019s all about asking the right questions and making the ideal decisions from there. Moreover, there are certain coding habits \u2014 such as keeping your code clean and using functions \u2014 that you should pick up in order to manage complexity and make your data science project less error-prone.", "Optimism is defined as a mental vantage point that has a propensity to favor the positive side of things. An optimist has higher expectations of things and dreams bigger, while pessimist(the opposite) generally has lower expectations and assumes the worsts of everything. Thus, optimists are happier, healthier and have higher emotional intelligence.", "\u201cA pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.\u201d\u2013 Winston Churchill", "It\u2019s evident that our thoughts have a strong influence on our behavior and attitude. If you keep facing obstacles and roadblocks, you\u2019ll be susceptible to losing your self-confidence. If you let your failures influence your thoughts detrimentally, you will start to think that everyone else is more qualified than you are and you\u2019re just an impersonator. This is what experts call the imposter syndrome.", "Simply out, imposter syndrome occurs when you have uncertainties about your success and perpetual fear of being exposed as a \u201cpretender\u201d. This syndrome is quite common in the world of data science for many reasons, but mainly because of the proliferation of ML tools and the fact that data science is poorly defined. As explained by Alex Lamb,", "The truth of these tools is that most of them feature huge overlap. You don\u2019t need to have them all down cold. But that won\u2019t stop you feeling like you should.", "It can be difficult to cope with this syndrome constantly pushing you down, but with optimism, you\u2019ll see the world differently and realize that there are many people just like you who are facing this syndrome. Instead of letting negativity conquer you, realize that even the best can fall down sometimes. Believe in yourself and be sanguine in all circumstances.", "You probably heard the phrase \u201cThe people you surround yourself with, you become.\u201d before. Life throws at us many hurdles and there will always be people who dispute your belief and challenge you along your path to success. What better way to stand up on your feet again and move forward with people who listen to you and push you forward.", "It\u2019s also essential to not be the smartest person in the room, as that would only limit your true potential and impede any room for growth and personal development. By encircling smarties around you and exchanging views with them, then only can you completely reframe the framework you had of the world and raising your expectations", "\u201cYou\u2019re the average of the five people you spend most of your time with.\u201d \u2014 Jim Rohn", "To surround yourself with data science experts, you can try networking with data science experts on LinkedIn, Twitter, and so on as connections can be invaluable in this field. Moreover, participating in meetups and conferences is another great way to surround yourself with experts from across the world. Not only would this expand your mind, but you\u2019ll feed off their passion and energy, making you invigorated and enthusiastic to start working on your goals and dreams.", "ODSC East 2020 by ODSC - Open Data Science is one of the largest AI conference happening in April 2020! Don\u2019t miss out! Head over there and surround yourself with the biggest names in AI.", "Seeing the big picture implies having the overarching idea of what your goal is. Having the big picture in your head is so important because sometimes you can go overboard in your learning process and stray away from your original goal. And what you see as beneficial now might not be beneficial in the long term.", "Learn to see the big picture. Often times we get tunnel vision and lose sight of the big picture and what we\u2019re really trying to accomplish. \u2014 Robert Cheeke", "One example of losing sight of the big picture is, you can get caught up in learning too many ML tools and end up being a jack of all trades and a master on none. Though having knowledge of ML tools is imperative in data science, you only require a few vital ones to do your job. So the big picture in this sense could be finding your niche in the data science world.", "Ask yourself this question: What part of Data Science got you hooked in the first place? Was it the business side of it where you communicate data with leaders and investors? Or was it the incredible potential of Machine Learning and its limitless capabilities? If it\u2019s a little of everything, then go for the position of a full-stack data scientist.", "What is THE goal you want to achieve? The one at the top of your list? Write it down and place it somewhere you can see every day. Make sure it\u2019s not a goal you can check off in a day or a few weeks, it has to be something worth fighting for each day, something that moves you and burns inside of you. With this, you\u2019ll be kept on the path towards success defined in your own terms.", "Thanks for reading and I hope this article was insightful for you and motivated you to fulfill your passion.", "Check out my article on actionable advice for Data Science beginners!", "Follow me on LinkedIn and Twitter for updates.", "Your home for data science.
