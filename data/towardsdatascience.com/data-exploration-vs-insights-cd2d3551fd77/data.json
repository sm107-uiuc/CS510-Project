By performing data exploration, the explorer aims to get familiarized and to understand the data, discovering interesting facts and trends such as corruption in the data, correlations, class imbalance.", "However, the final goal of the data explorer is not interesting facts or trends \u2014 it\u2019s actionable Insights. These data insights are ready-for-use \u2014 may it be for cleaning up the data, for improving the model performance, or for supporting business KPIs.", "It\u2019s not an easy process. It\u2019s quite hard to understand even a small dataset \u2014 a table of a few thousands of samples and a mere dozen of features \u2014 and it\u2019s even harder to sieve for insights. In this post, I will argue why data exploration is the wrong approach to discover useful data insights and suggest an automatic insight generation approach to replace it. I will share some results of this insight generation approach as well as my conclusions.", "One often starts the process of data exploration by looking at some samples, which is nice but limited to a few hundreds of samples at most. Going onward he/she would look at some statistics (e.g. min, max, freq, count) and plot some histograms, searching for interesting insights. Depending on one\u2019s creativity and curiosity, it\u2019s quite easy to produce a dozen of statistics and graphs for every feature in the dataset, which can accumulate to hundreds and even thousands of graphs.", "For example, let\u2019s look at UCI\u2019s Adult dataset (link). It\u2019s a small dataset \u2014 about 50K instances and 15 features \u2014 for which this Kaggler has trained a simple Logistic Regression model, but not before plotting more than 20 statistics tables and graphs.", "Can\u2019t see the forest for the trees", "Our meager human mind cannot handle too much information. Too many statistics/graphs will result in going over them without actually seeing them.", "Finding needles in the Data Exploration hay stack", "Putting aside the work required to create a statistics table/graph, it takes a substantial effort to read and understand what\u2019s in it. For instance, calculating the maximal value for each feature is trivial, but to note that a specific feature, (e.g. \u2018capital-gain\u2019 or \u2018hours-per-week\u2019 in the Adult dataset) has a suspicious maximal value \u2014 this is almost impossible.", "Information is useful only if you can act upon it", "Data exploration aims to obtain information on the data through various functions and techniques. However, do we need all this information? The answer is no, we do not. Any information which won\u2019t trigger action is useless, and we don\u2019t need useless information, however interesting as it may be.", "For instance, let\u2019s look at a histogram plot for the Occupation feature in the Adult dataset. We can see how many people there are in each occupation.", "If that was your dataset \u2014 would you care that the dataset has 994 samples of fishermen and 3650 samples of salesmen? It could\u2019ve been 1515 and 2317 respectively, right? So why looking at a histogram in the first place if a difference of 50% in a bin\u2019s height has no impact and won\u2019t trigger a second thought?", "The answer is quite trivial \u2014 we do data exploration as we search for interesting information on which we can act upon, in other words - Insights. Looking at the example above we can find some interesting facts:", "However, only the first 2 sentences should be considered as insights since they will trigger an action.", "If you first plot a graph, and then ask yourself what you can learn from it \u2014 then you are doing it wrong. Instead, first decide what you want to learn, then plot the graph.", "Plotting an interesting graph and then trying to discover insights is what most people do. It\u2019s challenging and fun, but not very effective. A better approach would be to define a \u2018question\u2019 (Q) or \u2018hypothesis\u2019 (H) and a corresponding \u2018action\u2019 (A) based on the answer to the question. For example:", "In this approach, insights (I) are easily discovered as they are the fact that triggers the action \u2014 an answer to a question (Q) or hypothesis (H) not fulfilled. Some examples based on the Adult dataset:", "Let\u2019s see how to put it into code:", "Insights are not limited to data", "In the previous examples, we\u2019ve focused on insights originating from the dataset. However, we might find additional insights if we define some ML hypotheses. For example:", "In most cases, it\u2019s quite easy to answer these questions or to check the hypotheses without using graphical means and even without a human in the loop. Thus, this process can often be automatized, and since many of the hypotheses are not dataset dependant, it\u2019s not hard to scale. One may even carry forward this concept and define a suite of unit-tests for the dataset.", "I\u2019ve taken onto myself to try and implement such auto-insight-generator as part of the Pytolemaic package (read more here). I\u2019ve defined and implemented a set of generic hypotheses, which I later tried on a couple of datasets. Before discussing my conclusions, let\u2019s see the results of those trials.", "Insights tell us: There are 5-sigma outliers \u2014 need to check. Also, a couple of features (Name/Ticket/Cabin) are not used correctly.", "Insights tell us: There are 5-sigma outliers \u2014 need to check.", "Insights tell us: There are ~250 insights, most of them are 5-sigma outliers \u2014 need to check. Also, small classes in sub_area should be merged into an \u2018other\u2019 class.", "The code for generating the Titanic insights using Pytolemaic package is given below, in case you wish to try it yourself.", "The implementation of these insights was very interesting, and not as hard as I\u2019ve expected. It showed me it\u2019s possible to implement generic auto-generated insights and obtain useful insights into the data. The requirements for such insights generation are experience, creativity, and coding skills \u2014 a combination of skills that any senior data scientist has. However, there are several challenges I had to face while creating the insight module, making the process challenging.", "Data exploration is unable to scale due to our limited human capabilities. As a result, we need to use a different approach \u2014 automatic insight generation. In this approach, we define a set of question-action or hypothesis-action pairs. Then the question/hypothesis is applied to the dataset, providing an answer which is actionable insight.", "Through a couple of examples, we saw the potential of this approach, as well as the challenges. I believe that in the near future the world will go beyond manual data exploration, replacing it with powerful algorithms capable of providing actionable insights in a scalable way.", "Your home for data science.
