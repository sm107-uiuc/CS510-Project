During the process, we would also see how cluster analysis helps us to get rid of the sea of financial metrics.", "Before that, I am also going to show you the procedures to (1) download historical financial ratios of stocks, and (2) daily price data of stocks, which could be very useful for many of you playing around stock data in different projects.", "For the originals of all the codes below, you may refer to my Github link here.", "First, we would use a library called FundamentalAnalysis. For the details of this library, please refer to the website here.", "To be able to use this package, we need an API Key from FinancialModellingPrep, and follow the instructions there to obtain a free API Key. Please note that these keys are limited to 250 requests per account though there is no time limit. So I strongly recommend all of you to output the downloaded data as excel file for further use. Otherwise, the limitation is easy to exceed.", "And due to this limitation, I set the scope for stock selection in the experiment as 97 stocks listed below, which are all components of Nasdaq 100 Index.", "The above codes would generate two excel files, (a) key_metrics.xlsx, and (b) financial_ratios.xlsx, with each stock in a separate sheet. Both files store various financial indicators for the past 10\u201320 years, depending on when the companies are listed. We will combine them together with the returns and price volatility data in later step.", "Next, let\u2019s download the price data. Since the above package has limitation on requests quota, we would switch to another free library yfinance.", "The above code would download the daily price data for all the stocks in the ticker list. And close price is selected to represent the price and is outputted as an excel file, price.xlsx.", "At last, we would like to combine the three excel files prepared into a single file, each for one year in the selected period (2017\u20132019). I am not planning to go through the details here, since all are just some basic skills using pandas and numpy.

But still, I will illustrate the codes for some key parts. For the financial concepts introduced below, if you have further interests, you may refer to Investopedia for more details. For the codes in this section, please refer to cluster_stocks_analysis.py in the Github link.", "Step 1: Choose a set of representative financial indicators. In this experiment, I have chosen the followings, targeting to capture a company\u2019s performance or ability from different dimensions.", "Debt to Equity ratio \u2014 leverage ratio of a company", "Dividend Yield \u2014 amount of money a company pays shareholders for owning a share of its stock divided by its current stock price", "Enterprise Value (EV) / EBITDA \u2014 a commonly used multiple to determine the value of a company", "Net Debt To EBITDA ratio \u2014 indicates company\u2019s ability to decrease its debt", "Net Profit Margin \u2014 how much net income is generated as a percentage of revenue", "Operating Profit Margin \u2014 how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales, after paying for variable costs of production, such as wages and raw materials, but before paying interest or tax", "Return on Assets \u2014 indicates how well a company utilizes its assets, by determining how profitable a company is relative to its total assets", "Step 2: Perform Cluster analysis based on the above selected financial indicators.", "Different people have various preference when selecting stocks. Some care about the company\u2019s profitability, while some care whether the stock pays stable dividend. But what if we want to know about the overall performance ? Then it\u2019s hard to conclude that one stock is definitely better than another, especially every financial indicator is representing different thing, and there could be more than hundreds of indicators.", "Under this situation, cluster analysis could be a way to save us. Clustering helps us to group similar stocks together based on their characteristics, represented by financial indicators.", "In this experiment, we would apply one of the most commonly used method \u2014 hierarchical clustering, with bottom up approach, Euclidean distance and Ward\u2019s method to calculate the similarity. For detailed explanation of hierarchical clustering, this article gives a very good lesson.", "Each financial indicator has its own scale. For example, EV / EBITDA can always be higher than returns on assets. So to prevent such scale difference leading to unparalleled weights and unreliable conclusion, we have to first standardize the data. And we can do this simply by one line of codes as below.", "mean() \u2014 calculate the mean of values within a column", "std() \u2014 calculate the standard deviation of values within a column", "After standardizing the data, we can perform clustering using a library called AgglomerativeClustering, whose name means a bottom-up approach.", "And to visualize the clustering result, we would apply Dendrogram, which is a tree-like diagram that records the sequences of merges or splits. However, please note that the number of cluster finally formed is completely based on your judgement. If there are too many clusters, the classification may be too detailed. If too few, the stocks may not be well classified.", "The dendrogram is plotted as followings.", "From the dendrogram plot, we can see that there could be 13 clusters.", "And interestingly, four stocks have formed independent clusters themselves.", "Based on the choice, we next apply the function AgglomerativeClustering on the datasets 2017, by setting n_clusters as 13, affinity as euclidean distance, and linkage as Ward\u2019s method.", "To illustrate the characteristics of the 13 clusters, we can plot a line graph.", "From the line graph, we can see that there are four clusters with very unique characteristics in 2017, and in fact, they are all solely formed. They are:", "(i) TSLA (grey line)\u2014 high net debt to EBITDA ratio and EV/EBITDA ratio, which means the company\u2019s ability to repay debt is comparatively low, and it is highly valued based on its weak earning ability, which may mean that it has been over-valued.", "(ii) IDXX (deep blue line)\u2014 negative debt to equity ratio, mainly due to the company\u2019s negative equity balance in 2017.", "(iii) DXCM (light blue line)\u2014 negative EV / EBITDA ratio, due to its negative EBITDA in 2017.", "(iv) VRTX (orange line) \u2014 negative net debt to EBITDA ratio, due to its negative value of net debt in 2017.", "We are not going to investigate the details of the companies\u2019 performance, which may need a separate article for every stock. I just want to show you all that among the financial indicators selected, clustering can help us to group stocks with similar characteristics together, but also can detect some outliners.", "Step 3: Construct a portfolio based on clustering result, and compare with the portfolio constructed without help of clustering", "The average performance table of the 13 clusters by end of 2017 is shown as below.", "After conducting cluster analysis, a criteria is needed to help making decision on portfolio construction. In this experiment, returns-to-price volatility ratio would be the only standard to follow.", "Returns would be the one year return, calculated by comparing the price at year-end 2017 with the price at the beginning of 2017. Price volatility is the standard deviation of the price throughout the whole year of 2017. So returns-to-price volatility ratio is simply a measure of returns and risks, and also used to mimic the Sharpe ratio.", "From the table above, cluster 6, 8 and 11 will be chosen due to their relatively high returns-to-price volatility ratio. Portfolio A is constructed with equal weighted investments onto all stocks in these three clusters, and there are 10 stocks in total. For comparison, we would like to construct another portfolio by selecting corresponding number of individual stocks with highest returns-to-price volatility ratio in 2017, without applying cluster analysis in advance.", "(A) Top 3 clusters with highest returns-to-price volatility ratio in 2017, and there are 10 stocks in total (CSCO, FAST, XEL, EXC, COST, QCOM, VRSN, CHKP, FB, VRTX)", "(B) Top 10 stocks with highest returns-to-price volatility ratio in 2017 (for fair comparison, we would adjust the number of stocks for this portfolio every year in order to match the number of stocks in portfolio A) (SIRI, CSX, CPRT, EBAY, CDNS, CSCO, MU, MXIM, NTAP, CMCSA)", "Now, we are interested to see which portfolio generates higher return in the coming one year (2018). And the result shows that portfolio A generates a return of 3.48% while portfolio B suffers from a loss of 2.29%.", "However, it\u2019s still hard to conclude that a portfolio construction based on the above method would definitely perform better, especially based on a single year data. Therefore, I extend this experiment for two more periods (2018\u20132019 and 2019\u20132020), and the result is quite surprising.", "Clearly, portfolio A has consistently generated higher returns than portfolio B in all three years.", "Of course, it can\u2019t be concluded that portfolio construction through cluster analysis of financial indicators would always give a superior performance. But its consistently better performance over stock selection by only considering returns and risks shows that fundamental analysis really adds some value, and cluster analysis has helped to simplify the analysis process.", "Below are some possible explanations for the better performance:", "(a) Value of fundamental analysis \u2014Financial indicators measure a company\u2019s performance from different dimensions. So returns of a company with good financial performance should be more sustainable than returns \u201crandomly generated\u201d. Taking consideration of financial indicators periodically and updating portfolio allocation are quite necessary for its sustainable performance. As an evidence, if we try to keep the allocation of portfolio constructed in 2017 unchanged until 2019, its performance actually deteriorates quite a lot in the period of 2018\u20132019.", "(b) Diversification benefits \u2014 Cluster analysis helps to distinguish stocks with different characteristics. In other words, the three clusters chosen should be quite different fundamentally. Such diversification prevents the portfolio suffering greatly from downturn of a specific type of companies during a period.", "(c) Prevent some company specific risks \u2014 Clustering groups stocks with similar characteristics together. So a group with high returns-to-price volatility ratio in the past should be more \u201cconcrete\u201d than a single stock with high ratio. Portfolio construction through this method may have prevented some company specific risks.", "It\u2019s always not easy to construct a portfolio with consistently good performance, especially when there are thousands of stocks. Sometimes we may first scale down the scope, but still have to look at hundreds of financial indicators before making the decision.", "This article introduces one of the possible ways \u2014 Cluster analysis to help us get rid of the seas of financial metrics, and has gone through some procedures to construct a complete financial dataset. I hope that this would open the discussion on how to improve our portfolio allocation by leveraging some data science techniques.", "If you are more comfortable and confident on time series model, my another article about customizing loss function in LSTM model may help you a bit.
