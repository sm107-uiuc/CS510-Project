Now, the COVID-19 pandemic has been unfolding for a few months, and other events are taking the spotlight \u2014 namely the demonstrations against police brutality and racial injustice. Also, we are just a couple months away from the Republican and Democratic national conventions, with the election coming up thereafter. So, what are politicians talking about?", "To get a handle on this, I decided to look at political speeches using VoteSmart.org (I got the idea from a research paper), and look at partisan phrases. The post will proceed as follows:", "I started with a well-maintained dataset of everyone in congress, which contains an ID that links to their Vote Smart page. To make things human-readable, my goal was to make a folder for each legislator which contained text files of all their speeches. The research paper I mentioned used a few types of speeches, but I included every type of public statement made starting in January 2020.", "This tutorial will focus on the text analysis, but you can find the code for scraping the corpus here. I used it to scrape over 10,000 unique statements and speeches from VoteSmart (I removed tweets and duplicate statements), though you could scrape more if you fine-tuned it and included more than just senators, for example. Here is a sample text from a Bernie Sanders interview with CNN back in March:", "And here is what the organized corpus looks like:", "The next step is to extract phrases by splitting up the texts into tokens. I used scikit-learn\u2019s token vectorizer because it has some great features built in. Here is how simple it looks to set everything up:", "Stopwords (i.e. nltk_stop_words) help get rid of non-informative words, common examples are \u201cof,\u201d \u201cto,\u201d and \u201cand.\u201d I used NLTK\u2019s list because scikit\u2019s built-in list has some known issues. Then, the tf_vectorizer (tf stands for \u201cterm frequency\u201d) gets initialized with a few settings:", "After putting texts into a list with file I/O, the tf_vectorizer can turn the texts into a phrase matrix with just one line:", "Now, term_frequences is a matrix with the counts of each term from the vectorizer. We can turn it into a DataFrame to make things more intuitive and see the most common phrases:", "The resulting csv file looks like this:", "First things first, we will need to split up the Democrat-authored and Republican-authored texts, and then get their term frequency matrices. The Pandas DataFrame makes this pretty easy:", "Now for the juicy part: figuring out which phrases are politically charged. Here is the part of the paper that explains the method for this (the key formula is highlighted):", "You may notice there are only two variables involved in the formula: phrase probability for Democrat-authored texts, and phrase probability for Republican-authored texts. So, to calculate the partisan bias score, we will just need to compute these two probabilities, which I called p_dem and p_rep for short. Once we have those, the bias score for each phrase is simply:", "I used a basic probability metric: the number of documents that contained a phrase divided by the total number of documents. There are some more sophisticated ways to measure probability, but based on my reading of the paper, this is probably what the authors did.", "Almost there! Now, we just need to put the bias scores into the phrases_df DataFrame from earlier, and then we can easily look at some common partisan phrases. When I first ran this, some name phrases such as \u201csenator harris\u201d and \u201csenator patty\u201d among the most partisan \u2014 an artifact of the transcripts. To put a band-aid on this, I made a filter to make sure partisan phrases were used by at least three senators:", "Now, at last, we can see the partisan phrases! You will notice they line up with partisan agendas, for example, Democrats talk about the climate crisis and health care, while Republicans talk about abortion.", "Here are the most Democratic-leaning phrase, along with the scores and probabilities we calculated.", "With these phrases and their bias scores, you could measure political bias in tweets, speeches, articles, etc. by counting the frequency of partisan phrases: if an article talks a lot about the unborn, liberals, and communists, it probably leans Republican, whereas if an article talks about the climate crisis, working people, and affordable health, it probably leans Democrat.", "Thanks for reading!
