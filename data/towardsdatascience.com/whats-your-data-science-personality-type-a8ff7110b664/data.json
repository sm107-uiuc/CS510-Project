He\u2019d run too many teams in which people earnestly and emphatically talked past each other, oblivious to what others were saying. It seemed that underneath, there was something deeply emotional going on, trumping any rational arguments being made.", "Hmmm. Earnestly and emphatically talking past each other. That does sound familiar. Ever seen data scientists do that?", "With that in mind, I thought it would be fun to chart out some data science personality dimensions, along the lines of a Myers-Briggs [1] test for data scientists. If I\u2019m right, then these dimensions will have some practical effect on how data science teams should be run. We\u2019ll return to those effects at the end, but first a disclaimer! These dimensions are based on my own personal experience, so at best they are a starting point. Please chime in with your thoughts in the comments!", "For some of us it\u2019s all about the blank sheet of paper, the tabula rasa. There\u2019s a creative thrill to building something from nothing. This time, we will produce that perfectly polished piece of data science that clearly explains something about the world!", "Then reality hits. The data\u2019s messy, or non-existent. There are all these confounding variables. Perhaps we just jot down a method that should work in theory and pause. Hang on, there\u2019s this other problem that\u2019s come up! Let\u2019s park the old one for now, it\u2019s basically solved anyway \u2026", "Not ideal. On the other hand, there\u2019s the Finisher. Give them an open ended task and you get worried looks, and a whole bunch of \u201cmaybes\u201d. Not ideal either! However give a finisher a sort-of working solution, tell them to improve it and suddenly they\u2019re away. Trawling through code, pointing out how the other guy\u2019s an idiot, they\u2019re suddenly in their element. And then the glow of satisfaction as they present a working, improved solution with their name on it. Success!", "Data science is still a relatively new discipline, and has attracted people trained in disciplines from the ancient past of, you know, before 2012. People generally carry mindsets that reflect their original training. I often see two mindsets play out in group discussions. One is the scientists\u2019 mindset, which is something like \u201cwe need to find out what processes are driving this thing we care about, then we can affect those processes positively\u201d. In some sense they are finding out how the world works first and only then figuring out what to do with that knowledge.", "In contrast there seems to be an engineer\u2019s mindset that starts with the premise that they are there to make changes that improve things. Often this comes down to a number they are trying to optimize (clicks, sales, time on page whatever) and a bunch of things they can do to improve that number. The problem then reduces to \u201cfind the combination of things to do that improve the number the most\u201d. The question of why any of it is working is secondary, if it gets asked at all.", "Of course a team needs both mindsets. All scientist and you spend so long figuring out why things are working you never actually get around to improving things. All engineer, and e.g in 2008, you notice that California and Florida have never had correlated housing markets and end up losing huge amounts of money because you never thought about why those markets were uncorrelated historically, and why they might be now.", "Some people love a bit of theory. The egg-heads like deriving a \u201cright\u201d answer from some first principles and they love to know what\u2019s \u201creally going on\u201d with a data science technique. By this they mean they want to understand the underlying Maths, and how it fits in with all the other underlying Maths in the world.", "In contrast there are people who could not care less about the theory. They just want to fiddle about, using techniques as a means to their end. This could be to improve the number they\u2019re optimizing (the engineers), or demonstrate the effect of real world processes (the scientists). How the Maths is working out is definitely of secondary importance. If you\u2019re the kind of person who likes highfalutin\u2019 talk, you can see this as a distinction between Plato\u2019s world of forms to be grasped by pure reason vs Aristotelian empiricism [3], in which the world is to be understood by observation and experience.", "It\u2019s easy to come to the conclusion that egg-heads are useless, and you want a team of tinkerers. However life isn\u2019t so clear cut. Whilst you\u2019ll see most progress from your tinkerers day-to-day, for the really big leap that gets you somewhere that you wouldn\u2019t have got otherwise, you often need some theory. And that will usually involve an egg-head.", "This is really a distinction between people who are extrinsically motivated and those who are motivated intrinsically. For some people, the respect and praise of their colleagues (and their line manager) is the reason they come to work. Conversely I have had direct reports who couldn\u2019t care less what I thought about their data science, but really really did care that they could get good results out of it. In some sense they defined themselves by their ability to do data science that made a difference to the business.", "Again it seems that being results focused is obviously a better way to be. No-one needs to care what I think, as long as they are delivering! However sometimes a bit of social seeking comes in handy too. It can stop you spinning off into your own world, and convincing yourself of things that to other people might look a bit \u2026 strange.", "So now you\u2019ve seen my four dimensions. I\u2019d reiterate that they\u2019re based on experience, rather than any formal cluster analysis. However if you are buying these dimensions I think there are some things that follow naturally from them.", "Firstly you have a responsibility to understand your own personality type, and how that might be biasing your responses to your team. For the curious, I\u2019d count myself as a Starter, Scientist, a bit of an Egg-head and a Social Seeker \u2014 I\u2019m writing this blog for a reason, right? As such, I can remember cases where I\u2019ve got frustrated with Finishers and Results Obsessives, when really they were just being themselves. Conversely I can remember at least one occasion when I gave an Egg-head too much leeway, because, well, I was kind of interested too.", "Secondly you have to balance the team so it can fulfil its mission within the larger organisation. Starter vs Finisher is easy. You just have some Starters to prototype things, and some Finishers to sigh, call them cowboys and operationalise the prototype. Egg-head vs Tinkerer depends on how research focused your team is. The more research, the more egg-heads you can carry. However, in most cases I\u2019d suggest that you want mostly Tinkerers, with only larger teams carrying a few Egg-heads. Think of them as the risky bets in your balanced investment portfolio. Yeah there\u2019s a risk that they\u2019ll deliver nothing but there\u2019s a small chance that they win big for you. For Social Seekers vs Results Obsessives, I don\u2019t think it matters which you have on the team, you just have to recognise the differences and work accordingly. You\u2019ll have to work harder to show Social Seekers some T.L.C., and give them opportunities to show off their work to the wider team. On the other hand you\u2019ll have to keep and eye on the Results Obsessives to make sure that, without the social feedback, they don\u2019t trundle off on their own, doing something irrelevant.", "The attentive reader will have noticed that I\u2019ve skipped Scientist vs Engineer. My own prejudice is that the clue is in the name. Data Scientists should, mostly, be doing Science. I have profound reservations about the \u201coptimise the number\u201d world-view that gets pushed in Kaggle competitions (and job interview tasks). However that is a post for another day. For now let\u2019s take the path of compromise and say you probably need a few people doing both.", "To sum up then, hopefully these four dimensions, Starter/Finisher, Scientist/Engineer, Egg-head/Tinkerer, Social-Seeker/Results Obsessive sound plausible to you. If they do, I think they can be a practical tool for running a harmonious data science team that delivers what it\u2019s supposed to!", "[1] For the uninitiated this wikipedia article is the place to start. It turns out that there isn\u2019t much evidence for the Myers-Briggs test either.", "[3] An argument as old as philosophy isn\u2019t going to be resolved here.
