No, not the biblical figure. No, not Eve from Wall-E.", "Eve is a researcher. She\u2019s based in the UK at the Manchester Institute of Technology. In 2015 she discovered that a compound shown to have anti-cancer properties could also be used in the fight against malaria. What about Adam, do you know him? He is also a researcher and in 2009 contributed with new scientific knowledge regarding the genomics of the baker\u2019s yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae.", "Why should you care about these researchers?", "Both Adam and Eve are robots. Built using artificial intelligence and marking a milestone in the automation and reduction of expenses in scientific research. We\u2019ve come a long way since 2009 and nowadays AI technologies are all over the place. This is a fascinating field and understanding it is not only important for scientists but for anyone alive as it will likely impact our professional and personal lives.", "AI is said to be the solution to cure cancer, accelerate the discovery of vaccines, reduce the costs of healthcare. AI is said to increase unemployment and impose a threat to human society as we know it. But what is actually true? What are the applications of these technologies in the real world? How do they work?", "The field is so vast that no one is likely to have anything more than partial answers to these questions. Nonetheless, we can always try to learn more.", "The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World is a book published in 2015 and written by Pedro Domingos. This book lessens our lack of knowledge in the field.", "1. I was looking for an overview of the field of Machine Learning and to understand how the dots connect;", "2. I wanted a less technical explanation of the algorithms I have implemented myself as well as others that I had never worked with;", "But who is Pedro Domingos? In his bio you can read:", "\u201cI received an undergraduate degree (1988) and M.S. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (1992) from IST, in Lisbon. I received an M.S. (1994) and Ph.D. (1997) in Information and Computer Science from the University of California at Irvine. I spent two years as an assistant professor at IST, before joining the faculty of the University of Washington in 1999.\u201d", "Moreover, in 1999 he started teaching AI and has been academically successful in the field with several best paper awards. One of his most impactful projects is Alchemy, \u2018a software package providing a series of algorithms for statistical relational learning and probabilistic logic inference\u2019.", "To learn more about Pedro Domingos you can check\u2026", "\u2026 his medium account (not very active): https://medium.com/@pedromdd", "The book has 10 chapters, each with the purpose of exposing an idea or exploring a specific topic. I decided to summarize each chapter so that you can get an idea of how the book is structured and the topics it covers.", "1. The Machine Learning Revolution: Machine Learning is introduced through examples of some applications, the promises of what it can achieve, and present obstacles. At the end of the chapter, the author lays out the questions this book tries to answer.", "2. The Master Algorithm: Here, the books\u2019 central hypothesis is presented:", "\u2018All knowledge \u2014 past, present, and future \u2014 can be deduced from data by a single, universal learning algorithm.\u2019", "This universal learning algorithm is what Pedro Domingos refers to as The Master Algorithm. Pedro Domingos refers to the work that has been carried out by 5 different schools of thought or what he calls the \u20185 tribes of machine learning\u2019: Symbolists, Connectionists, Evolutionaries, Bayesians, and Analogizers.", "This lays the ground for the following 5 chapters, each diving into one of the tribes.", "3. Hume\u2019s problem of induction: Dive into the Symbolists who incorporate pre-existing knowledge in the learning process. Their master algorithm is induction.", "4. How does your brain work: Dive into the Connectionists, to whom learning requires understanding how the brain works. More specifically, how neuron\u2019s connections adapt based on new evidence. Their master algorithm is backpropagation.", "5. Evolution: natures learning algorithm: Dive into the Evolutionaries who are inspired by mother nature and natural selection. Their master algorithm is genetic programming.", "6. In the church of Reverend Bayes: Dive into the Bayesians. This tribe is mostly concerned about uncertainty as all knowledge has some degree of uncertainty to it. Their master algorithm is the Bayes Theorem.", "7. You are what you reason: Dive into the Analogizers, who believe that the key to learning is to recognize similarities between events and use those to infer further similarities. Their master algorithm is the Support Vector Machine.", "8. Learning without a teacher: Introduction to unsupervised learning, a technique the author believes to be important for the Master Algorithm. This section includes brief explanations of algorithms such as k-means, Principal Component Analysis, and Chunking. Moreover, it skims through reinforcement learning.", "9. The pieces of the puzzle fall in place: The author proposes ways of combining the different algorithms and methodologies in order to create the Master Algorithm. Some of the current projects that aim to do so are presented.", "10. This is the world on Machine Learning: The author shares his vision of the meaning and real-world impact of what has been discussed. He does so by devising episodes of our everyday lives and how they are going to be impacted.", "Overall, I truly enjoyed reading this book. It was the first time I was exposed to the idea of the 5 machine learning tribes and it changed my perspective on the field and how it has evolved.", "Moreover, Pedro Domingos describes the field\u2019s developments through the people that worked on them. I find, this humanization of technology to be extremely important since technology-related fields sometimes forget about people that are behind the advances or those who are impacted by these same advances. Besides, it is a great way of learning about different researchers and the projects they work on.", "Regarding the algorithms and methodologies presented, few formulas are used, and concepts are mostly explained through analogies, examples, and diagrams. This makes things easy for everyone, yet those that have experience with machine learning can gain a new perspective on methods they may use regularly. Most diagrams are well designed and support the explanation.", "On the downside, there is not a reference or footnote anywhere to be seen. If you go to the end of the book, there is no list of resources. Even for a book that is written for the layman, I believe this to be a massive flaw. Pedro Domingos is an accomplished academic with an impressive track record but we should not simply buy everything he says and more importantly, we can\u2019t satisfy our curious minds. For instance, at some point, he mentions an estimate that NSA intercepts over a billion phone calls. I\u2019d love to read more about this, but I can\u2019t.", "Similarly, when making a point against the argument that AI can\u2019t learn everything, and that even Black Swans (a concept from Nassim Taleb\u2019s book) can be predicted by machine learning models, the author states that the real estate crisis of 2008 was largely predicted. Again, a really interesting topic to dive into and I\u2019d like to start by using the same information he used (instead of just googling it) but that information is nowhere.", "In the last chapter, Pedro Domingos calls for action on an extremely positive and inspiring note. In an attempt to draw the attention of people into the field, I believe he manages to lay the grounds for a better understanding of what Machine Learning is, how it is being used and what should be taken into account when interacting with these technologies.", "Recently, in a conversation with a friend who had just watched the documentary \u2018Social Dilemma\u2019, I realized how little is known by the general public about how these platforms \u2014 a.k.a. the biggest companies in the world \u2014 work. We should not stop using them but instead learn how to do so, like we have to learn how to drive a car before going to the highway. This book is a good start.", "So, who is this book for?", "If you are not that into technology, you are still very likely to use a computer and smartphone, access social media, and use amazon (or similar platforms). Reading this book will help you understand what your data is used for and how to better control what you share.", "Those who are seasoned researchers in the field will likely gain a new perspective on old problems. Those who recently arrived in the field will learn about new algorithms, projects, and problems that researchers are working on.", "Maybe I overreacted when I said that everyone should read this book. I\u2019m sorry, I got carried away. If you are looking for a how-to book or some in-depth explanation of algorithms, you should opt for something else as this is an exploration of concepts and ideas but not a practical guide.", "If you are not convinced and want more information about the book you can check the following:", "Hope you found this review useful, especially if you are trying to make a decision about whether or not to read this book.", "If there is a bit of information you\u2019re missing, or you have questions, feel free to write in the comments. I would be grateful for it.", "Your home for data science.
