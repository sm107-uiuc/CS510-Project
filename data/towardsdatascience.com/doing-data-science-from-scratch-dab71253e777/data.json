Over many years I have observed a tendency in such articles, blogs, or tutorials to start with specific data sets. Consider how many pieces are written about the Titanic or the Iris dataset as an example. Rarely do I find articles where measurement devices are used, measurements are taken, a dataset is collected and then used in the generic Data Science workflows subject of all those articles. Rather than generally bemoan this lack of perceived richness, I decided to contribute some articles and to advocate for a more in-depth discussion.", "Doing Data Science from Scratch is a journey. Any such journey starts with defining a real-world event we want to measure. Next, we describe our objective and measures of success. Based on those goals, we can select or build a measurement instrument. Testing the strategy and validating the process is always extremely important. Planning the running of the experiment and eventual collection of the data should never be oversimplified. All going well, we arrive with the data set, and that feeds into doing that traditional Data Science workflow.", "For me, as a writer, there are some risks in this strategy. Defining the objectives and measures of success is relatively straightforward, and you should do this for every project regardless of the complexity involved. Instrumentation of an observable event can include electronics and hardware and could become complicated. Those sort of complications are challenging to write about, and often do not interest many audiences. Similarly, signalling between Sensors, Edge devices, network controllers, and building up the dataset from the wild is always involved, challenging to write about, and again will not appeal to all readers. Naturally, there is less risk in working with the collected data. Many great writers produce good work with Time Series data. Sensors mostly provide us with real-time streaming measurements. Since one of my passions is real-time streaming, I eat drink and sleep it, I offer this article as an illustration of doing it all from scratch.", "The first step is always to clarify and define our objectives, goals, and how we will measure our success. I doubt anyone could stress this one enough, if you are driving across states, camping in the wilderness, or visiting a friend, you will always have a map, a target arrival time, and some expectations for the adventure. Doing Data Science from scratch is no different. Our first step aligns with the CRISP-DM method step of \u201cBusiness Understanding\u201d.", "Since there are many books written on Data Mining, I will only say that you should always do the Business Understanding stage really well. Avoid the temptation to skip, or do it quickly to get started. Many many projects are resolved, adding significant business value, just by doing the Business Understanding phase well and honestly.", "For the purpose of this article, I have established a small project. I wish to measure the amount of traffic passing by my house. One of my other passions is going for a stroll in the scenic area that I live in. So I would like to understand what time of the day has the least Cars and Trucks on the road. Declaring success requires me to be able to plot the frequency of traffic, map daylight times, and find a slot that is the safest for my stroll. I could then visit places like Fore Abbey.", "Given that we want to instrument the traffic flow in front of my house so that I can measure the frequency of passing vehicles, the first step is to research the general approaches to this activity. Similar to business understanding, it is worth doing the research really well. Some simple and obvious solutions probably exist, and you might not be aware of how researchers generally tackle the task. A careful analysis of approaches is critical with Data Science from scratch.", "An interesting article [Retail Sensing] was helpful in providing a summary of the main methods available for counting passing traffic. Those are broadly:-", "Papers and articles from [Airpix], [Qiao Meng et al.], [Pancharatnam], and [Bouaich] demonstrate the wealth of research and implementation of real-world projects in Computer Vision for Traffic planning and management. Their combined work tends more towards Traffic management and Smarter cities. The articles make for interesting reading and certainly help to inform me about this popular topic.", "Based on the research, it appears that two options are viable, neither would not require permission, and certainly would not involve me in digging up the road outside the house. Those are:-", "After completing the research, you should have a better idea about how others have tackled your specific challenge, and that provides you with a great starting point for your own work.", "If I wished to do a manual count, I could simply stand at the window and count each passing car for a day. It would be incredibly dull, but it can be done. The steps would be:-", "There would be an audible cue, traffic noise, and a visual signal, the vehicle passing by the viewing angle of my eyes, to help me trigger the count increment. The process seems simple enough, but could we replicate the human activity with a measurement instrument? I believed so and resolved to repeat the process.", "Having resolved to build a measurement device for my project, I drew heavily on my previous work. Any such measurement process requires two components:-", "I have written several articles and made a video series about my central server concept. You can get the full details from my Blog.", "For this project, the central server will provide a Samba server giving us a place to stream the live video clips and collect all the motion events. The server also has a RabbitMQ broker service, a REDIS key-value pair database, and a MongoDB instance. We have all the collection services we need right on one server.", "As it turns out, I already have a Smart Doorbell I built for another project. You can read the full detail of the entire build process directly on my blog. I choose to write on my blog because some of the pieces are hardware, purchasing, and assembly, and those details might not interest all readers. There is an excellent explanation on the blog for those interested.", "Here is an example of what the doorbell normally shows.", "The doorbell is a motion detector based on the Raspberry Pi 3b and a Camera. The little device connects to the Samba share (central server) and uses the Linux Motion library to begin monitoring the driveway. When the camera detects movement, a video stream is created, and that is stored directly on the central server as a clip. During a typical day, there can be hundreds (100\u2019s) of small video clips showing movement. The movement can range from a tree blowing in the wind, to a delivery man, or just me coming and going. But how to get a single movie that could be processed by a model such as Yolo? Thankfully I found a solution to this one as well.", "A python script, using the moviepy package, allows me to collect all the clips and create one large video file of an entire day of events. You can find a full explanation of the process in the article I wrote.", "A method already exists, from my work, to capture movement in a camera view, to record that activity, and then combine all the activity into a single video file. We start to see the benefit of building your own measurement devices, taking measurements, and setting yourself up for analysing and drawing conclusions that result in real-world insights.", "The process also generates a log of all events providing even further sources of data for our experiment.", "Given the availability of the Smart doorbell, the central server, the video processing script, and the log file, I considered that pointing the doorbell towards the road would generate a video of passing vehicles which could be counted either by hand or by a detection algorithm. Further, the Motion log can be parsed and counted. We have the event start time, event end time providing duration, and timeframe.", "The value to me in building my own measurement devices is that I am free to design experiments to answer questions, which, when analysed, allow me to draw conclusions about real-world observations.", "My next step is to execute my experiment, collect the data, and then move into the regular Data Science workflow. We will be working with Time Series data, and as you would expect, it will be messy and will require the usual Exploratory Data Analysis, Cleaning, and plotting.", "If you are interested in reading the results of the experiment tune in next time. I plan to publish a detailed article once the investigation concludes. Meanwhile, I would love to discuss my design and approach with you, the readers. So feel free to contact me or leave your perspectives in the comments.
