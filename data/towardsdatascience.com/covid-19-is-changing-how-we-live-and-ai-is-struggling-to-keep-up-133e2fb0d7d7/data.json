For many of us, what we buy, where we go, and what we do are remarkably different than before.", "These changes are expected during an international health crisis. However, to artificial intelligence systems that are trained on normal human behavior, our new actions are quite a shock to their algorithms and they are struggling to keep up.", "AI is a broad term that encompasses a lot of things, but in this case, we\u2019re talking about machine learning. These algorithms use massive amounts of data to find a pattern and make an educated guess on what comes next. For Amazon, that guess is what you want to buy. For YouTube, it\u2019s what you want to watch.", "Whether or not we realize it, our lives are entrenched in machine learning models. Beyond online stores and streaming apps, they are used for fraud detection, security, marketing, and more.", "But these models can only go off of the data that they were given. When they encounter a scenario that differs too much from the data they learned from, they have trouble guessing what you\u2019re going to do.", "As reported by MIT Technology Review, one company\u2019s predictive algorithm was broken by an unusual bout of bulk orders. They noticed this when the items that the algorithm was telling them to restock no longer matched up with what their customers were buying.", "A similar spike in users caused problems for the recommendation algorithms used by an online streaming company. They found that the influx in user data made the recommendations less accurate.", "For a credit fraud detection company, it wasn\u2019t how much was being purchased, but what was being purchased that raised red flags. They discovered that people were suddenly buying gardening equipment and power tools, which their algorithms would typically register as fraudulent spending.", "In this case, the company\u2019s engineers had the foresight to make adjustments for the change in spending habits.", "Modifications like these are essential to keeping a machine learning algorithm working when big changes occur. You can\u2019t simply train automated systems and walk away. To stay up-to-date, they need oversight, tweaking, and possibly even some retraining.", "For example, Amazon tweaked their algorithms to account for the changes they\u2019re seeing in purchases.", "They normally drive traffic to sellers who use their warehouses, but when the pandemic began and people started shopping more online, the warehouses became overwhelmed with orders. By adjusting their algorithm, they were able to get orders to be more evenly distributed among sellers.", "Another company, who uses machine learning to write advertisement emails, made some modifications to their algorithm as well. Their system chooses the best phrases to use, but with the current global pandemic, the company thought it best to avoid certain phrases like \u201cgoing viral.\u201d", "Moving forward, as our lives continue to evolve during and after the pandemic, computer science teams in charge of the maintenance of machine learning models will need to continue to make these kinds of changes. That way, the new world we are experiencing will be reflected in the behavior of the algorithms.", "With all the uncertainty following COVID-19, scientists have been making algorithms that predict the future of the virus.", "In a study published on May 19, researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital combined chest CT scans and patient data with machine learning models to diagnose patients with COVID-19. They found that, in some cases, their algorithm was even better than a senior thoracic radiologist at determining which patient had the virus.", "Other hospitals, desperate for insight into which patients will become critically ill, have even begun using algorithms that have yet to be validated.", "Machine learning is also being used to predict the spread of the virus and determine how well mitigation efforts like quarantines and social distancing are working.", "Researchers at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute focused these efforts on individual cities. They noted that smaller cities are harder to model since there is less data to train the algorithm. In these cases, they needed to make adjustments to make accurate predictions.", "Like with the algorithms that influence other aspects of our daily lives, these models will have to be updated as we learn more about the virus and adjust to a new normal.", "The purpose of AI is to make our lives easier. Machine learning models do this in many different ways, across many different industries. But with this interconnectedness comes the necessity that we grow together. If not, they risk being left behind.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Former biomedical engineer. Current freelance science writer/journalist.
