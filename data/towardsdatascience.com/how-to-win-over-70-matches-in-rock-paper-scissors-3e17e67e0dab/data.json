How to set a Go-playing program? Why was AI bot able to beat you in your favorite game? Well, you\u2019re not going to read it in this article. The game I\u2019m going to write about is both easier to play and implement.", "Although rock-paper-scissors (RPS) may seem like a trivial game, it actually involves the hard computational problem of temporal pattern recognition. This problem is fundamental to the fields of machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data compression. In fact, it might even be essential to understanding how human intelligence works.", "The above text comes from the great Rock Paper Scissors Programming Competition page. It hosts a free and open competition where everybody can submit his/her playing algorithm. Code submissions are in Python 2, and they are visible to everybody. It gives everybody an opportunity to see the details of the best solutions. It\u2019s not always easy to understand them though.", "Submitted algorithm plays one thousand rounds with other programs. It\u2019s called a match. The algorithm with the higher number of rounds won takes the match. Players are listed on a leaderboard based on ranking points gained or lost by playing matches.", "Let\u2019s implement the most straightforward playing algorithm. It always plays Rock.", "Note that the only thing you have to do in the program it to give a value for range(\u2018R,\u2019 \u2018P,\u2019 \u2018S\u2019) to the global output variable. You opposing algorithm assigns its move to input global variable. Each round you can see input from the previous round. The first round the variable is an empty string.", "Well, the first gameplay would be quite easy to counter for any algorithm that learns from data. Now take the opposite approach.", "How do you think will it go? It\u2019s quite easy to predict: on average one-third lost, one-third drew, and one-third won. This strategy gives you a 50% chance of winning every match. To achieve a higher win rate you have to take a risk. Would it be fun to watch only random models competing? Rather not, so please don\u2019t submit entirely random solutions. We\u2019re going to use the model in certain situations though.", "Note that you can test your model offline. Just download rpsrunner.py from the site. You could post them to check how they\u2019re doing, but there is not much computation power there. I made a mistake in the beginning and posted some codes that were unintentionally random. It\u2019s easy to test \u2014 just let your code play with constant input (like the first model implemented). If it looses around 50% times, your model is probably random.", "The model we\u2019re going to implement is a discrete Markov Chain. It\u2019s built on a straightforward idea. Let\u2019s say a process has two possible states A and E. We\u2019re now in the state A. What\u2019s the chance we will stay at the state A? Also, what\u2019s the chance of going to state E? Concerning a Markov Chain with two possible states, these two probabilities have to sum up to 1. Adequately, there would be two probabilities for the current state E. You can see the mechanism on the picture below.", "There is an excellent visualization of how Markov Models work here.", "How can we use the model in the context of RPS contest? A natural way is to analyze the input and the output from the latest round and try to predict the next input. Then make the move which beats it. This setup indicates that our current state is a pair, like \u201cRP,\u201d and the next state is our output. It should look like that:", "Here is the implementation. I also added a n_obs key to keep the number of past occurrences. We\u2019re going to use it in the learning process.", "The decay parameter represents a memory of the model. A value one would mean the model has a perfect memory. If assigned with a value between zero and one the model would forget earlier observations and therefore adapt faster to changes in opponents behavior.", "As the input prediction, the model chooses the move with the highest probability, given the latest output-input pair.", "Below you can find the whole playing program:", "You can play with the algorithm:", "I have to warn you. This model would not perform well in the contest. It\u2019s just too elementary. Most of the risk-taking algorithms should be able to counter this strategy. You can see its performance under this link. It\u2019s only a place for you to start an adventure in the Rock-Paper-Scissors contest. You can modify parameters, train many models and choose the best to play, create ensembles. It\u2019s only up to your imagination. The best algorithms win around 80% of matches. You can check my over-70%-algorithm here. Can you do better?", "Note about Bayesian Inference in the RPS game. As I started to take part in the contest, I fought that the best solution would be a Bayesian one. Now I believe it\u2019s not a Bayesian problem. You can assess all the strategies because the input and output are simultaneous and therefore independent from each other. It nullifies one of the Bayesian Inference biggest strengths \u2014 a selection of the next algorithm to test.", "Are you going to take part in the contest? Do you have an idea for another approach? Let me know in the comment section or clap if you liked the article!", "Your home for data science.
