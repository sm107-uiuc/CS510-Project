In fact, Python has so many good math (NumPy), Statistics, data analysis libraries that it will probably be around for a quite long time. So dependency management can be a bit annoying, in other words, how can you find the libraries you need to a specific project making it shareable and portable? And why would we use a virtual environment?", "So the purpose of a virtual environment is to have space where we can install packages that are specific to a certain project, so for example, let\u2019s say you have a lot of Django web sites that use Django version 1, but you wanna start using Django version 2 in a new project, well, if you\u2019re just using single global environment then when you update to Django v2, it could break some of your old project that uses Django v1. So we don\u2019t want all of our projects pointing to a single instant of Django \u27f9 each project should have its own package separated from the others. One of the ways we accomplish this is through virtual environments.", "Just know that generally working in a virtual environment is best practice when you\u2019re using Python.", "So let\u2019s set up our environment:", "We first need to create a new directory (folder)", "Note: to list your installed packages you can type pip listin a command prompt (cmd).", "To create a virtual environment, we can simply type:", "Now if we try the pip list, we can see only pipand setuptools are installed. That\u2019s great, we can install certain packages in our specific environment.", "In this screenshot, I tried to install \u2018request\u2019, so the result is what we expected to get.", "First, we have to install the package:", "Now we can install any dependency in isolation.", "When you\u2019re using a Terminal to run your python script, we\u2019re used to type python filename.py, but there\u2019s another way to run your script, and that\u2019s with the interactive shell by adding -ibefore the filename. So we can call functions or variables to test and try things (kinda hot reloading)\u2026", "This can be very useful for developing things like bots.", "For example, let\u2019s consider this function:", "The Python debuggerset_trace() method can stop your file before it\u2019s finished executing so you can debug (it\u2019s the same as inserting a breakpoint).", "We\u2019ll get an error when we try to run this code. But let\u2019s say this code is huge and we don\u2019t know where the error is occurring. In that case, we can import the pdb module (built-in python) and call theset_trace() method to stop the execution of this code:", "Now we can do different things like, for example:", "You can check this cheat sheet via kapeli.com", "So this can help us identify where the code is breaking and we can even follow the debugger through complex multiple levels of functions calls.", "The great part is you can import pdb inline so you don\u2019t need to do it on top of the file.", "Modern debuggers are GUI-based, and typically either part of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), or an editing system with IDE capabilities. I recommend you use:", "We can create Python functions using the keyword def. Python offers us another way to create functions, which are extremely short because they are limited to a single instruction.", "Syntax: lambda arguments : expressionNote: A lambda function can take any number of arguments, but can only have one expression.", "Why use a lambda function instead of a named function?", "Lambda functions are generally used in a certain context, for which defining a function using def would less practical or longer. For example, if you wanted to define a function in your interactive shell and another probably more complex example is in list methods (or NumPy)that need a callback function, for example sorting, mapping and filtering.", "List comprehensions are very powerful tools allowing to use map and filter with a syntax closer to that usual in Python. In addition, they allow you to combine a map and a filter at the same time. The idea is simple: simplify the code to make it more readable and therefore faster to write and easier to maintain.", "Let\u2019s say we have this Userslist, and we would like to pull out a single property from an object, but to do that in conventional syntax we have to write at least 3 lines, with list comprehension we can make it only in one line.", "We can also filter the list, adding a conditional statement in the end:for example: if the name starts with an \u2018A\u2019 then we add it to the new list.", "It\u2019s kinda similar to \u2018List comprehension\u2019.", "Let\u2019s extract a dictionary from the Userslist that has a user name as a key, and the salary as a value. Normally, we have to loop into the list items manually, but in this case, we can just make it one line.", "Your home for data science.
