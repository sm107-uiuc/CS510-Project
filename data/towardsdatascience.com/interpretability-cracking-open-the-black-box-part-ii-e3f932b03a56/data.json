Now let\u2019s dig deeper into the post-hoc interpretation techniques which is useful when you model itself is not transparent. This resonates with most real world use cases, because whether we like it or not, we get better performance with a black box model.", "For this exercise, I have chosen the Adult dataset a.k.a Census Income dataset. Census Income is a pretty popular dataset which has demographic information like age, occupation, along with a column which tells us if the income of the particular person >50k or not. We are using this column to run a binary classification using Random Forest. The reasons for choosing Random Forest are two fold:", "Now let\u2019s look at techniques to do post-hoc interpretation to understand our black box models. All through the rest of the blog, the discussion will be based on machine learning models(and not deep learning) and will be based on structured data. While many of the methods here are model agnostic, since there are a lot of specific ways to interpret deep learning models, especially on unstructured data, we leave that out of our current scope.(May be another blog, another day.)", "A Random Forest algorithm was tuned and trained on the data with 83.58% performance. It is a decent score considering the best scores vary from 78\u201386% based on the way you model and test set. But for our purposes, the model performance is more than enough.", "This is by far the most popular way of explaining a tree based model and it\u2019s ensembles. A lot of it is because of Sci-Kit Learn and its easy to use implementation of the same. Fitting a Random Forest or a Gradient Boosting Model and plotting the \u201cfeature importance\u201d has become the most used and abused technique among Data Scientist.", "The mean decrease in impurity importance of a feature is computed by measuring how effective the feature is at reducing uncertainty (classifiers) or variance (regressors) when creating decision trees within any ensemble Decision Tree method(Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, etc.).", "The advantages of the technique are:", "Sci-kit Learn implements this by default in the \u201cfeature importance\u201d in tree based models. So retreiving them and plotting top 25 features is very simple.", "We can also retrieve and plot the mean decrease in impurity of each tree as a box plot.", "Let\u2019s take a look at what fnlwgt and random are.", "Now, surely, these features cannot be more important than other features like occupation, work_class, sex etc. If that is the case, then something is wrong.", "Of course\u2026 there is. The mean decrease in impurity measure is a biased measure of feature importance. It favours continuous features and features with high cardinality. In 2007 Strobl et al [1] also pointed out in Bias in random forest variable importance measures: Illustrations, sources and a solution that \u201c the variable importance measures of Breiman\u2019s original Random Forest method \u2026 are not reliable in situations where potential predictor variables vary in their scale of measurement or their number of categories.\u201d", "Let\u2019s try to understand why it is biased. Remember how the mean decrease in impurity is calculated? Each time a node is split on a feature, the decrease in gini index is recorded. And when a feature is continuous, or have high cardinality, the feature may be split many more times than other features. This inflates the contribution of that particular feature. And what does our two culprit features have in common- they are both continuous variables.", "Drop Column feature importance is another intuitive way of looking at the feature importance. As the name suggests, it\u2019s a way of iteratively removing a feature and calculating the different in performance.", "The advantages of the technique are:", "Let\u2019s do a 50 fold cross validation to estimate our OOB score. (I know it\u2019s excessive, but let\u2019s keep it to increase the samples for our boxplot) Like before, we are plotting the mean decrease in accuracy as well as the boxplot to understand the distribution across cross validation trials.", "As expected, the fnlwgt was much less important that we was led to believe from the Mean Decrease in Impurity importance. The high position of the random perplexed me a little bit and I re-ran the importance calculation considering all one-hot features as one. i.e. dropping all the occupation columns and checking the predictive power of the occupation. When I do that, I can see random and fnlwgt rank lower than occupation, and workclass. At the risk of making the post bigger than it already is, let\u2019s leave that investigation for another day.", "So, have we got the perfect solution? The results are aligned with the Mean Decrease in Impurity, they make coherent sense, and they can be applied to any model.", "The kicker here is the computation involved. To carry out this kind of importance calculation, you have to train a model multiple times, one for each feature you have and repeat that for the number of cross validation loops you want to do. Even if you have a model which trains under a minute, the time required to calculate this explodes as you have more features. To give you an idea, it took 2 hr 44 mins for me to calculate the feature importance with 36 features and 50 cross validation loops (which, of course, can be improved with parallel processing, but you get the point). And if you have a large model which is takes two days to train, then you can forget about this technique.", "Another concern I have with this method is that since we are retraining the model every time with new set of features, we are not doing a fair comparison. We remove one column and train the model again, it will find another way to derive the same information if it can, and this gets amplifies when there are collinear features. So we are mixing two things when we investigate \u2014 the predictive power of the feature and the way the model configures itself.", "The permutation feature importance is defined to be the decrease in a model score when a single feature value is randomly shuffled [2]. This technique measures the difference in performance if you permute or shuffle a feature vector. The key idea is that a feature is important, if the model performance drops if that feature is shuffled.", "The advantages of this technique are:", "The permutation importance is implemented in at least three libraries in python \u2014 ELI5, mlxtend, and in a development branch of Sci-kit Learn. I\u2019ve picked the mlxtend version for purely no other reason other than convenience. According to Strobl et al. [3], \u201c the raw [permutation] importance\u2026 has better statistical properties.\u201d as opposed to normalizing the importance values by dividing by the standard deviation. I have checked the source code for mlxtend and Sci-kit Learn and they do not normalize them.", "We also plot a box plot of all trials to get a sense of the deviation.", "Everything is hunky-dory in feature importance land? Have we got the best way of explaining what features the model is using for predictions?", "We know from life that nothing is perfect and neither is this technique. It\u2019s Achilles\u2019 Heel is correlation between features. Just like drop column importance, this technique is also affected by the effect of correlation between features. Strobl et al. in Conditional variable importance for random forests [3] showed that \u201c permutation importance over-estimates the importance of correlated predictor variables. \u201c Especially in ensemble of trees, if you have two correlated variables, some of the trees might have picker feature A and some others might have picked feature B. And while doing this analysis, in the absence of feature A, the trees which picked feature B would work well and keep the performance high and vice versa. What this will result in is that both the correlated features A and B will have inflated importance.", "Another drawback of the technique is that the core idea in the technique is about permuting a feature. But that is essentially a randomness which is not in our control. And because of this the results may vary greatly. We don\u2019t see it here, but if the box plot shows a large variation in importance for a feature across trials, I\u2019ll be wary in my interpretation.", "There is yet another drawback to this technique, which in my opinion is the most concerning. Giles Hooker et al. [6] says, \u201cWhen features in the training set exhibit statistical dependence, permutation methods can be highly misleading when applied to the original model.\u201d", "Let\u2019s consider occupation and education. We can understand this from two perspectives:", "Giles Hooker et al. [6] suggests alternative methodologies which combine LOOC and Permutation methods, but all the alternatives are computationally more intensive and does not have a strong theoretical guarantee of having better statistical properties.", "After identifying the highly correlated features, there are two ways of dealing with correlated features.", "N.B. The second method is the same method that I would suggest to deal with one-hot variables.", "During the discussion of both Drop Column importance and Permutation importance, one question should have come to your mind. We passed the test/validation set to the methods to calculate the importance. Why not train set?", "This is a grey area in the application of some of these methods. There is no right or wrong here because there are arguments for and against both. In Interpretable Machine Learning, Christoph Molnar argues a case for both train and validation sets.", "The case for test/validation data is a no-brainer. For the same reason why we do not judge a model by the error in the training set, we cannot judge the feature importance on the performance on the training set (especially since the importance is intrinsically linked to the error).", "The case for train data is counter-intuitive. But if you think about it, you\u2019ll see that what we want to measure is how the model is using the features. And what better data to judge that than the training set on which the model was trained? Another trivial issue is also that we would ideally train the model on all available data and in such an ideal scenario, there will not be a test or validation data to check performances on. In Interpretable Machine Learning[5], section 5.5.2 discusses this issue at length and even with a synthetic example of an overfitting SVM.", "It all comes down to whether you want to know what features the model relies on to make predictions or the predictive power of each feature on unseen data. For eg. if you are evaluating feature importance in the context of feature selection, do not use test data in any circumstances(there you are overfitting your feature selection to fit the test data)", "All the techniques we reviewed till now looked at the relative importance of different features. Now let\u2019s move slightly in a different direction and look at a few techniques which explore how a particular feature interact with the target variable.", "Partial Dependence Plots and Individual Conditional Expectation plots help us understand the functional relationship between the features and the target. They are graphical visualizations of the marginal effect of a given variable(or multiple variables) on an outcome. Friedman(2001) introduced this technique in his seminal paper Greedy function approximation: A gradient boosting machine[8].", "Partial Dependence Plots shows an average effect, whereas ICE plots show the functional relationship for individual observations. PD plots shows the average effect whereas ICE plots show the dispersion or heterogeneity of the effect.", "The advantages of this technique are:", "Let\u2019s consider a simple situation where we plot the PD plot for a single feature x, with unique values {x1,x2,\u2026..xk}. The PD plot can be constructed as follows:", "I have found the PD plots implemented in PDPbox, skater and Sci-kit Learn. And the ICE plots in PDPbox, pyCEbox, and skater. Out of all of these, I found PDPbox to be the most polished. And they also support 2 variable PDP plots as well.", "Let me take some time to explain the plot. On the x axis, you can find the values of the feature you are trying to understand, i.e. age. On the y axis you find the prediction. In case of a classification it is the prediction probability and in case of regression it is the real valued prediction. The bar on the bottom represents the distribution of training data points in different quantiles. It helps us gauge the goodness of the inference. The parts where the number of points are very less, the model has seen very less examples and the interpretation can be tricky. The single line in the PD plot shows the average functional relationship between the feature and target. All the lines in the ICE plot shows the heterogeneity in the training data, i.e. how all the observations in the training data vary with the different values of age.", "Now, let\u2019s also take an example with a categorical feature, like education. PDPbox has a very nice feature where it lets you pass a list of features as an input and it will calculate the PDP for them considering them as categorical features.", "PD plots can be theoretically drawn for any number of features to show their interaction effect as well. But practically, we can only do it for two, at the max three. Let\u2019s take a look at an interaction plot between two continuous features age and education(education and age are not truly continuous, but for lack of better example we are choosing them).", "There are two ways you can plot a PD plot between two features. There are three dimensions here, feature value 1, feature value 2, and the target prediction. Either, we can plot a 3-D plot or a 2-D plot with the 3rd dimension depicted as color. I prefer the 2-D plot because I think it conveys the information in a much more crisp manner than a 3-D plot where you have to look at the 3-D shape to infer the relationship. PDPbox implements the 2-D interaction plots, both as a contour plot and grid. Contour works best for continuous features and grid for categorical features", "This is also a very useful technique to investigate bias(the ethical kind) in your algorithms. Suppose if we want to look at the algorithmic bias in the sex dimension.", "The assumption of independence between the features is the biggest flaw in this approach. The same flaw which is present in LOOC importance and Permutation Importance. is applicable to PDP and ICE plots. Accumulated Local Effects plots are a solution to this problem. ALE plots solve this problem by calculating \u2014 also based on the conditional distribution of the features \u2014 differences in predictions instead of averages.", "To summarize how each type of plot (PDP,ALE) calculates the effect of a feature at a certain grid value v:Partial Dependence Plots: \u201cLet me show you what the model predicts on average when each data instance has the value v for that feature. I ignore whether the value v makes sense for all data instances.\u201dALE plots: \u201cLet me show you how the model predictions change in a small\u201dwindow\u201d of the feature around v for data instances in that window.\u201d", "In the python environment, there is no good and stable library for ALE. I\u2019ve only found one ALEpython, which is still very much in development. I managed to get a ALE plot of age, which you can find below. But got an error when I tried an interaction plot. It\u2019s also not developed for categorical features.", "This is where we break off again and push the rest of the stuff to the next blog post.
