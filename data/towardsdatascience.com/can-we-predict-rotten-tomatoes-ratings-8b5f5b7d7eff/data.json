This has led us to wonder if the movie reviews that you see online actually reflect the general public\u2019s opinions?", "When looking at IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, we see that both movie aggregator sites do not state how their movie rating percentages are calculated.", "We take all the individual ratings cast by IMDb registered users and use them to calculate a single rating. We don\u2019t use the arithmetic mean (i.e. the sum of all votes divided by the number of votes), although we do display the mean and average votes on the votes breakdown page; instead the rating displayed on a title\u2019s page is a weighted average.", "The Tomatometer score represents the percentage of professional critic reviews that are positive for a given film or television show. A Tomatometer score is calculated for a movie or TV show after it receives at least five reviews.", "The Audience Score, denoted by a popcorn bucket, is the percentage of all users who have rated the movie or TV Show positively.", "Initially, we were interested in understanding what features went into IMDb\u2019s weighted average, but their Conditions of Use prohibits data scraping. As a result, we worked with Rotten Tomatoes for the purposes of our project.", "We were most interested in answering two key questions.", "During our quest to see if we could create our own scoring mechanism, there were several steps we took.", "We manually selected about 150 movies that had Rotten Tomatoes Audience Scores ranging from 0\u2013100%. We aimed to get an even distribution of movie ratings across quartiles. Below demonstrates the distribution of movies falling into each of the quartile ranges. For consistency, we will refer to movies ranging from 0\u201325% as the first quartile, 26\u201350% as the second, 51\u201375% as the third, and finally 76\u2013100% as the fourth quartile.", "Distributions Across Tomatometer and Audience Ratings in Dataset: Observations", "One thing that we noticed while building our list of movies was that movies on Rotten Tomatoes rarely have an audience rating below 25%. As a result, you can see that while the number of movies with ratings in the upper three quartiles is relatively uniform, there is a notable disparity between the movie counts in the upper quartiles and that of the first quartile.", "We believe this lack of movies with very low audience ratings is due to the fact that audience ratings are being produced by a large quantity of Rotten Tomatoes users that have no authority or accreditation to rate movies. Anyone can go on to Rotten Tomatoes and give any movie a rating. Thus, the score could be skewed by those who give very high ratings simply because they enjoyed the movie. Or possibly, because these ratings are produced from all users, they more accurately portray the general publics opinion and people typically tend to like most movies and give them a higher rating.", "Interestingly enough, although our dataset was built by Audience Score, we notice a lower degree of variance across quartile counts for Tomatometer scores.", "We believe that this is because the Tomatometer rating is produced from legitimate, accredited movie and TV critics. These critics\u2019 profession is comparing and rating movies and thus, they are able to determine what in the movie industry is considered a \u201cbad\u201d or \u201cgood\u201d film. Because they are much more skilled in movie rating, we believe that these critics probably hold stronger opinions on movies and tend to rate a movie either very high or low depending on their opinion.", "Next, what information about the movie were we most interested in?", "Because accessing Rotten Tomatoes\u2019 API required approval, we turned to using BeautifulSoup to build our data set.", "There were two main steps in the process of gathering our data.", "An excerpt of score.py, which we used to scrape Audience Reviews from Rotten Tomatoes.", "We created a .csv file of our movie list and each of their corresponding URLs. We pulled the data we needed from each movie into a JSON data format, as shown to the left. We also added each movie into its corresponding rating quartile.", "We then loaded the data into the pandas dataframe, as shown above. We converted the list of strings containing the audience reviews for each movie into a single string. We then cleaned up the data by performing basic text pre-processing such as lower casing, punctuation removal, and stopwords removal. Beyond that, we also did lemmatization instead of stemming, as it converts the words into its root word rather than stripping the suffix.", "Now we needed to create our classifier to convert the string of audience reviews into a rating (we chose to rate it by quartile 1,2,3,4 rather than assign an exact rating in order to improve accuracy).", "We aimed to build a classifier that predicted which point range a given movie\u2019s rating fell in \u2014 or which quartile. For our initial dataset, we tried to scrape from a list of movies whose audience rating seemed uniformly distributed. We also limited the number of pages of audience reviews we scraped from to 20 so we could minimize the disparity between numbers of audience reviews for popular versus less popular films.", "In order to make the vectorizer, transformer, and classifier easier to work with, we used a scikit-learn Pipeline class which behaves like a compound classifier. Using a normal TF IDF with a naive bayes classifier, we were getting a 28% accuracy \u2014 very low. We realized this was because our classification was not binary, it was multi-class, which means it used multiple labels that were mutually exclusive. Therefore, we switched to a OneVsRest classifier, still using TF IDF. Our accuracy results were much better.", "As our graph demonstrates, our classifier was most accurate at predicting movies that would fall into the 2nd and 3rd quartiles of Tomatometer ratings.", "As our graph demonstrates, our classifier most accurately predicted movies that would fall into the 1st quartile of audience ratings.", "We figured that the audience reviews would always accurately predict the audience rating, which led us to be very surprised by these results. Thus, we have confirmed that our hypothesis that these movie ratings are not reflecting the general public\u2019s actual opinions. This has led us to believe that perhaps Rotten Tomatoes includes other factors into the Audience Rating that they are not disclosing.", "For the first and fourth quartiles, our classifier produced more accurate predictions for the audience rating. However, for the second and third quartiles, our classifier more accurately predicted the Tomatometer rating. Our classifier has shown us that using the audience reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, we were not consistently able to accurately predict the audience rating nor Tomatometer rating of these movies. So clearly, there are other factors being considered when determining the ratings displayed on the Rotten Tomatoes website.", "From our study, we are able to determine that the movie rating scores on Rotten Tomatoes, and most likely on other websites as well, are not accurately displaying the general public\u2019s opinion on the movie. Although we expected the Tomatometer to not match with the audience review\u2019s produced rating, we were surprised to see that the audience rating score also does not reflect the audience reviews.", "It was a very interesting exercise to see how well we could build our own movie rating mechanism based off of public reviews. Some notable words from audience movie reviews are shown in the word cloud below:", "We advise movie watchers to be wary of the movie ratings they see displayed on movie websites such as Rotten Tomatoes and IMDb. There is information incorporated into these scores that is not accurately reflecting people\u2019s genuine thoughts on the movie. These scores could be biased for a variety of reasons and could be influenced by Rotten Tomatoes in order to affect profits and viewings. We would like to continue this study to discover what these elements are that are being included in these scores and skewing them from accurately reflecting the population\u2019s opinions.", "If interested, feel free to check out our code here.
