It can run on multiple CPUs and GPUs", "Since machine algorithms run on huge data sets, it is extremely beneficial to run these algorithms on CUDA enabled Nvidia GPUs to achieve faster execution, due to thousands of compute cores.", "Its always a bit annoying and time consuming process to get a fast and constistent data science environment running. This is a step by step guide, helping you to install a Anaconda Environment with a runable GPU Kernel in a jupyter Notebook. There are other ways of making your GPU usable for Data Science, but this a very good option for beginners and Windows-User.Why should I use my GPU to compute in data science? Read this article if you dont know yet.", "We have to start with your hardware. This is quite important, because you will need a CUDA Toolkit compatible graphics processing card, such as a Nvidia GPU. To check if your GPU is supported, follow this link: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus and see if your GPU is on one of the lists. If you are not sure about what GPU you\u00b4ve got installed in your system, follow these steps:", "Check the Current Driver and Software Requirements", "After being sure your GPU supports CUDA Toolkit we have to install some tools in order to get the GPU running with tensorflow. As those tools are fast developing, its almost impossible to keep blogposts up to date version wise. So, I am trying to explain it as detailed as possible, without focusing on a specific version. Sounds complicated but isn\u2019t. Our second step after the hardware check is to open the tensorflow gpu website.", "A few scrolls down the page you will find a software requirements list.
