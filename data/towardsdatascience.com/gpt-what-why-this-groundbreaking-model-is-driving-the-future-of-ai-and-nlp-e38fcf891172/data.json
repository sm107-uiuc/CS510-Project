Those with early API access through OpenAI\u2019s beta program went to Twitter to showcase impressive early tools built using GPT-3 technology:", "For non-engineers, this may look like magic, but there is a lot to be unpacked here. In this article I will provide a brief overview of GPT and what it can be used for.", "OpenAI is an AI research laboratory founded in 2015 by Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and others with the mission of creating AI that benefits all of humanity. The company recently received $1 billion of additional funding from Microsoft in 2019 and is considered a leader in AI research and development.", "Historically, obtaining large quantities of labelled data to use to train models has been a major barrier in NLP development (and AI development in general). Normally, this can be extremely time consuming and expensive. To solve this, scientists have used an approach called transfer learning: use the existing representations/information learned in a previously-trained model as a starting point to fine-tune and train a new model for a different task.", "For example, suppose you would like to learn a new language \u2014 German. Initially, you will still think about your sentences in English, then translate and rearrange words to come up with the German equivalent. The reality is, you are still indirectly applying learnings about sentence structure, language, and communication from the previous language even though the actual words and grammar are different. This is why learning new languages is typically easier if you already know another language.", "Applying this strategy to AI means that we can use pre-trained models to create new models more quickly with less training data. In this great walkthrough, Francois Chollet compared the effectiveness of an AI model trained from scratch to one built from a pre-trained model. His results showed that the latter had 15% greater predictive accuracy after training both with the same amount of training data.", "In 2018, OpenAI presented convincing research showing that this strategy (pairing supervised learning with unsupervised pre-training) is particularly very effective in NLP tasks. They first produced a generative pre-trained model (\u201cGPT\u201d) using \u201ca diverse corpus of unlabeled text\u201d (i.e. over 7,000 unique unpublished books from a variety of genres), essentially creating a model that \u201cunderstood\u201d English and language. Next, this pre-trained model could be further fine-tuned and trained to perform specific tasks using supervised learning. As an analogy, this would be like teaching someone English, then training him or her for the specific task of reading and classifying resumes of acceptable and unacceptable candidates for hiring.", "GPT-3 is the latest iteration of the GPT model and was first described in May 2020. It contains 175 billion parameters compared to the 1.5 billion in GPT-2 (117x increase) and training it consumed several thousand petaflop/s-days of computing power. GPT-3 is fed with much more data and tuned with more parameters than GPT-2, and as a result, it has produced some amazing NLP capabilities so far. The volume of data and computing resources required makes it impossible for many organizations to recreate this, but luckily they won\u2019t have to since OpenAI plans to release access via API in the future.", "Admittedly, GPT-3 didn\u2019t get much attention until last week\u2019s viral tweets by Sharif Shameem and others (above). They demonstrated that GPT-3 could be used to create websites based on plain English instructions, envisioning a new era of no-code technologies where people can create apps by simply describing them in words. Early adopter Kevin Lacker tested the model with a Turing test and saw amazing results. GPT-3 performed exceptionally well in the initial Q&A and displayed many aspects of \u201ccommon sense\u201d that AI systems traditionally struggle with.", "However, the model is far from perfect. Max Woolf performed a critical analysis noting several issues such as model latency, implementation issues, and concerning biases in the data that need to be re-considered. Several users have reported these issues on Twitter as well:", "OpenAI\u2019s blog discusses some of the key drawbacks of the model, most notably that GPT\u2019s entire understanding of the world is based on the texts it was trained on. Case in point: it was trained in October 2019 and therefore does not know about COVID-19. It is unclear how these texts were chosen and what oversight was performed (or required) in this process.", "Additionally, the enormous computing resources required to produce and maintain these models raise serious questions about the environmental impact of AI technologies. Although often overlooked, both hardware and software usage significantly contribute to depletion of energy resources, excessive waste generation, and excessive mining of rare earth minerals with the associated negative impacts to human health.", "To quell concerns, OpenAI has repeatedly stated its mission to produce AI for the good of humanity and aims to stop access to its API if misuse is detected. Even in it\u2019s beta access form, it asks candidates to describe their intentions with the technology and the benefits and risks to society.", "Where do we go from here?", "Without a doubt, GPT-3 still represents a major milestone in AI development. Many early users have built impressive apps that accurately process natural language and produce amazing results. In summary:", "All said, I\u2019m extremely excited to see which new technologies are built on GPT-3 and how OpenAI continues to improve on its model. Increased attention and funding in NLP and GPT-3 might be enough to ward off fears from many critics that an AI winter might be coming (myself included). Despite the shortfalls of the model, I am hoping that everyone can be optimistic about a future where humans and machines will communicate with each other in a unified language and the ability to create tools using technology will be accessible to billions of more people.", "Your home for data science.
