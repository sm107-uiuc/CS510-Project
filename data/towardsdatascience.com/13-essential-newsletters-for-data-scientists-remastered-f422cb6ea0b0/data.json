Lots of newsletters. Like, too many newsletters. I can\u2019t help myself. When done right, newsletters are an excellent form of content curation that can help deliver interesting and insightful information to you with minimal effort on your part. Lucky for us, data newsletters are no exception to this rule.", "In this post, I\u2019ll outline why I think newsletters are such an awesome tool for continued growth in data science. More importantly, I\u2019ll lay out the data science and AI-focused newsletters that I look forward to most throughout the week.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that this post has been remastered from a previous post. More concretely, I\u2019ve added more newsletters, elaborated on each one with a small blurb, and cleaned up some structural things.", "Looking back on when I started out in data science, one of the first and most valuable things that I did was seek out tons of data newsletters. This forced me to stay on top of the latest news in the ever-changing realm of data science.", "It helped me learn techniques and technologies, introduced me to new concepts and learning resources that I wouldn\u2019t have known about otherwise and notified me when it came to networking opportunities, public tech talks, and job openings. Most importantly, it did this on a weekly basis.", "Consistently delivered content curation is invaluable in our current world of clickbait titles and fake news. The amount of information out there is overwhelming. Newsletters help solve this problem by differentiating between signal and noise for you. Why take the time to weed through thousands of posts and find the best ones when others will gladly do it for you?", "The following collection of newsletters is a perfect example of this. Ranging from data science to machine learning to artificial intelligence, the links delivered by these content curators can serve as a game-changer when it comes to your continued growth as a data scientist.", "So let\u2019s get onto the list, in no particular order.", "Data Science Weekly is definitely a fan-favorite, and for good reason. The newsletter started in 2013 and has pumped out 276 consistent issues since. It starts off with an Editor Picks section and quickly moves onto listing a bunch of data science articles and videos. Furthermore, it includes a section for job openings, tutorials, and books as well. Sent every Thursday, this one is well worth your time. Check out a recent issue.", "You have probably heard of O\u2019Reilly Media in one way or another. Personally, I have a collection of their books sitting on my desk at all times. They also publish ebooks, host conferences, and offer other learning solutions. Their data-focused newsletter delivers 10 links each week that range from news to tutorials to white-papers.", "Data Elixir takes a similar approach, breaking things down into a wide-ranging collection of weekly news, insights, tools & techniques, resources, and data visualization. The newsletter goes out to over 29,000 subscribers and is delivered every Tuesday. Check out a recent issue.", "Data Machina is a more technical newsletter that breaks down links by technology, hitting on topics from R to blockchain to algorithms. There\u2019s really a little bit of everything here. I subscribe to the free version, sent every two weeks but it looks like you can pay to receive the newsletter every week if you would like. Check out a recent issue.", "Mode offers a number of enterprise data solutions, but they also put out a pretty good data newsletter every week. They primarily focus on articles that catch their eye around the community but also include a section for featured data jobs as well. Check out a recent issue.", "As you might have guessed, Machine Learnings focuses on ML and AI news primarily. I particularly enjoy the Awesome and Not Awesome sections that give bite-sized news if you\u2019re in a rush. Others seem to like it as well, as the newsletter boasts 40,000+ subscribers. Check out a recent issue.", "Another newsletter that has been around for some time, The Data Science Roundup has 177 published issues and over 7,000 subscribers to date. This newsletter takes a more concise approach, offering 5 or so links each week with an insightful reflection written on each article. Check out a recent issue.", "Not a data science newsletter per se, but a valuable resource nonetheless. Like most people in tech, I love Hacker News. However, I had a hard time keeping up with it, until I found this. You can dictate the frequency and amount of links that are sent to you based on the number of upvotes on each post.", "This newsletter contains any recent blog posts, interviews, or news regarding Kaggle, everyone\u2019s favorite machine learning competition site. It also includes links, resources, meetups, and job openings around the community. I couldn\u2019t find a subscribe link for this one, pretty sure Kaggle automatically subscribes you when you make an account.", "Stratechery\u2019s Daily Update is a little different than the others in that it\u2019s a paid, daily membership. Not a traditional data science newsletter, these reports focus on tech strategy think-pieces. It\u2019ll run you around $10/month, a little less if you pay yearly. This is one of the few places where I gladly pay for written content, Medium being the other. There\u2019s also plenty of free essays available on the site. Check out this post and others to get a feel for it.", "Import AI leans heavily on technical machine learning and AI resources, often white-papers and recent research results. The issues also include an impressive amount of analysis. Even if none of that is your thing, make sure to read the Tech Tales section at the end for an always-interesting futuristic story. Check out a recent issue.", "Similar to Import AI, this newsletter covers technical machine learning and AI tutorials, projects, research papers, and news. Delivered a bit sporadically, The Wild Week in AI has over 17,000 subscribers if that\u2019s any indication of the content. Check out a recent issue.", "Data Is Plural is delivered weekly, focusing solely on interesting datasets for you to explore or use in your next side-project. There\u2019s also a pretty awesome Google doc that serves as the archive for all these datasets dating back to 2015. Check out a recent issue.", "Last but not least, the team at Towards Data Science puts out both weekly and monthly digests of the most popular posts on the publication. You can receive these emails by accepting Letters from TDS if you go to the dropdown found on their homepage. Check out a recent issue.", "That brings our list to an end, for now at least. I\u2019ll be on the lookout for more worthwhile data science newsletters out there. Feel free to light up the comments section with other must-have data newsletters out there that I may have missed.", "I know that these newsletters helped me immensely during my journey to data scientist and continue to help me grow and improve today. I hope they can provide you with some value as well.", "Thanks for reading! Feel free to check out some of my similar essays below and subscribe to my newsletter to receive any new content.", "You can follow me on Medium for more posts like this and find me on Twitter as well. For more on me and what I\u2019m up to, check out my website.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Product at Metabase.
