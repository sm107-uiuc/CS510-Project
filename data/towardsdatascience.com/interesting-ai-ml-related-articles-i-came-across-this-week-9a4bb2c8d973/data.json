I would like to thank these writers on Medium for producing quality content that sparks inspiration and guidance\u2026and much-needed distraction.", "It was only a matter of time before someone used AI to generate sex poems; my only surprise is that someone didn\u2019t do this earlier. Benjamin Davis has ventured where few have. Although AI producing poetic or novel like content is not unheard of.", "Benjamin has tapped into the power of the previously deemed too powerful to release GPT2 AI model.", "By feeding short phrases to the interface presented in the site TalkToTransformer, Benjamin has generated a series of poems and creative writing that\u2019s entirely made by AI.", "By feeding the AI system with phrases that follow the pattern Sex is __, Benjamin uncovers feedbacks from the system that are rather jaw-dropping at times. It begs the question: what training data was used to train this AI system, Fifty shades of Grey?", "Providing provocative phrases to AI that results in a series of interesting imaginative, novel-like and poetic constructs, that almost seems to emit some aspect of human intuition and creativeness.

It\u2019s these cycles within the learning process that Ken\u2019s article elaborates upon.", "The four of the five presented learning stages focuses on the competence levels of a learner and ends at the rather rare \u2018mastery\u2019 level.", "I\u2019m glad Ken opens up the article by speaking on the naiveness and ignorance of new learners that believe the entirety of data science can be crammed into a course or two and viola you are a data scientist!", "Thinking that data science or any machine learning field can be rushed is an idea that a lot of individuals fall victim to, including me.", "By including his own experience through each learning stage, Ken supplements each stage with tips and advice for preserving in moments of hardship and progressing to the next stage.", "Tips presented in this article range from advising learners to remember their purpose for learning; maintaining consistency, and focus on just essential skills. This advice is relevant, even for experienced data scientists.", "This article is a good read for Data Scientists of all level. And if you are more of a visual person that enjoys YouTube videos, then here\u2019s a link that covers the content of this article.", "Jonathan Hui is a renowned writer on Medium within Artificial Intelligence and Deep learning domain. His latest article is based on the recently released YOLOv4, a state of the art approach to object detection.", "For those who might be unaware, object detection is a common computer vision task that involves developing a system that can recognize contents such as cats, dogs, cars, within an image or series of images.", "Jonathan\u2019s article is a breakdown of the ideas and techniques leverage within the YoloV4 object detection technique. He touches on the fundamental makeup of the neural network architecture while providing an explanation where necessary. The article is rich in images and diagrams that assist in the illustration of neural network architectural designs.", "This is an article that provides both information and some essential definition of deep learning terminologies and concept you are bound to come across in other states of the art techniques such as Dense blocks, Spatial pyramid pooling layers, regularization techniques etc.", "This article might take a while for the average deep learning practitioner to get through, but it\u2019s one to revisit and save to your reading list.", "What better ways to show off your data science and analytics skills than using Medium writers as a case study.", "Martin Andersson Aaberge has managed to capture the attention of both the data science and writing community within Medium, through the clever utilization of specific Medium writer\u2019s statistics and metrics.", "Martin presents a data-backed formula for creating successful articles on Medium based on data points aggregated and analyzed from some popular Medium writers such as Zulie Rane, Tim Denning and Shannon Ashley.", "Equipped with Python and some visualization tools, Martin focuses on data points such as a writer\u2019s interests, headline word count, post read time and publishing frequency. All this data point provide a personal \u2018Magic Formula\u2019 for the ideal article for each writer.", "Perhaps Martin could create a web interface that provides easy access to the functionalities of his program.", "The article was published in the Better Marketing publication. Still, I can\u2019t help but think that with some exposure to the code implementation of the data analysis method within the article, it would find a home in the Towards Data Science publication. I\u2019m sure the data science community will be inspired by this creative method of showcasing one\u2019s skills.", "This article is not poised as a machine learning or data science article, but the feat of Martin\u2019s program is impressive enough to inspire data scientists to explore more creative approaches to data analysis.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
