The prosecutor argues that you are guilty because the odds of finding this evidence given that you are innocent are so small that the jury should discard the probability that you did not actually commit the crime.", "But those numbers don\u2019t add up. The prosecutor has misapplied conditional probability and neglected the prior odds of you, the defendant, being guilty before they introduced the evidence.", "The prosecutor\u2019s fallacy is a courtroom misapplication of Bayes\u2019 Theorem. Rather than ask the probability that the defendant is innocent given all the evidence, the prosecution, judge, and jury make the mistake of asking what the probability is that the evidence would occur if the defendant were innocent (a much smaller number):", "To illustrate why this difference can spell life or death, imagine yourself the defendant again. You want to prove to the court that you\u2019re really telling the truth, so you agree to a polygraph test.", "Coincidentally, the same man who invented the lie detector later created Wonder Woman and her lasso of truth.", "William Moulton Marston debuted his invention in the case of James Alphonso Frye, who was accused of murder in 1922.", "For our simulation, we\u2019ll take the mean of a more modern polygraph from this paper (\u201cAccuracy estimates of the CQT range from 74% to 89% for guilty examinees, with 1% to 13% false-negatives, and 59% to 83% for innocent examinees, with a false-positive ratio varying from 10% to 23%\u2026\u201d)", "Examine these percentages a moment. Given that this study found that a vast majority of people are honest most of the time, and that \u201cbig lies\u201d are things like \u201cnot telling your partner who you have really been with\u201d, let\u2019s generously assume that 15% of people would lie about murder under a polygraph test, and 85% would tell the truth.", "If we tested 10,000 people with this lie detector under these assumptions\u2026", "The important distinctions to know before we apply Bayes\u2019 Theorem are these:", "What the polygraph examiner really wants to know is not P(+|L), which is the accuracy of the test; but rather P(L|+), or the probability you were lying given that the test was positive. We know how P(+|L) relates to P(L|+).", "To figure out what P(+) is independent of our prior knowledge of whether or not someone was lying, we need to compute the total sample space of the event of testing positive using the Law of Total Probability:", "That is to say, we need to know not only the probability of testing positive given that you are lying, but also the probability of testing positive given that you\u2019re not lying (our false positive rate). The sum of those two terms gives us the total probability of testing positive. That allows us to finally determine the conditional probability that you are lying:", "The probability that you\u2019re actually lying, given a positive test result, is only 45.68%. That\u2019s worse than chance. Note how it differs from the test\u2019s accuracy levels (81% true positives and 71% true negatives). Meanwhile, your risk of being falsely accused of lying, even if you\u2019re telling the truth, is also close to-indeed, slightly higher than-chance, at 54.32%. Not reassuring.", "Marston was, in fact, a notorious fraud.", "The Frye court ruled that the polygraph test could not be trusted as evidence. To this day, lie detector tests are inadmissible in court because of their unreliability. But that does not stop the prosecutor\u2019s fallacy from creeping in to court in other, more insidious ways.", "This statistical reasoning error runs rampant in the criminal justice system and corrupts criminal cases that rely on everything from fingerprints to DNA evidence to cell tower data. What\u2019s worse, courts often reject the expert testimony of statisticians because \u201cit\u2019s not rocket science\u201d-it\u2019s \u201ccommon sense\u201d:", "The data in Ben Geen\u2019s case are available thanks to Freedom of Information requests \u2014 so I have briefly analyzed them.", "The most comparable hospitals to the one in which Geen worked are large hospitals that saw at least one case of respiratory arrest (although \u201c0\u201d in the data most likely means \u201cmissing data\u201d and not that zero incidents occurred).", "The four hospitals that are comparable to the one where Geen worked are Hexham, Solihull, Wansbeck, and Wycombe. The data for Solihull (for both CardioED and RespED) are extremely anomalous:", "After accounting for the discrepancies in the data, we can calculate that respiratory events without accompanying cardiac events happen, on average, roughly a little under 5 times as often as cardiac events (4.669 CardioED admissions on average per RespED admission).", "The average number of respiratory arrests per month unaccompanied by cardiac failure is approximately 1\u20132, with large fluctuations. That\u2019s not particularly rare, and certainly not rare enough to send a nurse to prison for life. (You can read more about the case and this data here and see my jupyter notebook here.)", "Common sense, it would seem, is hardly common \u2014 a problem which the judicial system should take much more seriously than it does.", "Your home for data science.
