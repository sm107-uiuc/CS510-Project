However, when we start dealing with business problems, it can become a bit chaotic: project goals are not always clear, problems require subjective inputs because there is no data available and executive management is not always keen on relying 100% on data to make decisions.", "To handle these situations, it is a good idea to adapt our mindset to this new environment and, most important, be able to speak the same language as your colleagues, by translating \u201cdata lingo\u201d to \u201cbusiness lingo\u201d. With this in mind, let\u2019s go through the basics of business, and how can you tackle business problems with data, while still being able to speak your mind in a way everyone understands.", "The goal of marketing is to sell as many products as possible, to as many people as possible, as many times as possible and at the highest possible possible, by finding your ideal target market, selecting the optimal price and determining strategies to address those customers.", "It looks like an optimisation problem, right? Well, not really. In practice, there are too many loose ends to properly address it: how do you define an ideal target market? How can you test different prices? How can you determine the strategies to address your customers? Which timeframe should you use?", "Thus, it is important to use domain-specific knowledge to come up with the specific questions, and use data to guide the process and come up with the answers. For example, to find your ideal price, it is not enough to test the reaction of demand to different prices and find the optimal spot: it is also a matter of branding, and how you want your product or service to be perceived when compared to competitors. If you work at Rolex, even if you notice that the demand for their watches is very sensitive to the price (every time you make promotions and give special discounts, the demand increases considerably), it is not necessarily a good strategy to lower the prices too much: you would make good profit for a while, and then people wouldn\u2019t perceive Rolex as such a high-end luxurious brand, losing a lot of its value.", "Understand that defining prices and target markets is not just optimising it in the short term, but knowing how customers perceive your product/service and how they would react to marketing strategy changes. How do you want your product to be perceived when compared to competitors? That is actually not a question that can be answered by data: it requires a subjective answer which will then determine how you will use data to address other questions.", "One key marketing concept you should be familiar with when defining a marketing strategy is the 4 P\u2019s: product, place, price, promotion.", "Another important concept is segmentation: the act of splitting your customers in different groups with some similar characteristics. For example you can split your customers into new and old or big and small, in terms of amount spent. A classical segmentation method is RFM, which segments customers using 3 dimensions: Recency (when was their last purchase?), Frequency (how often do they buy?) and Monetary Value (what is their average purchase amount?). These are usually subjective concepts, but you can also use classic clustering methods, such as K-Means, to find new segments. It is important to understand, however, that a data-driven segmentation method is not necessarily better than more subjective ones, and the best method will depend on your goals.", "Finally, you should understand the concept of a persona. By looking at the data, you can identify the average customer age, income and which sex is predominant. However, those numbers can be too abstract to be useful when creating product features or marketing strategies. That is why often marketing people refer to personae (plural of persona), a concrete way of dealing with those abstractions by turning them to \u201creal people\u201d. Instead of addressing white man, aged between 50 and 60 years who live in the countryside, you create a persona: Howard, 55 years old, a retired fireman who lives in Hainesville, Texas. It helps us get around statistical abstractions when imagining how our market will respond to different strategies.", "These concepts can help you frame your questions and see them as part of a broader system, before trying to answer them with data.", "Finance is actually simple in its core: it\u2019s all about making more money than you spend and, ideally, being able to postpone your costs and anticipate your revenues. The best way to control these two flows is accounting. Accounting is quite an old activity, and considered by some people as not very sexy. Still, it can benefit greatly from data science, in fields such as fraud detection and revenue forecasting.", "Revenue forecasting has been there for a while now and many companies still use outdated methods to forecast how much money they will make next year. This information is quite valuable, since businesses use it to determine their budgets: how much money to allocate to each department or project. Even though current methods are simple, they usually work better than more sophisticated methods, so there\u2019s still great room for improvement in this field.", "A few key concepts are profit margin, markup and opportunity cost.", "Profit Margin = (Revenue - Cost)/Revenue", "So if you have a profit margin of 10%, for each $100 of sales, $10 will actually become profit. Profit margin is how much of your revenue actually becomes profit.", "Companies sometimes use markup to determine prices: they take a desired markup of 30%, for example, and apply to the cost of a product to come up with the final price.", "Opportunity cost is what it costs to do something in terms of what else you could be doing instead. Imagine you work as a manager in a big company and are considering the possibility of taking a full-time MBA: it will have a direct cost related to tuition fees, books, etc., but it will also have an opportunity cost, since you will have to stop working for a year or too and will not have any salary for that period (nor will gain professional experience), which should also be taken into account when making your decision. Same goes for businesses: think, for example, of keeping cash. The more cash a business has, the more it is prepared for tough times such as a decrease in sales or unexpected costs. However, when this money is kept as cash, the company is missing the opportunity of investing it in financial products or in the business itself. Even having money in the bank has a cost, the cost of opportunity, so companies have to take this trade-off into consideration when deciding on cash levels.", "Business operations deals with everything that is needed for the company to deliver value to its customers, including optimising production, equipment placing, staffing, etc.", "There is a lot of optimisation going on here, which is not necessarily data science, but it can definitely use someone with mathematical knowledge. These departments usually think a lot in terms of processes and systems, and they want to make sure that processes run smoothly and as efficiently as possible.", "One useful concept here is Lean methodology, which originated in manufacturing and has expanded on to software development in the shape of the Agile methodology. So, everything you know about Agile software development can also be applied to traditional manufacturing, with constant iteration and improvement.", "Another famous methodology used for process optimisation is Six Sigma. It is out of the scope of this article to explain it in detail, but, generally speaking, Six Sigma is a set of data-driven techniques used to improve processes by reducing the variance of their outputs and, thus, making them more predictable. It was quite popular in the 80's and 90\u2019s and has its roots in using basic statistical methods to improve the quality of the business processes and operations, so it should be interesting for data scientists to read a bit more about it.", "Finally, another important concern from an operations point of view is the level of stocks. Most businesses have a stock of some sort, and stocks usually come with a trade-off: the more items you have in stock, the more prepared you are for unexpected events, such as a peak in demand. However, keeping too much stock has some costs such as the storage cost itself (the space and the maintenance) and the opportunity cost (discussed above), since the money used for excessive stock could be spent somewhere else.", "Business strategy is a high-level, broad subject, which encompasses a lot of different concepts and domains and it\u2019s quite hard to sum up. So, let\u2019s go through some key concepts and then talk about how it interacts with data science.", "Business strategy is usually defined as \u201ca company\u2019s high-level plan to reach specific goals\u201d, which is accurate, but quite vague. It goes from defining its price strategy, to what types of business the company will try to conquer, to which countries it will try to enter next year. However, all of these decisions should derive from the company\u2019s mission and vision statements and its core values. Its mission statements are the company\u2019s own raison d\u2019\u00eatre, it states why the company exists, who it serves, what is its purpose. As an example, take a look at IBM\u2019s mission statement:", "\u201cTo lead in the creation, development, and manufacture of the industry\u2019s most advanced information technologies, including computer systems, software, networking systems, storage devices, and microelectronics. And our worldwide network of IBM solutions and services professionals translates these advanced technologies into business value for our customers. We translate these advanced technologies into value for our customers through our professional solutions, services and consulting businesses worldwide.\u201d", "A company\u2019s vision statement, on the other hand, defines what are the company\u2019s goals for the future, what it expects to achieve in the next few years. Again, here is IBM\u2019s vision statement:", "\u201cTo be the world\u2019s most successful and important Information Technology Company. Successful in helping out customers apply technology to solve their problems. Successful in introducing this extraordinary technology to new customers. Important, because we will continue to be the basic resource of much of what is invested in this industry.\u201d", "Finally, the company\u2019s core values remind everyone what is important for that company, to guide important decisions. IBM\u2019s values are the following:", "\u201cDiversity and inclusion, innovation, being yourself, and focusing on change.\u201d", "All these three concepts are defined when a company does its strategic planning (usually at an executive level), but small businesses can also define them, usually first on their business plans, which are a tool used by entrepreneurs to help them define not only their strategy when they have a business idea, but also to layout their planning for every business area, including financial forecasts, to check if their idea actually looks viable. Business plans are sometimes requested by banks when an entrepreneur comes asking for a loan to start their businesses.", "Some people believe, however, that business plans are outdated tools, that do not represent reality, especially for startups. A much more popular tool (with different goals, though) for small tech companies is a business model canvas, which is essentially a graphical representation of how that company delivers value, to whom, and how it can be financially viable.", "To make strategic decisions, executives might require a lot of data, but usually, it\u2019s not complicated stuff: they rely a lot on business intelligence and simple Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), that show how the business is going, promising markets, high-performance departments, etc. It\u2019s more important to choose the right numbers to look at and how to interpret them than to perform complex statistical transformations (even though this might induce error sometimes).", "The concepts presented here can help you communicate better with different departments in your company, to understand what they are saying and also to better frame your ideas in terms they will understand. They can also help you come up with better ideas in general, by having a better understanding of the business as a whole.", "Finally, I hope it has inspired you to do more research on business or on some of these specific topics. Not many data scientists understand businesses as a whole, so understanding the basics can really help you create value for your company.", "To help you continue your research, here is a list of a few books that can help you learn in more detail some of the topics discussed here:", "Your home for data science.
