In the past decade, they have proven their usefulness in tons of cases, from social media networks to fraud detection to recommendation engines. The true strength of graph databases is the ability to efficiently represent the relationships between pieces of information. This especially applies to data that is highly connected, like hospital records.", "In this blog, I\u2019ll be walking through an example of how we take healthcare data stored in a graph database and visually show a sample of that information in 3D. Because of the large number of connections, 2D network graphs can quickly become cluttered and unreadable; however, these issues can be handled by changing our perspective. In cases where the 2D option fails, 3D graphs provide an expansive view of the data that is much easier on the eyes.", "Since the data is stored in a graph database, it only makes sense to visualize it with a graph. That way, all we have to do is translate the connections that already exist in the database into something visible.", "With that background, let\u2019s start making our 3D graph masterpiece!", "The full code for this blog can be found on my Github.", "The graph database I used for this project was built on TigerGraph using synthetic patient data generated by a neat, open-source program called Synthea. If you are unfamiliar with Synthea, check out this short blog I wrote or have a look at their website.", "If you\u2019re interested in seeing the process I used to design this healthcare network, check out my last blog post.", "Otherwise, feel free to design your own graph or use a premade one. TigerGraph has tons of tutorials and examples that can help you design your own graph. Optionally, you can reference an article I wrote that takes you through the general graph design process.", "Everything I mention from this point on can be done with any graph.", "To access our graph, we\u2019ll use the pyTigerGraph Python connector created by Parker Erickson. After installing and importing the package, you can connect to your graph server using the following code:", "If you don\u2019t have a token, you can create one with a secret.", "Next, run an installed query to grab data from the graph.", "Here\u2019s the query. It grabs all patients as well as all edges and vertices immediately connected to those patients.", "When we run our query, it returns a lot of information. We could try to graph all of the data coming in (essentially graphing the majority of the healthcare touchpoints for these patients), but our graph would end up looking very messy. So, we\u2019ll just grab a subsection of our data.", "I chose to select the patients, their addresses, and any allergies or imaging studies they\u2019ve had in their lifetime.", "This code may be confusing, so let\u2019s dissect what\u2019s going on.", "With that, the data is now good to go!", "In order for our JavaScript functions to receive the graph data from Python in real-time, we need to set up a server. We\u2019ll do this using Flask. All we have to do is wrap the functions we\u2019ve already created in the Flask web server structure. The full Python code should now look something like this:", "The python part of this project is now complete!", "The heart of this visualization is the 3D-Force-Graph package. Built on top of ThreeJS and WebGL, this package makes generating force-directed graphs very simple.", "Like most web apps, this network graph visualization was built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Let\u2019s take a look at each of those components individually.", "The HTML for this project is pretty straightforward.", "Let\u2019s again break down this code into smaller steps.", "Most likely, you will run into a CORS error if you try and run this code as-is.", "You can read about CORS issues here. To solve this, you need to specify response headers that will allow the data to flow. I fixed this using the Moesif Origin and CORS Changer extension for Google Chrome. This works great if you are running the program locally. However, if you want to deploy the graph, you will need to configure the appropriate settings on both Flask and JavaScript.", "That\u2019s all of the code. Now, all we have left to do is run the server and admire the graph in all of its glory.", "With not a lot of code, we gathered a lot of data stored in a graph database and created an awesome 3D visualization to show that data. We used TigerGraph to store the healthcare information, Python to extract and process our data, and JavaScript and HTML to create the 3D visual. The process isn\u2019t very complex but leads to super cool results. The methods shown in this blog can be used beyond the healthcare industry, too. Any field dealing with highly connected data can benefit from graphs, using the power of graph databases for storing information and the power of 3D network graphs for displaying information.", "I hope you enjoyed reading this blog and learned something new!
