MIT\u2019s GOSSIS community initiative, with privacy certification from the Harvard Privacy Lab, has provided a dataset of more than 130,000 hospital Intensive Care Unit (ICU) visits from patients, spanning a one-year timeframe. [Source]. Detailed description about challenge can be found here", "Looking Deeper Into Potential Data Issues As Following:", "Milestone # 1 : Identify Explicit Missing Values", "Milestone # 2 : Look Out For Implicit/Disguised Missing Values & Incorrect Data Values", "Milestone # 1 : Identify Explicit Missing Values", "So in our previous iteration, we have already looked upon distribution of missing values. This was an easy short as we were able to identify missing values encoded simply as NaNs. As simple as that!", "Milestone # 2 : Look Out For Implicit/Disguised Missing Values & Incorrect Data Values", "As a matter of fact, you should always look our for \u201cdisguised\u201d missing values in your dataset as well in order to ensure that missing values are encoded properly as missing i.e NaN to be more precise. A few disguised forms of missing values are described below:", "The problem is that to identify disguised missing values and potentially corrupt/incorrect data, you would nearly all the times rely on collaborating with the domain experts of the problem that you are trying to solve. In our case, the domain experts are medical practitioners butas its a Kaggle Dataset, possibility of collaborating with domain experts doesn't exist. But still a point to note!", "Luckily, we have been provided with data documentation which itself isnot detailed one and doesn't point to data issues as well but a quick EDA and skimming through the documentation revealed a lot many insights to me regarding disguised missing values and possibly incorrect data and this is what exactly I am going to focus on for next few minutes.", "It\u2019s evident above that we have a \u201cCategory\u201d for every attribute. Summarizing the above information for category wise distribution yields below graph:", "Above clearly shows what particular data types fall into what particular category. Considering that vitals, labs, & labs blood gas consist of numerical variables mainly, lets focus on them first.", "Exploring whether these variables consist of any zero values or not reveals:", "Additionally, going through the description of variables belonging to these 3 categories reveals that they relate to presence of specific chemicals inside the human body and it doesn't make sense that a \u201c0\u201d refers to a valid value itself in case a person is alive. This can be further validated by the domain knowledge (as provided in the documentation) by skimming through the description of these variables. For example for variables belonging to category of vitals:", "Data provided complies to patient\u2019s previous 24 hours and the values recorded don't correspond exactly to the time of patient\u2019s death. This points to two main insights:", "The trend above with bifurcation into hospital death==1 and hospital death==0 reveals that there is general lowering trend in case of \u201chospital_death\u201d==1. So this does support our second assumption that if hospital _death==1 , lowering trend is generally found.", "Next, for our first assumption, we need to zoom in a bit more for the values of exact \u201c0\u201ds. We could possibly look for an intersection of \u201c0\u201ds with values detected as outliers. This could further validate our notion that these \u201c0\u201ds are actually the missing values.", "Lets look into the general distribution of outliers for these variables", "Distribution of \u201c0\u201ds in Vitals\u2019 variables shows that the d1_heartrate_min & d1_resprate_min have most of the 0\u2019s values whereas d1_spo2_min & h1_resprate_min have comparatively lesser \u201c0\u201d\u2019s. Lets plot outlier distribution.", "Wow! So, the plot does show that for variables having relatively higher number of \u201c0\u201d\u2019s have higher count of \u201c0\u201d\u2019s as outliers as well! We can further validate our idea that \u201c0\u201ds are missing values by explicitly checking if all these \u201c0\u201ds are part of the total outliers set for each variable as well.", "Matching distribution of 0\u2019s of outliers with distribution of zeros in original dataset:", "\u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d columns correspond to hospital_death==0 and hospital_death==1. All \u201c0\u201ds in original dataset are found in outliers and match exactly!", "So uptill now, we have collected enough evidence that supports our argument that for above variables of vitals category, 0\u2019s are most probably the missing values.", "We are not 100% sure about joist notion but at the same time, we are not absolutely blind-spot as well!", "I would like to mention here that this is again something that stresses collaboration with domain experts and if it would have been the case that this problem was being dealt on-site, we could have an opportunity to validate our findings even more!", "And now, by encoding these \u201c0\u201ds as properly missing values \u201cnans\u201d, its always a good idea to reflect upon the change in data distribution.", "As expected, since d1_heartrate_min & d1_resprate_min had most number of \u201c0\u201ds, they have been changed the most.", "In this blog post, we confined to detailed analysis for variables belonging to vitals only. In next blog posts, we will be moving to other types of variables and continue with identifying and fixing other data issues. This is time consuming, but in the end, results will be worthy!", "If you have any thoughts, comments, or questions, feel free to comment below or connect \ud83d\udcde with me on LinkedIn", "Your home for data science.
