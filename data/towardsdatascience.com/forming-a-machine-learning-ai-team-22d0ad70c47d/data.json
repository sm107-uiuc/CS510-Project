Data Engineering, Web Development, Devops, Cloud architects etc are examples."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Enterprises are overwhelmed by the hype created around Machine Learning & Artificial Intelligence, yet I\u2019m sure no one wants to miss this bus and are striving to get their act together to build their own Data Science capability. But in their zeal to create a Machine Learning/AI team, the leadership must be careful not to forget other key ancillary and complementary skills that are needed as well. I\u2019d like to use this blog to touch upon those skills here so the decision makers can prepare for a holistic data science strategy.", "I remember when I was a kid in school, I was fascinated about astronauts that whenever someone asked me what I wanted to become when I grow up, I\u2019d say that I wanted to become an astronaut. Not just that, for some reason, I naively thought that everyone at NASA was an astronaut. But as I grew up I realized that astronauts were just one skill in the whole spectrum of skills needed at a successful space agency. This includes professionals like mechanical engineers, computer engineers, geologists, physicists, chemical engineers etc etc. So is the case while forming a successful data science team in an enterprise.", "Here\u2019s a high-level architecture of a data science system at Enterprise scale. Even though this may vary from enterprise to enterprise, this should give one a perspective of the diverse set of skills needed for this architecture to work. Let\u2019s dive into this architecture in little more detail.", "*The architecture is purely illustrative & actual implementations could vary depending on many factors", "Data Engineering(DE) layer is the foundational layer for a successful data science team and no Data Science strategy is complete without it. The core responsibilities of a Data Engineering team are as below", "With the explosion in volumes, variety & velocity, data sources abound and enterprises need to be ready to process any type of data, in any form and in any volumes. Typically the different sources of data for an enterprise can be broadly classified to be internal and external (based on source). Internal data would include \u2014 transaction systems, digital analytics data showing customer engagement metrics (sessions, average session duration etc), customer feedback & support metrics etc., CRMs etc. External data would include \u2014 social media data, consumer survey information, industry benchmark reports etc.", "DE team needs to identify all data that can be relevant to tackle both tactic and strategic needs of the enterprise and have a strategy to wrangle them as appropriate.", "Once identified, data from all these sources needs to be ingested onto an enterprise data lake or a data store of some kind. Ingestion must ensure data is refreshed on a periodic and consistent basis.", "Data ingested needs to be persisted in a form that supports both Business Intelligence (BI) requirements as well as Machine Learning(ML) & AI requirements among other data requirements of the organization. Typically most enterprises create a data mart/data warehouse that stores historical information about the enterprise operations and other types of data stores like a no SQL data store for catering to the data needs of high-performance downstream applications. Creation of these data structures is key to the success of the ML & AI teams as they source their data from these systems.", "Once data structures are created, they need to be maintained perineally in order to ensure that the data is getting refreshed in the ecosystem in a periodic and consistent manner", "Skills needed \u2014 Data Warehousing, NoSQL, ETL pipeline building, Big Data Ecosystem skills \u2014 Hadoop, Spark, Hive etc, Cloud \u2014 AWS/Azure data services", "Machine Learning (ML) layer is where all the action with regards to building ML capability lies. Some of the activities that you\u2019ll need to plan for in this layer would include the following.", "a) Model building & validation\u2014 Leverage data created by the data engineering layer to start building predictive models to model for events such as customer responses to email campaigns, customer propensity to buy a product, customer churn, forecasting models, recommendation engines etc.", "b) Model deployment \u2014 Once the model has been built and validated, its time to deploy it in production to reap the benefits for business. Models can be deployed to work in i) batch mode or ii) real-time mode. In batch mode, models are used to score on data at predetermined time intervals (usually after business hours) or scheduled to run at a preset frequency (every hour or 2 hours). This is usually a simpler design to handle. On the contrary, in a real-time mode, models are expected to score and return the results almost instantly in a near real-time basis. To implement a design such as this there needs to be a mechanism that\u2019ll take in a request for model inference and then return the results of the model back to the requesting application.", "In order to implement such an application usually, an ML API layer needs to be built using a server-side scripting language such as node.js or a flask. But if the production environment is managed on the cloud such as AWS, administering this has been simplified a lot than if it were managed on-prem.", "Skills needed \u2014 Machine Learning, Deep learning", "a) ML API \u2014 As briefly discussed in the previous section in order to enable the model to be used on a real-time basis or expose it for consumption by another application, its important to provide for an API layer in the architecture. This layer would house all the API functions that would take in a request for scoring the model and return the result object back to the calling application", "b) Data API \u2014 Extending the above concept to the data stores created by the data engineering layer, there is a need to create a Data API layer to handle requests for data pulls from the data stores by different consuming applications. Delineating a separate data API layer for this purpose would be a good design choice", "Skills needed \u2014 API Development, Web development \u2014 Node.js (or any similar scripting language), Cloud skills \u2014 AWS, Azure", "Finally, to deliver the model to the business user, its best to serve it up as a web application with an intuitive UI, than to pass it in its raw form which the user needs use from a command line interface. If you didn\u2019t get the latter part, don\u2019t worry about it because it's just as dull executing it as explaining it to someone and besides it's not at all intuitive.", "It has gotten easier to deploy the model as a web application these days on the cloud as there are existing frameworks that automatically handle a lot of the technical aspects of this design that the ML engineers need to focus just on building a great model and leave the rest to these frameworks.", "Skills needed \u2014Full stack web development", "Your home for data science.
