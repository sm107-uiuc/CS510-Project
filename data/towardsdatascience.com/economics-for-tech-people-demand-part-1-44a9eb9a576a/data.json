What is a curve? Why does the demand curve change? Why is it wrong to say that a change in price means a change in demand? What is the difference between demand and quantity demanded? What does elasticity even mean? How can I figure out the maximum total revenue?", "What we are going to do in this article is explore concepts in demand using R programming to analyze and visualize some realistic data I created in an Excel file.", "Structurally, we will use 10 hypothetical firms to analyze the demand for our hypothetical new Software as a Service (SaaS) application that charges a monthly fee per license. There is a good mix here of firms ranging from small to large with a diverse combination of what price they are willing to pay for how many licenses.", "We will then examine the market demand as well as break down the concept of demand elasticity in an attempt to find where we maximize total revenue.", "This is the first part of a multi-part series explaining economics in a technological context through project-based work.", "For this work, I am using RStudio on a Mac with an R Markdown (RMD) file.", "All the files can be downloaded from my GitHub here.", "Note: If you are on a Mac, DO NOT OPEN THIS FILE WITH NUMBERS. It will automatically change the encoding of the file, and R will not be happy with you. If it happens, delete that file and download a fresh copy of the Excel file.", "I am also assuming that you can manage to get an R environment setup on your local machine. It is best to put all your files in a single folder wherever you are mashing the buttons.", "Sometimes Excel files can be a little tricky to import with R.", "What I think is the simplest and least confusing way to do it using RStudio is to create a folder to use as a working directory on your machine, then click on the \u201cFiles\u201d tab as shown here:", "From there, click on the three dots (\u2026) all the way on the right edge. You can navigate to the folder where the data and R file are located on your machine.", "Next, click the \u201cMore\u201d button with a little drop down menu then click \u201cSet As Working Directory\u201d. That will help make the data import a little simpler and is a good habit to have because it makes managing code and files in RStudio simpler [1]. Here\u2019s what that looks like:", "With that done, go ahead and click on the actual text of \u201cDemand_Data.xlsx\u201d to import it from there with the \u201cImport Dataset\u2026\u201d option like this:", "That will bring up the readxl data import window like this:", "It should automatically work, but double check that the data looks good. Make sure the \u201cFirst Row as Names\u201d box is checked to avoid unnecessary code to wrangle that together properly. If you want to rename the data set something other than \u201cDemand_Data\u201d, now would be a good time to do so in order to avoid unnecessary code down the line. However, you should just leave it alone to follow along here.", "With that done, let\u2019s get to mashing some buttons!", "We will need the readxl and tidyverse libraries for this project. If you do not have them installed in your R environment, simply remove the \u201c#\u201d sign before the \u201cinstall.packages\u2026\u201d lines of code [1]. Once they are installed, you will not need to install them again on your machine.", "Let\u2019s check that the data came in okay. The code I have shows the way to read in the Excel file with code rather than button clicking. Make sure your Working Directory is set to the right place so you do not have to find the entire file path.", "We will use the head() function to check the first few rows look good.", "When working with economic data, it is always a good idea to just make a quick and dirty graph just to make sure that there is nothing weird going on. Remember, demand curves, with rare exception, trend down and to the right [2]. Let\u2019s just pick a random column of Quantity to plot and make sure it passes the smell test here.", "I know, it is not the prettiest graph you have ever seen. The point is that we have data that generally slopes down and to the right, which is what we want to see! Thank you Law of Demand [2]!", "Seeing one plot is great, but what about seeing all 10 of our individual demand curves at the same time? We will use the magic of ggplot to accomplish this.", "If there is one thing I have learned about ggplot over time it is that the entire package is temperamental and only likes data a very specific way. Rather than try to fight the system, we need to structure our data in a way that plays nice with ggplot\u2019s way of doing things.", "So, we are going to use the stack() function to do a really neat job of wrangling our data from its current form in 10 different columns to a much smaller and more ggplot appropriate form where price and quantity data is labeled by Qd_# in 2 small columns of glory.", "While we\u2019re at it, we will go ahead and combine it into a single data frame with the price data to make a third column automatically putting the right price data with the right quantity and label data.", "Finally, we\u2019ll change the column names from the ones generated by the stack() function to make them a little more appropriate for our project.", "With that accomplished, we can much more easily use the facet_wrap() function with a few styling parameters to elegantly show all the individual demand curves.", "There is a lot to unpack here! Let\u2019s think about what these 10 plots of individual demands mean for us in our project of selling SaaS license subscriptions.", "One observation that stands out to me is that many firms are not really buying many if any units above $5\u20136. As the price gets lower, most firms start to buy quite a lot more licenses. Some aren\u2019t really buying many licenses no matter what the price is like firms 4, 8, and 10.", "Others like firms 6, 7, and 9 are buying a lot of licenses and buying a lot more as the price goes down.", "One of the fundamental concept is that individual firms have individual demands [2]. Some organizations simply value our SaaS application more than others, and lowering our price may not have much of an impact on their purchasing decision [2].", "As a seller of monthly licenses, we need to be worried about the market demand. Let\u2019s take a look at that.", "The simplest definition for market demand is that it is the sum of all the individual firms\u2019 demand curves [2]. This means that if we have 10 firms in our market, adding up all the quantities demanded and each price will give us the market demand curve [2].", "Let\u2019s take a look at how to assemble that.", "Visualizing our data can be done with a little help from ggplot() by just plotting the sum of our quantities demanded for each price.", "When I look at this, I notice instantly that in certain ranges of this market demand curve that a change in price is not going to yield the same change in quantity demanded by the market at every point on the curve because it is not linear [2].", "Visually inspect this, I see four distinct regions where we have similar slopes. Let\u2019s take a look at that next and introduce the concept of elasticity.", "Elasticity of demand is simply the idea of seeing how the combination of prices and quantities change between two points on a curve [2]. It can be mathematically stated as the percent change in quantity divided by the percent change in price [3].", "In plain language, we are looking for the slope between two points just like we would using the classic y = mx + b formula from high school algebra class by looking specifically at that m value.", "The business question from our point of view is:", "By how much does the quantity demand change for each unit of price change?", "What I did to illustrate the point is ranges of prices different elasticity zones. It might not be the most formal way in the world to do this, but you can really see that different areas along the market demand curve have different slopes in various ranges.", "From a programming in R with ggplot point of view, it is really important to put the vector of numbers inside the as.character() function so that ggplot will automatically know that these are categorical values and not numbers to use for math [1]. We will see this in action in the next plot.", "While ggplot can be frustrating at times, it does offer some great features. We are going to add on to our previous market demand code by adding color = Elasticity_Zone to the aes() function so that ggplot knows to assign a different color to each zone [1].", "We also will add the geom_smooth() function with the method = \u201clm\u201d parameter to have it make linear models for each elasticity zone [1]. We will make some dedicated models a little later to delve into that a bit further. For right now, this is clearly showing that different sections of the demand curve can have quite different slopes and elasticity numbers.", "While using linear models inside of the ggplot is great for visualization, we need to make some dedicated models to get precise slopes to compare the elasticity of each section in a meaningful way.", "To do that, we will use the lm() function to create linear models. There are many ways to do this and filter the data, but the goal here is to be as explicit and readable as possible.", "We will be doing the same basic process four times", "Now that we have some detailed summary statistics for the linear models for each Elasticity Zone, we need to interpret the results in the context of the project.", "Just like with any linear model, we want to check that our model is of high enough quality to make a reliable interpretation. That means checking that all the p-values are statistically significant and that the R-squared values are as close to 1 as possible [1].", "When we look at the Coefficients section of the output of each model and in the \u201cPr(>|t|)\u201d column, we see that the coefficient of Price is a number that is smaller than 0.05 in all four models. That means that we can be at least 95% sure that our results are not due to chance [1]. In fact, we can be at least 99% sure that the relationship between price and quantity demand is not due to chance because all the p-values in this column are smaller than 0.01 [1].", "Depending on who you ask, .7 and higher for either Multiple or Adjusted R-squared is pretty good [1]. R-squared measures how much of the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable(s) in the model [1]. In all four cases, we see we are explaining 99%+ of our dependent variable [1].", "With that in mind, we want to look at the \u201cPrice\u201d row in in the \u201cEstimate\u201d column for our slope value [1]. While it technically would be better to switch the price and quantity around to be more proper, it is easier to understand like this and really gets us to the same place for business purposes anyway [3].", "Let\u2019s just take a look at the last model of Zone 4. Here\u2019s how you should read that:", "As the price decreases by 1 unit, the quantity demanded increases by 540.4 units.", "This aligns with the Law of Demand because as we lower our price, more units are demanded [2].", "Once we know that everything is significant and does a good job of explaining the results, let\u2019s make a comparison of results based on solid evidence.", "The simplest way to do this is going to be creating a little table with the slope coefficients pulled out from the summary statistics.", "We will do this by making a data frame with labeled columns and viewing the output of the summary statistics as a table. The \u2026coefficients[2,1]\u2026 part of the model is navigating through the output to get the second row and first column of the output of the summary statistics, which is the slope value [1]. Finally, we will round the results to 2 decimal places for our sanity and general readability.", "Again, yes, I understand that is not technically a bunch of slopes in a purely mathematical sense [3]. It is really how much the quantity demanded changes per unit of price change [3]. It is just much easier to understand the idea this way.", "Now it is time to quickly update the Market Demand plot from earlier by annotating the change in Quantity Demanded per unit of price so it is clear what is happening. We will need to paste some text and numbers together, position the text appropriately, and use the abs() function to get the absolute value of the numbers so they positive and easier to read.", "So what does this all really mean?", "When prices are high, the market is relatively more inelastic than when prices are really low [2]. We get a much smaller effect in terms of number of subscriptions demanded when we move from a price of $10 to $9 than we do from $2 to $1 where the curve is relatively more elastic [2]. In fact, it is almost a 14x difference in number of subscriptions demanded going from a point in zone 1 to a point in zone 2.", "The real question we need to ask here is:", "How does this help us find where we would maximize total revenue?", "Good question! Let\u2019s quickly find out.", "First, we need to create a column to our market data that simply multiples price by quantity demanded to get total revenue [2].", "Let\u2019s make a plot to see where total revenue gets maximized.", "Looking at the chart, we see that a price of $2.50 is where the maximum total revenue given our market demand data, which is the third elasticity zone. What this means is that as we raise the price from free to $2, we keep increasing revenue [2]. We maximize total revenue at a price of $2.50 with a total revenue of $1,850 [2]. As we continue raising the price from $3 and up, we actually make less revenue [2]!", "The result of this story is that it pays to understand the market. We started off gathering data about individual firms in the market for our SaaS subscription. What were they willing to buy at each price? We then combined that into market data. It is interesting to uncover that demand curves are not always straight lines. In different ranges of the curve, small price changes can have a range of effects on number of units demanded and, as we saw at the end, in terms of maximum total revenue.", "As I noted at the beginning of this article, this is the first part of many parts explaining economic concepts in an easy to digest way specifically for technology people.", "I hope you enjoyed this article.
