And health care services and medications for heart disease costs the US nearly $200 billion every year.", "So half a million lives gone and $200 billion dollars spent", "for heart disease. (in the US alone)", "In 2030, the American Heart Association projects that the costs involved in treating heart disease will rise to $818 billion. And 116 million people in the US will have some form of cardiovascular disease.", "Half of the problem is genetics. People are born with genetic mutations that increase their likeliness of developing heart disease. Unfortunately, we can\u2019t control this right now but with gene editing technologies like CRISPR, we may be able to prevent this in the future.", "The other half of the problem is poor lifestyle. People make poor decisions on a daily basis that cause heart disease.", "We can break these factors into four categories.", "There\u2019s one thing in common with all of these factors. They\u2019re all in our control. We get to decide whether we want to exercise, smoke and maintain a healthy diet. This is a choice. And thus, the deaths from these factors could have been prevented if those people made smarter decisions.", "And to make an informed decision, people need information.", "First, a quick recap. We know a lot of people are dying from heart disease and that half of these deaths could potentially be prevented if people made better lifestyle choices. So how do we do this?", "Using a subset of Artificial Intelligence called Machine Learning, we can predict someone\u2019s likeliness of having heart disease before they die from it. If people know their likeliness of having a fatal disease, this will encourage them to make smarter lifestyle choices. Thus reducing the number of people who die from heart disease.", "We can use a machine learning algorithm to take in information and classify if a person is likely to have heart disease.", "Using the Cleveland Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, I tried this out myself.", "The model took in 13 different data points about each person.", "Here is a layman\u2019s explanation of what a Support Vector Machine does.", "An SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that performs classification tasks. In plain English, it uses labelled data to differentiate between classes of inputs.", "Here is an analogy for how it works.", "You\u2019re a teacher at a middle school. One day, you\u2019re patrolling the middle school grounds, making sure everybody is safe and sound. All of a sudden, a fight breaks out between the sixth graders and eighth graders. As a teacher, there are three things you need to do.", "On your first try, you successfully separate the sixth and eighth graders but you make physical contact with them and risk your life by touching the hormonal eighth graders.", "The second try is a huge success. Not only do you save your life, you are reminded that your years of schooling were finally worth it. Jk, but you do a really good job at 1. Separating the eighth and sixth graders and 2. Maximizing the distance between each middle schooler to yourself.", "This is an example of a really good Support Vector Machine algorithm.", "Our two classes in this example are the eighth graders and sixth graders. We\u2019re trying to classify and divide the two classes from each other.", "The teacher represents a hyperplane. I\u2019m not going to explain what a hyperplane is in this article but it can be thought of as the line that does that classification.", "The objective of an SVM is to find an optimal separating hyperplane.", "In the above example, we did exactly that because we classified the two classes and maximize the distance from the blue line to every input. This also proves why our first try as a teacher didn\u2019t go so well. We didn\u2019t find the optimal separating hyperplane.", "Our teacher (blue line) can be thought of as a hyperplane. The role of an optimal separating hyperplane is to classify the classes, in this case, eighth graders and sixth graders and maximize the distance between each input and the line which was done.", "To recap, a SVM is a machine learning algorithm that uses a hyperplane to separate classes. The optimal separating hyperplane is what it aims to use to classify between classes. It can be distinguished by 1. Accurately separating all the classes and 2. Maximizing the distance between every input and the hyperplane.", "Using scikit-learn, a machine learning package, I implemented an SVM to classify between people with high probability of having heart disease and low probability.", "Unfortunately, I got an accuracy rate of around 62% which isn\u2019t good enough to be used in the real world. After some more research, I learned three things. First off, Support Vector Machines aren\u2019t the best at multiclass classification tasks. Second, I need to preprocess more of my data better. This is something that I\u2019m learning about now and am reiterating. Third, it\u2019s really difficult to find open-sourced health data online.", "Although machine learning is a very novel field, if data scientists and machine learning experts had access to open-sourced health data, we would be on the path to cracking a lot of the problems we\u2019re currently facing in healthcare. We\u2019re not at the stage to prevent deaths from heart disease right now, but this is the starting point of doing something alike.", "What I\u2019ll be working on next:", "To continue developing a knowledge base in AI, I\u2019ll be making more progress on Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning course and working on more projects to apply my knowledge.", "If you\u2019d like to learn more about other projects I\u2019ve worked on, check out my portfolio here and connect with me on Linkedln.", "Your home for data science.
