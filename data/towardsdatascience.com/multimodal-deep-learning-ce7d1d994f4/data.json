I decided to dive deeper into the topic of \u201cInterpretability in multimodal deep learning\u201d. Here are some of the results.", "Our experience of the world is multimodal \u2014 we see objects, hear sounds, feel the texture, smell odors, and taste flavors. Modality refers to the way in which something happens or is experienced and a research problem is characterized as multimodal when it includes multiple such modalities. In order for Artificial Intelligence to make progress in understanding the world around us, it needs to be able to interpret such multimodal signals together.", "For example, images are usually associated with tags and text explanations; texts contain images to more clearly express the main idea of the article. Different modalities are characterized by very different statistical properties.", "Though combining different modalities or types of information for improving performance seems intuitively appealing task, but in practice, it is challenging to combine the varying level of noise and conflicts between modalities. Moreover, modalities have different quantitative influence over the prediction output. The most common method in practice is to combine high-level embeddings from the different inputs by concatenating them and then applying a softmax.", "The problem with this approach is that it would give an equal importance to all the sub-networks / modalities which is highly unlikely in real-life situations.", "We take a weighted combination of the subnetworks so that each input modality can have a learned contribution(Theta) towards the output prediction.", "Let's get to the point where I start bragging about the results.", "We achieve state-of-the-art results in two real-life multimodal datasets -", "Multimodal Corpus of Sentiment Intensity(MOSI) dataset \u2014Annotated dataset 417 of videos per-millisecond annotated audio features.

The transcription start site is the location where transcription starts. The different parts of the DNA fragment have different properties which affect its presence. We divided the TSS into three parts -", "We achieved an unprecedented improvement of 3% over the previous state-of-the-art results. The downstream DNA region with the TATA box has the most influence on the process.", "We also performed experiments on synthetically generated data to verify our theory.", "Now we are in the process of drafting a paper to be submitted in a ML journal.", "If you are interested to know about the mathematical details or scope of multimodal learning, in general, ping me on purvanshi.mehta11@gmail.com.
