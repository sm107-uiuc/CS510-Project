So, in order to prevent losing out on all the good tips that I was receiving online, I decided to keep a track of all the articles I was reading by placing them onto relevant Google Chrome bookmark folders.", "About a couple of weeks back, I realized that \u201cNetworking with data scientists through meetups and sessions\u201d was an important step towards growing as a data scientist. I had never attended any meetup session before, let alone data science and this was a direct effect of my severe lack of ability in being able to socialize with people easily.", "But over the past couple of years, I have realized that \u201cGood data scientists are predominantly gregarious people!\u201d. They absolutely love reaching out to the global community through channels like blogs, podcasts and of course, events! Therefore, attending a meetup was an opportunity in disguise for me to connect with some of the smartest data scientists in my city and gain a real-world understanding of data science.", "So, I reshuffled my sleep schedule of a Sunday and utilized the day to attend a Data Science meetup organized by GDG Bangalore, Kaggle Days Meetup Bengaluru and WTM Bangalore \ud83d\ude04", "Without further ado, I shall skip right into the main aim of this article and elaborate on my main takeaways from this meetup.", "A good amount of people at a meetup are beginners with respect to the content being discussed. Therefore, you are not alone if you feel that the topics being talked about are way beyond your comprehension. There are several other attendees like you and if they can gather the courage to persist in their adventure, you very well can do it too.", "Losing hope right at the beginning has never been advantageous for any new endeavor, and data science is no different.", "What did I do?I looked around the room when I felt I was struggling to keep up on a few aspects of the workshops. Then I saw that a lot of people were struggling just like me, but what differentiated me from them was the fact that \u201cThey were struggling together while trying to help each other out and I was struggling alone\u201d. This revelation hit me hard and the next thing I knew, I was working together with a DevOps engineer who was looking to make her transition from DevOps to Data Science.", "It\u2019s always great to stand out in a crowd, but if you are going to stand out as a recluse person at a meetup, there is not going to be much for you to gain out of it. Talking to people, learning from people, helping people \u2014 these are all amazing ways to build your own knowledge repositories. And, there is no better learning methodology for data science than community-based learning.", "Don\u2019t be an outlier. Because, data scientists have a natural inclination towards getting rid of them.", "What did I do?I walked around and had a few conversations with people at the event. Though I can\u2019t classify myself as a complete beginner, I still was pretty new to a meetup session on data science. So, it took me a while to acclimate to the whole idea of meeting new people(Frankly, I only met like 5\u20136 people in a room of 100. I clearly need to stop being so pathetic at socializing \ud83d\ude15). But, these limited talks that I had have shaped my out-of-the-box thinking ability and that\u2019s one of those solid skills which people often tend to overlook.", "In the meetup that I attended, we were exposed to way more terminologies and concepts than what the itinerary had. While most of these were pre-requisite terminologies to the main concepts being discussed, there were also details about concepts that the speakers had personal proclivities for.", "If your meetup\u2019s agenda is to discuss N topics, you are always going to be learning M topics where M >> N.", "What did I do?In order to keep a track of all the topics that were being discussed, I took down the terms in my notebook. Even those esoteric, data-centered vocabulary that were jargon to me found a place in my notebook. In this way, I was able to maintain a list of all the discussions at the event even though I was completely unaware of certain terms being used. After going back home from the event, I put my web surfing skills to test and learnt in detail about all those terms that didn\u2019t make sense at the event. And trust me, whatever I learnt using this method is still etched into my memory because I didn\u2019t just hear about it. I noted it down, I looked it up and I wrote all about it in words that made sense to me.", "Sometimes, meetups have hands-on-workshop sessions. Now, these workshops can get a bit tedious to follow at times. The reasons for this can range from a delayed package install to an excruciatingly slow system. This can often lead to us missing out on a step or two in between.", "Stay on missed chances for too long and you would not see those that are within your reach.", "What to do if this happens?In such a case, be quick to regroup and move onto the next step that is being talked about. If it is impossible to work on the next step without completing the one that you missed, then pick up your pen and notebook and start noting down the steps you need to do. In this way, you stay on track and do not lose out on the whole session.", "Speakers unknowingly hurtle jargon at their audience at times. But, what we need to realize is that \u201cOur identification of certain terms as jargon is only an effect of our lack of knowledge about them\u201d. Therefore, terms that are jargon once will not be so at a later stage once you have learnt about it.", "Not all jargon is going to remain jargon forever.", "All it takes is our intent to take these complex terms down and read about them once we leave the session.", "There are often times when sessions get boring. This might happen either because you are too uninterested in the topic or because of the speaker\u2019s lack of ability to make it interesting. But, that\u2019s totally normal because speakers are also human just like you and me.", "We all err and none of us have been truly perfect in our lives.", "What to do if this happens?In such cases, being patient and not showing restlessness is an amazing way to be nice to the speaker. By doing this, you are not just being a good listener, but also a great human being. And as far as I understand, a great human being can easily make a great data scientist as most data scientists work towards generating value for people.", "Prior to this meetup, I have attended several workshops and also conducted a few at my college. And the biggest misconception all attendees at such workshops have is that, \u201cThis workshop will help me become a pro in this topic!\u201d. In my opinion, that\u2019s a bit too ambitious a statement to make. It is because workshops and meetup sessions are only ice-breaker sessions; sessions that help you break the ice with the topic in discussion. But, if you want to get good at what the session discussed about, you need to work on the topic on your own even after the session.", "A single workshop or session or course is often not enough to transform you from an amateur to a pro.", "Everybody at a meetup session comes from very diverse backgrounds and they bring with them their own sets of tips and tricks to work with data and relevant technology. So, always make a note of the contact details of the relevant people you meet. Because in the end, data science is a community-driven discipline and you learn much more by talking to people who are working along the same ideas as you are, with different approaches.", "The greater the diversity of the ideas that you surround yourself with, the better will be the shape of your own.", "The whole purpose of me writing this story is a result of my adherence to this point of \u201cSharing your Experience\u201d. In my opinion, it\u2019s a sea of \u201caspiring data scientists\u201d out there. So, if we are able to share our experiences at a data science event, it would help so many more people to take up that bold step of moving out of their comfort zones and doing things that can help shape their ideas towards data-related solutions. Also, if you are able to write about your experience and provide a summarized version of the meetup, it would definitely improve your content-building skills(Something that is very relevant to build a strong data science portfolio)", "Everybody around us is learning something. But, only those who find true value with what they learn are able to communicate with others about their discipline.", "And that\u2019s a wrap from my side!", "I hope that this article was of relevance to your time and please do feel free to share your ideas about your meetup experiences as comments.", "Your home for data science.
