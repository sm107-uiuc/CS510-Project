To become really great in web crawling, you not only should be able to write the XPath or CSS selectors quickly but also how you design your crawlers matters a lot especially in the long run.", "During the first year of my web crawling journey, I always focus on how to scrape a website. Being able to scrape the data, clean and organize it, this achievement already can make my day. After crawling more and more websites, I found out there are 4 important elements that are the most vital in building a great web crawler.", "How to determine a great web crawler? You might want to consider the following few points:", "Are you able to scrape the data in your limited time?", "Do you manage to scrape all the data you are interested in?", "How can you ensure the data scraped you have scraped is accurate?", "Could you scale the web crawler when the amount of websites increases?", "In order to answer all the questions above, I will be sharing some of the tips that could help you to build a great web crawler.", "Using a web scraping framework: Selenium as an example. If we want to scrape this website: https://www.yellowpages.com.sg/category/cleaning-services", "Let\u2019s say, we want to get the data for address and description of the company. So, for Selenium, we might use driver.findElement twice to retrieve the address and description separately. A better way would be using the driver to download the page source and use BeautifulSoup to extract the data you need. In conclusion, hit the website once instead of twice to be less detectable!", "Another situation is, when we are using WebDriverWait(driver, timeout, poll_frequency=0.5, ignored_exceptions=None) to wait for a page to fully loaded, remember to set poll_frequency(sleep interval between calls) to a higher value to minimize the frequency of making a request to the webpage. More details you can read through this official doc!", "Previously when I was scraping websites, I will output the records only once \u2014 when all records are being scraped. However, this method might not be the smartest way to complete the task.", "A way instead is that after you scrape a record, you will need to write into the file, so that when problems occur ( for example your computer stop running, or maybe your program stop because of an error occurred), you can start from the website where the problem occurs, to start your crawler/scraper again:)", "For me, I normally use python writerow function to write records to the output file, so that I am able to start from the website where I do not need to re-scrape all previous scrapped data if my scraper is stopped.", "There are quite a lot of ways to implement stuff so that crawlers or scrapers won\u2019t get blocked, but a good crawling framework will reduce your effort in implementing them.", "The main library I am using is Request, Scrapy or Selenium. You can refer to this link for comparison between Scrapy and Selenium. I prefer Scrapy as it already implemented some of the ways to decrease times of being blocked by the website.", "Refer to the below links for more information", "Tip #4 Retrieve data through API", "For example twitter. You can scrape the website or using their API. Instead of going through the hurdle, access their data through API will definitely make your life much easier!", "Tip #5 Crawl google cache\u2019s website instead of the original website", "You can access the cache version as shown below:", "You will not be able to get the latest data by scraping the cache\u2019s website instead of the website. However, if the website\u2019s data only changes a few weeks or even months, scraping google cache website will be a much wiser option to do.", "More information about google cache you can check on these websites:", "Low Wei Hong is a Data Scientist at Shopee. His experiences involved more on crawling websites, creating data pipelines and also implementing machine learning models on solving business problems.", "He provides crawling services which is able to provide you the accurate and cleaned data which you need. You can visit this website to view his portfolio and also to contact him for crawling services.", "You can connect with him on LinkedIn and Medium.", "Your home for data science.
