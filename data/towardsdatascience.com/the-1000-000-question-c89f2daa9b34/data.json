At first, it looks like we all know the answer, but when we take a closer look, we realize it is not that trivial.", "Let us know what you think before reading the rest of the article in the comments.", "We all know that if we have four choices, and one is correct, the probability of being right is 1/4=25%, which is correct. Since there are two 25% possibilities at A and D, we have 1/2 giving us 50% as being the correct answer. Given that now question C is right, the chance of choosing it randomly is again 1/4=25%.", "Giving this beautiful circle of self-referencing, many users opted for choice B, being 0%. However, assuming this would indeed be the right answer, we again would have a 1/4=25% chance of drawing it at random.", "One more circle? Let\u2019s assume that one answer must be correct, and this leads to excluding the answer B. This would then lead us to believe that we have a chance of 1/3 of being right 33%, which is not on the board, leaving us with 0% as the correct answer\u2026is your head making circles fast than any F1 driver?", "No worries, as we can see, this is just an ill-posed problem, and indeed many answers can be seen as correct. Through the way this question has been asked, we can not be sure what method of randomness we are encountering. Can we exclude an answer? This entire thing can be seen as a so-called mathematical paradox.", "Sometimes also called an antinomy. A paradox generally refers to a logically self-contradictory statement.

What may seem to be a short little statement had the smartest man of the time doubt themself and their chosen field of study.", "Named after and published by Bertrand Russell in 1901, the paradox created quite some problems, since it could be derived from their axoms.", "First, we must understand that mathematics is based on axioms. From those axioms, everything else is proven. An axiom is a statement that is taken to be true. They serve as a basis for all reasoning that is then made based on them. One of the earliest examples comes from ancient Greece.", "When an equal amount is taken from equals, an equal amount results.", "From this axiom, we could prove simple things like:", "Another small thing we need to understand is the principle of explosion. The principle of explosions states that from a false statement, anything can be proven. We could, for example.", "The combination of a paradox and the principle of explosion now basically breaks math, science, and reasoning in general. It leaves us with a very fuzzy definition of what true and false mean. The consequence of the mathematicians of the time was to create a new and consistent set theory.", "Well done, you challenged yourself today with some of the most awkward problems. Each of those examples made you a bit more skeptical about what and how we can even formulate a question!", "Paradoxes have been around for as long as humans asked strange questions. Their existence teaches us a valuable lesson; sometimes, not the answer is wrong. It is the question!", "There is a good reason why paradoxes are studied around the world, they are crucial to developing critical thinking. I hope you can now stop worrying about it and accept that some questions are indeed not to be answered, assuming you want to keep your sanity.", "If you enjoyed this article, I would be excited to connect on Twitter or LinkedIn.", "Make sure to check out my YouTube channel, where I will be publishing new videos every week.", "Your home for data science.
