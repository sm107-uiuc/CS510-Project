As the number of active cases grows, our healthcare systems come under more strain. More hospital beds, more healthcare staff, and more equipment come into demand. With resources running scarce, our healthcare systems are threatened with overwhelm.", "Are we approaching a tipping point? If so, when will it come? German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, offers some insight:", "The \u201creproduction factor\u201d, or basic reproduction number, plays an important role when considering these questions. This article will explore the concept of the basic reproduction number, what it means for the spread of COVID-19, and its implications for our healthcare systems.", "Note: Our focus here is on unpacking the concept of the reproduction number as it relates to models of infectious disease. We take the case of COVID-19 as an example for illustrative purposes.", "Before we dive into the details of the reproduction number, we need to cover the basics of how compartmental epidemiological models work. Read this article for a simple but more detailed explanation.", "For brevity, we skim over the relevant assumptions of the SIR model here.", "Two key factors that determine how quickly the infection spreads:", "Background out of the way, we can now take a look at the reproduction number.", "\u201cWe are now at a reproduction factor of 1, so one person is infecting another one. I can only say that for one chain of infection if one person will infect another person. That is an average of one person infecting another one.\u201d", "In other words, we can think of the basic reproduction number as the number of people that one infected person passes the disease on to. For example, if each infected person infects another, then we have a basic reproduction number of 1 (the chain of infection that Angela Merkel describes). If each infected person infects two other people, then our basic reproduction number is 2, and so on.", "The reproduction number is calculated using the transmission and recovery rates. If the transmission rate tells us how many people an active case will pass the disease on to, and the recovery rate tells us how long that person will remain infectious, then we can calculate the basic reproduction number as follows:", "The basic reproduction number makes a big difference in the outcome of any infectious disease model. We can imagine that the disease spreads in waves of infection, starting with the first confirmed case.", "Let\u2019s assume that we have a basic reproduction number of 1. In that case, the spread of the infection would look something like this:", "In this case, the chain continues until all people in the population have been infected. Each person passes the infection on to another before recovering. With each new wave of infection, the number of infected people remains constant. This makes for a more manageable situation for our healthcare systems. Constantly busy, but more manageable as the number of active cases with each wave of infections remains stable.", "Now, let\u2019s imagine that our reproduction number is two, meaning that each person passes the infection on to two others, before recovering from the infection themselves. The outcome now looks something like this.", "Now, we see that the number of infected people grows with each new wave of infection. This means that the number of active cases creeps closer to the limits of our healthcare system\u2019s capacity with each wave.", "And if we take a reproduction number of 5:", "This WHO report indicates that, for severe or critical cases of COVID-19, it takes between 3 and 6 weeks to recover. In the figure below, we assume 5 weeks to recover, so 5 weeks between each wave of infection. Here, we can see the impact of a higher reproduction number.", "The reproduction number is a key variable in modelling the spread of epidemics.", "\u201cIf we get to the point where everybody infects 1.1 people, then by October we will reach the capacity of our healthcare system with the assumed number of intensive care beds. If we get to 1.2 people, so everyone is infecting 20% more. [Where] out of 5 people, one infects two and the rest one, then we will reach the limit of our healthcare system in July. And if it\u2019s up to 1.3 people then in June we will reach the limit of our healthcare system.\u201d", "Merkel goes on to describe the situation as being \u201cfragile\u201d and on \u201cthin ice\u201d. A variation of 0.1 in the reproduction number could make a difference of 3 months in the timeline to reaching healthcare capacity.", "It depends on the reproduction number. There are 3 cases to consider:", "If the reproduction number is larger than one, then the answer would be yes, using this model. Since each person infects more multiple others, the number cases grows with each wave until the majority of the population have been infected. The rate at which the infection spreads through the population will depend on the number of susceptible people. With these models, we expect the infection rate to slow down after reaching a tipping point, but the model still shows that everyone will catch it at some point.", "Here is a simple network simulation illustrating this case. The blue nodes indicate susceptible people, the red are infected, and the green are recovered (or removed from the population).", "In this case, the disease doesn\u2019t just infect everyone, it grows quickly with each wave and spreads across the population.", "A reproduction number of less than one means that, on average, most people are not passing the infection on. If the reproduction number is 0.5, that means that half of the people who are infected will not infect anyone else, so the total number of active cases halves with each wave. This continues until the disease eventually disappears. Here\u2019s what a simulation looks like, using the same network, but with a reproduction number lower than 1.", "Eventually, we reach a point where the person who has the the infection will recover before passing it on to anyone. In this case, it does not pick up enough momentum to infect a majority of the population, and disappears with time.", "This is the second best case scenario, as the number of infected people remains constant with each wave of infection.", "In this case, we do expect the disease to eventually spread across the entire population. However, this is the second best case for healthcare, as the number of active cases at any given time remains constant.", "For a more detailed mathematical explanation on the reproduction number, I would recommend this paper from The Department of Anthropological Sciences at Stanford University.
