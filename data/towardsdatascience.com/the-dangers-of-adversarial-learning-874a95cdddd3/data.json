It sounded good in theory, sounded good in the realm of speculative discussion over beer among friends, but with many things that sound good in theory, it doesn\u2019t necessarily follow that they will also be sound in practice.", "So Ian Goodfellow went home and implemented his idea. It was a relatively simple idea, so it took him only a couple of hours to get it working. Behold: it worked! And Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) were born.", "GANs are generative models (I wrote a more detailed introduction about generative models in my article on making computers dream). That means that they allow you to generate completely new data following the probability distribution of the data that you have trained the model on. GANs are not the only architecture that builds generative models (e.g. variational autoencoders are another very popular example) but have consistently been, since their invention, among the most popular models.", "The data they are trained on can take many shapes and forms. It can be, for example, image data. It can also be the sound of a voice, videos, neuroimaging data (e.g. for better understanding mental illness), etc.", "Generative models are a part of a statistical, unsupervised approach to machine learning that differs in quality from the classical deep feedforward architectures that have become so popular in the last decade.", "While feedforward networks can only classify and learn correlations in data, the imaginative capabilities of generative models more closely resemble the skillset of our brains: Helmholtz machines, among machine learning\u2019s first attempts at training generative models, were trained with the wake-sleep algorithm. They can effectively dream up new data: through ideas like the free energy principle, Karl Friston\u2019s active inference, the Bayesian Brain Hypothesis, and predictive coding, they also provide an important perspective on the principles that our own brains might be operating on.", "But these fascinating parallels to neuroscience are not the focus of this article, but rather the very real and potentially impactful applications these generative models could have on our societies in the very near future.", "Take a look at these two pictures: one is of a real human being and one a picture I just fabricated using a GAN. Can you tell the difference?", "I bet you had to look very closely until you figured who the real person was and who wasn\u2019t. But the odds are you didn\u2019t manage to figure it out, because there is no real person. Both of these pictures are fake, but I assume you as a human couldn\u2019t really tell anymore with much confidence.", "This illustrates both the virtue and the issues with generative models: they are rapidly evolving, and in some areas, they have become so convincing that they blur the boundaries between what\u2019s real and what\u2019s fake beyond any human\u2019s ability to tell.", "This means that they are composed of two networks: a generator network and a discriminator network. Those two are in constant competition with each other: the generator network tries to generate fake data that looks real, while the discriminator network tries to tell the difference between what\u2019s real and fake (say you use pictures of faces to train the discriminator, with one part of the data being actual photos of human faces that are fed into the network and the other part faces that the generator spat out).", "If the fakes become too good for the discriminator, the generator network wins. But as long the discriminator can still discern the difference between what\u2019s real and fake, then the generator network needs to keep on improving, and the abilities of the discriminator can continue to be used to improve the abilities of the generator network.", "\u201cTo be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Rick and Morty. The humour is extremely subtle. And without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over the average viewers head.- President John F. Kennedy", "The generative powers of generative models bring the potential to generate fake media onto our smart devices and computers.", "Modern man spends much of his or her day in virtual realms decoupled from the physical reality of trees and birds and oceans. Some days our brains are more concerned with sifting through virtual data than through real data. But while the fact of a tree in the forest is usually hard to argue with, our intuitions with respect to what\u2019s real or fake on the internet have yet to accustom to the new realities facing us.", "While it may seem obvious to the historically schooled person that President Kennedy did not in fact praise the subtle humor in Rick and Morty, this video that was \u201cput together in 3 hours with very little effort and looks awful\u201d by an average user still indicates the direction we are headed in.", "GANs can have fun and entertaining applications, e.g. by emulating famous painting styles (as in these GANGogh paintings, or this project painting the next Rembrandt), permitting us, through apps like FaceApp or PortraitAI, to imagine us as young and old, male and female, or as a 17th-century oil painting.", "Because these applications are becoming so popular and are so obviously entertaining, it will be impossible to stop the rapid increase of developments in the field of generative models. Nina Schick projects that in ten years the average user will have access to special effects that Hollywood is at this stage only dreaming of, completely revolutionizing the way movies will be made.", "But we shouldn\u2019t forget the darker aspects of these developments: a \u201cdeep fake\u201d is the name for a piece of virtual data that is used by potentially hostile agents under the pretense of being real. Deep fake media has the potential to further the divide between the filter bubbles and echo chambers of social media, which will further decouple them from any need for a grounding in reality. It will facilitate building alternative realities composed of alternative facts: if we can make opposing politicians or other competitors look and sound like whatever we wish, then the doors are open for all sorts of things, and it will become ever the harder to tell the truth from the fiction.", "As the two pictures above indicate, in some areas humans are becoming hardpressed are downright overpowered in their discriminative abilities by what generative models put on our plate.", "To counterbalance, companies around the globe are starting to build deep fake detectors that build artificial intelligence that can still tell what is real and what is fake even after our human abilities have come to an end. It is crucial to build this defense wall.", "But the irony of GANs and adversarial learning is precisely that building ever better discriminators will in turn allow us to train ever better generative models, leading to a fateful arms race with no end in sight.", "How we will get out of this conundrum is hard to tell, but it is something the AI community needs to be mindful of and learn about, e.g. through Nina Schick\u2019s new book \u201cDeep Fakes \u2014 The Coming Infocaplypse\u201d that goes into all of this in more detail. Generative models are brilliant inventions, testaments to our imaginative capabilities that go so far as to imagine algorithms that can start to imagine on their own. But we need to watch out that we don\u2019t let them turn into pandora\u2019s boxes that, once opened, will be forever impossible to close.", "Your home for data science.
