The result baffled the researchers as well as the editor, who prefaced the article with the remark that the paper is \u2018offered to Statistical Science readers as a challenging puzzle\u2019.", "What did the researchers claim to have found, and how?", "The authors were looking for so-called equidistant letter sequences, the sequences of letters if you look at every 5th letter in the Book of Genesis, for instance. They were testing if the letter sequences thus generated would contain the names, birth dates and death dates of a list of 32 notable Rabbis, covering the entire span of Jewish history. If they were able to find such a pattern, this would prove, in their view, that the Book of Genesis in fact had predictive power.", "In fact, the researchers found the \u2018Rabbi pattern\u2019 hidden in equidistant letter sequences, which surprised themselves as well as their readers. One reader, journalist Michael Drosnin, made it his mission to find even more patterns, which formed the bulk of his 1997 published book \u2018The Bible Code\u2019. What was going on here? Does the Bible really have predictive power?", "Of course not. What happened here is an instance of a so-called look-elsewhere effect. The book of Genesis is a massive document. By allowing themselves to vary the start of the equidistant letter sequences, their spacings, as well as the particular version of the Rabbi\u2019s name to look for, the authors were giving themselves a huge amount of wiggle room. And it is this wiggle room that produced the spurious statistical signal: given such a large number of different combinations of search parameters, it is not unlikely at all to detect the list of Rabbis, or any other list of names you might be searching for. The original paper was officially rebutted in 1997, when Brenden McKay and collaborators published \u2018Solving the Bible Code Puzzle\u2019 in the same journal.", "The more opportunities you give yourself to be surprised, the more likely you will be surprised. This is the nature of the look-elsewhere effect.", "Another place where you can find the look-elsewhere effect is the financial industry. Investment firms typically have incubators, which means that they launch many different mutual funds with different strategies, all of which are funded exclusively with their own money. If the number of funds during the incubation period is large enough, of course a few of them will outperform the average market, simply by chance. At the end of the incubation period, the firm can then open the winning funds to the public, advertising their stunning performances, while quietly discontinuing the funds that were losers. Customers are led to believe that the fund managers have predictive powers, but in reality they were just looking at a statistical fluke, an instance of the look-elsewhere effect.", "Or consider a Swedish study from 1992, linking living near power lines to childhood leukemia. The researchers surveyed everyone living within 300 meters of high-voltage power lines over a 25-year period and looked for statistically significant increases in rates of over 800 different ailments. Of course, by looking at so many different possibilities at once, it is pretty much guaranteed to find at least once statistically significant signal simply by chance.", "Or consider the North Carolina Lottery Coincidence: The winning numbers picked in the North Carolina Cash5 Lottery game (4, 21, 23, 34, 39) were identical on July 9th and 11th, 2007. Of course this is highly unlikely, with odds of only 2 in a Million, and some observers even suspected fraud. However, before rushing to any judgements, think again about the look-elsewhere effect here: this particular lottery had been operating for almost a year at the time, and in addition there had been hundreds of other 5-number lotteries operating for many years all over the country. With so many lotteries in so many different places in operation for such along time, it not unlikely at all to find two identical draws in three days in one of them.", "The look-elsewhere effect fundamentally highlights a problem with what is known as frequentist statistics. In frequentist statistics, we perform hypothesis testing as follows: Assuming the Null hypothesis (e.g., the Bible does not predict the future), how probable is it to find the measured observation (e.g., the names and death dates of Rabbis)? If that probability is less than a certain threshold, for example 0.05, then researchers see the result as \u2018statistical significant\u2019 evidence in favor of rejecting the Null hypothesis.", "Even though this approach is widely used today, there are a number of problems with it, one of them being its inherent proneness to the look-elsewhere effect. When performing just 20 different tests, it likely to find one statistically significant signal simply by chance alone. This can happen if one research team looks for a signal in 20 different ways, as in the xkcd comic below, or if 20 different research teams around the globe look for a particular signal, in which case only the one team that found a (spurious) signal will publish their results.", "If frequentist statistics is in some ways flawed and gives flawed results, is there an alternative? Yes, and the answer is Bayesian statistics. The most important difference between these two flavors of statistics is that the Bayesian framework forces you to formulate your prior believes. For instance, my prior on the Bible\u2019s ability to predict the future is essentially zero, so even the result from the Hebrew research team will not move this prior belief a lot. Only if I were to see more and more of the same evidence in other places, would I start to change my views.", "The same with the power lines. My prior believe for power lines causing leukemia is close to zero as well, given what we know today about medicine, human anatomy, and electromagnetism. Thus, even the results published by the Swedish research team should not change my believes, unless they are backed up elsewhere.", "Bayesian thinking can thus protect us from the look-elsewhere effect: thinking about our priors first can prevent accepting \u2018statistically significant\u2019 results that are really the results of chance.", "In order to understand the severeness of the problem caused by look-elsewhere effects, consider the roles of the researchers around the world, working hard on their research projects and trying to survive in a competitive environment. In order to establish themselves in the academic world and secure funding, researchers want to publish novel and interesting results, and not merely try to reproduce prior results from other teams. Unfortunately, this makes it unlikely that fluke results will be debunked by follow-up studies. Physician and scientist John Iodannis makes an even stronger claim in a 2005 paper, arguing that most published research findings are false.", "The problem is thus not with individual researchers, but with the entire academic \u2018publish or perish\u2019 culture. This is an example of a system where the game is to blame, not the player, a phenomenon I wrote about in more detail in a previous post here.", "There are many more examples of look-elsewhere effects and flawed statistics than I can mention here, and if you pay attention to the world around you, you will see them. The next time you hear someone claiming that toads predict earthquakes, that some gene predicts IQ level, or that certain foods are bad for you, think about the look-elsewhere effect: how many other animals, genes, or food items did they test as well? And, most importantly, know what your prior believes are.", "Find more of my stories on my profile page, for example:", "Your home for data science.
