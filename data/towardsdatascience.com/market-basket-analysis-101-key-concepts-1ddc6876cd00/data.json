Although it\u2019s kind of a culinary travesty, we still make it with Thanksgiving dinner for sentimental reasons. Its essential ingredients are green beans, canned cream of mushroom soup and \u2014 most important \u2014 so-called \u201cfrench fried\u201d onions (also from a can) sprinkled on top. All three ingredients often are grouped together in the grocery store around the holidays.", "But how\u2019d the grocery stores know to showcase those items together? Do they have a sentimental attachment to green bean casserole, too?", "Nope, the stores are making the most of their customer data \u2014 and so can you. An analytic approach called market basket analysis reveals which items buyers purchase together. Among other purposes, this analysis can show retailers how to locate products together and how to cross-promote and recommend items that customers often put in their shopping carts at the same time. Marketing messages and promotions can highlight those items occurring together often, and key products that often relate to additional purchases can be identified. This approach works whether the stores and carts are physical or digital. Market basket analysis can also be used to analyze web browsing history, detect fraud and manage inventory.", "Let\u2019s walk through the essential concepts underlying market basket analysis here.", "Although its results are visible all around us in our lives as consumers, market basket analysis at first sounds a bit foreign: \u201cApriori\u201d? \u201cAntecedents\u201d and \u201cconsequents\u201d? A metric called \u201cconviction\u201d? Don\u2019t worry \u2014 we\u2019ll get through this terminology together.", "First, we\u2019ll assume that you have a dataset of transaction information where the components of each transaction are identified, like this:", "Given those data, we want to find out which items are often purchased together. (It looks like the customer for Transaction 3 has green bean casserole on the dinner menu!) We can eyeball these four transactions and see that two include turkey, green beans and french fried onions. One turkey buyer didn\u2019t buy either of the other two items, though, and one person bought green beans and none of the other casserole ingredients.", "We might guess from these four transactions that there\u2019s some relationship among the three casserole ingredients, but it would be hard to determine if that\u2019s the case across a much larger dataset.", "The market basket approach to making that determination is to build \u201cassociation rules.\u201d The word \u201crule\u201d sounds very authoritative or definitive, but really these are just statements that connect an \u201cantecedent\u201d item to a \u201cconsequent\u201d item. Association rules also do not imply causal relationships, only co-occurrence, so don\u2019t be deceived by those little arrows. In our example, we might wonder if green beans would be an antecedent item for french fried onions.", "green beans \u27a1\ufe0f french fried onions", "To find out if that\u2019s the case, we first create \u201citemsets\u201d from our transaction data. An itemset might be {green beans, french fried onions}.", "In our tiny dataset above, we see that two of the four transactions contain that itemset; but two also contain the itemset {turkey, green beans}. If we had a bigger dataset, how would we know which of those itemsets\u2019 relationships was more important and should be the basis for, say, how we organize our grocery store? It\u2019s even more complicated if you imagine all the possible combinations of the 10 different items included in our four transactions.", "What we need to do next is not only measure the frequency of the itemsets we\u2019ve identified among all our transactions, but also to assess the strength of the associations between those items. We\u2019ll use some different metrics for that strength, and we will \u201cprune\u201d (discard) the rules that don\u2019t meet a threshold we set. The association rules that remain should have a high level of interestingness (that\u2019s a real term!).", "There are a few different interestingness metrics you may apply to your association rules:", "number of transactions with {green beans} \u27a1\ufe0f {french fried onions}", "In our dataset above, we find support for {green beans} \u27a1\ufe0f {french fried onions} is 0.5 (2 transactions out of 4). Higher numbers closer to 1 are better here.", "Support is easy to calculate, but imagine trying to do this for more popular items in the store. How many people buy {bread, eggs} when they shop? Probably a lot. You may get a high support metric for that association rule, but it won\u2019t add much nuance to your understanding of your customers\u2019 habits.", "proportion of transactions with {green beans} \u27a1\ufe0f {french fried onions}", "proportion of transactions with green beans", "In our dataset above, 2 of 4 transactions included both items, and 3 of 4 included green beans. That\u2019s 0.5 / 0.75, or 0.67. Again, higher numbers closer to 1 are better here.", "Confidence gives us the probability that a customer will purchase the consequent, the item on the right of our association rule \u2014 the french fried onions \u2014 given that they purchased green beans, our antecedent. As you can see, this metric provides a different and perhaps more useful insight into the nature of customers\u2019 behavior; we are getting not just frequency, but also a measure of likelihood.", "proportion of transactions with {green beans} \u27a1\ufe0f {french fried onions}", "(proportion of transactions with {green beans}) * (proportion of transactions with {french fried onions})", "The lift metric lets us know whether our assumption of \u201cno relationship\u201d between the items \u2014 that they are independent \u2014 is reality or not.", "Want still more metrics? Support, confidence and lift are the most commonly known metrics for this analysis, and you\u2019ll see them in the market basket tools in Alteryx Designer. You may also see leverage and conviction discussed on the interwebz. These are additional options for assessing the strength of the co-occurrence relationship expressed in an association rule.", "Clearly, those are a lot of potential calculations to carry out for many potential association rules based on many potential itemsets, if you have more than a few items. How can you expend your computational power efficiently in this process, which is often called association rule mining?", "The most frequent approach is to apply the Apriori algorithm, which starts out by generating the frequent itemsets for your data with a minimum number of items k, which you can set. It decides which itemsets are frequent by requiring them to meet a minimum level of support (explained above). Then, those frequent itemsets are partitioned (divided) and re-combined repetitively and the support calculated for each combination, until no more itemsets can be created.", "Association rules are generated from the frequent itemsets by splitting them apart into antecedents and consequents, and then the confidence for each rule is calculated. Only the association rules that meet a minimum confidence level will be retained, and the others are discarded.", "The process of whittling down the itemsets (and thereby reducing the number of association rules to evaluate) is pruning. Pruning is important to reduce the computational demands of reviewing the data repeatedly and of calculating metrics for many potential itemsets.", "The eclat algorithm is also used for building association rules. ECLAT is actually an acronym that stands for Equivalence Class Clustering and bottom-up Lattice Traversal (though the word \u00e9clat itself actually means \u201costentatious display\u201d or \u201cdazzling effect\u201d \u2026 its creators set some high expectations!).", "Instead of the breadth-first approach that the Apriori algorithm uses to identify frequent itemsets, eclat uses a depth-first approach. It looks at each item, identifies the transaction IDs for the transactions in which that item appears, and makes a list of those IDs. It then looks for intersections among those lists for the various items and calculates support based on the intersections.", "The eclat algorithm can be faster, but it also can be memory-intensive as it constructs and uses the lists at these intermediary steps. (For more comparison and contrast between these algorithms, check out these slides.)", "Another way of limiting the number of association rules requiring analysis is aggregating items into larger categories prior to constructing the rules. For example, in our grocery transactions above, we could put the turkeys and pizza into a \u201cfrozen food\u201d category, and put the two pies into a larger \u201cdesserts\u201d category. We\u2019d then end up with association rules that could tell us how often purchases within these larger categories coincided. However, while we\u2019d gain efficiency in aggregating these items, we would lose detail that might be useful.", "I hope you\u2019re inspired to give this analytic approach a try. You can use a variety of tools to implement this kind of analysis: if you prefer R, check out the arules package; if Python, try the mlxtend package. There are also tools built into Alteryx Designer for market basket analysis. Whether or not you use Designer, you can read in this blog post about how to use the pandas and seaborn Python packages to visualize your market basket analysis and make it easier to understand the relationships you\u2019ve found.", "Originally published on the Alteryx Community and featured on the Alteryx Data Science Portal.", "Your home for data science.
