These tips are for anyone who is starting their Data Science career with the goal of obtaining a job in industry and applying Machine Learning and Deep Learning to solve business problems.", "If you start with the list below, you will be prepared to tackle just about any Data Science task you\u2019ll be faced with on your first job.", "For Statistics, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning, you will need to understand the mathematics of the models, be able to explain the model intuitively and implement the models in Python or R.", "Through continued job experience, you\u2019ll refine your Data Science skills and develop your own best practices for things like feature engineering, evaluating models, model monitoring, automated retraining, avoiding mistakes like data leakage, and presenting your work to a broad audience.", "The answer is no, but it does help if you have at least a Bachelors degree in a quantitative field. The best way to learn Data Science depends on your learning style. Degrees, immersion programs, and self-teaching with online courses are all viable options. The most important thing to do is identify how you learn, and then choose a learning path that works for you. If you need structure and deadlines to stay motivated and on-track, opt for a degree or immersion program. If you already have a strong mathematical background, I recommend the online course route because it is cheaper, and prepares you very well for the job.", "Imposter syndrome is everywhere and Data Science is no exceptions. I have two methods to overcome this.", "Your portfolio is crucial if you are getting started in your Data Science career. You will need some project work to discuss in the interviews. Both personal projects and Kaggle competitions are great ways to build your portfolio. Kaggle has some great free datasets you can download and use for a personal project. Personal project more accurately represents a real-life project because it requires some creativity to define the project, choose the modeling approach, and choose the right evaluation metrics.", "Having a Github page with personal projects will be a huge advantage during your job search. Many employers will look at your Github prior to an in-person interview to see a sample of your code. It will not help you to just have some notebooks from online coursework on your Github. I recommend creating repos for your personal projects and writing up a simple description of the project in the Readme.", "Now you\u2019re ready to start interviewing! I don\u2019t know the secret recipe to get your dream job, but I do have a few interviewing tips that I believe will increase your chances, and put you towards the top of the stack of applications.", "With these tips, you should be able to learn everything you need to know to start your career as a Data Scientist and stand out in the interview process. I hope these tips will make the process of learning Data Science easier.", "Disclaimer \u2014 This article contains my own candid advice and all information in this article is my own opinion based on my personal experience as a Data Scientist and is not scientific fact.
