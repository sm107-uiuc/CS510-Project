A gene is a long sequence of coded letters, like computer information. Modern biology is becoming very much a branch of information technology.\u201d \u2014 Richard Dawkins", "A/B testing is a common practice in the tech industry. Every time a new feature is built, product managers and data scientists put it through the ultimate test of performance \u2014 A/B testing. The resulting metrics will tell whether the feature will meet the proposed business outcome. The first step is to find out what data to collect. For platforms such as Facebook and Twitter, the metrics include the time spent on the website, number of likes, increase in daily active users (DAU), number of shares, and so on. Next, segment the user population to control and test to run experiments\u2014 the size of the population is decided by power analysis. Finally, collect the data. Once there is sufficient data, now it's time to model the test population, do parameter estimations, and perform statistical significance tests to check if the test distribution deviates significantly from the control. If there is significance, the feature will get added to the product stack.", "In biology, the whole process runs in reverse. We already have the product \u2014 an organism; therefore, we deal with a different set of questions.", "How was the product made? What metrics were used to measure the success of a feature? Why were redundancies incorporated? What led to modularity? Questions are many. These are tough questions, and since we can\u2019t go back in time, the best we can do is maximum likelihood estimations based on the available data.", "scRNA-seq is a high-throughput sequencing technique for profiling transcriptomes (the total RNA present in a cell) of hundreds of thousands of cells in parallel. According to the central dogma of molecular biology, gene expression is the unidirectional flow of genetic information from DNA (gene)\u2192RNA \u2192Protein. scRNA-seq captures this information flow at the RNA level for each cell in question.", "To understand the logic behind scRNA-seq, let us take a look at the homeobox genes or Hox genes in the fruit fly Drosophila. The term homeobox originates from homeosis \u2014 meaning the replacement of one body part with another.", "In the fruit fly, the body patterning is controlled by the homeotic gene complexes antennapedia and bithorax. The expression of these genes in specific zones in the larva determines the segment identities in the adult fly.", "For example, the Ultrabithorax \u2014 Ubx \u2014 gene prevents the formation of wings in the third thoracic segment(T3 \u2014 see above illustration); therefore, the wings are limited to the T2 segment of the fly.", "In a ubx mutant, which lacks a functional copy of the ubx gene \u2014 T3 transforms to T2, giving the mutant fly an extra pair of wings! Read more about the fascinating aspects of Drosophila development here.", "In general, the cell identities are determined by the expression of specific genes in that cell, which might be absent in another cell (a skin cell vs. a neuron). Gene interaction networks are complex non-linear networks (interactome) where the expression of one particular gene might cause another gene to stop expressing completely or might activate the expression of a different gene, and so on. This contextual interaction of genes determines the developmental trajectory of a cell.", "In our ubx mutant, we could compare the RNA from the T3 segment of a ubx mutant to the T3 segment of a normal fly to figure out what takes to make a wing. Because a physical change \u2014 extra wings \u2014 we observed must have its underpinnings in the gene expression. By counting the number of copies of RNAs transcribed from each gene (as we would collect the clicks and page visits in an A/B testing setup), we can precisely measure the subtle differences in gene expression brought about by a particular mutation \u2014 this study is known as differential gene expression analysis. Differential gene expression forms the very basis of scRNA-seq. Likewise, a comparison of a cancer cell to a normal counterpart might uncover unique drug targets that are otherwise not easily identifiable.", "In data science, garbage in, garbage out (GIGO) is a well-known concept where if you feed flawed data to your analysis pipeline, what you get out will be garbage. The only way to deal with this is, to begin with, a proper randomized experimental design and collect meaningful data.", "Following are the steps of the scRNA-seq pipeline:1)Sample collection: Collect the tissue samples to analyze. It is ill-advised to collect specimens in batches such as all tumor samples on Monday and all normal samples on Tuesday. Such a practice will lead to batch effects and confounding. Randomization is the key here. Have both the normal and tumor samples collected on the same day, the same personnel, and the same protocols with proper controls to avoid unnecessary variation.", "2)Isolation of single cells from tissues: This is the most challenging part. Tissues are a collection of cells, and are delicate and thus need careful handling.More details on the high throughput method are available in the Zheng. et al. (2017) paper.", "3) Extract RNA from individual cells.", "4)Convert RNA to DNA: DNA sequencing is necessary to identify the genomic origin of RNA. So, prior to sequencing, we need to convert the RNA to DNA by reverse transcription PCR. RNA is a single-stranded nucleic acid molecule therefore, highly unstable, RTPCR transforms RNA into a much more stable DNA that is suitable for downstream sequencing experiments.", "5)Sequence Analysis: \u2192Quality Control: Check the quality of sequencing data (fastQC, multiQC, rseqc) \u2192Adapter Trimming: Remove the sequencing adapters (cutadapt, flexbar) \u2192Alignment to the reference genome: Determine the identity of a sequence (A splice-aware mapper such as HISAT/HISAT2 should be preferred). \u2192Alignment Visualization: Visualized the alignment file(IGV) \u2192Post-alignment QC: Check the sequence quality after alignment(samtools, fastQC)\u2192Preparation of Count Matrix: Count and record the number of unique RNAs detected by sequencing analysis.", "An excellent tutorial can be found here", "6)Data Analysis \u2192Cell Quality Control & filtering: Remove cells with less than a certain threshold of identified genes or more than 25000 detected genes (there are over 25000 genes in humans, anything more might indicate two or more cells trapped together during single-cell isolation). \u2192Gene Quality Control & filtering. \u2192Dimensionality Reduction with Principal Component Analysis, tSNE, and UMAP: RNAseq data is high dimensional data. It is vital to deal with the \u2018Curse of dimensionality\u2019 as early in the analysis as possible. It also helps in removing covariate genes. \u2192Clustering and community detection with DBSCAN, K-means, and Louvain algorithms", "Tutorials can be found here and here", "When I was a graduate student, we relied on Northern blotting for detecting RNA expression. Then came microarray, qPCR, followed by RNAseq. The latest entrant to the scene is scRNA-seq, and it is set to transform biomedical research.", "For example, a recent hackathon that took place in San Francisco used deep learning on RNAseq data to identify gene networks specific to a rare form of kidney cancer. The idea was to find a gene regulatory network that is similar to predictions made by a GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) called TSPG (transcriptome state perturbation generator) so that we can repurpose the existing drugs to treat kidney cancer. Coming up with new drug formulae using the more traditional clinical trial approach is expansive and time-consuming, and patients often need rapid clinical interventions (You may read the tragic story of Leila Janah here and here. Therefore the deep-learning approach is more attractive.", "You may also read about the first-ever genomics hackathon that happened in 2017 which tackled a similar problem.", "I am Aneesh, I am passionate about applying AI in biomedical research.
