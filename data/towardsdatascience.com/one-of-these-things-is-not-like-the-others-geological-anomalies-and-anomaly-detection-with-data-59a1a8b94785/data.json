I\u2019m going to play the role of the geologist, asking frustrating, poorly framed data science questions, and Jess will be able to translate that for you, hopefully in a meaningful way. Fingers crossed!", "So what we thought we\u2019d do is focus on three specific types of anomalies which are really common to see in geological data.", "Holly: First we\u2019re going to talk about the physical characteristics of rocks, and specifically geophysical data. As a geologist what I\u2019m looking for in this type of data is something that indicates to me a physical differences in the rock. As an example, certain types of ore bodies, like sulfide, are more dense and more conductive than the surrounding rocks \u2014 so I go and look for signals that might indicate to me more dense or more conductive rocks.", "How I do that is firstly I get someone to collect data, usually an airborne geophysical survey, probably magnetics and gravity. Then, I get someone much smarter than me to do some nice maths on the data (inversions) and generate a number of gridded images that are typically coloured; red as high magnetic intensity, blue as low.", "Still Holly:I look in those images for structures and trends that may indicate something different is going on. I might be looking for a particular change in rock type or physical characteristics, or I might be looking for a structure or chemical change which is indicated by a difference in density.", "I guess I\u2019d start by noting that you just talked about five or six different steps with this data.", "There\u2019s the raw data that you get off the instrument.", "There\u2019s some processing of that data \u2014 for example, if it was magnetics, you want to remove the effect of the Earth\u2019s magnetic field so that you\u2019re just looking at what the local geology is contributing to that field. Then, you mentioned inversion and you also mentioned pretty images which I think are two separate steps.", "I guess a geologist\u2019s basic description of why we do inversions is that we\u2019re recording raw measurements from the Earth which are causing the signal to come back in a certain way \u2014 but what we actually want to know is what it\u2019s telling us. During the inversion process we apply some prior knowledge to help us determine that.", "A savvy exploration geo, before doing a survey would provide the geophysicists with some characteristics of the rock that you already know. So if you already know about the rock types and some of their characteristics you can give those to geophysicists and they can generate a better model that honours your known geology.", "So, coming at this from a data science perspective, essentially the thing that we don\u2019t do very well in exploration [note, Jess also worked as a geologist], which we should do better at, is understanding the background as well as trying to understand the anomalies.", "Obviously, we know we\u2019re looking for mineralization. We want to find that big spike of sulfide that\u2019s going to make us all rich. But sometimes we don\u2019t spend enough time actually understanding what that background actually looks like and what the natural variability of the rock is \u2014 so that then we can threshold properly and say \u201cthis thing is actually an anomaly\u201d.", "One of the advantages that we think data science will be able to bring to exploration is potentially taking a larger look at some of all public data sets and trying to understand what natural variability there is. Then when you\u2019re presenting your anomalous target for minerals you can say, well actually we looked at all of the greenstones in South Australia and found they have these kind of geophysical signals and this thing is just different to that. So being able to provide that kind of bigger data or higher level view is a bonus.", "How difficult is it for data scientists when giving them raw geophysical data with no context?", "Part of a data scientist\u2019s role is to create the context from the data! The things that we would identify as \u2018useful context\u2019 might not be quantitative enough or scale to all of the data. So a data scientist is going to take a \u2018more is more\u2019 approach, where they try to think of a superset of all possible things that might be \u2018useful context\u2019, and then learn which ones are actually useful from the data.", "There\u2019s still a lot of things that you can kind of pull out of that data without having to do a full inversion.", "Just to clarify some of the language, when I would talk about an inversion, coming from a physics background I would expect that we have some governing equations that describe how the physical properties of the rock lead to the signals that we see in the field. When I\u2019m doing an inversion I\u2019m basically trying to go from the field back to those physical properties.", "This works well when you\u2019re just looking at one or two fields. Where it becomes really hard is when you\u2019re trying to actually stack a whole bunch of other data on top of there as well. For example, we don\u2019t have any governing equations that tell us simultaneously how rock\u2019s magnetic and density properties plus the geochemistry plus the mineralogy plus the structure invert. You put all of those things together and that system of equations is just too complicated to invent properly.", "This is where there\u2019s a specific advantage for machine learning, because potentially with machine learning we don\u2019t need to solve that inversion problem \u2014 but we can actually look for patterns instead. This is kind of a data fusion approach. Or, you can do that conversion and you can start to constrain the inversion with some other data sets; that\u2019s also a really valuable way to go and can actually then feed into a machine learning model as well.", "So, again lots of different ways to apply machine learning in geology.", "So, let\u2019s move on to my favourite thing \u2014 geochemistry!", "The first thing to point out with regards to geochemistry is that when we talk data we\u2019re talking about a lab assay result or some real-time chemical reading or indicator of what the elements are within your rocks.", "Often geochemistry databases are from drilling, but the density and spacing of drillholes will depend on if you\u2018re drilling out a resource or doing regional exploration. So due to the possible sparsity of the data I imagine it\u2019s really quite difficult from a data science point of view.", "What we look for in a geochemical anomaly is any chemical change that is indicative of potential mineralization.", "Still Holly:My process of going through geochemical data is firstly to segment that data.", "I know that if I look at the data in bulk I\u2019m unlikely to see any meaningful trends; I\u2019m probably going to see different rock types but I need to separate those different rock types out into separate populations so that I can see if the actual anomalies stand out within those separate datasets. So, I segment that data out into different rock types and even into potential subsets for alteration types. Then I can really clearly see what are the anomalous points in there", "If we\u2019re looking for a new deposit, we know we\u2019re looking for something different but we don\u2019t know exactly what the chemical signature might be. It could be an enrichment of some elements, but it could also be a depletion, so really we\u2019re just looking for something that stands out as different in a certain area.", "This is this is where there\u2019s a real opportunity to connect the chemistry data that you\u2019ve got directly to a geological process actually forming the deposit.", "Holly hasn\u2019t mentioned this yet, but what a lot of geochemistry is about is trying to understand how different elements behave under each deposit-forming process.", "For example, you might have a bunch of hot fluid moving through some rock and what that\u2019ll do is change all of the minerals in that rock and you will see some elements enriched \u2014 like silica. Minerals like plagioclase are altered into clay minerals, or lose the silica, which is transported elsewhere by that hot moving fluid. When you can see that kind of operation that\u2019s an indication that there\u2019s been a hydrothermal process acting there. You might be thinking about hydrothermal deposits like gold or some kind of copper.", "As geologists we learn through our education of what unaltered and altered rocks look like, chemically-speaking.", "Breaking it down really basically, we can consider sedimentary, metamorphic, and igneous rock. Geologists understand the different chemistries of each in their natural state. They\u2019ll also know what elemental indicators can potentially show up if they\u2019ve been altered. We\u2019ve learned about those physical systems. So we apply that knowledge when we\u2019re looking for evidence of economic mineralization.", "There can be such a broad range of elements to look at. Each element behaves differently in these alteration processes, but groups of elements behave similarly, so there\u2019s actually a lot of information that you can get about the kind of processes that are happening by being able to compare groups of similar elements together.", "Geologists have a whole bunch of language around things like hydrothermal elements. Often what you can start to do is take ratios of elements \u2014 and it\u2019s actually the ratio of the elements that changes, giving you this real big indication of\u2026 things.", "Just as a technical point, you don\u2019t want to be just using the raw element of data outside of the chemistry. The key thing about all of those results is that each result needs to add to 100%, you can\u2019t have more than 100% silica in a rock for example. So you need to basically be looking at using log ratio transforms or something similar to actually transform that data into a space where you would start to apply your traditional clustering methods.", "Geologists use tools like ioGas to do that. If you\u2019re doing this in machine learning you\u2019d probably want to look at implementing this yourself. It\u2019s actually really straightforward to do.", "Our last anomaly type to talk about is structures.", "What we\u2019re talking about in structures are features in the crust that may have been involved with mineralization. These are things like faults, breccias, veins, which may have facilitated mineralization occurring.", "You might think of them like traps or sinks. Basically there\u2019s a reason why this certain feature has allowed fluid to flow along it or has created a chemical or physical barrier \u2014 so we look for those kind of features in the data.", "I mean, if you think about it you\u2019re really looking for places in the Earth\u2019s crust where elements can be concentrated and there\u2019s a few ways that they can do that.", "We can have sort of transport pathways. With those hot flowing fluids we mentioned earlier, they can pass through faults that are acting as preferential pathway. In those cases, you\u2019re more likely to be bringing all of those elements together around that kind of fault, so that makes it a good target for trying to find some kind of mineralization.", "Imagine for example that you start off with a fluid deep in the crust and you bring it up along a fault. While deep in the crust it\u2019s sitting in chemical equilibrium with all the rocks around it, but as you bring it up along that fault it comes into contact with other rocks and then you can have chemical reactions and as those chemical reactions occur that will cause precipitation of certain elements.", "This makes it useful to look for places where we have these kind of guiding structures, or transport structures, that are going to be bringing material from a broad area into a really narrow area.", "It\u2019s not always the case that every deposit that you\u2019re looking at will have formed this way though. Sometimes you\u2019re looking at variations in groundwater that are actually causing things to precipitate out.", "It\u2019s worth mentioning that often certain types of ore bodies can be fairly vertical so if you looked from above it would look like a fairly linear straight thin line; this is a kind of feature we look for in the data. Often in geophysical data because there\u2019s often a contrast across that structure either in density or conductivity or resistivity which enables us to pick that up.", "I would say that if you\u2019re taking a data science approach to geology and you\u2019re looking for changes in these faults then you should be thinking about trying to do some kind of spatial filtering, particularly on the potential field data or the magnetics and gravity.", "Mainly because what you\u2019re looking for are high frequency changes, so generally when you look at, say, the magnetic map, you\u2019ll see broad features that are you know changes in cover thickness or changes in the bulk behaviour of the rock. Then you\u2019ll see really fine scale lumps and bumps; some of them are just noise, but some of them are actually these really fine-scale fault features.", "South Australian Government Resources Information Gateway has just added some fresh magnetotellurics data, which is deep crustal stuff. If you\u2019re interested in trying to understand where deep fluids might be coming from the crust, then it\u2019s probably worth taking a look at that set.", "Geology can provide context for what an anomaly is. What we can do in data science is extract all of those as covariates to our predictor \u2014 essentially trying to say that given we know what all of the background rocks look like, tell me whether this is anomalous.", "If you\u2019re trying to convince a geologist that your model is worth something, you\u2019re trying to say this is the context that my model is adding to your interpretation of this data. So you can say, well we think we think this is anomalous because of all of these reasons, does that actually link really well to the geological processes?", "And when you are working as a geologist for a company there are additional constraints applied on you. So, we don\u2019t just get asked, \u2018just go and find anything, go and look for anomalies\u2019. Usually there are other things that are driving what we\u2019re doing \u2014 for instance if a deposit of some type has been found nearby, we\u2019ll often be looking to use that model for that style of mineralization to find other similar deposits.", "This makes us very driven by a particular model looking for particular styles of anomalies, and it can be easy to miss the other types of anomalies in the data which weren\u2019t expected.", "Also, most exploration departments, whether they be small within large miners have a focus on a particular commodity or a particular style. This focuses us and allows us to apply our funds in a particular way and but it does mean that we might be too biased, looking for ore bodies that the department already processes or trades in.",
