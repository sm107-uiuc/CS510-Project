Is it a car that is mostly normal but allows you to let go of the wheel at times and maybe park itself? Or is it a futuristic bedroom where you can watch movies and relax, while the car will do all the driving for you?", "Well, there is no formal definition. So, people at the Society of Automotive Engineers have provided us with a handy guide on how to rate a vehicle.", "But why does this even matter? Is it just a random practice of classification when it is not needed?", "It turns out it might be more useful than we have expected. The US government has adopted SAE automation levels. This means it could be used in the future in regulating the production and testing of certain levels of vehicles.", "Not only that but it can also be used in labeling vehicles and determining insurance rates. After all, making a car autonomous does not make it immune to accidents.", "This level probably describes the car that you are using right now. The driver has full responsibility in driving the car and there basically is no automation involved.", "It might include a proximity warning system to help you in parking. However, it still requires user intervention to actually stop.", "Cars at this level are incapable of driving themselves outside the old-school cruise control.", "Next comes level 1. If the car can control itself to some degree based on the information it gathers from its surroundings it goes into this category.", "So, popular features like lane assist, when your car can help you get back in the lane when you start to drift a little. Or a radar-based cruise control that automatically slows down and resumes your previous speed based on what's in front of the car.", "Such small assistance techniques will all qualify your vehicle as a level 1.", "Here belong cars that can drive completely on their own in specific situations by both steering and handling acceleration instead of just doing one or the other.", "If you have a more advanced autonomous cruise control system that can also shift the car to the left or right. Or maybe you have a self-park feature that can squeeze your car in a tight parking space without your assistance. This is the category for you.", "Keep in mind though that this level of autonomous vehicles still requires that the driver always has to be attentive and ready to intervene.", "Now, we are getting to something actually interesting. Level 3 cars are capable of driving down a normal road and along a specific path according to a destination chosen by the driver.", "Should be pretty amazing right? Well, not quite. These cars do not have meaningful fail-safes.", "It puts them into this weird in-between state. The whole point of making an autonomous vehicle is to increase safety and allow the driver to do other meaningful tasks while on the road.", "However, level 3 cars are supposed to still have human drivers that can instantaneously intervene if something goes wrong. Meaning that if your fully self-driving car encounters a situation it is not capable of solving on its own while you're watching a movie, this situation might not end well.", "So, it is not surprising that many car manufacturers are trying to jump straight to level 4.", "Similarly to level 3, these cars use a human driver as a fail-safe but it is smart enough to handle certain tricky situations on its own. This means that a level 4 car can be designed to handle certain tasks fully or drive within a limited geographical area.", "It will still require a human driver to handle situations that are too complex, like a difficult merge onto a busy highway. The biggest difference is that if this level car encounters a situation it cannot handle on its own it has to be able to safely abort the drive by parking the car until the human inside can take over.", "Currently, Google\u2019s self-driving Waymo fleet contains level 4 vehicles. Meaning they can be operated without anyone inside but they are restricted to certain locations. Now, they are located inside the Phoenix area.", "Ford is planning to make its own commercially available self-driving car by 2022, with a little shift of time frames caused by the pandemic.", "And this is the holy grail of self-driving vehicles. A car that is always in control of everything going on while steering. It will not require any intervention from the driver at all.", "What's even crazier is that most level 5 concept cars do not even have a steering wheel. It should be able to handle any condition that a human would. Theoretically, it should be able to do everything even better and be safer than a human driver.", "Even though companies like Nvidia and Audi are currently working on level 5 cars and the technology required for that, it is highly unclear when this will become a reality.", "Not only the public has to believe that a self-driving car would safely bring them from start to finish and not drive them off a cliff. There are also significant issues with government regulations of such cars.", "Fully self-driving vehicles are not yet available and it is rather difficult to define what these cars should be able to do. The SAE scale allows us to better define the current level of development. It can also help regulate such vehicles and the testing they require.", "It also helps highlight the issues related to each level and what has to be done to actually achieve the fully autonomous vehicles.", "Your home for data science.
