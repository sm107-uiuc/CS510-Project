You do a Google search and see various sources report that there is currently a shortage of Data Scientists and the demand will continue to rapidly grow.

Referring back to the list I mentioned above, many people start to turn away from learning Data Science because they do not have the time to learning everything.", "This is 100% understandable. Most people who are interested in learning about Data Science are not able to just step away from life for a few months to a year to learn all of these complex topics. I was one of those people with the same issues, but then COVID-19 came.", "COVID-19 has forced many of us (including myself) into stay at home situations, leaving many people out of work.

I am not trying to discredit any of those sites at all. They are very good learning resources and many people have had success from utilizing them. I was just not one of them and needed a different approach. I would learn something, then forget how to do it the next day. It was a repetitive cycle of me completing modules, yet not feeling like I learned a thing.", "Then one day, around the beginning of April, I came across a Data Science content creator named Ken Jee on YouTube. The first video of his that I watched, I remember he said that the best way to learn Data Science is by doing projects.", "At that moment, a light bulb went off in my head.", "I browsed to one of his playlist\u2019s on his YouTube channel where he walked through how to tackle a Data Science project from the project planning phase, to deploying the model. I thoroughly watched through his tutorial series and recreated it as my own project. Not only did I learn things, but I was implementing them and using the concepts into a real project. By doing this, I started to retain piece by piece of what I did.", "All of a sudden, things started to make sense.", "While developing my first project, I stumbled across another Data Science content creator named Chanin Nantasenamat, who goes by the alias of Data Professor on his YouTube channel. He created a tutorial on how to make a Data Science portfolio website with Hugo and GitHub pages which I followed. This was a huge confidence booster because I now had a visual platform to showcase my projects as I complete them. I will link the finished product here for those who are curious on how it looks.
