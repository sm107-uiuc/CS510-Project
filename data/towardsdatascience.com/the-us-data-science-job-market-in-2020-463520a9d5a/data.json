Data Engineers are the second largest group, occupying 23% of all positions. Only 17% are Business Analysts and 10% are Data Scientists. Other analysts (System Analysts, Quality Analysts, Reporting Analysts, \u2026etc.) account for 22.7%. All analyst-type hires combined dominate the total hires by 67%.", "However, from the graph below, we see the overall salary distribution of Data Scientists locates much more to the right comparing with those of Data Engineers and Analysts, showing Data Scientists\u2019 salaries are obviously higher.", "In general, the average salary of all data science jobs is $89,000 a year, but the variance is quite high. The middle 50% centered by the median ($80,000) can range from $60K to $110K.", "Although many jobs are temporarily remote, most companies still plan to resume to their physical offices after the economy reopens and specify the job location when hiring. However, as many companies pay their employees differently based on the candidate\u2019s current residential location, the final deal with each candidate during the pandemic is unknown in this dataset.", "Not surprisingly, a California-based job is paid more ($110K+), but such a big gap, up to $50K a year, between California and others like Florida is still astonishing. Moreover, regardless of living costs, data science professionals in Texas are definitely undervalued, given such a high demand.", "Some would attribute the salary variation to living costs of the location. If that were the case, New York and San Francisco would have been with the highest salary level for data science professionals. However, cities in Silicon Valley with mid-high living costs such as Santa Clara, Sunnyvale and San Jose actually perform much better. Therefore, some other factors that made Silicon Valley prosperous might be the real cause to those high salary pays.", "Here is another view to how job location has a great impact on salaries. Earlier we saw Data Scientists\u2019 salaries (avg. $123K) are significantly higher than Data Engineers and Analysts, but notice the second peak on the left of the distribution below (salaries from lower than $90K)? They look as if a bunch of Analysts\u2019 salaries being misplaced with the title \u201cData Scientists\u201d.", "It turns out that, as job descriptions are confirmed to be similar, the presence of California as the job location in the high-paid group (\u2265$90K) is a lot higher. On the other hand, the underpaid group (<$90K) locates more at lower-salary states such as Texas and Illinois.", "Also, from the regression analysis, nearly half of the variables in the final model are related to job locations, which outweigh other factors such as seniority, industries and sectors.", "Giant companies are not always the top choice in pursuit of higher salaries. Although in general giant companies (with 10,000+ employees and revenues above $5 billion) tend to pay higher, financially-unpublic small-and-medium businesses (SMBs) would also offer competitive packages.", "In the heatmap below, the left-hand side shows the number of companies hiring data science professionals with their size and scale, whereas the right-hand side shows the average salaries they offer. Some buckets with extremely high salaries but low sample sizes are considered extreme values (e.g. only three companies are with 10,000+ employees and revenue $1\u20132 billion. That they offer $152K would be regarded as a rare case).", "From the next heatmap for Data Scientists\u2019 salaries and the upcoming ones for Business Analysts, Data Analysts, and Data Engineers, we would gradually realize that giant companies only pay much higher salaries to Data Scientists, which require higher qualifications as well, but for other types of positions, high-paying clusters are small to medium businesses.", "Some keywords on job titles also have an impact on the salaries. The most obvious one is \u201cMachine Learning\u201d (sometimes \u201cML\u201d). Data shows \u201cMachine Learning\u201d written on the job title would increase this job\u2019s salary by more than 10%. However, the often pairing phrase \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d does not have comparable effects, and \u201cMachine Learning\u201d seldom shows up on analysts\u2019 titles.", "Likewise, \u201cMachine Learning\u201d appears more frequent in the job descriptions for Data Scientists and Data Engineers than in those for analysts. On the other hand, Data Scientists are required or preferred to have a much extended breadth of qualifications, including PHD degrees, whereas other positions focus more on fewer skillsets and require/prefer only Master degrees or lower.", "For Data Engineers, in addition to common skills such as Python and SQL, data infrastructure words and phrases such as Hadoop, Spark, AWS and ETL appear much more frequent than other positions.", "Both Data Analysts and Business Analysts have similar qualifications such as EXCEL, SQL and a Master degree. However, Data Analysts tend to use more Python and be a bit more statistically intensive, and, intriguingly, Business Analysts hires somehow prefer a Computer Science degree much more than a MBA degree.", "We have learnt the characteristics, composition and salary distributions of Data Science jobs. We also clarified that entering giant companies is not a high-paying guarantee. Although job location is the top factor to the salary variation, we can still find that some keywords on titles such as \u201cMachine Learning\u201d would have a significant impact, along with other factors. The datasets being analyzed were published in July 2020 and not time-series data, so changes over time are not monitored, not to mention the impact of pandemic on the salaries. Meanwhile, it seems that most companies are still hiring with specified locations instead of directly announcing to be remote.", "Your home for data science.
