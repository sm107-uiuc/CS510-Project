When running an experiment, the steps follow as:", "When using p-values, stakeholders blindly compare this value to some threshold (0.05 in most cases) to make a decision. This comparison is made with some vague understanding of when the p-value is small, we choose the alternative hypothesis. However, even this statement is fundamentally against the theory associated with how a p-value is calculated.", "Consider we are in the first scenario, and we are interested in knowing which of two landing pages is \u201cbetter\u201d. Outlining the steps of an experiment specific for this example might follow as:", "In an introductory statics course, you will learn to use some sort of two-sample t-test, where you need to determine if the variances of your groups are equal or different. Then compute the standard error, which you can then use to determine a p-value.", "If you are new to t-tests and searching in python, you will likely run into questions about whether you would use a related t-test, paired t-test, or independent t-test. So, how do you choose? And why do you choose a particular test? How do you know you chose the right test?", "Here is where bootstrapping comes into play to save the day! But if you do choose the right test from all the possible choices, and you use the built-in within Scipy, the corresponding p-value is 0.00008. The code for this solution is quite simple. The difficult part is knowing you made the right choice.", "5. Again from an intro stats course, you may now compare the p-value to 0.05 and choose the alternative that average revenue differs from version 1 to version 2.", "However, to fully understand the conclusion made in this situation, it is important to understand p-values, Type I error rates, and how the combination of these two drives the conclusion in part 5.", "Although the code for this solution is straightforward, knowing which solution to choose and how to interpret the results can both be confusing, especially to those who don\u2019t do hypothesis testing on a regular basis.", "In order to make the final two steps more interpretable, I prefer to use bootstrapping to simulate the distribution for the differences in means. This relates to the ideas associated with traditional p-values and confidence intervals quite well.", "The definition of bootstrapping is sampling with replacement. By sampling with replacement from the original dataset, we can then calculate a difference in average revenue multiple times for each of the bootstrap samples to see how the average difference changes from one bootstrapped sample to the next.", "We can perform bootstrapping for this dataset using the function shown below. Each bootstrap sample, in this case, is a newDataFrame containing a \u201csample with replacement\u201d version of the original rows until we have created a new DataFrame with the same number of rows.", "Using the default of 10,000 bootstrap samples provides back three lists with a value for each bootstrap sample:", "This idea of seeing how much variation exists from one sample to another allows us to see what types of sample estimates we can expect from a population containing these values. The range these estimates take on can help us understand what values are possible, and if these values are consistent with the null or alternative hypothesis.", "The results of the above function can be plotted using the code below.", "Here are what the plots look like:", "From these plots, we can see the average revenue for Version 2 is almost always higher than the average revenue for Version 1 across all bootstrap samples.", "Additionally, the first plot shows the average differences across all bootstrap samples along with the bounds (the dashed blue lines) where the middle 95% of differences fall. Since a difference of zero is not contained between these two bounds, the bootstrap interval provides significant evidence that the difference in the averages is not zero.", "Using the p-value from Scipy did lead us to the same conclusion as the bootstrap method. However, drawing a conclusion from these plots (using the bootstrap method) is much more intuitive than using the traditional approach of p-values (in my opinion).", "Your home for data science.
