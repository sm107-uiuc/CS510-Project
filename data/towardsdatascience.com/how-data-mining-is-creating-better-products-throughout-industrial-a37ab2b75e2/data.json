Bosch is able to be the top of the line appliance manufacturer because of its commitment to quality. Bosch even goes so far as to record data at every step along its assembly lines. By recording data at every step in the production process, Bosch can apply advanced analytics to improve the manufacturing processes. [1] In 2016, Bosh created an open source competition on Kaggle which allows people of all backgrounds and levels of experience to use data science techniques to solve internal failures for Bosch. Kagglers are to predict internal failures using thousands of measurements and tests made for each component along the assembly line. This would enable Bosch to bring quality products at lower costs to the end user. [1] Prizes are offered in the amount of $30,000 for the first, second, and third palce winner with the first place winner receiving $15,000, the second place winner $10,000, and the third place winner receiving $5,000.", "Advanced fault detection methods through data mining sensors are increasingly being needed throughout industry. Vedika et al in the IEEE Intelligent Systems Journal, discusses the need for advanced algorithms, which can provide automatic early detection and diagnosis of faults in coal mills, so that control actions can be taken in time. Vedika et al explains how the fault detection systems in thermal power plants coal mills usefixed alarm limits which are configured for process variables in the distributed control system (DCS), activating an alarm once the value of the variable crosses its upper or lower limit. The system reacts to the abnormalities only after extensive damage has occurred. [2]", "When advanced algorithms are applied to data mined from sensors, faults can be detected before damage is detected saving materials, increasing productivity, hense increasing profits for the company, and decreasing the consumer cost. [2] Vedika et al introduces and additional step in the current algorthm called the adaptive learning model (ALM). The current algorithm has the start and stop process initiated by the worker. Data aquistion is gathered by sensors throughout the process, the data is preprocessed and then used by the model. The data looks for residual information based on noise from the plant and then outputs whether an fault is detected or not. Vedika et al introduces an adaptive learning model (ALM) just after the residual generation analysis. The ALM is implemented to learn the drift from wear and tear of the machinery that occurs within the plant.", "To use data from sensors, Vedika et al explains the two types of data pre-processing essentials for FD applications. The article discusses the use of offline data pre-processing which involves pre-processing the training data set employed for model development. [2] Online data pre-processing involves pre-processing the data in online mode during fault detection. Data pre-processing is mostly applied to reduce missing values, outliers, and random noise in the data. Vedika et al explains the common methods to deal with missing values include case deletion; imputation using mean, median, and mode value; and k-Nearest neighbor (k-NN) Imputation. [2] The journal explains how statistical models such as 3\u03c3 edit rule, z-score, and boxplots are most suitable for quantitative real valued data. To remove the noise several approaches are proposed such as linear filters, wavelet analysis, and the Savitzky \u2014 Golay algorithm. The data mined from the sensors are used to detect when there are faults within the system, allowing for technicians to stop the production line when true positives are detected. The technicians fix or adjusts the line, retrain the data based on the adjustments, and restart the line without loss of material or severe damage.", "In the article \u201cData analysis and feature selection for predictive maintenance: A case-study in the metallurgic industry\u201d Marta et al describes how machine learning and data mining can be applied in an industrial setting to predict when components may fail. Components are changed out just before the systems break. InValue which is a company in the metallurgic industry employs machine learning and data mining techniques to uncover new knowledge about the operation and maintenance of equipment collected by a data acquisition module. [3] The information collected about the specific operational parameters are used to prevent deteriorization of a machines components. When the deteriorization is detected the components are changed out preventing catestrophic failure and maximizing productivity.", "The internet of things (I.O.T) and the implemention of 5G more and more companies will use Big Data in their processes. Machine learning and data mining will be used to make discoveries of the unknown which will enhance operations, increase productivity, cure diseases, and cut the consumers costs. Data Scientist with domain knowledge will become increasingly sought upon, or perhaps will domain experts with the knowledge of data science techniques be the key to the industrial future?", "Your home for data science.
