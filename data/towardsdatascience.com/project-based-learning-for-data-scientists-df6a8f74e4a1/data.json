What makes a really strong Data Scientist candidate is not only a sound technical skill set but also being able to critically think through and solve business relevant problems to guide business decisions.", "In essence, developing a keen sense of how to solve different business problems will set you apart from the field of potential hires during the interview process.", "So, how can we develop your data intuition? In this article, I am going to share with you one of my favorite strategies for developing those key critical thinking skills to get you on the path to developing your data intuition, all through Project-Based Learning.", "Project-Based Learning(PBL) is developing your skills through practical work and application. In the context of Data Science, this means performing data analyses on many different kinds of data using a wide variety of skills you have either mastered or are in the process of mastering. In essence, to develop your data senses and intuition, you need to practice using them.", "As you work through more and more data analyses, or projects, you will be exposed to more and more kinds of data from various domains that will have unique business-relevant questions for you to find and solve.", "The more projects you are able to complete, the more exposure you get to different kinds of data, business problems, and opportunities to develop your data senses.", "Not only that, here are some additional benefits to Project Based Learning:", "Sounds great right? Let me show you how you can get started.", "Setting up your first Data Science Project", "Here is a list of FREE data set repositories that you can peruse through and download a data set of your liking. I would select choosing a data set on a topic you are genuinely curious about, not what you think an employer would want to see.", "Not sure which to pick? Start with Kaggle if you are a beginner. You will have access to other users\u2019 notebooks so you can draw inspiration to get started.", "2. What questions would you like to solve?", "After selecting your data, you\u2019re going to want to load it up into Python and perform an exploratory data analysis(EDA) to get to know your data. If you have never done an EDA before, or need a refresher, feel free to reference this handy book.", "After your EDA, ask yourself \u201cIf a business came to me with this data, what might be something they would like to learn more about? What might be some critical information I could find to help the company improve?\u201d", "For instance if you have time-series data belonging to an online retail company like Amazon, it might be a good idea to look for seasonal trends. Maybe your data has lots of continuous variables. It might be wise to create a correlation matrix to begin your investigation into the different relationships that may exist between the different variables within your data.", "3. Do you have enough data?", "Depending on what questions you came up with for your analysis, you may need to find additional data to add to your analysis to gain additional insights. You also might need to get additional data sets that expand the time frame of your original data.", "For example, Airbnb\u2019s public data sets are only available only in 1-month increments. That\u2019s not bad and is a place to start, however you might be able to create a much more thorough analysis if you had a few years worth of data.", "Organize your project to answer the various questions you came up with in Step 2 and extract as much meaningful information as you can from the data you have.", "This is where the magic happens. You are now in a real world practice scenario with data and important industry relevant questions to solve. You have access to the world wide web to access tons and tons of resources to assist you, you got this.", "This is a great opportunity for yourself to learn new skills and cement your understanding of others. As you run into bugs and other problems, Google and the documentation will become your greatest assets. And you also can access many forums on the web for Data Scientists such as Stackoverflow and Data Science Stack Exchange.", "As you create and work through more and more projects, you get more and more real world practice as an actual Data Scientist. This will slowly but surely grow your data senses into a data killer instinct.", "5. Create a write up of your findings you can share with an audience", "In my opinion, a nice final write-up about your project is a great way to show off your communication and writing skills. What are some of the insights you were able to find through your analysis? What might be some things you would advise a client/manager to do?", "A final write-up is a must have for any project you put on a resume. It gives a hiring manager a chance to quickly peruse your skills and way of thinking to see if you are a possible fit for the team. You\u2019ll definitely want to include different visuals and statistical models you used, and carefully explain what your business problems were and how your work resolves them.", "But alas, that will be a topic for another day :)", "Project Based Learning is the most effective method of developing your data senses as well your technical and communication skills. There are some skills you can only learn on the job and Project Based Learning will put in the driver\u2019s seat to develop those critical data senses.", "Thank you so much for taking the time to read my article, feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions. Until next time!", "My name is Kishen Sharma and I am a Data Scientist based in the Bay Area. I am on a mission to teach and motivate aspiring Data Scientists all across the world.", "Feel free to connect with me on Instagram and check out my additional content here.
