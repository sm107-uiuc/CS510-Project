This one will focus more on past experience and dive into more of the technical portion of what you\u2019ve done within data science and machine learning. While the recruiter gets a sense of your projects at a high level to fit with the team, the hiring manager will ask you more in-depth questions like why you used certain algorithms for a project or how you built different machine learning or analytics systems.", "The hiring manager will also get to tell you more about the roles and responsibilities of the team.
