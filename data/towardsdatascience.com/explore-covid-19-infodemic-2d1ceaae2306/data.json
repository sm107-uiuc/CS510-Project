Similarly, conspiracy theories, myths and exaggerated facts could have consequences that go way beyond public health.", "Thanks to the projects such as Lead Stories, Poynter, FactCheck.org, Snopes, EuVsDisinfo that monitor, identify and fact-check disinformation that spread across the world.", "To explore the content of COVID-19 fake news, I use strict definitions of what true and fake news stories are. Specifically, true news articles are articles that are known to be true and from well trusted news sources. Fake news stories are stories that are known to be false and are from well known fake news websites that are intentionally trying to spread misinformation.", "With the above definitions in mind, I collected over 1,100 news articles and social network posts on COVID-19 from a variety of new sources, then labeled them. The data set can be found here.", "After some cleaning, we can see that we have 586 true articles and 578 fake ones.", "The true articles were largely collected from Harvard Health Publishing, The New York Times, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, WHO, CDC, and so on.", "The fake ones were collected from Facebook posts, a far-right website called Natural News, an alternative medicine website called orthomolecular.org. Some articles or posts were removed from the internet or social networks, however, they were able to make their way to Internet Archive, among others.", "Using the following function, we will be able to read any given news article, so that we can determine how to clean them:", "There article texts are pretty clean, we could just remove punctuation and change to lower case.", "Most of the articles in the data contain less than 1,000 words. Still, few articles contain more than 4,000 words.", "When we separate by label, there isn\u2019t significant difference between true news and fake news in terms of the length of the article. Though most of the true articles seem to be a little shorter than the fake ones, in the data.", "To show the probability density of the text length at different values, we could use violin plot:", "On average, Facebook posts are significantly shorter than Harvard health articles:", "We can present using violin plot as well:", "Perhaps we are all familiar, Facebook fake posts tend to be shorter in terms of content. The people who post them try to persuade readers through heuristics rather than the strength of arguments.", "There isn\u2019t a significant difference in terms of sentiment between true news and fake news. This can be confirmed with the following violin plot:", "When we compare sentiment polarity between these four sources, we can see that the sentiment distribution of New York Times and natural news are much narrower than the sentiment distribution in Harvard health news and Facebook.", "This means the news articles in New York Times and natural news in the data sound less emotional.", "This can be confirmed with the following violin plot:", "I noticed that the news articles and posts I collected are neither very strong positive nor very strong negative. Most of them are in the modest positive range, and most of them less than 1,000 words in length.", "There is no obvious relation between sentiment and length of the article. And in general, sentiment or length of an article does not reflect its authenticity. The distinction between fake and real news can be a rather arbitrary one.", "I noticed Rudy Giuliani\u2019s post had one of the highest sentiment score, curious to know what it is about:", "It is about Hydroxychloroquine, of course.", "Now we are going to understand what themes that included in my data.", "From our data, one stark difference between true and fake news content is that fake news seem to use more often of peoples\u2019 names, this suggest that fake news may be more personal.", "The above two news sources both promote conspiracy theories, however, they do focus on different themes.", "naturalnews.com has been spreading disinformation such as the coronavirus was engineered as a bioweapon in a Chinese lab and/or it was spread to cover up alleged harmful health effects associated with exposure to 5G wireless technology.", "orthomolecular.org has been promoting use of high-dose intravenous vitamin C as a cure which was unfounded.", "Feel free to check out the other sources on your own.", "First, we do not know if there was any selection bias in collecting the data. Second, while we can say these were news stories with high user engagement, we cannot say anything about the actual traffic the stories generated. Despite these limitations, this data set provides reasonable ground truth labels and we know all stories have been widely read and shared.", "Jupyter notebook can be found on Github.
