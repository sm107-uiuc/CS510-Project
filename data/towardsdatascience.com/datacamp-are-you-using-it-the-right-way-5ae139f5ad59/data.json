It should, after all, be no surprise that many platforms are offering tracks to\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://medium.com/u/e18542fdcc02?source=post_page-----5ae139f5ad59--------------------------------", "anchor_text": "DataCamp Team", "paragraph_index": 16}], "all_paragraphs": ["We are generating about 2.5 quintillion bytes a day and the demand for data scientists is increasing more than ever. It should, after all, be no surprise that many platforms are offering tracks to prepare you for a data science career! My favorite so far has been DataCamp. But are you using the platform the right way?", "From high quality content to a user-friendly interface, the platform has everything you need to get started with mastering the basics of the field. Here are a few things you should keep in mind to maximize your learning and make the best out of the platform experience.", "Don\u2019t you just love those thoughtfully tailored career tracks that most data science platforms are curating for users? Whether you are aspiring to be a Python Data Scientist, a Data Engineer or an R Data Analyst, DataCamp curated carefully chosen progressive courses to build a \u201cTrack\u201d (or what other platforms call a \u201cPath\u201d) for you. You start learning in a linear fashion and after about 26 courses, you complete the track you chose. You earn a certificate too!", "But is that enough? Certainly not! And the platform is very well aware of the need for other courses to supplement those tracks. Say you chose (like many of us just starting do) a track as a Python Data Scientist. The curated track offers you everything from an introduction to the Python programming language, to data manipulation and cleaning, to a few machine learning courses, etc\u2026", "What you end up missing is some of the more advanced and targeted courses that are hidden all the way down in the \u201cCourses\u201d tab outside the curated tracks! Courses like the \u201cIntroduction to Deep Learning in Python\u201d, \u201cIntroduction to Natural Language Processing in Python\u201d, \u201cParallel Programming with Dask in Python\u201d, \u201cVisualizing Geospatial Data in Python\u201d, \u201cImage Processing with Keras in Python\u201d, \u201cSoftware Engineering for Data Scientists in Python\u201d and a ton of other super informative and quite necessary courses to get a more of a well-rounded taste of the field.", "There is a great danger (shared among all learning platforms) in passively sitting back and absorbing new information. Are you watching the video lectures? Are you trying your hands at the coding exercises after each video? Are applying the methods and techniques you learned elsewhere on datasets and side-projects you are working on? Are you trying to explain the concepts you just learned to a friend or a data-savvy colleague?", "These are all questions you should be asking yourself on the regular if you want to make sure that your learning is happening actively and with intention. Afterall, it doesn\u2019t matter how many pandas techniques and tricks you know! What matters is how many of them do you really have under your built ready to be used in the right place and context. And always remember that the best way to learn something is to go ahead and try explaining it to someone else.", "Does the Bitcoin Cryptocurrency market fascinate you? Did you ever think of doing a network analysis of Game of Thrones? Maybe you are a baseball fan or a musician and would like to explore a dataset in those topics? Well, the DataCamp \u201cProject\u201d section has something for everyone!", "These guided projects are priceless to get a sense of what it means to apply what you are actually learning. They also prepare you (with guidance) for what you will be doing on your own at the job! Isn\u2019t that great? My advice is to not skip the projects interspersed between courses inside a chosen track. In fact, I would take this a step further; complete those and check out other projects in the \u201cProjects\u201d tab so you are always getting some kind of practice!", "Oh and mentioning practice, did I tell you the platform has a \u201cPractice\u201d section that most of my friends did not even know existed/ever used?", "I think this feature (available also on the mobile app) is absolutely priceless. I love kicking back, loading the app on my phone, and completing a few of the multiple choice questions they have for almost every single course on the platform! These are so much fun to ensure what you learned is staying fresh.", "Practice! Practice! Practice! These MCQ\u2019s are fun, informative, well-written and serve as a great summary for the concepts you are learning in the course you are practicing for! Each practice session starts with a review of the basic course concepts made using simple flashcards. You then proceed to answering questions on the topics of the course. And to add to the fun? You accumulate (I like to think of it as winning) XPs! You can retake each practice session as many times as you think is necessary to make sure you understood the answers to all the questions.", "The last feature I will mention which I really enjoyed using on their platform is the \u201cAssessment\u201d feature. Not only can you take assessments to know more or less where you currently stand, but you can also take assessments regularly to keep checking how much you have improved.", "Even better? The assessments are adaptive and adjust accordingly to your skill level and the answers you provide.", "I found that this also serves as great prep for some of the technical assessments companies will send you to complete when you start your job hunt and when you are ready to land your first Data Science job!", "And what a greater time to land a job in this field and have the data-arsenal to contribute to all the gazillion ways we can make this world a better place?", "Thank you DataCamp Team for kickstarting many people\u2019s journey into data science!", "If interested in reading more of my stories, read how a book about building habits helped me learn data science more effectively:", "Your home for data science.
