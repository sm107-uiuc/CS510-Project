I realized that humanity is simply a really dumb species, I don\u2019t mean it in an offensive way, well it\u2019s offensive either way (sorry!) \ud83d\ude05.", "\u201cThe first thing we should assume is we are very dumb. We can definitely make things smarter than ourselves.\u201d \u2014 Elon Musk \ud83d\ude36", "It\u2019s not a question of will artificial intelligence be smarter than human beings, it already is in several areas, but the real question is how we can leverage this intelligence for good?", "The advancement of artificial intelligence has taken an exponential curve for the past few years.", "Merely 10 years ago, things like Siri and Alexa didn\u2019t even exist.", "Today, we are able to leverage AI to detect cancer from medical images, Google Assistant can book appointments for you over the phone by mimicking human-voice, and developing fake images that are almost flawlessly similar to real images has never been easier before.", "The widespread concerns regarding privacy and misinformation have shunned the spot-light on deepfakes, which are fake media produced using algorithms such as autoencoders and Generative Adversarial Networks.", "In the hands of the wrong person, this technology can be used for fraud. For instance, recently, a deepfaked voice was used to scam the CEO of a UK firm $244,000 \ud83e\udd2f.", "The emergence of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) disrupted the development of fake images.", "Previously, we\u2019ve been using manual methods like photoshop, but with Generative Adversarial Networks, this process is being automated and the results are generally significantly better.", "Generative Adversarial Networks is a relatively new neural network first introduced in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow. The objective of GANs is to produce fake images that are as realistic as possible.", "There are two components involved in GAN:", "The generator takes a latent sample, a vector of random noise in as input. By leveraging de-convolutional layers, which is essentially the reverse of convolutional layers, an image is produced.", "Convolutional layers are responsible for extracting features from an input, de-convolutional layers perform the reverse as it takes the features in as input, and produces an image as the output.", "Let\u2019s say you\u2019re playing charades with friends. The person who\u2019s acting the phrase is performing \u201cde-convolutions\u201d, while the other players guessing the phrase is performing \u201cconvolutions\u201d. The \u201cacting\u201d is analogous to the image, while the \u201cguessing\u201d is analogous to the features of the image.", "In essence, the convolutional layers identify the features of the image, and the de-convolutional layers construct an image given its features.", "The discriminator, on the other hand, leverages convolutional layers for image classification as its job is to predict whether the image produced from the generator is real (1) or fake (0). The objective of the generator is to produce images that are as realistic as possible and successfully fool the discriminator into thinking that the generated images are real.", "The discriminator\u2019s job is critical to the success of the generator. To help the generator produce more realistic images, the discriminator has to be really good at differentiating real images from fake images. The better the discriminator is, the better the generator will be.", "After every iteration, the generator\u2019s learnable parameters, the weights, and biases are refined according to the suggestions given by the discriminator.", "The network updates the learnable parameters by backpropagating through the gradients of the discriminator\u2019s output in regards to the generated image. Essentially, the discriminator tells the generator how it should tweak each pixel so that the image can be more realistic.", "Let\u2019s say the generator created an image and the discriminator thinks the image has a 0.29 (29%) probability of being a real image. The generator\u2019s job is to update its learnable parameters so the probability increases to, for instance, 30% after computing backpropagation.", "The generator, however, relies on the discriminator to be successful.", "A more intuitive way of thinking of this is to imagine how the generator is analogous to the student, and the discriminator to the teacher.", "Remember the time when you wrote a test, and you were so stressed out about your results because you have no idea how well you\u2019ve done.", "The student doesn\u2019t know the mistakes they\u2019ve made until the teachers mark their test and give them feedback. The students\u2019 job is to learn from the feedback the teacher gives them to improve their test scores.", "The better the teacher is at teaching, the better the student\u2019s academic performance gets.", "Theoretically, the better the generator is at creating almost flawlessly realistic images, the better the discriminator gets at differentiating real images from fake images. The same is true for the reverse, the better the discriminator is at image classification, the better the generator will be.", "To classify fake and real images, I used a pre-trained convolutional neural network known as MobileNetV2, which is trained on ImageNet, a 14 million image dataset.", "The main reason why I leveraged MobileNetV2, the 2.0 version of MobileNet instead of constructing my own convolutional neural network is that MobileNetV2 is designed to be mobile-friendly which means that it requires significantly less computational power.", "By adding several additional layers on top of MobileNetV2 and training it off the Real vs Fake images dataset, my model was able to differentiate fake images from real images with a 75% accuracy.", "2. Average Pooling Layer \u2014 This layer is responsible for reducing the dimensions of the data by performing down-sampling. For instance, let\u2019s say we have a 4x4 input matrix, and a 2x2 average pooling layer is applied. Essentially what happens is that for each 2x2 block in the input matrix, the average of those values is taken, thus reduces the dimensions.", "3. Dense Layer \u2014 A dense layer is just a regular fully connected layer where every node in each layer is connected to every node in the next layer. The activation function, ReLU ( R(z) = max (0,z) )is applied to this layer and is essentially responsible for restricting the range to only positive values.", "4. Batch Normalization Layer \u2014 This layer is responsible for normalizing the inputs passed through that layer for the purpose of enhancing the stability of the neural network.", "5. Dropout Layer \u2014 This layer is responsible for preventing overfitting by setting the activations of certain random nodes to 0. In the dropout layer, there are no learnable parameters (ie. this isn\u2019t a training layer like the other layers).", "6. The Output Layer \u2014 This is essentially a regular dense layer with the softmax activation function applied. The softmax function produces an output between 0\u20131, which represents the probability distribution of the final predicted output classes.", "The accuracy of this model can be easily enhanced by having a larger dataset. I trained the model on a dataset of 2041 images, but imagine if we trained it on 1 million images, the accuracy of the model can be significantly higher!", "The applications of GANs aren\u2019t just restricted to negative purposes like creating misinformation, it can actually be applied to so many industries in a positive way!", "Some pretty interesting uses of GANs:", "By leveraging GANs we can potentially accelerate advancements in machine learning itself!", "We can leverage GANs to tackle the issue around a small dataset, one of the major bottlenecks in machine learning by generating new data that are similar to the real data in the dataset.", "Having a larger dataset is one of the most reliable ways to enhance the performance of classification-based machine learning programs.", "\ud83d\uddbc\ufe0f One of the potential applications might be to leverage GANs to generate synthetic brain-MRI images to improve the detection of glioma, a type of brain cancer.", "\ud83d\udc8a The most exciting application is leveraging GANs to synthesize new molecules or drug candidates that target a specific protein or biomarker which causes disease.", "To do this, the generator is responsible for generating the new molecule, and then the discriminator predicts the role of the molecules to see if it can either inhibit or excite a certain protein. GANs can we used to advance and accelerate the process of drug discovery.", "\ud83c\udfa5 In the film and comic industry, GANs can be used for text to image synthesis.", "There are so many more practical applications of GANs! There is potential in this technology to disrupt many industries, ranging from healthcare to film!
