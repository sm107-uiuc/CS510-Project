For the identification we developed a Deep Learning approach which resulted in a high rate of correct microfossil identification (98% IoU). To validate it we use ground truths generated by specialists in the micropaleontology field. We also present the first fully annotated MicroCT-acquired publicly available microfossils dataset.", "The applicability of the computational analysis of paleontological images ranges from the study of animals, plants and evolution of microorganisms to the simulation of the habitat of living beings of a given epoch.", "But nowadays paleontology is not only a pure science anymore. It also can be applied to solve problems in areas of economical activity, such as oil exploration, where there are several factors to be analyzed in order to identify the potential of an exploration site and minimize the expenses related to the oil extraction process. One factor is the characterization of the environment to be explored. This analysis can occur in several ways: use of probes, extraction of samples for petrophysical components evaluation or the correlation with logs of other drilling wells.", "When we look at samples extraction, fossils found in sedimentary rock are central for the characterization of this rock. Here Computed Tomography (CT) is of importance because it preserves the sample and makes it available for several analyzes. Based on 3D images generated by CT, several analyzes and simulations can be performed and processes, currently performed manually and exhaustively, can be automated.", "Imagine the following scenario: A paleontologist receives a rock sample with microfossils for analysis. The time needed for the complete process of microfossils isolation, performed manually, is long and after this process the rock sample is destroyed. After this, the paleontologist will analyze the microfossils in physical isolation with a microscope and classify manually each isolated fossil.", "Now let\u2019s hypothesize that the company where this paleontologist works acquired an AI-based tomographic image analysis software, specific for microfossil analysis. This software performs the microfossil identification and extraction from the rock sample automatically with minimal or no supervision at all. The paleontologist now can load his tomographic sample, select the specific pipeline and leave the procedure executing during the night, leaving to the paleontologist only the work of evaluating the obtained results and classify each extracted microfossil.", "You can perform this workflow above employing Semantic Segmentation with Deep Learning. Let\u2019s see how\u2026", "We employed a scanned carbonatic rock sample obtained from a drilling rig probe collected at the Sergipe Basin Quaternary sediments, off the northeast coast of Brazil. For the training of our Semantic Segmentation network, a team of micropalentologists generated a Ground Truth for this rock sample, segmenting and classifying manually the whole MicroCT volume. The scanner used to digitalize the sample was a Versa XRM-500 (ZEISS/XRadia), with a volume size of 956x1004x983 voxel.", "The full dataset, together with additional explanations and the specialist-annotated Ground Truth of manually segmented images is available here: http://www.lapix.ufsc.br/microfossil-segmentation.", "The Deep Learning API we employed was the fast.ai/PyTorch framework and with hyperparameter optimization (HYPO) we acquired a IoU of 0.98 with UNET + ResNet34 (or ResNet50). The different kinds of HYPO are important here and we will explain them below.", "HYPO #1: Variable Resolution. The MicroCT data posed a challenge: the memory requirements imposed by both the dataset size we employed and the UNET architecture would strongly limit the batch size of our training set. In order to overcome this limitation and be able to initially work with larger batch sizes and train the network at a faster pace, we employed a step-wise progressive improving image resolution training strategy.", "For this purpose we performed the training in three cycles: we started our transfer learning with the dataset at 1/4 of the original MicroCT image resolution; trained the model; re-sized the dataset to 1/2 of the original resolution; trained again and, after that, we employed the full CT volume resolution for a final fine tuning training cycle. The outline of this strategy was originally presented by Jeremy Howard in May, 2018 in this discussion posting and later as an informal communication during a CNN lecture available at https://course.fast.ai/videos/?lesson=1. The figure below shows our interpretation of the step-wise progressive improving resolution training workflow employed.", "HYPO #2: Differential Learning Rate: Another strategy for fine-tuning our model is the Differential Learning Rates (DLR) strategy, also informally presented by Jeremy Howard during a lecture of the same fast.ai course series.", "When performing transfer learning followed by fine tuning, in the first layers the pre-trained model being adapted will learn generic low level features from the new dataset being used in the transfer learning. These low level features are very probably similar to those of the original dataset, regardless of the image context. So, there is no need for employing high learning rates at these first layers. As information gets deeper into the network, the feature combinations become more complex and dataset-specific, and are more directly connected to the application context. Higher learning rates in deeper layers are desirable in order to allow the network to better adapt to context-specific features.", "HYPO # 3: Fit1Cycle: We trained the network employing the fit1cycle method originally developed by Leslie N. Smith:", "This method is fast, it will allow us to employ only 5 epochs in the first Transfer Learning stage.", "If you want to to know more about the new learning API in the fastai library, look at this notebook prepared by Sylvain Gugger.", "Below is the code for the semantic segmentation of microfossil samples in MicroCT-acquired bore cores from carbonatic rocks. This is the code we published as a notebook (https://github.com/awangenh/Segmentation-of-Microfossils-in-Carbonatic-Rocks) and it assumes that you are either using Google Colab or that you have the latest versions of PyTorch and fast.ai installed. You\u2019ll also need a GPU with at least 11 GB RAM.", "The Intersection Over Union (IOU) Metric and a function to save prediction definitions", "Definition of weight decay, metric, model and if we employ imageNet weights", "Here is where we start the training part. First we employ the 256x252(1/4) resolution.

Smith.", "Employ a Differential Learning Rate (DLR) and Train the learner", "Now we will perform the same as above again, just now with a resolution of 1024x1024. We will employ a shorter transfer learning stage. Most cells below go uncommented because we are repeating steps, only with a few different parameters\u2026", "What do you do if your training was interrupted? This can happen because you reached your 12 hours of continuous \u201cfree\u201d operating time on a Google Colab notebook or because your computer stopped for some reason. I live in Brazil and events of power shortages are common\u2026", "The fit_one_cycle method works with varying, adaptive learning rates, following a curve where the rate is first increased and then decreased. If you interrupt a training in epoch #10 of, say, 20 epochs and then start again for more 9 epochs, you\u2019ll not have the same result as training uninterruptedly for 20 epochs. You have to be able to record where you stopped and then resume the training cycle from that point and with the correct hyperparameters for that part of the cycle.", "The first thing you have to do is to save your network every epoch:", "This will have your network be saved every epoch, with the name you provided followed by _#epoch. So at epoch #3, the file saved_net_3.pth will be written. This file you can load after you:", "After reloading the .pth file, you can restart your training, only you\u2019ll tell fit_one_cycle to consider 20 epochs, but to start training from epoch #4.", "To learn how this is done, look here:", "The fit_one_cycle method in fast.ai has been developed to allow you to tell it from which part of the cycle to resume an interrupted training. The code for resuming a training will look like this:", "fast.ai will tell you \u201cLoaded <callback_save_file>_<previous_epoch#>\u201d and resume training.", "You can look at all parameters supported by the fit_one_cycle method here:", "(A) shows microfossils identified and segmented by the network in a MicroCT slice. (B) shows the fossil in detail and (C) shows a microtomographic image of the fossil after it was manually extracted. (D) shows a microscope photograph of the same sample.", "Convolutional neural networks and deep learning can successfully be applied to solve problems in Marine Micropaleontology, a field where you wouldn\u2019t expect AI would find an application. A semantic segmentation network can be trained to reliably find the microfossils in microtomographic images of sedimentary rocks, gained from bore cores obtained at oil exploration rigs. An off-the-shelf UNet framework with a ResNet34 as its network is enough to solve this problem.", "We also tested other networks and have some new publications:", "The memory problem posed by the huge amount of data in a microtomographic volume can be solved employing a new HYPO strategy: a step-wise progressive improving image resolution training strategy.
