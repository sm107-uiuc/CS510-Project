I am sharing some lessons learned and a \u201c1+1+1 Process\u201d that helped me to land interviews (and job offers) at the most prestigious companies. I also included mini-challenges to help you get things started.", "Disclaimer: I use the term Data Science and ML interchangeably. My opinions are strictly from personal experience and don\u2019t represent the official hiring guidelines of my employer.", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter. Check out my \u201cInfluence with Machine Learning\u201d guide. It helps data scientists to problem-solve, design, and communicate better.", "I was invited to speak to a group of aspiring data scientists recently. A student asked: \u201chow do you get someone to refer you? I am not that outgoing.\u201d", "My short answer: you don\u2019t need to ask for a referral if you get a few things right ahead of time, especially if you\u2019re an introvert.", "Reflecting on my own journey, most of my interviews (and job offers) at top consulting firms, big tech firms, a Wall Street Hedge Fund, and AI start-ups originated from cold relationships, not from old friends nor sending in resumes.", "As an introvert, it was an extremely daunting experience every time I needed to cold email, network, and navigate the conversation. But as my career progress, I started to approach such interaction differently. In this post, I will share an approach and process to make it easier and more effective.", "To set the expectation, you must be aware and ready for the following:", "So, how can you get referrals without asking for one? Let\u2019s break it down by the steps. The lessons here mostly apply to build cold relationships (e.g. people not in your family and existing friends network).", "There is no way around this. You must invest time to develop the basic skillsets and \u201cbrand\u201d so that people can feel confident in bringing you to their teams and networks. How can you be \u201creferrable\u201d? As aspiring Data Scientists, I think there are a few ways to stand out:", "Mini-Challenge #1: Take your most recent school or passion projects, clean up the code, write a simple 1-page summary that your grandma can understand, upload to Github or your personal website. Show it to 1\u20132 people every day for the next 1\u20132 weeks. Get feedback and ask them to share with their friends who might find it interesting and useful. If you have trouble getting started, check out my post on a 12-Hour Challenge and try it.", "Who are the \u201cright\u201d people? If you have all the time and energy in the world, you should get to know every interesting individual. But, realistically, you are likely running against a hiring schedule or runway to the next job. So, my recommendation is to make connections in the following order:", "What are the right companies? In my experience, it\u2019s more effective to get referrals from people who work at start-ups and medium-sized companies. Big companies usually have standard campus hiring processes for entry-level positions and most people would refer their friends and acquaintances who are more experienced to non-entry level jobs.", "You can take a look at this article where I breakdown the type of data science roles and companies.", "Understand what Data Science is really about. Find the type of data science role that fits your profile and interest. Come up with a list of target companies from small to large, the job titles, and start connecting with people on LinkedIn based on the priorities I suggested in Step 2.", "Mini-Challenge #2: Write down 5 companies you want to join (1\u20132 big companies, 2\u20133 medium-size companies, and 3\u20134 start-ups). Find 1\u20133 data science/analytics job postings at each of these companies. Find 1\u20132 manager level people at each of these companies on LinkedIn. Connect with the ones in the same city or went to the same school first, don\u2019t connect with everyone all at once. Send them a good introduction message by following Step 3 below.", "Not everyone will accept and respond to your LinkedIn invitation and messages. From my experience, it\u2019s a 50\u201370% acceptance rate and a 20\u201330% response rate (e.g. to get 1 person to respond, you need to connect with at least 8-10 people).", "You can\u2019t really do anything about the acceptance rate, but you can try to improve the response rate depending on how you write your message.", "In my experience, shorter messages with clear asks and options work better. As an introvert, I used to think such messages are rude and abrupt. But it\u2019s more important to respect others\u2019 time by letting them know how they can help \u2014 and make it easy.", "To make it concrete, here is a bad example that landed in my inbox a few days ago.", "I know the person is looking for help, but I didn\u2019t know what and how I could help.", "Overall, the goal of the introduction message should be letting the recipients know why and how they can help with the minimum amount of mental energy.", "Here are a few principles I follow:", "With these in mind, here is how I\u2019d re-write the LinkedIn message:", "\u201cHi Ian, thanks for accepting my invitation. I love your articles on Medium (\ud83d\ude09, okay maybe not the wink). I am exploring Data Science opportunities and saw an opening at your company (include a link if available). You can check out my resume and work here (links to resume and portfolio). Are you free to have a quick 15-min chat at 3pm this or next Friday? If you think there is a better person I can speak with, it will be great if you can connect us.\u201d", "You can take elements from this message and adapt to your own use. There are many good email and message templates online. Stick to the principles and find your own style.", "Once you have a meeting set up with the right person from the right company and team with the right introduction message, now comes the moment of truth: get the person to put you in the interview process.", "Having to chat with strangers and asking for favours might be the most overwhelming process for introverted data scientists. Unfortunately, I can\u2019t provide a script because the conversation can happen in many forms depending on the personality of the other person, the mood of everyone before and during the meeting, the context of the hiring process, etc.", "The good news is, at this stage, the person you are about to meet knows your intention (e.g. get a job at his / her team or get connected to someone else), is in a position to influence and act, and is open to help or at least listen to what you can offer. Your chance of getting a \u201creferral\u201d is already much higher than randomly talking to someone or sending in resumes to a generic inbox.", "To make the conversation less daunting and more effective, here are a set of mental and conversational tricks I found useful:", "Now you\u2019ve done what you can. Let life take care of the rest.", "During the meeting, it is important to be able to facilitate conversations and tell good stories about yourself. It is too risky and expensive to practice with hiring managers (you need to be ready when you show up to the meeting).", "Mini-Challenge #3: Prepare how you\u2019d like to explain your work, what is interesting about it, and why it matters. Rehearse by yourself. Bring up the stories casually during drinks or coffee with your close friends. Aim to have them ask questions and follow the flow of the conversation. Practice thinking and articulating on the spot, avoid pre-scripting everything.", "Like I mentioned in the beginning, building relationships takes time, patience, and discipline. As my work and life get busier, I developed a process of building new and maintaining existing networks (as an introvert, I don\u2019t naturally do this well, so I have to rely on a process).", "It\u2019s called the \u201c1+1+1 Process\u201d: try to meet one new person and catch up with one old friend, acquaintance, or co-worker every month on Friday afternoons (e.g. 1+1+1). If you have more time and want to accelerate, you can adjust the number of people and frequency (e.g. 3+2 every 2 weeks).", "As you go through the job-hunting process, you can adopt this process to start and maintain the momentum of building relationships that you can lean on now or in the future.", "There is no short cut. Prepare to invest time, energy, and most importantly, your genuine interest in people. Good things will come. Until the next time!", "Like What You Read? Follow me on Medium, LinkedIn, and Twitter.
