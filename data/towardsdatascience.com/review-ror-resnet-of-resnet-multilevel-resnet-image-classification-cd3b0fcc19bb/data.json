After the success of ResNet which become an state-of-the-art deep learning approaches and won numerous recognition competitions, there were numerous researches working on how to generalize or improve the ResNet, such as Pre-Activation ResNet, ResNet in ResNet (RiR), ResNet with Stochastic Depth (SD), Wide Residual Network (WRN). RoR is another paper to improve the ResNet, they introduce a concept that a group of ResNet blocks can also have one shortcut connection. This makes a network become multi-level hierarchical ResNet. This is a paper firstly appeared in 2016 after ResNet, accepted in 2017 and finally published in 2018 TCSVT recently, which have got tens of citations already. (Sik-Ho Tsang @ Medium)", "Original ResNet is shown at the left above, numerous Residual Blocks are cascaded together and form a very deep network.", "Within a Residual Block, there are two paths:", "With Shortcut Connection paths, gradient vanishing problem can be reduced because error signal can be propagated to early layers easier during back propagation.", "RoR shown at the right above, proposes that we can also have shortcut connection across a group of Residual Blocks. On top of this, we can also have another level of shortcut connection across a group of \u201cgroups of Residual Blocks\u201d.", "For the middle-level shortcuts, each shortcut will be across the Residual Blocks which have the same size of feature maps.", "And m = 4 and 5 are also tested, but without any details about it in the paper. Nevertheless, the results are not good enough compared with m = 3.", "RoR is applied to different versions of ResNet as shown above.", "To be brief, RoR-3 uses Conv-BN-ReLU. Pre-RoR-3 uses BN-ReLU-Conv while WRN is the wider and shallower version of Pre-RoR-3. (If interested, please read my reviews of Original ResNet, Pre-Activation ResNet, and WRN.)", "ImageNet: 1000-class large scale dataset in ILSVRC.", "Different layer versions of RoR-3 consistently outperforms different layer versions of ResNet.", "There are detailed ablation experiments within the paper. If interested, please visit the paper.", "Similar approach, using long and short skip connections, has also been applied to biomedical image segmentation. Hopefully I can cover it as well.", "[2018 TCSVT] [RoR]Residual Networks of Residual Networks: Multilevel Residual Networks", "Your home for data science.
