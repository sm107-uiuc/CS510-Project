This open-source application is flexible and, most importantly, interactive. This is a tool you need for basic data science tasks, such as data cleaning, building visualizations, creating machine learning models and a lot more. You can write here Python or R code (depending on the kernel you use), save results of code execution in the cells and share them with other people.", "I can\u2019t imagine my work without Jupyter Notebooks. They are shareable, fast to set up, and simple to use even if you\u2019re just starting your path into the data analysis world or learning Python.", "If you work with data in Python a lot, you may look at it in a summarized form quite often. In Python, you can group or pivot your data using built-in functions from the pandas library.", "A classical way to go with pivoting is to use the good-old pivot_table method. As for most Python methods, its syntax is straightforward and easy to read.", "However, the more complicated logic of the pivot table\u2019s layout you have, the more time you may require to code it. Besides, the resulting pivot table is always static rather than interactive. Each time you need to arrange data on the pivot grid to see it from a different angle, rewriting code is needed. Yes, this may involve not so many changes, but instead, you could spend this time focusing on your data and getting a better understanding of it.", "Today I\u2019d like to show you an alternative way to pivot your data in Jupyter Notebooks. After mastering this approach, you\u2019ll easily generate interactive reports in no time.", "The greatest thing about the approach I\u2019m going to show is that you can save the resulting notebook with interactive data visualization components to HTML and send it to your friends and teammates. They can open it in the browser, play with the pivot table and pivot charts, gain their personal insights, save the report they configured and resend it to you. This may make the entire data analysis experience more productive.", "We\u2019ll be working in JupyterLab since it\u2019s an extremely comfy environment to run your notebooks in. JupyterLab is simply a user-interface for Jupyter Notebooks. Everything you use in a classical Jupyter is here: notebooks, file browser. But JupyterLab offers more extended functionality: you can install extensions, expand and collapse cells, drag and drop them \u2014 the feature you may lack in Jupyter. Also, the text editor provides a tab auto-complete feature.", "So, run your JupyterLab and let\u2019s start!", "First and foremost, let\u2019s import the Python libraries we need. These include pandas, json, and the display module from IPython. All these libraries are shipped with Anaconda distribution, but if you\u2019re not working with it, you may need to install these libraries globally or within your virtual environment.", "For data visualization, we\u2019ll be using Flexmonster Pivot Table & Charts, which is a JavaScript library.", "What about data? For the demonstration purposes, I\u2019ve chosen an \u2018Avocado Prices\u2019 dataset from Kaggle. It\u2019s lightweight and contains a reasonable number of fields. Instead, you can choose any data set you like.", "\u25b6 Load your data. Using pandas, read CSV data to the dataframe. Drop the column `Unnamed: 0` \u2014 an index column that often appears when reading CSV files.", "\u25b6 Call the to_json() method on the dataframe to convert it to a JSON string and save it to the json_data variable.", "\u25b6 Now let\u2019s create an instance of Flexmonster using a nested dictionary. Here we specify all the necessary initialization parameters and pass the decoded data to the component. For decoding JSON, we use json.loads() method.", "\u25b6 Now we encode Python object into JSON using json.dumps():", "\u25b6 The next step is to define a function that renders the pivot table directly into the cell. For this, we\u2019ll define a multi-line string and pass it to the imported HTML function:", "\u25b6 Finally, we can pass the JSON to this rendering function and call it:", "Voila! You see the interactive pivot table on the page. And the data set is ready to work with: you can rearrange the fields on the grid, change aggregations, set filtering and sorting, format values, and do everything to create your unique report. Besides, if you miss the way records were displayed within the dataframe, you can switch from the pivot mode to the flat view. This way you\u2019ll see the data as it comes from the source, but with interactive functionality.", "Here\u2019s how the pivot table looks like now:", "Additionally, you can try applying conditional formatting to focus on the values that matter most.", "Now, let\u2019s complicate our logic a bit by adding more elements to the notebook. Two pivot charts will make our data visualization more versatile. For this, we\u2019ll define an extra function that accepts multiple JSON components and renders them on the page. Its logic is the same as for a single pivot table. Pivot charts components are defined in the same way as for a pivot table.", "In the report slices for pivot charts, we can set Top X filters, which are comfy for limiting the number of categories displayed on the pivot charts. This makes them more neat and compact.", "Hooray! Now you can enjoy an interactive dashboard inside your Jupyter Notebook! Don\u2019t hesitate to generate a report on your data analysis and share it.", "Today we tried a new way of manipulating and presenting data in Jupyter Notebook, using Python and a JavaScript data visualization library. As you see, it takes not too much code and time to set everything up.", "Once you do it, you can explore your data right in the workspace you\u2019ve got used to.", "This approach frees you from rewriting bits of code each time you need to look differently at the data. And it goes hand-in-hand with the central idea of Jupyter Notebooks \u2014 to make the data visualization and data analysis interactive and flexible.", "You can find the full code on GitHub. \ud83d\udc48", "To fulfill your curiosity on what else you can enhance in your dashboard, here\u2019s a brief list of top features you can make your reporting better with:", "All too often, the real-world data is neither neat nor consistent. Fields can be named using different cases, they may also contain indistinctive contractions, etc. To prettify it, we can use mapping \u2014 the report\u2019s property that sets view configurations applied to the data source. Another benefit that comes with its formatting functionality is the explicit setting of data types. By setting the types, you tell the component to treat the fields the way you intended, e.g., like strings, numbers, or dates. This will affect the choice of aggregations available for field hierarchies.", "In the GitHub sample, you can see how to define a mapping object and set it to the pivot table.", "The pivot table comes with JavaScript API methods and events. You can configure saving reports in different formats locally or to remote destinations such as servers with the exportTo method.", "To introduce new formulas to the report, you can add calculated values.", "Your home for data science.
