As stated by the World Health Organisation (WHO), \u201epneumonia is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children under five years old. [\u2026] Pneumonia caused by bacteria can be treated with antibiotics, but only one-third of children with pneumonia receive the antibiotics they need.\u201c", "Additionally, today there is already a shortage of needed radiologists. Each existing one has much more work to do than in former times. In a general hospital, radiologists are doing this pneumonia classification manually on their viewing stations hour by hour. As mentioned in the \u2018AI in Healthcare\u2019 journal, for radiologists artificial intelligence methods like deep learning are going to \u201cexpedite and improve their ability to interpret images\u201c.", "Regarding pneumonia X-ray images, artificial intelligence (AI) learning methods could ease the medical workflow and increase the diagnosis correctness rate, because an estimation can be given automatically and efficiently for thousands of images in a short time, even difficult ones not easy to diagnose manually. Radiologists can focus on other important tasks having such kind of helping tools.", "Furthermore, according to the mentioned WHO fact-sheet \u201cPneumonia affects children and families everywhere, but is most prevalent in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.\u201c There the healthcare coverage of the whole area is not the same compared to western countries like in Europe or North-America. Having automatic tooling would help to trigger necessary medical or other interventions, even if there are not enough qualified medical personnel.", "So, what is necessary to create and deliver such kind of medical AI software improving the situation for children having pneumonia, to reduce the \u201815% of all deaths of children under five years old\u2019?", "With the help of an example \u2014 the medical diagnosis question as to whether a Chest X-ray image shows pneumonia or not (on my GitHub profile) \u2014we consider the following questions:", "For historical reasons the \u2018big players\u2019 of the medical market in terms of manufacturing and personnel policy have been hardware oriented to create high-quality medical devices as it has been necessary. But today this has been changed, for the companies, the differentiator is the software part. Therefore for the manufacturing processes, software engineering should have a higher priority, especially for the creation of AI software tools. To achieve this you need experts who are specialised in this kind of software development and AI research healthcare cooperates with specialised universities and hospitals.", "For software development the way of programming concept changes:", "The criteria used by the algorithm to make its decision are not immediately apparent, it comes from the image dataset. The goal is that the final algorithm shall be able to predict correct classifications for new, unknown Chest X-ray images. Means, the dataset itself used for software models training, validation and testing is one of the most important criteria.", "Therefore it is all the more important that engineering processes such as CRISP (Cross-Industrial-Standard-Process (of Data Mining)) are adhered to in order to guarantee uniform working methods and risk minimisation. And that brings us to the second question.", "The CRISP process is an internationally accepted process of the data science domain. Its application therefore facilitates communication with regulatory authorities as well as the creation of the product. In general, this process for solving a business problem is divided into different phases.", "Regarding this cycle, the overall solution process starts with business understanding, followed by understanding and modifying existing data. This is the crucial part for a successful, correct product result according to business requirements and it is teamwork.", "With regard to the pneumonia business question, the first finding is that it is a binary image classification problem that affects medical diagnosis.", "To introduce a new medical product legal aspects have to be taken into account. In general, the \u2018Q&R\u2019 (Quality & Regulatory) department works on that including marketing and R&D (Research & Development) departments. For our Chest example, think about a team with e.g. product managers knowing the business domain in detail, software engineers, testers and data scientists.", "If you consider the Data Scientist as AI project manager, this role includes leading communication with the regulatory authorities for official approvals (e.g. for the US: mandatory FDA 510(k) process) and official audits by e.g. FDA or T\u00dcV (in Europe according to MDR).", "In this context it is crucial that a data scientist is able to explain the software engineering process as well as the technical AI basics, critical components of the AI product software and their interpretation in a general understandable way. Q&R and regulatory authority employees usually do not have the necessary engineering background to conduct AI discussions, nor is it their job. Their primary focus are regulations and complaints and not the mathematical depths of AI algorithms.", "For example, to get a better understanding what the CNN is doing internally in its hidden-layers, Dipanjan (DJ) Sarkar presents some interpretation techniques for CNNs in his blog post about interpreting deep learning models. E.g. \u201eUsing GradCAM, we try and visualize how parts of the image affects neural network\u2019s output by looking into the class activation maps (CAM).\u201c You can identify and visualise which regions of the image the specific hidden-layer block is focussing on.", "Like in this cat example, focussing in the first hidden-layers (top) on edges and corners; in higher hidden-layers (bottom) focussing on surroundings and facial structures. \u2018Explainable AI (XAI)\u2019 is an own research field good to know for a data scientist of the medical domain.", "Beside interpretation, further questions arise immediately and will be asked by regulatory authorities as well:", "The data scientist has to explain the evaluation metrics and because it is a medical diagnosis issue, e.g. the false negative value of the confusion matrix (type 2 error) is very important for choosing the right model as well. For the children having a pneumonia, the CNN model result of high false negative values, leads to the situation that they are ill, but the software has regarded them to be healthy and the ill children wouldn\u2019t get the required necessary medical care.", "Regarding our model implementation with the dataset V3 60\u201320\u201320: if the decision is taken to have the model with the highest test accuracy, then the choice is the Basic Model with Adam optimiser and Augmentation: Its value is 89.33%. But is has detected 57 false negatives, which is too much. If it is decided to have a higher prio on the lowest number of false negatives, the ResNet50 transfer model with Adam optimiser and bottleneck features is the final model \u2014 having only 5 false negatives and a test accuracy of 84.80%.", "Artificial intelligence algorithms have the potential to change the medical workflow being common in the future (source).", "In order to develop and market qualified, medical AI products, company structures and management mindset require change. For data science, software engineering needs a higher accepted status and suitably qualified employees. And regulatory aspects need high qualified communication skills of the data scientists.", "Regarding our example, having the goal to reduce the \u201815% of all deaths of children under five years old\u2019, for our codings and its final software solution (RestNet50 transfer model using bottleneck features) the used model hyperparameters are considered to be a \u2018starting point\u2019. It is expected doing a detailed hyperparameter tuning to get better, stable prediction and metric results (e.g. test accuracy > 86% with low number of false negatives (<5)). Furthermore, more advanced hidden-layer structures getting much better results and interpretational concepts for the hidden-layers have not been implemented yet. It is computational expensive and needs an appropriate hardware environment.", "[1] Own diagram creation as a combination of a chest image from the Kaggle dataset, a medical youtube video and a diagram of the databricks paper \u2018Democratization-of-AI-and-Deep-Learning\u2019", "[2] SAP course \u2018Getting started with Data-Science\u2019", "Your home for data science.
