This really got me excited and I did some study and created this note on bias in machine learning. Let\u2019s talk about bias and why we need to care for it.", "The term bias was first introduced by Tom Mitchell in 1980 in his paper titled, \u201cThe need for biases in learning generalizations\u201d. The idea of having bias was about model giving importance to some of the features in order to generalize better for the larger dataset with various other attributes. Bias in ML does help us generalize better and make our model less sensitive to some single data point.", "But the problem occurs when our assumptions for a more generalized algorithm produces results that systematically prejudice. Many-times the algorithm may be biased on some features even if we omit the features we don\u2019t our model to weight on. They do this by learning the latent representation of those features from other provided features.", "This is concerning as machine learning models have started playing bigger roles in various crucial decisions of our lives, such as; loan application, medical diagnosis, credit card fraud detection, suspicious activity detection from CCTV, etc. Therefore, the bias in machine learning won\u2019t only give a result based on societal stereotype and belief but will amplify them in society.", "Many of you must have heard of Amazon attempt to build a resume filtering tool and how it ended up being biased against women. Everyone would like to have a system that can filter five resumes from a chunk of hundreds of resume. It went wrong when the model started rejecting applicants based on their gender and therefore never went to production. Another simple example can be seen in the word embeddings. Introduction of word embedding was a revolution for various natural language understanding problem as they were able to capture the simple relationship between words:", "King \u2014 Man + Woman = Queen", "The same word embeddings ware also capture the following relationships:", "Computer-programmer \u2014 Man + Woman = Home-Maker", "Mathematically, these word embeddings may not be wrong and are correctly encoding the data, but would we like to encode these biases in our machine learning algorithm? Therefore, we need to remove these biased to become an integral part of our algorithms.", "This is a very active interesting topic for researchers working on various aspects of machine learning. I also went through work from Prof. Sharad Goel and Prof. James Zou on the measure of fairness on our machine learning algorithm and bias in the word embedding respectively. Both are trying to address the same problem but in different approaches. Prof. James\u2019s recent work is about quantifying and removing gender and racial bias from word-embedding. In his work titled, \u201cMan is to Computer Programmer as Woman is to Homemaker? Debiasing Word Embeddings\u201d, with Tolga Bolukbasi, they proposed a methodology to geometrically modify an embedding to remove gender stereotypes. The final embedding preserves the association between queen and female and discards the association between receptionist and female. Whereas, Prof. Sharad recent work, \u201cThe Measure and Mismeasure of Fairness: A Critical Review of Fair Machine Learning\u201d, talks about how various fairness definition such as anti-classification, classification parity, and calibration suffers from significant statistical limitations and may harm the very group they are designed to protect. They also argue that based on the accurate estimate of risk one can produce, we should treat similarly risky people similarly. Research in fairness and bias in machine learning has just started and would be interesting to see how it develops and shapes the policies of the next generation.", "Your home for data science.
