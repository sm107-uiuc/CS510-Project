As I dived into it, I realized that it\u2019s difficult for me to understand which indicator of central tendency to choose for given data. Because, for sure, you know, there are three of them: mean, median, and mode.", "So I decided to write this article to help someone new in this field like me to figure this out and not to afraid of data and statistics. You know, sometimes it happened, but it shouldn\u2019t be a high wall between a person and his dream to become a data analyst. And also it was a good opportunity for me to make a small research in the sphere that seems rather interesting for me \u2014 wold, countries and their population. (Why I find in interesting \u2014 it\u2019s another story.)", "OK, let\u2019s start. First, we should take data for exploration. I\u2019ve found a good dataset on Kaggle: this Country Statistics. It represents economic, social, infra, and environmental indicators of all countries around the world. For our research, we need only three columns from this data frame: name of a country, the region of its location, and population.", "Let\u2019s take a glance at the data:", "Now we can move to our question: which central tendency measures we should use to explore data, and why.", "The easiest part is about the mode. It\u2019s just the most common value of all the values in a row or a column \u2014 nothing more. It\u2019s the most \u201cpopular\u201d number in the data.", "We use mode for non-numerical values and only for them. And to find it we have to count how often a particular unit appears in a given column. The unit with the greatest result is the mode we are looking for.", "In our dataset we can apply a question about mode only to the region column \u2014 the only one column in our table where this question does make sense. Because in the Country column all the values are different and in the Population column they are numbers.", "In advance I cleaned this column and left only the names of five continents as they have to be (instead SouthenAsia \u2014 Asia and so on). Just not to confuse us.", "And the mode of the Region column is:", "Good. It means that most countries are located on the African continent. And this is not surprising, right?", "Now let\u2019s move to mean and median. Both these values show us the number in the center of the row. But in different ways.", "Mean is an average value and we can count it by summarizing all the values in a row and then dividing the result by their amount. Let\u2019s look at the population. To calculate the mean we should add all countries\u2019 population values to each other and then divide this sum by the number of countries in our dataset. Fortunately, Pandas can do it for us.", "This number says that on average in a normal country live about 33 million people. Let\u2019s leave it as it is and move to the median.", "The median also shows us an average number. But it is the value exactly in the middle of a row. If we order population values from the smallest up the biggest, on the middle position of this ordered row the median will be.", "Ups! According to the median, the average population in a country is only about 5,5 million people. It\u2019s much smaller than the average population according to the mean. How could this happen?", "Usually the mean and the median are rather close to each other. If not, the problem is in outliers \u2014 values that are very different from all the other values in the row. Let\u2019s make a little graphics.", "We see that most countries are concentrated near zero. But some values stand out from others. Although these points are very small, we can see some of them above 200 million and two of them near 1 billion 400 million. These are outliers. And they affect the mean. Because this is the nature of the mean \u2014 to take into account all the values in a row. And the median is free of this disadvantage.", "So the conclusion is though mean, median and mode are used to describe the central tendency of data, we should be rather careful choosing one in our exploration. Otherwise, we can come to the wrong decisions.", "And also now we know that the world is full of small but brave and pretty countries. Mostly in Africa.", "This is a tiny example of a statistical and programming approach to describe the world around us. Data analysis can give us more and help people receive answers to their questions.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "I\u2019m a junior software developer. I think programming is a great thing because by doing what I really like I can help other people and make their lives better."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
