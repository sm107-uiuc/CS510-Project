This can be helpful in text analysis. For example, a financial company may want to identify all companies mentioned within a news article, and subsequently investigate how the relations between the companies might affect the markets.", "It is helpful to view NED as a component within an information extraction pipeline given a text document. For example, if we were given a text document consisting of the sentence, \u201cPresident Ford granted a pardon to President Nixon.\u201d, we would first identify all the words of interests, such as \u2018Ford\u2019. This is called Named Entity Recognition (NER). The word \u2018Ford\u2019 can refer to President Gerald Ford, Henry Ford, or the car company \u201cFord\u201d. As such, the second step in a pipeline is candidate selection, where we narrow down the list of possible candidates for the identified words of interest. Subsequently, we disambiguate entities from the candidate list and link each identified entity to a unique identifier within a knowledge base. In the example above, we should ideally identify the entity \u2018Ford\u2019 as \u2018Gerald Ford\u2019. This final step is the focus of this article \u2014 NED. All code can be found on our Github.", "As a human being, we find it easy to use the contextual information from the surrounding text to correctly identify \u2018Ford\u2019 as the former president Gerald Ford. One may expect that a reasonably designed model should be able to use the textual information to do so as well. However, the process of disambiguation can be further improved if we have access to a knowledge graph.", "We would like to utilize the context of the text in determining the correct entity. To do so, we first need to represent each word as a vector of real numbers, and this is what is called a word embedding. In theory, we want an embedding such that words that have similar meanings are close to each other in the vector space. For example, we would want words related to politics to be in one part of the vector space, and words related to automobiles to be in another part.", "A knowledge graph is essentially a graphical representation of a knowledge base, where entities and their relations are represented as nodes and edges respectively. Wikidata, which is a structured form of Wikipedia, is a knowledge base. For example, in the Wikidata knowledge base entry of Gerald Ford, \u2018Ford\u2019 is an entity/node, with an edge/relation \u2018party\u2019, which links to another entity/node \u2018Republican Party\u2019.", "Importantly, we expect that identified entities within a text document to be close to each other in the knowledge graph. Then, we can possibly infer the unique identity of each of those entities based on the context of the text!", "However, knowledge bases and graphs take up a lot of memory. For deep learning approaches, we use graphical embeddings to represent the information in lower dimensional vector spaces. There are numerous approaches to graphical embeddings. We use DistMult, by Yang et al. (2015), to embed knowledge graphs, rather than using typical graphical embedding approaches not designed for knowledge graphs. DGL \u2014 Knowledge Graph Embedding implementation is used to efficiently train a subset of 7.6 million the Wikidata entities. This yields a top 1 hit rate of 90.1% for the graph completion task, where we try to predict tail in a (head, edge, ???) triplet and head in (???, edge, tail) triplet.", "Most of the current NED methods rely on textual methods where the contextual information of the document is used to infer the identity of the entity. There is also considerable research into the use of graphical methods, such as Graph Convolutional Networks, on knowledge graphs. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is not much research into methods that combine both textual and graphical information. Specifically, we use the new graphical embedding mentioned in the previous section to attain considerable improvements in disambiguation results.", "We used Wikipedia articles and the Wikidata knowledge base to train our model. Almost all articles have a corresponding entry in the knowledge base. Furthermore, each Wikipedia article has readily available hyperlinked text, known as anchor texts, which link Wikipedia articles to each other. These are important features within the data that we use in our NED task.", "Due to the size of Wikipedia, we train on approximately 1% of all the available Wikipedia articles (385,000). Furthermore, we only include the \u2018Introduction\u2019 sections for each article; as Wikipedia does not repeat hyperlinks, the introduction sections are the most comprehensive when identifying all words-of-interests. Additionally, we note that the hyperlinked identified words-of-interests need not correspond to named entities in a typical NED task. For example, apple (fruit) may be linked in a Wikipedia article, but it is not considered a named entity. Nonetheless, despite the imperfections of the dataset, it is probably the best dataset available for a supervised approach to NED due to the rarity of datasets.", "Below are some of the relevant datasets that were used. Our dataset is a Wikipedia snapshot on Aug 8, 2019. Kensho Technologies plans to make the dataset open to the public, and we will update links to each one accordingly. Kensho has now opened the dataset to the public.", "The following datasets are related to Wikidata:", "After a typical text-preprocessing of Wikipedia introductions, we use the SpaCy library to identify all the named entities within the introductions (NER). SpaCy is a well-known industrial strength NLP library with functionality for entity recognition.", "Note: As SpaCy uses extensive feature engineering to reduce the complexity of their models, it is particularly sensitive to capitalization of the text in entity recognition. As such, we identify all the entities with SpaCy before lowering the caps of the text.", "For an identified entity, we need to select entities from our knowledge graph that could correspond to the identified entity\u2019s true entity. In this step, we combine two approaches: anchor text frequency and MinHash locality-sensitivity hashing (LSH) Forest.", "For each of the anchor text on Wikipedia, we have the frequency that the anchor text corresponds to the target page. We store a dictionary of anchor text and a list of their target pages, ordered by the frequency the anchor text maps to the target page descending. Note that our preprocessing lower cases the anchor text, so there are some processed anchor text frequencies that do not sum to 1. Then, for an identified entity, we get the top anchor_k entities that the identified entity text maps to in the dictionary. Intuitively, we would think that if some anchor text maps to an entity with a high frequency on Wikipedia, then there is a high probability that the anchor text will refer to that entity when the anchor text is mentioned outside of the Wikipedia context.", "The anchor text method alone is not sufficient, since it requires the identified entity to exactly match the anchor text. Even a one character difference from a misspelling could result in no matches. Therefore, similarity matching should also be utilized, in which we retrieve entities with names similar to the identified entity text. Specifically, we utilize Jaccard similarity. Jaccard similarity can be used to check how similar two texts are, and it can be efficiently approximated by MinHash LSH. For a more detailed overview of Jaccard similarity and MinHash LSH see this tutorial, which we adapt our code from. We measure similarity of the text on the character level to account for misspellings. Then, for an identified entity text, we can get the top lsh_k similar entities.", "Thus, for an identified entity, from our candidate selection, we can get the top entities from both anchor text and LSH, and this is our candidates for the identified entity.", "We approach the model as a classification problem. The model predicts whether each candidate is the true entity for the word-of-interest. First, we create a context window surrounding each word-of-interest (ex. \u00b110 words), and feed that into an embedding layer as part of the model. This contextual word embedding is fed into a Bidirectional LSTM; its output is concatenated with the knowledge graph embedding, and fed into a feed forward neural network. The FFNN creates a mapping between the knowledge graph embedding and local context embedding.", "For training, we include 10 false entities, if possible, with the true entity as the potential candidates. We had about 12 million data points, with 20.11% positive and 79.89% negative labels. We split the data into a train/test set, ensuring that the candidates for the same identified entity are in the same set to prevent leakage. We achieved a test accuracy of 0.8678 and AUC of 0.9000. We primarily care about the recall of 0.57; we are able to predict the correct entity 57% of the time.", "However, there is the possibility that more than one candidate was predicted to be the correct entity or no candidates were predicted to be the correct entity. Instead, we then predict the candidate with the max probability as the correct entity. Then, the model is able to predict the correct entity 75.8% of the time, a significant improvement.", "The full pipeline is thus a combination of the NER, candidate selection and NED stages. When given a text document, we identify all words-of-interests, and link them to a corresponding entry in the Wikidata knowledge base. As a demonstration of our pipeline, we use a simple Jupyter Widget that takes in a text document and returns the same text document with hyperlinked words-of-interests linking to the corresponding Wikipedia article pages.", "Here\u2019s a demo of our pipeline where our pipeline works perfectly.", "We can see that our model is able to differentiate Micheal Jordan, the basketball player, and Michael Jordan, the machine learning researcher. This means that our model is able to disambiguate the right candidate based on context and graph connectivity between the entities found in the sentence.", "Here\u2019s another demo where our pipeline cannot get the correct entities. We see that instead of Steve Jobs, our model points to iSteve, a parody movie on Steve Jobs instead. Inspecting our model further, we see that our candidate list doesn\u2019t even contain Steve Jobs. This indicates a failure on our candidate selection, whereas our NED model seems to have made a sensible choice picking a film related to Steve Jobs instead.", "On the other hand, the second failure lies in NED model ranking iOS higher than iPhone.", "This failure is caused by NED model being only based on the context of the words and connections from the graph embeddings. Notably, we can just replace iOS with iPhone in the sentence, and it would still read fine. So, the context and the underlying connections are totally reasonable when considering iOS for the entity. This is a failure for not penalizing the text dissimilarity in the disambiguation stage.", "As noted in our results, one of the main bottlenecks is definitely the candidate selection stage. The candidate selection dictionary can be improved with more careful feature engineering. As for the NED model, we could penalize text dissimilarity of the chosen candidates in the loss function to avoid cases where an entity with a totally different text that works perfectly in the same context to be chosen as the candidate. In addition, BERT is still noteworthy to consider as a replacement for our word embeddings given its dominating performance in numerous NLP tasks, but it would take a much more powerful GPU to properly fine-tune it. Given more resource, it\u2019d be interesting to formulate NER and candidate selection as deep learning problems and jointly train all stages together to share information across each task.", "[1] B.
