In this article we will take a look at some of the basic principles of programming a quantum computer and address this misconception. We will look at free, open-source software such as QISKit from IBM, as well as the Quantum Machine Learning software PennyLane. We will also explain how you can run your programs on actual quantum computers in the cloud at IBM. In a follow-up article we will talk about some applications in machine learning that are ready for use currently to anyone with a bit of curiosity.", "First off, let\u2019s talk a little bit about quantum computing and what you can expect from the technology. Current computer chip architectures that you can find inside of you phone, laptop, or tablet are constructed out of silicon. One of the most common techniques etches tiny, microscopic patterns into the silicon chip using a special kind of light based lithography. These tiny patterns allow us to create silicon chips that transport electrons (electric current) through the chip in a controlled way. Currently, we have hit the physical limit of how small these tiny patterns can be. They can be efficiently created in mass quantities with nanoscale precision, with a typical architecture being around 10 nanometers, which is somewhere between 20 and 50 atoms across.", "More precise technology exists which can manipulate single atoms and we can currently create architectures that are even smaller than what you typically find in a computer or phone. This fabrication process is a bit slower, and so mass production of these much smaller, atomically precise chips is a bit harder. One difficulty we run into when constructing computer chips with such small features is the quantum behavior of electrons and atoms. Electrons have something called wave-particle duality. This means, under certain circumstances the electron behaves like a wave instead of a particle, and so confining it to a tiny etched pattern on a silicon chip becomes much more difficult when the etched patterns are too small. The electron \u201cspreads out\u201d and electron leakage occurs, causing issues with the current flowing through these tiny channels in the silicon chip. This leakage means the chip doesn\u2019t perform as desired and the wave-like behavior of the electron becomes a problem. This is often referred to as the \u201cdeath of Moore\u2019s law\u201d and represents a halt in the growth in performance of computers that we have come to expect over the past few decades. It\u2019s a big problem if you are betting on a market built on the assumption of constant and perpetual growth because there really is a physical limit to just how small and efficient you can make computer chips.", "Quantum computing aims to use this \u201cproblem\u201d of quantum mechanical behavior as a computational advantage, by using it to process information in a fundamentally different way from the usual binary ones and zeros in our phones and laptops. A useful way to think of a quantum computer is as an ASIC (Application-Specific Integrated Circuit). That\u2019s not exactly what it is, but it\u2019s not a bad analogy. Think of it as a special kind of computer chip, designed to perform specific kinds of computations much more efficiently than standard silicon chips. Let\u2019s have a look at how to represent the basic units of computation in QISKit.", "First, you\u2019ll need to download a free distribution of Anaconda so that you can use Jupyter Lab. Once you\u2019ve downloaded Anaconda, open the Anaconda navigator and open an instance of Jupyter Lab. If you\u2019d like to download the notebook from Github, you can find it here. If you\u2019d like to see the interactive version on Binder, you can find it here. To install QISKit, you can just use pip in Jupyter notebook or Jupyter Lab.", "Next, you\u2019ll need to import qiskit and matplotlib.", "Now, if you want to plot the \u201cSpin-Up\u201d state on the Bloch Sphere, you can type the following command.", "We can plot the \u201cSpin-Down\u201d state of the qubit with the following command.", "In general, qubit states are no longer restricted to simple 0 or 1 like a classical binary bit of information. Qubits can be in infinitely many states. Each state is represented as a point on the Bloch Sphere. Spin-Up corresponds to the state 0, and Spin-Down corresponds to the state 1, but the qubit can also be in a combination of these two states. Each point on the Bloch sphere, like coordinates on the surface of the earth, represents a unique qubit state. This ability of a qubit to be in infinitely many different states is related to the concept of \u201csuperposition\u201d in quantum physics. For example, the following state on the Bloch Sphere is an even mixture of the state 0 and the state 1, so it is in a superposition of these two state.", "This \u201cSpin-Right\u201d position is represented as a \u201csuperposition\u201d,", "or a \u201clinear combination\u201d of the 0 state and the 1 state. If you don\u2019t understand the linear algebra reference, that\u2019s okay. Now, if we want to operate on a single qubit in the Spin-Up state (or state 0), and flip it to Spin-Down (or state 1), we can use the NOT-gate. The NOT-gate or the \u201cPauli X-gate\u201d is a quantum logic gate. Quantum logic gates are conceptually similar to classical logic gates, but they are not quite the same. They operate on qubits much like classical logic gates can operate on bits, but they are always reversible and are represented by (unitary) matrix multiplication. We can create a quantum circuit in QISKit as follows:", "Now, if we want to operate on the single qubit using the NOT-gate, we can do this in QISKit with the following code.", "This shows us that we have flipped the qubit state to Spin-Down. This is the basic idea behind quantum algorithms. In a followup article we will look at how these quantum logic gates are implemented on actual hardware using superconducting qubits. This can also be done with IBM software and amounts to programming microwave pulses that are applied to the quantum computer chip. If you would like to look at some tutorials that walk through the mathematics behind quantum algorithms, have a look at my Github Repository on the mathematics behind quantum computing implemented in Python.
