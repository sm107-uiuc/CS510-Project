By the end of this, I hope that this will help steer you in the right direction to achieving your goals as well! Here we go\u2026", "If this is the kind of stuff that you like, be one of the FIRST to subscribe to my new YouTube channel here! While there aren\u2019t any videos yet, I\u2019ll be sharing lots of amazing content like this but in video form. Thanks for your support :)", "Despite having a Bachelor of Commerce, I\u2019ve finally landed a position as a Data Scientist at Datatron, a goal of mine for the past three years. For you to understand how I got to where I am now, I think it\u2019s important that you know a little bit about my past.", "My interest in data sparked from dabbling in financial data in my second year of undergraduate studies. With a bit of analysis and a lot of luck, my stock portfolio ten folded and I was captivated by the idea of extracting immense value out of raw data.", "Around the same time, my exposure to my software engineer friends got me interested in learning how to program, specifically in Python. When I eventually heard about the concept of machine learning, I knew that that was something that I wanted to learn more about.", "This leads to my first tip\u2026", "Let me break this down even further into two sub-points:", "Because \u2018Data Science\u2019 is so vaguely defined, there is a wide range of skills that are required to be a well-rounded Data Scientist. Below are some of the most important skills that I worked on honing over the past few years and the resources that I leveraged to do so:", "Once you have a foundation built, the best way to accelerate your learning is by completing some data science projects. The best way to do it is to go on Kaggle, pick a dataset, and creating a prediction model or some data visualizations. Remember that your first few projects aren\u2019t going to be great! But what matters is how you progress over time.", "Here are some data science projects that I completed in the past that you can use to get some inspiration!", "While you continue to learn and practice your data science skills, there are other things that you can do to make yourself a more valuable data science candidate, and this leads to my next tip:", "I knew I would be fighting an uphill battle, especially with no previous experience as a Data Scientist. However, finding jobs similar to data scientist positions will significantly increase your chances of becoming a data scientist. The reason for this is that related jobs will give you the opportunity to work with actual data in a business setting.", "I first worked as a Business Intelligence Consultant at Bell Canada and this allowed me to work with real-life data for the first time. By the end of this internship, I learned how to use Excel more extensively, how to query large and complex databases using SQL, and how to leverage data to support business decisions.", "I then worked as a Data and Operations Associate at Wealthsimple, and here, I had the opportunity to develop its first data manipulation and analysis process as well as create several dashboards.", "Lastly, I moved on to working at HelloFresh as a Growth Marketing Analyst. This was the first job where I had the opportunity to develop machine learning models in a business setting, and I developed several models to optimize discounts.", "My point is this: despite not having a single data science job, I was able to learn several data science-related skills with each job building off of the previous one.", "You don\u2019t need to be a Data Scientist to do \u2018Data Science\u2019 work", "Here are some data science-related jobs that you can look for:", "In addition to the two points above, there\u2019s one more tip that significantly improved my reputability as a data scientist\u2026", "Most Data Science job listings require a Master\u2019s degree because it generally requires a high level of technical skill. If you find that you are not finding success with the two pieces of advice above, I recommend looking into a Master\u2019s program in a quantitative field (computer science, statistics, math, analytics, etc\u2026)", "Personally, I chose to enroll in Georgia Tech\u2019s Master of Science in Analytics program for a number of reasons:", "That being said, there are several options out there and I highly advise that you take the time to explore all of your options before you make a decision!", "What really helped me get exposure and ultimately a data science position was a personal initiative that I committed to called \u201952 Weeks of Data Science\u2019 where I learn and blog anything related to data science for a year. Below is a timeline that shows my achievements and how blogging has helped me.", "If you like my work and want to support me\u2026", "Your home for data science.
