How could you use machine learning to provide live feedback on their pronunciation? In this post, we will cover how this can be achieved in more than 20 languages using Google\u2019s speech to text API.", "If you had access to a database with recordings of non-native and native voice recordings for given words, accent recognition could be performed quite readily. In fact, machine learning may not even be necessary \u2014 one could compare the spectrograms and Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients of the audio clips. For those of you who are not familiar, spectrograms and Mel Coefficients represent the frequencies/pitches present in an audio recording. A simple comparison of coefficients from native and non-native recordings might do the trick.", "Pictured here are two spectrograms of \u201cHola.\u201d The first spectrogram displays an improper accent while the second a proper accent. One could compute the difference between the two graphs to quantify the similarity between the pronunciations. This approach, however, is not robust. Different pitches of voices would alter the calculation as well as the speed one talks. Furthermore, as mentioned earlier, this approach requires a database of recordings from native speakers.", "Without a database of recordings, however, we must adopt a different solution. Rather than creating our own model, we can use Google\u2019s speech to text API. Google\u2019s models have been trained on the voices of native speakers and consequently are only able to recognize recordings that are similar enough to the voice of a native speaker. Thus, if Google\u2019s text to speech model is able to identify our pronunciation, we are to assume that we pronounced the word correctly. As we shall see, if we provide an audio clip with a harsh accent, the model will be unable to recognize the speech.", "1. If you don\u2019t already have a Google Cloud account be sure to create one first. https://cloud.google.com/", "2.
