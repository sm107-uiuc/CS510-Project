Although anyone could broadcast their creative ideas on this website, not everyone manages to get enough pledge before the campaign deadline. My project aims to help campaigners narrow down the criteria to focus on in order to launch a successful campaign.", "Obtained the Kickstarter dataset from the website Web Robots that crawls all Kickstarter projects and collects data in CSV and JSON formats.", "Preprocess my features and dummy categorial variables before looking into the data further.", "Project category: this feature is a dictionary that contains all kinds of information regarding the campaign category. I extracted category name, category position and category parent ID information from this variable, and made three new variables.", "Category name: after extracting this information from the project category variable, I transformed it into a dummy variable.", "State: there were initially 5 different campaign states, including suspended, canceled, successful, failed and live, I reduced the groups to successful/failed to simplify the prediction.", "Feature selection is performed by calculating the Information Value (IV) for each variable, and only retaining the variables with a value larger than 0.1. For more information on Information Value calculation, please visit this site.", "As for feature engineering, I took the timestamps features such as created at, launched at, state changed at and deadline, calculated their difference and got the duration of each stage.", "I chose Logistic Regression to be my baseline model and split the data into a 20% test, 20% validate and 60% train sample. After fitting the different train, validation and test samples into my baseline model, I got the results in below table:", "The train accuracy and test accuracy were very similar so there was no sign of over-fitting. However, the test recall was higher than the test precision, so there is some room for raising my precision score with other models.", "We could also take a look at the confusion matrix to get more information on where the model is making errors.", "The model is making more false-positive predictions than false-negative predictions, meaning there are more predictions on successful campaigns that are actually unsuccessful than successful campaigns that are actually successful. In order to lower my false-positive prediction rates, I ran other models to seek improvements.", "I first split my data into 20% test and 80% cross-validation and fitted the samples into models such as KNN, Random Forest and AdaBoost. With the help of RandomizedSearchCV, I was able to fine-tune the parameters in each model and make sure I get the best performance out of them. Below is the result table I got for each model:", "Although Random Forest gives us the highest F-1 score out of the three models, I decided that AdaBoost was my best model because it gave us the highest precision score. I am prioritizing the performance of precision over the performance of recall because I want to prevent predicting unsuccessful campaigns successful. AdaBoost gives us a precision score of 0.72, meaning out of 10 campaigns, my model correctly predicts 7 campaigns to be successful.", "To better understand how the above models work, let\u2019s take a look at how my features perform. Below is a graph for feature importance:", "We can see that goal and time-related features are the most important features in predicting a campaign\u2019s success. This finding makes sense because the success of your campaign is decided by whether the amount of pledge meets your goal, and whether you get the amount of pledge within the campaign deadline.", "We could also look at the graph below to see in what ways the features affect the campaign outcome.", "The SHAP value represents a feature\u2019s responsibility for a change in the model output. The higher the SHAP value, the more positively the feature is affecting the model. If we only look at the right half of the graph which is the half where the model is positively affected, we could see what feature values help to launch a successful campaign.", "Take the \u2018preparation duration\u2019 feature, for example, its feature value is low (blue) throughout the entire right half of the graph. This means a short preparation duration has a better chance of launching a successful campaign. Take the \u2018goal\u2019 feature as another example, its feature value is also low (blue) throughout the entire right half of the graph. This means a small goal has a better chance of launching a successful campaign. As for other project category related features, different categories affect the model differently.", "The insights of the graph correlate to our intuition because if you have a short preparation duration, you are more likely to complete the campaign within the project deadline. Similarly, if you have a smaller goal, you have a bigger chance to achieve a pledge amount that meets the goal.", "I also built a web app with Flask and Javascript to demonstrate my model performance. The app allows users to input values for the top 4 important features, and retrieve a prediction of campaign success.", "According to my results section, I would advise campaigners to:", "in order to increase their chances of launching successful campaigns!", "For future steps, I would like to do a multi-class classification, take into account different campaign states other than successful/failure. In addition, I also want to collect data over a longer period of time. There are some features that, according to my intuition, would affect the performance of the model, however, didn\u2019t show much impact on current models. Maybe the features would show their influence once I widened the time period in data collection.", "For further information, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact me!
