A small hidden pocket acting as home for business cards, crumpled papers, and receipts from the past. That\u2019s when I discovered the old, stained paper with this crude and rough sketch of what I scribbled down around 4 years ago.", "Spatial info: An Irish bar in Denver, Colorado", "Thermodynamic info: An exceptionally hot evening, perfect for citrus drinks", "I had travelled from east coast to Denver on a sales pitch meeting with a potential client and it didn\u2019t go as well as planned. There were budget cuts at their end and my proposal got pushed to the next quarter. My return flight was the next morning and I had a dinner scheduled with that client in the evening. Well, consulting makes you a kind of food and drink connoisseur. Dan and I decided to meet at a local bar for a drink before heading to dinner.", "As it was an especially hot day, we decided to prolong our stay in the bar and have a couple of more beers(also because Denver is quite high on the brewery scene, so one could sample many craft beers). Dan was telling me about the business restructuring that is going on and that will lead to budget cuts across the organisation for the time being. Their idea was to make the organisation lean and flexible and hire more folks in tech and analytics sector.", "The conversation somehow got diverted to the creation of new departments and hunt for departmental heads within the organisation.", "I had done primary research on agent-based models and Thanks to Thomas Schelling I liked to fit the statement in conversations and this was the perfect opportunity.", "What you see at the macroscopic level might not be true at microscopic level", "I must have drawn the graph for him on the piece of paper above then to show him how people from various departments connect to each other and how sometimes those who hold the highest titles in the department might not be the \u2018fulcrums\u2019 or the most important ones in running the day to day business. So, before reaching a hard conclusion, learn what various people do at their job and don\u2019t rely only on data given by their supervisors or the title of the chair they are holding. I gave him a few ideas on how to do it and what tools he could use.", "Three or four months forward, I met Dan again at the initiation of a new project and that\u2019s when he told me that he created graphs for small parts of the organisation and quantified the importance of the people in the business setting. I will simulate a case that he mentioned and interested him.", "Employee.csv contains three major columns. Employee_1 and Employee_2 is the pair of 2 people who would have interacted with each other. Weight is the measure of interaction between the two. It is a simple count of how many times Employee_1 and Employee_2 exchanged emails or were present in the same meeting. The observations were harvested for the past 3 months.", "The data was collected from reading the metadata of the email and SMTP servers and no one's privacy was breached in the process.", "Click on Add Database, provide a username and password and you are all set.", "Once you add the database, click the three horizontal dots and from Manage section you will add a few plugins that you will make your job a little easier.", "In the Plugins tab, go ahead and install APOC and Graph Data Science Library.", "Go ahead and start your DB and open with the Neo4j browser.

It is more robust and captures the status of the employees at the entire graph level than only at their node level.", "Pagerank seems to be more controlled and not scattered like weighted degree and degree. It can be a much better metric to measure the power of each node.", "I want to do some clustering as well on the employees i.e. which of them are highly connected subgraphs within the graph. In graph terms, what I want to accomplish is to detect the communities.", "I had no idea how to accomplish it but a quick search helped.", "All the queries are uploaded on Github here.", "Now that I have everything I needed, I can use Neo4j\u2019s Graph Data Science Library to visualise the data.", "It will launch a UI which is called NEuler(Noy-ler) in Neo4j\u2019s vernacular.", "Once you connect, you will have to select which label, what weight property you want to run your graph on. I selected Employee and PageRank respectively.", "Select the options from the drop-down to make your graph colourful and interpretable.", "The graph shows the connections and the various communities that exist in the small employee pool. The thicker the edge between the employees, the higher the interaction is based on the page rank score.", "Now, let\u2019s focus on the interesting observation Dan had.", "Sue, Amanda, Chris, Mark, and Yan all worked for the Accounts department with Sue assuming the head of the department's role. You should see that the edge between her and Yan is quite bleak. Yan has a thick edge between her and Alex(a major stakeholder and an important person in the ecosystem of the organisation). Not only that, Yan is the only bridge that connects the Accounts department to the rest of the organisation.", "Before Dan accomplished the exercise(which must be a similar version of what I have concocted here), Yan\u2019s name featured in the list of those who were being axed from their department. She isn\u2019t a heavy lifter within her accounts department but she lifts a lot of weight nevertheless and that would never have been realised had we taken only departmental feedback into consideration.", "A simple visual showed that Yan is an influential person in her organisation even though her intra-department score might be low, her inter-department dependency makes her indispensable.", "She was not only saved from being fired but in the next cycle, she was given a position by Alex\u2019s department.", "Graph DB avoided a mistake from being made if one had only looked at the organisational structure from a qualitative perspective. Thankfully that wasn\u2019t the case here for Yan.", "This is the power of looking at data in a graphical manner, you see patterns that you could have missed otherwise. Other than that, many people are visual learners, present them a table and a graph, more often than not they will reach for the graph.", "After this, I can say that the visit to the bar that evening was a fruitful one!", "Please let me know your comments and you can use the Github repo here.", "Your home for data science.
