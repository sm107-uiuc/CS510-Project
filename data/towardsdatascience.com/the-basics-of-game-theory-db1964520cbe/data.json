A tool used in a wide array of industries & fields ranging from economics, to political science, to computer science \u2014 the basics of game theory are surprisingly tenable to the average high-schooler. The concepts aren\u2019t too advanced, yet the potential knowledge can pay off in spades. Understanding the fundamentals of game theory is an endeavor worth undertaking for anyone in a position subject to group decision-making (hint: everyone).", "While last time we discussed the early days & modernization, this time around we\u2019ll review frequently-used terminology & the basics of diagramming games.", "Most branches of math, particularly branches of applied math, require their lexicon \u2014 game theory doesn\u2019t deviate here. To comprehend examples, it\u2019s critical to familiarize ourselves with the appropriate language. Below we\u2019ll find the basic vocabulary; the terms aren\u2019t in alphabetical order, but rather in subjective order of decreasing relevance to the overall topic:", "Game \u2014 Any interaction between two or more players in which each player\u2019s payoff is affected by their decisions & the decisions made by others.", "Players \u2014 The interdependent agents of the game, which might range from individuals to governments, to companies, etc\u2026", "Actions \u2014 The strictly-defined behaviors that a player has to choose between, what can players do? Enter a bid? End a strike? Bet on a coin flip?", "Payoff \u2014 The specific, exact, increases or decreases of \u201cvalue\u201d within a value system that maps to a player\u2019s action.", "Value System \u2014 Abstract & context-dependent, this is the range of all possible values; anything from jail-time, to market share, to land occupation.", "Zero-Sum \u2014 A situation in which one player\u2019s gain is equivalent to another\u2019s loss; the net change in wealth or benefit to the game as a whole is zero.", "Non-Zero-Sum \u2014 A situation where there is a net benefit or loss to the system based on out the outcome of the game; winnings & losses of all players do not add up to zero.", "Simultaneous \u2014 When players are making decisions & taking actions at approximately the same time; they don\u2019t know the choices of other players when making their choices, such as rock-paper-scissors.", "Sequential \u2014 When players are making decisions & taking actions in alternating turns such as monopoly or chess.", "Non-Cooperative \u2014 The more common type of game, this is a strictly-competitive game among individual players.", "Nash Equilibrium \u2014 The optimal outcome of a game where no player has an incentive to deviate from a chosen strategy; no incremental benefit from changing actions, assuming other players remain constant in their strategies.", "Dominant Strategy \u2014 A strategy that, regardless of what other players do, is the most beneficial strategy among all others.", "Cooperative \u2014 A type of game in which players can forge alliances & respond cooperatively to external credible threats.", "Shapely Value \u2014 The average marginal contribution of a player\u2019s value across all possible coalitions; used for cooperative/coalition games, it\u2019s the average expected marginal contribution on a per-player basis.", "Complete Information \u2014A game in which knowledge about other players is available to all participants; the payoff functions, strategies & \u201ctypes\u201d of players are common knowledge.", "Incomplete Information \u2014 A game in which players may or may not have information on the game-type, player actions player-type, strategies, payoffs..", "Imperfect Information \u2014A game in which players are unaware of the actions chosen by other players; however, everything else, player-type, strategies, payoffs, etc\u2026is common knowledge.", "Finito. The list of terms above covers the bare essentials of any game theory problem we\u2019ll likely encounter. As you\u2019ll learn below, in addition to these verbal describers, the best way to analyze a game is by visually mapping it out.", "There are two primary ways of visualizing games in game theory: matrices & trees. In general both models are appropriate & should yield some insight; however, which model is most appropriate for any given scenario is a function of the type of game & its rules (simultaneous vs. sequential, complete vs incomplete vs imperfect, etc\u2026).", "The most basic tool of game theory is the payoff matrix. Typically, matrices are used to describe 2-player, simultaneous games. Seen in the template below, the two-player choices line up perpendicular to each other on the outer borders of our matrix\u2014 one stems across the top (left-to-right), & one spans down the left-side (top-to-bottom). Inside, is the expected payoff for each player assuming they took that action. For example, let\u2019s pretend, for some really simple game, that two players (Alice & Bob) exist, each with the capacity to pick one of only two actions (therefore four scenarios total). Each \u201cscenario,\u201d or box in the matrix, contains two numbers, the specific scenario payoffs:", "The example above is context-less, but still serves its purpose of demonstrating the basic layout of a game theory matrix. Evident by the bold outer titles, this game is between Alice & Bob; additionally, it\u2019s clear that they each only have one of two choices: \u201cAction 1\u201d or \u201cAction 2.\u201d Last, the ordered pairs inside the matrix represent the payoffs for both players given a specific scenario (Alice\u2019s payoff is the left/x number, Bob\u2019s payoff is the right/Y number).", "Let\u2019s consider a more relevant & relatable game: Rock Paper Scissors. A common game with global renown, it\u2019s strictly a 2-person, simultaneous, non-cooperative game. The players, as is well-known, have only one of three strategies; additionally, we also know the payoffs & value system from those three strategies. We can map this game mathematically using a 3x3 matrix:", "The example above should make much more intuitive sense. By following along a row (Alice\u2019s choice) & a column (Bob\u2019s choice), it\u2019s clear what the pay-off for both individuals results in. Take note though, by representing games in matrices we can only represent situations where players move simultaneously \u2014 there is no concept of time.", "A game tree is a directed graph with nodes & edges. Nodes represent either player positions or exits/payoffs from the game. Typically, there is an assignment of players to the decision nodes; a group of decision nodes, when on the same horizontal, x-axis, represent the array choices for a single player at a single point in time. Edges, on the other hand, represent the moves, or actions, taken by the player/node. The complete game tree for a game is the game tree starting at the initial position & contains all possible moves from each position.", "With trees we essentially add a temporal dimension to the table, allowing for the optimal representation of a sequential game over time. The topology of the game tree varies between two possible setups, depending on whether that game is simultaneous or sequential. To gain insight from a meaningful comparison, we\u2019ll review trees by continuing our previous example of rock-paper-scissors:", "Note, Alice was chosen at random for the top node/origin choice, however, the entire diagram would remain the same if we simply switched her & Bob\u2019s positioned. Like the matrix example above, this diagram provides the same payoff options.", "For every game tree, there is only one way to represent it using a matrix; but for every matrix, there are multiple ways to represent it using a game tree. Given its inclusion of time, unless a game is really simple, game trees are typically the tool of choice for analysis.", "And there we go! With common language & visual mappings now under our belt, in addition to its history, our self-taught game theory knowledge is steadily but surely growing. We\u2019ve evolved our perspective of games, & this is exciting because it provides us with the ability to see common-day scenarios in a completely different light.", "While this time we focused on structuring our games, next time, we\u2019ll finally get into the meat of the bones \u2014 the true payoff from learning game theory: analyzing & arriving at a dominant strategy.", "Your home for data science.
