During the last months, amidst the strange situation, we are all in, I did not know what project to do. I started a few projects but I did not finish them because the results were not promising and not worthy of an article. I knew that I did not want to use a Data Set on Kaggle or elsewhere, but I wanted to do an end-to-end project by using data that I would need to collect.", "After browsing through articles/projects on Medium, thanks to the article of Samir Sheriff, I found out that it is possible to analyze data from a WhatsApp Group, and as I have not done a project on Natural Language Processing or NLP, I thought this was a great opportunity to sharpen my technical skills.", "Natural language is used for everyday communication between humans, such as Messenger, e-mails, Whatsapp, social media (Twitter, Facebook, etc.). The data from these sources are highly unstructured for both text and speech, thus making it difficult to parse and comprehend by machines. Natural language processing (NLP) is concerned with the interaction between natural human language and computers. It is an intersection among the fields of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence.", "Nowadays, most of the data are classified as unstructured data, meaning that the data collected are not organized in tables, like in Microsoft Excel. It is, therefore, more difficult to analyze and not easily searchable, which is why it was not useful for organizations until recent years. It often requires a lot of time to clean and organize the data into a useful data frame, which is for many people a boring task. If this information is ignored, companies aren\u2019t using everything available to them to be successful. Right now in the job market, more and more companies are looking for a specialist to analyze these data as they want to leverage this precious information. I did a similar article in the past about how to collect and process tweets to an Amazon S3 bucket.", "Artificial intelligence algorithms now help to automatically extract meaning from the volumes of unstructured data that are generated daily. Companies use big data tools and software such as Hadoop to prepare, mine, integrate, store, track, index, and report business insights from raw unstructured data.", "I have summarized the main application of NLP below:", "Let\u2019s now look at my project", "As a part of a WhatsApp group, I can export the data and start to explore it. This group was created in 2015, but due to the recent change in the encryption of WhatsApp data, I am only able to pull the data starting in October 2019. Moreover, to make this article understandable for a wide public, I am not going to paste my code in the article. Instead, you will see cool plots made by using the package plotly. In case you are interested in the code please check my repository on GitHub.", "Please note that anyone in a WhatsApp group can extract the data from the conversation, and it is also possible to do that on messenger. Feel free to copy my code and use it to explore your data.", "Back to my project now, after extracting the data from the Whatsapp App, I obtain a text file, that looks just like this:", "As I previously mentioned, I can\u2019t use the data in this format, the data are unstructured, it is a mess. To transform these data into a data frame with columns, I tokenize the data. But, what is tokenization?", "Tokenization is the process of demarcating and possibly classifying sections of a string of input characters.", "In a text file, each line represents one comment, and I identify 4 tokens:", "After some more cleaning, I\u2019m able to generate the following data frame. I won\u2019t go into all the details of how I obtained the data frame. Instead, I would suggest checking the repo I have linked above and at the end of the article.", "Also, to ensure the privacy of all this information, and because I want my friends to still be my friends after this article is published, I replaced our names by some famous pro-cyclists, as the group chat was initially created due to our shared fond for cycling and mountain biking. Here is the list of 17 authors in the group:", "Chris Froome, Egan Bernal, Alberto Contador, Nairo Quintana, Romain Bardet, Vincenzo Nibali, Peter Sagan, Emanuel Buchmann, Julian Alaphillipe, Tony Gallopin, Thibaut Pinot, Tom Dumoulin, Fabio Aru, Adam Yates, Warren Barguil, Wout Van Aert, Bauke Mollem.", "The most active users in the group", "Let\u2019s jump into the data now. The group chat contains 8,337 messages, 2,818 emojis, and 229 links. A first easy look at the data would be to check who is sending most of the messages in the chat. Below is a plot of the number of messages and words per author.", "Vincenzo is the author in the group sending most of the messages (1,470) followed by Chris, Egan, Julian, and Nairo with around 1,000 messages. Let\u2019s see if Nibali would be as active on the Tour de France as he is on this group.", "We can also look at who is sending most of the emojis, and the plot above is showing that Vincenzo Nibali is sending most emojis in the chat followed by Egan, Chris, and Peter. The top 5 is almost the same as in the previous plot. I note that Julian Alaphillipe is sending very few emojis.", "Another way to explore if there are some correlations between the different variables is to create a correlation matrix. Based on it, there is no strong correlation among the variables. There is a fair correlation between the number of emoji and the ratio of words per emoji (0.38). There is a strong correlation between Letter Count-Word Count, this correlation is expected as the more words the more letters.", "To finish up the descriptive section, I looked at the URLs sent by each author, and you will notice that Nairo is sending most of the links (118) into the group, followed by Julian (36) and Vincenzo(28).", "More statistics about the top 5 authors", "Next, I have summarized the statistics of each user in the group, to make it short, I have only posted the top 5 users in the group.", "I also looked at which days of the week are the most active. Based on the radar chart below, Tuesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays are the busiest days: around 1,400 messages were sent on these days.", "Now let\u2019s look at the number of messages sent through time. On the plot below, it\u2019s noticeable that since around March 2020 the group is significantly more active than before (p-value: 2.63e-06).", "I think this increase was likely due to the lockdown in France between March and May: more free time = more time to send messages.", "The most active day was on April 27, in which 150 messages have been sent.", "As of August 2020, there is a total of 3,304 emojis in the Unicode Standard. In my Whatsapp group, a total of 143 unique emojis have been used. The pie chart below represents the proportion of the emoji used in total in the group:", "Around 50% of the emoji used is split into only 4 types:", "\ud83d\ude02: Face with Tears of Joy", "\ud83d\ude01: Beaming Face with Smiling Eyes", "\ud83d\ude04: Grinning Face with Smiling Eyes", "Even though WhatsApp contained 3,304 emojis, the vast majority of the authors are only using 4 emojis. It looks like this group chat is really fun as most of the emojis have a lot of smiles and tears of joy which does make sense since we are joking each other all the time.", "As a biologist by training, I couldn\u2019t help to notice how the Diversity Index could be applied in this scenario. The Diversity Index is a quantitative approach that reflects how many types of species there is in an ecosystem, based on the abundance of each species and the variety of species. Therefore, I set out to calculate the richness of emojis, meaning that I counted the number of unique emojis used by each author in the group chat. The way we can interpret the Diversity Index is by comparing different ecosystems. In this case, each Author is one ecosystem. Vincenzo is the user with the highest diversity and Egan has the lowest diversity among the top 5 users, even though he is sending a lot of emojis! We can start by suggesting Egan to diversify his emojis. To dig a bit deeper, let\u2019s look at the proportion of emojis used by Vincenzo and Egan:", "Vincenzo has the highest diversity index and Egan has the lowest among the top 5. Vincenzo is using more than 50% of the time 3 emojis, and Egan is using one emoji more than 75% of the time.", "A cloud of words is a visual representation of text data, in which the size represents the frequency of each word, in this case, the group chat. The first step to creating a word cloud is to merge all the comments into one long string with 335,093 words.", "\u201cOui\u201d or \u201cyes\u201d in English has been used 118 times, and \u201cmoi\u201d or \u201cme\u201d has been used 214 times. I see on this cloud some words related to cycling: \u201cv\u00e9lo\u201d, \u201cZwift\u201d, \u201cGarmin\u201d,\u201dvtt\u201d, \u201cstrava\u201d, \u201ccourse\u201d, \u201csortie\u201d. Surprisingly, I am not seeing words about drinking or food. The word \u201cbi\u00e8re\u201d or beer has been used 17 times, and \u201cvin\u201d or wine only 8 times. In the era of coronavirus, the word lockdown or \u201cconfinement\u201d has been used 33 times. Before doing this analysis I would expect to see more unhealthy habits but based on the word cloud the group is pretty healthy and focusing more on sports.", "This analysis is now coming to an end, if you are interested in the code, you can access it through my GitHub repo. As a summary, in this article, I explored the tendencies of how people text each other, what are the busiest days, and what is the trend through time. Also, I was able to run some fun analysis, to analyze which authors are sending the most or least emojis, and what is the diversity of emojis used.", "I hope that you enjoyed reading this article, that you learned a few insights on how to prepare and explore data from Whatsapp and that you see now the potential of NLP for businesses, or just to know your friends and their habits.", "To further explore these data, I could perform sentiment analysis to try to find tendencies among the authors. I could, for example, investigate who are the most positive/negative authors? Or, are the sentiments changing through time?", "This project has opened my vision of data science, and I cannot wait to keep on exploring the NLP world. For instance, I read a pretty cool article from Sharon Lim, in which he applied topic modeling and Naive Bayes for classification. In the article, Sharon was able to find the optimal number of topics and determine the various topic categories and structures.", "Lastly, if you like my work, you can connect with me on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
