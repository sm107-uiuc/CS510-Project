Essentially these two concepts describe different ways that the model can fail to match your data set. Underfitting refers to making a model that is not complex enough to accurately represent the data and misses trends in the data set. Overfitting refers to a situation where the model is too complex for the data set, andbelieves that there are trends in the data set when there actually aren\u2019t.", "Another way to think about these topics is through the terms bias and variance. These two terms are additional fundamental concepts in data science and represent another way of thinking about the challenges of model fit. Understanding these two concepts will help you create useful simulation models.", "Both terms describe how a model changes as you retrain it using different portions of a given data set. By changing the portion of data set used to train the model, you can change the functions describing the resulting model. However, models of different structures will respond to new data sets in different ways. Bias and variance describe the two different ways that models can respond. They are defined as follows:", "Bias: Bias describes how well a model matches the training set. A model with high bias won\u2019t match the data set closely, while a model with low bias will match the data set very closely. Bias comes from models that are overly simple and fail to capture the trends present in the data set.", "Variance: Variance describes how much a model changes when you train it using different portions of your data set. A model with high variance will have the flexibility to match any data set that\u2019s provided to it, potentially resulting in dramatically different models each time. Variance comes from models that are highly complex, employing a significant number of features.", "Typically models with high bias have low variance, and models with high variance have low bias. This is because the two come from opposite types of models. A model that is not flexible enough to match a data set correctly (High bias) is also not flexible enough to change dramatically when given a different data set (Low variance).", "Those who\u2019ve read my previous article on underfitting and overfitting will probably note a lot of similarity between these concepts. Underfit models usually have high bias and low variance. Overfit models usually have high variance and low bias.", "The Bias-Variance Trade-Off is a commonly discussed term in data science. This is because actions that you take to decrease bias (Leading to a better fit to the training data) will simultaneously increase the variance in the model (Leading to higher risk of poor predictions). The inverse is also true; actions that you take to reduce variance will inherently increase bias.", "It\u2019s important to keep in mind that increasing variance is not always a bad thing. An underfit model is underfit because it does not have enough variance, leading to consistently high bias errors. This means that, when developing a model you need to find the right amount of variance, or the right amount of model complexity. The key is to increase model complexity, thus decreasing bias and increasing variance, until bias has been minimized and before significant variance errors become evident.", "Another solution is to increase the size of the data set used to train your model. High variance errors, also referred to as overfitting models, come from creating a model that is too complex for the available data set. If you\u2019re able to use more data to train the model, then you can create a model that is more complex without accidentally adding variance error.", "This trick doesn\u2019t help with reducing bias error, unfortunately. A model with low bias, or an underfit model, is not sensitive to the training data. Therefore increasing the size of the data set won\u2019t improve the model significantly; it\u2019s unable to respond to the change. The solution to high bias is higher variance, which usually means adding more data.", "I\u2019ve written a few articles on similar topics. One, which has been linked to a few times in this article, discusses the details of underfit and overfit models, and gives related examples. A second conceptually discusses the process of model development, validation, and testing that you can use to determine when a model has been well fit to the data set. This process will help you decide if you have the right amount of variance in the model, and help you determine whether or not you need to add more data.", "Finally, I learned a lot of my starting data science concepts by reading Joel Grus\u2019s book Data Science from Scratch: First Principles with Python. His book introduces many of the fundamental concepts of data science, and provides example code helping you develop some initial functions in python.", "Bias and variance are two key terms in data science and model development. Together they describe the two key errors that can arise when creating models. Bias refers to constant error at all points, representing a model that isn\u2019t complex enough to capture the data set. Variance refers to a model that is too complex for the data set, often acting as if there are trends in the data set that don\u2019t really exist.", "These two types of error lead to the famous Bias-Variance Trade-Off. The solution to high bias in the model is to add more variance. But adding too much variance leads to variance errors. Thus it becomes a balancing act of creating a model with enough variance to capture the data set and reduce bias error, but not create a model that has so much variance that it adds variance error.", "If it\u2019s not possible to find a solution with low bias and low variance error, you need to find and add more data. A larger data set allows you to create a more complex model without adding significant variance error. In this way you can create a model that is complex enough to minimize bias error while not being so complex that it adds significant variance error.", "Your home for data science.
