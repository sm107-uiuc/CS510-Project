To train parameters of any model we need a training dataset. After training the model, we need to evaluate how well the model\u2019s parameters have been trained; for which we use a test dataset which is utterly distinct from the training dataset and hence unseen by the model. After that, we define an evaluation metric to quantify how well our model performed on the test dataset.", "For comparing two language models A and B, pass both the language models through a specific natural language processing task and run the job. After that compare the accuracies of models A and B to evaluate the models in comparison to one another. The natural language processing task may be text summarization, sentiment analysis and so on.", "Limitations: Time consuming mode of evaluation.", "Perplexity is the multiplicative inverse of the probability assigned to the test set by the language model, normalized by the number of words in the test set. If a language model can predict unseen words from the test set, i.e., the P(a sentence from a test set) is highest; then such a language model is more accurate.", "As a result, better language models will have lower perplexity values or higher probability values for a test set.", "Example Perplexity Values of different N-gram language models trained using 38 million words and tested using 1.5 million words from The Wall Street Journal dataset", "The following example can explain the intuition behind Perplexity: Suppose a sentence is given as follows: The task given to me by the Professor was ____. A better language model would make a meaningful sentence by placing a word based on conditional probability values which were assigned using the training set. Hence we can say that how well a language model can predict the next word and therefore make a meaningful sentence is asserted by the perplexity value assigned to the language model based on a test set.", "It is a method of generating sentences from the trained language model. Suppose the trained language model is bigram then Shannon Visualization Method creates sentences as follows:", "\u2022 Choose a random bigram (<s>, w) according to its probability \u2022 Now choose a random bigram (w, x) according to its probability \u2022 And so on until we choose </s> \u2022 Then string the words together \u2022", "Here <s> and </s> signifies the start and end of the sentences respectively. For Example:", "Shakespeare\u2019s corpus and Sentence Generation Limitations using Shannon Visualization Method", "Number of tokens = 884,647, Number of Types = 29,066. However, Shakespeare\u2019s corpus contained around 300,000 bigram types out of V*V= 844 million possible bigrams. Hence approximately 99.96% of the possible bigrams were never seen in Shakespeare\u2019s corpus. As a result, the bigram probability values of those unseen bigrams would be equal to zero making the overall probability of the sentence equal to zero and in turn perplexity to infinity. This is a limitation which can be solved using smoothing techniques.", "Quadrigrams were worse as what was coming out looks like Shakespeare\u2019s corpus because it is Shakespeare\u2019s corpus due to over-learning as a result of the increase in dependencies in Quadrigram language model equal to 3.", "Your home for data science.
