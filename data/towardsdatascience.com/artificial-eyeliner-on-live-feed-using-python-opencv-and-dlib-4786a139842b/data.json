In this article, I have tried to create an artificial eyeliner to mimic Snapchat or Instagram filters. Hope you enjoy reading.", "This article is meant for beginners in computer vision, who want to build something exciting. I\u2019ll keep the explanation as simple as I can. I\u2019d advice on going through the code on GitHub along with reading the article to have a better understanding.", "It is important to set up a new virtual environment and install all the required dependencies before you begin. You can visit my GitHub repo for the instructions.", "We\u2019ll be using OpenCV, NumPy, imutils, SciPy and Dlib for this project. Below is a brief description of the use of these libraries in our project \u2014 feel free to skip this section if you\u2019re already familiar.", "Briefly explaining \u2014 the program first extracts 68 landmark points from each face. Of those 68 points, points 37\u201342 belong to the left eye and points 43\u201348 belong to the right eye \u2014 see picture below.", "Because our goal is to apply eyeliner, we are only interested in points 37\u201348 and we extract these points. We\u2019ll interpolate these extracted points. Interpolation means that we try to insert points between two given points. We can either make this interpolation linear or smooth \u2014 see figure below for details.", "The flow chart of the eyeliner algorithm is shown below.", "Next, we describe the algorithm in further detail. If you are just interested in running the code, skip to the next section.", "We\u2019ll first extract the coordinates of the bounding box surrounding the face.", "OpenCV converts an image to a NumPy array. This numpy.array (that is a matrix representation of an image) is stored in the variable named frame. We use a function called face_detector() that returns the coordinates of bounding boxes surrounding all the faces found in a frame. These bounding box coordinates are stored in a variable named bounding_boxes.We iterate a loop over bounding_boxes to apply eyeliner over each face detected in a frame. face_landmark_points stores the 68 landmark points. eye_landmark_points is an array of eye landmark points received from getEyeLandmarkPts() .", "The getEyeLandmarkPts() takes 68 landmark points as input and returns an array of 4 elements having coordinates of left upper eyelid (L_eye_top) , left lower eyelid (L_eye_bottom) and same for right eye (R_eye_top & R_eye_bottom). This is done by simple NumPy indexing. We\u2019re shifting the extreme points (pt no. 37,40,43 and 46. See the 68 landmark points figure) to further outside by 5 px. This is done in line no. 6\u20139. This is to give a more realistic look.", "Now we need to interpolate through these points to get a smooth curve from which we can make eyeliner. We need to treat each curve differently. (i.e. L_eye_top , L_eye_bottom, R_eye_top, R_eye_bottom). Hence we use a separate variable name for each curve. interpolateCoordinates() is used to generate interpolations over each of these curves.The functioninterp1d() from the scipy module is used to generate the interpolation. The kind='quadratic' means to generate a curvature of those points.", "interpolateCoordinates() is called by getEyelinerPoints() repetitively to generate interpolated coordinates for each curve. It returns an array of interpolated points for each curve.", "drawEyeLiner() takes the generated interpolated points as an argument and draws a line between two consecutive points. This is done for each curve in two loops, one for left and other for right eye. These drawn lines make our eyeliner. It returns a new frame op which has the eyeliner. And BOOM ! We\u2019re done :D.", "The usage of this project is very simple. Just clone the github repo from here.", "Next, open the command prompt and type the following code to run a sample test", "You can use your own video by placing your video path inside the argument. The complete CLI commands are as follows:", "Play around with the code and if you add something useful, do make a pull request. Let\u2019s make it a collaborative project.", "Well this brings us to the end.", "Hey this is my first post. Please comment your doubts and feedback, and I shall be happy to solve them.
