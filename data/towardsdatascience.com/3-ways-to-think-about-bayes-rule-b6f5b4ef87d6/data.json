It's also at the foundation of all science and a key tool for critical thinking. Unfortunately, it is often taught as just a formula to memorize, with too little time spent on really grokking what is going on. I had a hard time really wrapping my brain around it when it was first taught to me, and this is post is what I wish someone had told me back then.", "In English, \"the conditional probability of A given B is equal to the conditional probability of B given A multiplied by the probability of A and divided by the probability of B.\" If that seems like a mouthful, don't worry; it will make more sense visually.", "So far, this is just a formula with a proof, something to memorize and apply. Fortunately, there are ways of thinking about it that make it feel more natural and provide some insights about what is really happening.", "The first is a visual approach that breaks down the right-hand side of the formula into 3 steps, each of which has a clear graphical interpretation. Think of the universe as the set of all possible outcomes for an experiment. For example, the universe U for a die roll is {1,2,3,4,5,6}. But if I tell you I rolled an even number and you just don't know which one, that narrows U to {2,4,6}. We're doing the same thing here, but illustrating it graphically.", "We have two events, A and B, and they sometimes happen together: A \u2229 B. Our universe, U, is everything that can happen, and area represents probability. Since it is our frame of reference for everything else right now, we highlight it in blue.", "This is our starting point \u2014 a conditional probability, but not the one we really want. In a sense, this gives us a new, smaller universe: A (highlighted in blue). Our event of interest is the gray area A \u22c2 B. Area(A \u22c2 B)/Area(A) answers the question, \"How probable is B if we already know A has happened?\"", "This is our way of zooming the frame back out to the original universe. The event of interest A \u22c2 B stays the same, but the universe (the denominator of our probability fraction, if you will) becomes larger.", "Finally, we shrink the universe to B by dividing by P(B). The event of interest still doesn't change. Now we have P(A|B), the left-hand side of Bayes' Rule that we are interested in.", "For visually-oriented learners (most people), this is a satisfying and intuitive way to think about probability. As long as you can picture the \"frame\" shifting to shrink or stretch our universe, you can picture what is really happening with Bayes' Rule, and hopefully, that helps you get a feel for why it is always true. It may even help you remember the formula.", "This is the most common vocabulary real statisticians use to talk about Bayes' Rule. \"Bayesian updating\" is an important concept in every branch of science. The basic thrust of it is that while we ultimately want to know P(A|B), we start with our prior probability P(A), the unconditional probability of A. From there, we use P(B|A) and P(B) to resize P(A) to where it should be \u2014 what we now know after taking all relevant information into account.", "I like to think of P(B|A)/P(B) as a scaling factor that we use to update P(A). Essentially, we are weighting P(A) by P(B|A)/P(B) to determine how much we should change our prior based on new information.", "We can think of our scaling factor as \"how much more/less probable A makes B\". If A and B are independent, this will be 1. If they are disjoint, it will be 0. If they are the same event, it will be 1/P(B)=1/P(A). If A happening makes it \u03bb times more probable that B happens, then the conditional probability of A given B should be \u03bb times greater than P(A).", "If you still don't have a sense for why this is true, just use the equation P(A|B) / P(A) = P(B|A) / P(B) and think of it as: \"how much more probable B makes A\"=\"how much more probable A makes B\". The right-hand side is our scaling factor, while the left-hand side contains both our starting point and our end point.", "And just in case you have trouble feeling in your gut why it must be true that A increases the probability of B by exactly the amount that B increases the probability of A, have a look at the following obviously true equations, especially the second one. (Hint: What cancels? Which probability does each fraction represent? What does each product of fractions represent?) It's a good exercise. And if you prefer, let Area(U)=1.", "The brilliance of Bayes' Rule is that it formalizes a key insight from how we make decisions in our everyday life. We begin with our baseline information, often assumptions, about reality. Every little bit of new information causes us to update our beliefs, unless of course it perfectly confirms them (and unfortunately, we often find new information more confirming than we should \u2014 confirmation bias at work). Or at least new evidence should cause us to update or beliefs, because that's a big part of what it means to be rational.", "If we already do this naturally, why do we need Bayes' Rule? Good question. The problem is that there are some situations, including some very high-stakes and important ones, where our monkey-brain intuition breaks down, and formalizing this process of belief-updating can help us avoid mistakes. We'll consider one such example later.", "If you know the conditional probability of B given A but want to get to the other conditional probability, P(A|B), all we need to know is the unconditional probability of the two events. All we need to do to get from one conditional probability to the other is to multiply by the ratio of the unconditional probabilities. Stated this way, this relationship might seem surprising or random, but thinking about it visually can help you see why it must be true.", "In fact, this may seem like it's just a less helpful restatement of the visual interpretation, but it turns out this is an especially good way to think about it as a data scientist. That's because it allows us to go from recall to precision and vice versa. We'll go into detail on this once we've seen an example, and it will make more sense.", "It's important to note that these are all equivalent ways of thinking about Bayes' Rule. You don't need to juggle all of them in your head. If one really clicks with you, use that one. I find that there are generally different situations where one will make more sense than another.", "Let's look at each of our 3 interpretations as it applies to a real-world example. Consider the following scenario:", "(Note: the specific numbers don't matter too much. We could have chosen different numbers. One interesting exercise is to change the numbers one-at-a-time and see what effect each change has on the outcome.)", "To simplify things, we can rename our events and identify which probability goes where in the formula:", "Notice that we don\u2019t have P(A \u22c2 B) explicitly given here. It is implied, though, and it wouldn\u2019t be difficult to calculate, if necessary.", "Now we're ready to apply each of the 3 interpretations to our numbers.", "Since the subset A of people with the disease is so tiny, we\u2019ll just zoom in to a small corner of our universe. This isn\u2019t drawn exactly to scale, but it\u2019s close enough for our purposes.", "Step 1: P(B | A)Start with the conditional probability we know: the probability of a correct diagnosis if you actually have the disease.", "Step 2: P(B | A) \u00b7 P(A) = P(A \u22c2 B)Get the probability of the intersection by multiplying by P(A). We can also think of this as \"de-conditioning\" the conditional probability.", "Step 3: P(B | A) \u00b7 P(A) / P(B) = P(A | B)Now we zoom back in, but to a different universe (B), to give us the conditional probability we really care about.", "What's the moral of the story? Testing for very rare diseases is extremely difficult. It's not that the test is terrible per se; it's just that when so few people have the disease, there can't be many false positives without making the test very unreliable for those who test positive. This is one reason doctors use multiple tests, and tests that perform like this hypothetical one are used to screen who should be subjected to further (often more expensive) tests. Its recall, after all, is really quite good \u2014 of the people with the disease, it detects the vast majority of them (at the expense of alarming many more healthy people \u2192 low precision).", "In this framework, you go to the doctor assuming that your probability of having the disease is 0.01%, or 0.0001. You will then use the results of the test to update your beliefs regarding whether you have the disease.", "What exactly does the scaling factor mean in this context? It essentially tells us how much more likely you are to get a positive when you have the disease [=P(B|A)], relative to any randomly-selected person in the population [=P(B)]. The fact that this ratio is large tells us that we should update accordingly by increasing our degree of belief that we have the disease. In this case, we're 98 times more likely to test positive if we have the disease, so we take the ex ante rate of 0.01% and scale it up by a factor of 98. In other words, 1 in 10,000 people has the disease, but 98 in 10,000 who test positive for it actually have the disease, so a positive diagnosis makes you update your beliefs accordingly.", "Exercise: To see an upside to this test, consider what the scaling factor would be if you had tested negative.", "In this interpretation, you start with the \"other\" conditional probability and scale it by the ratio of unconditional probabilities to get our final degree of belief that you have the disease.", "We already have the answer to the question \"What is the probability I test positive if it is true that I have the disease?\" Now you want to get from there to the probability that you have the disease if you have already tested positive. Just like in the second paradigm, we scale it to get our final degree of belief.", "Of course, we get the same answer as above, but the interesting part is the difference in how we got there.", "Interestingly, we can put this in terms of precision and recall. High precision means few false positives and high recall means few false negatives. We know that high recall (99%) in the test means higher precision as well, holding all other factors constant (since both formulas are increasing in TP). But we need to take those other factors into account to know whether high recall really translates into high precision, and in this case, it doesn't.", "Why is that? Our scaling factor P(A)/P(B) tells us that for a randomly-selected individual in our population, the probability of actually having the disease is much lower than the probability of testing positive. In fact, it tells us that you are 100 times more likely to test positive than you are to have the disease. So even though the vast majority of people who have the disease will have it accurately detected, they will still be a minority of all the people who test positive.", "Put differently, our scaling factor compares the number of false negatives to the number of false positives. It's not exactly their ratio, but rather the ratio of each added to the number of true positives.", "In a nutshell: Start with recall, then scale it by \"how probable is having the disease compared to getting a positive diagnosis\" to get precision. More on this in the next and final section.", "As an extra, let's dig into this and show exactly how Bayes' Rule relates to precision and recall.", "It seems almost trivial when we state it this way. \"Precision is recall, except that you cancel out the part that makes it recall and add in the part that makes it precision.\" We could just go one step further to get", "which is blatantly obvious, and not at all helpful. The real value of this, though, is that we now have a way to tie together two different concepts that are sometimes treated as quite different but are in fact intimately related.", "Your home for data science.
