The ever-increasing data and thriving demand of intelligent systems require an aggressive analysis over the data. Whether you use your virtual assistant like Siri or Alexa, or you get content recommendation on your media service providers like Netflix or Amazon; data analytics is the foundation of every smart system. It has already spread the roots everywhere, be it supporting in decision making to grow any business or becoming a part of our lifestyle.", "As we begin ahead, let\u2019s use the data analytics to explore a city of Canada. This article will lead you into exploring the eatery and neighborhood venues of Fredericton. Using the terms of data science methodologies, we will drive it from describing the problem to concluding it with the possible answers.", "Fredericton is the capital city of Canadian province of New Brunswick, with a population of around 60 thousand. One of main urban centers in New Brunswick, It is the third largest city in the province.", "As a provincial capital, its economy is tied to the public sector; however, the city also contains a growing IT and commercial sector. The city has the highest percentage of residents with post-secondary education in the province and the highest per capita income of any city in New Brunswick [1].", "Being a resident of this city, I decided to explore the venues of Fredericton. The city is fully diverse with lot of communities and it is becoming denser as it attracts more people around the globe. Indeed, the importance of food diversity cannot be denied here.", "The aim of the project is to explore the venues in Fredericton. As Fredericton\u2019s neighborhoods are not dense and are less in numbers, the desire will be to find out the eatery category and their share in food diversity in Fredericton city.", "This project will help to figure out the different cuisines available in the city. Any government official or food industry expert can use the outcome of this analysis to know the food diversity in the city. Vendors, who are planning to set up their restaurant or food outlet, can take help of this analysis to make their decision.", "Following data sources were inclusive part of this analysis:", "List of Postal codes of Canada: E [2]", "This page has list of postal codes of New Brunswick FSAs (Forward Sortation Area). The page data was uploaded and the table of postal code was scraped using Python package. This data consist postal code of all neighborhoods, we can use this data to get the spatial coordinates of Fredericton neighborhoods.", "Foursquare is a technology company that built a massive data-set of location data. Currently its location data is most comprehensive and quite accurate. It feeds location data for many popular services like Apple Maps, Uber and Twitter.", "Using the API [3], I got the data of venues of Fredericton neighborhoods. API provided the response in JSON and venues were retrieved along with their category and other details. I used this data to explore the food diversity in the city.", "In order to explore the city, first we need the city data. That was retrieved from the Wikipedia page; I scraped the page data using BeautifulSoup package of Python. The table from wiki page was converted into below pandas data frame.", "To represent the neighborhoods on map and to get the venues from foursquare API, the spatial coordinates are required. To get the spatial coordinate of neighborhoods, I used the Geocode library of Python.", "Using Geocode, I was able to get the longitude and latitude of all the neighborhoods that we scraped in last step. As a result following data frame was created:", "The shape of the data frame is (111, 5), which means there are 111 neighborhood in New Brunswick. The postal codes, which are not assigned, have been cleaned out from the data frame.", "Above data frame consist all the boroughs of New Brunswick province. It can be visualized on a map using folium library; following picture is the representation of New Brunswick with neighborhoods superimposed on top, using folium library.", "As we are looking to explore only Fredericton neighborhoods, I separated out the data for borough \u2018Fredericton\u2019 in a new data frame.", "Client ID and Secret are required to call the Foursquare API, which can be generated by signing up on foursquare developer site. Foursquare provides API end points with different filter options. I first tried to get the venues for the entire neighborhood in Fredericton. The Fredericton neighborhoods are not dense, so I kept the radius as 10000 meter and limit 100. After the JSON data was received from Foursquare, It was interpreted and transformed into following data frame:", "The merged data frame has information for all the venues of neighborhoods. Let\u2019s do the one hot encoding of the venues; I converted the venue categories to the columns of a new data frame and added neighborhood column in it.", "The shape of the data frame is (4, 53) that depicts there are 52 unique categories of venues. Using this data frame, we can find the most common venues of Fredericton neighborhoods. I tried to get top three common venues and result is here:", "The result tells us the three most common venues of Fredericton neighborhoods. As we see, the most common venues include restaurant for three neighborhoods. However, North Fredericton is the only neighborhood that does not have any restaurant in common venues. North Fredericton\u2019s population is very less as compare to the other parts of Fredericton. As a result, it has less number of outlets comparatively.", "There are only four neighborhoods in Fredericton; hence clustering the neighborhoods is not a good option here. Thus, we will do further analysis on the restaurant category to know the taste of Fredericton.", "I used the Foursquare API again but this time category id was passed, to get venues only of food category. The JSON response was interpreted same way as we did before and transferred into a data frame. There are 22 unique food categories that also contains general categories like Diner, Food and Food Court. I made a list of general categories and removed those venues from the data frame.", "As we are looking to explore the eatery category in Fredericton city, I added one column in data frame for borough and inserted the value as Fredericton.", "To make the data more structured, I made the venue categories as the columns and performed a group-by on \u2018Borough\u2019 with mean values of categories multiply by 100. It gave me the percentage value of each category for the Fredericton city. The data frame with mean value of categories is depicted below:", "To visualize the above data, I got transpose data from above data frame, rounded the percentage decimal to two points and converted the data frame as following:", "Above data frame is good to visualize now. A horizontal bar chart would be a good choice to visualize it and show the percentage of eatery category in Fredericton.", "Let\u2019s create a bar chart on it using the Matplot and Seaborn libraries. Following is the horizontal bar chart on this data:", "The bar chart shows the percentage of eatery categories in Fredericton. The percentage of each bar is shown along with itself. The graph clearly shows that Fast Food Restaurants are leading here with around 25% share. Pizza and sandwich places are also running ahead from any kind of special cuisine in the city. Chinese Restaurants have their fair share in the food diversity of Fredericton. There are other cuisines as well in city that are enhancing the taste of the Fredericton.", "After considering the results, it can be said that Fast Food Restaurants are dominating the food market in Fredericton. The result shows the food diversity in the city, which is quite vibrant considering the city\u2019s population. In addition, it cannot be denied that increasing population of the city will boost the demand of more cuisines in the city. Hence, it will bring more opportunities for the vendors who are planning to invest in food business.", "Moreover, if we see the neighborhoods of Fredericton, restaurant category could not make it to be in the most common venues of north Fredericton, yet construction is on top; it further grabs the attention of the stakeholders.", "The scope of this analysis can be extended further by taking the data of population figures, community dominating locations and their interests, to know the exact demand of the city; which can be a deciding factor for the vendors to make their decision.", "Thank you for reading the article!
