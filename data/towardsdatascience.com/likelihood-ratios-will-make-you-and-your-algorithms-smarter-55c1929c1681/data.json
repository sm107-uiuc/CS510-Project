They can\u2019t. All they do is estimate how likely or unlikely a phenomenon is.", "But probabilities fit uneasily into the world. We (and our algorithms) have to make binary decisions \u2014 yes/no, stop/go \u2014 based on imperfect information. We have to treat a probability as though it were a sure thing. One approach is to try to perfect that information \u2014 to create a perfect test that never fails and always gives the correct results.", "We all know that approach is unrealistic in real-world situations. By definition, the world is more complicated than any representation of it in a test or algorithm. Worse, from a product development perspective, the effort to perfect a test soon yields diminishing returns. It eats up time and resources and makes you look dumb to your boss or customers.", "The way out of that trap is to incorporate other information into your decision. We all know this and we all do it. But we don\u2019t always do it well. Likelihood ratios allow you to incorporate test results with other information and do so with rigor and precision.", "Likelihood ratios were developed for use in healthcare decision-making. That\u2019s my background, so I\u2019ll start there, but if flesh-and-blood bores you and you want a machine learning example, feel free to skip ahead to the next section. The principle is exactly the same.", "I ragged about the shortcomings of over-hyped cancer tests here. The test in question had superficially good performance but would spew out a heinous level of false-positives due to low prevalence. Likelihood ratios might just rescue such a test, though, and render it useful to mankind.", "Let\u2019s start with the basics of any diagnostic test: its sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the fraction of true positives (patients with the disease) who test positive. Specificity is the fraction of true negatives (patients without the disease) who test negative.", "In the example I used for lung cancer, the liquid biopsy test would have 80% sensitivity at a specificity of 93%. Because lung cancer is rare, with new cases occurring in 0.05% of the population per year, a positive result does not mean that you have cancer. In fact, the chance that you have cancer would still be less than one percent. A positive test result by itself is worse than useless.", "Likelihood ratios make use of that result. Positive likelihood ratio is defined as", "Plugging in the numbers for sensitivity and specificity above, the test results mean that you are about 11 times more likely to have lung cancer than you were in the absence of a positive result. That\u2019s 11 times a very small number, so it\u2019s still a small number, and not really actionable.", "But now you can combine it with other information. Smoking increases your odds of getting lung cancer by a factor of 24. That\u2019s a lot, but not enough to justify an intervention \u2014 24 x 0.0005 (the baseline odds) is only 0.012. But now multiply in the post-test increase and your odds have gone up to 11 x 24 x 0.0005 = 0.13, or a probability of 12%*. That\u2019s enough to justify an intervention. Likelihood ratios allow you to combine several inadequate bits of information and come up with a useful conclusion.", "Let\u2019s say you are working on one of the harder problems in AI \u2014 object recognition. Maybe your job is to come up with an algorithm to recognize stop signs for a self-driving vehicle. Your product requirement document states that your code has to have a false-negative rate (i.e, missing a stop sign) of less than 1 in 1000, as well as a false-positive rate (stopping when there is no sign) also less than 1 in 1000.", "Your coding is (as usual) brilliant and innovative. But you hit a brick wall nonetheless. Although you hit each of your targets individually, you can\u2019t meet both simultaneously. Lower the probability threshold to reduce the misses, and the code starts throwing false-positives, seeing stop signs where there are none. Damp down the false-positives, and your car starts running stop signs. Not good.", "You\u2019ve tested extensively and know that (at maximal accuracy) your code has a sensitivity of 99.5% (i.e., it misses 5 per 1000 signs).", "You are frustrated by your inability to write code that does a better job of recognizing stop signs. To relieve the stress (and get away from your boss\u2019 demands for status updates) you take your old lame dog for a walk. Looking around as it sniffs a tree, you realize that you don\u2019t need better recognition code. You just need independent information, and to integrate it with recognition.", "A survey of cities reveals that 80% of crosswalks also have stop signs. Likelihood ratios let you use this information to meet your specs.", "To use LRs, you follow these steps:", "Voila! Problem solved. You now detect 99.9% of stop signs. Likelihood ratios let you incorporate the Bayesian prior that crosswalks usually have stop signs. That information, along with your excellent object recognition code, gets the job done.", "No test, no matter how sophisticated and elegant, is perfect. All are subject to false positives and false negatives. Likelihood ratios mobilize other information in the service of better test performance. They let you use information that is completely independent and even disparate in form. Your test is far more likely to make the world a better place if it incorporates likelihood ratios.", "*To convert odds to probability, divide odds by (1+odds). This conversion is not important for small values of odds.", "Your home for data science.
