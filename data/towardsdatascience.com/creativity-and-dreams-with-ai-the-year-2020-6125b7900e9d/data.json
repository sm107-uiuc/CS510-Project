Fine-tuned on \u201cUlysses\u201d, GPT-2 delivered me a screenplay: dozens of text pages in the style of Joyce.

I gave GPT-3 a task to write a Love Letter by a Toaster, and it fulfilled the request perfectly:", "GPT-3 understands what\u2019s a toaster. It also knows the features of a love letter. But combining them in a typical exercise for human creative writing into a convincing work like above is astonishing. Check out the Love Letter versions written by things and characters here.", "With the help of GPT-3, I created short crime stories like \u201cK\u00f6stner\u2019s Intelligence\u201d, took part in NaNoWriMo with multimedia stories, or generated new poetry:", "I also had ontological discussions about our reality:", "Applying the famous Nabokov Questionnaire on AI was an insightful experience (published in Harpers\u2019 Magazine in October).", "Remember my \u201cEmpty Room\u201d storyboard, written by GPT-2?

The good news is: that since it\u2019s trained on a vast data set, it is less biased than other models with smaller datasets.", "OpenAI released another treasure trove in 2020 that strangely got little attention: JukeBox. Trained on a million and a half songs, this AI model creates music. In many styles and genres.

After my experiments, I understood: AI is far from being a standalone creator. But it is also much more than just a tool. It\u2019s an endless collection of ideas, unexpected twists, and thought fodder. It\u2019s a Muse that can help with writer\u2019s block. AI is a co-author full of weirdness and the knowledge of the world \u2014 whether about historical persons, fairy tales, or astrophysics. AI will never replace us \u2014 but inspire and complement.
