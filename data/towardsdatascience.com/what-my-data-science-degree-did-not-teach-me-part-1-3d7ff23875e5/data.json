This degree gave me the knowledge, the confidence and the motivation to step into the field and I strongly believe that without this degree, I would have never become a Data Scientist. I recently wrote an article about my rather uncommon path from working in Sales to being a Data Scientist where I mention my degree as well and the struggles I faced during it.", "When I look back, I certainly see that my Master helped immensely in giving me a start. However, there were many relevant points that my academic training did not address. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I do not blame the University nor the academic team. The speed at which the Data Science and AI fields currently expand remains too high for academic institutions to adapt at the same pace. Moreover, time and resources restrictions in a Master\u2019s degree limit the content that can be taught. However, when I entered the field, many difficult or essential aspects of the job were unknown to me. This article covers the first part of my findings in my 3-year career in Data Science.", "Editor\u2019s note: these findings were determined for the most part by my own professional experience and partially from the experience of my former and current colleagues. Other Data Scientists might have experienced entirely different issues.", "Accessing the data is one of the biggest struggles that I encountered in my career as Data Scientist which I never expected after my academic training. It might sound ridiculous and slightly naive, but I graduated believing that my stakeholders would stand ready with a data connection established to have their data sets analyzed by me, The Data Scientist. I quickly learnt how wrong I was. Issues about data accessibility or data extraction happen commonly in large companies full of complex processes and compliance regulations. Nonetheless, smaller organizations can undeniably experience similar issues.", "In most cases, the stakeholders do want their Data Scientists to analyze the data. They often simply do not know in which system it is, nor who has the right permissions to extract and share the data. Some outdated systems might have no direct connection available so you cannot query it from your script and someone has to download the data in Excel format manually. You might sometimes have to rely on another team to build the data connection for you. What if the data has to come from three different departments and the databases were not made to be accessed out of the department? Also, one data owner might not want these databases to be accessed out of the department, for security purposes or due to political matters that no one wants to get involved in.", "Eventually, you might realize that the only option for you to get your data sets is to wait for Angela from the Marketing department to send you the data by email in a .csv file. Unfortunately, Angela might be on holidays for three weeks and people like Angela always seem to be so busy. After a while, sending polite reminders might become your most valuable skill!", "I graduated without knowing much about Git and Version Control in general. I even feel slightly ashamed when I look back at how I dealt with versioning my thesis. To be entirely fair, some guest lecturer did try once to teach us some Git during what seemed to be the worst lecture ever given. It was the first time we were hearing about it, and no one had primarily explained the importance of Version Control. I was told later that this one-time lecturer admitted his failure and actually had a massive hangover on that day (as students, we might have sympathized if he had been honest), which partially justified the super messy lecture he gave.", "As I said in my article about PyCharm, understanding Version Control comes with using Version Control! I learnt how to properly handle Version Controlling on the go, while working in a group on my first AI project. I admitted to my more senior teammates that I did not know the details of Git and I got help with my first commit and my first merge conflicts.", "Anyone studying or starting in Data Science can benefit from Git and Version Control in general, even for individual projects. If you have the chance to work in a group, swallow your pride and ask for help!", "No one ever brought up how much engineering I would have to do if I wanted my projects to work smoothly. No one mentioned Linux, nor how to query an API. It is also very common for Data Scientists to work on Cloud Platforms (e.g. Microsoft Azure, AWS) and to use tools such as Apache Spark. I recently wrote an article about the Data Engineering skills that a Data Scientist needs to know because to be entirely honest, I was extremely surprised by how much engineering I needed and how helpful the skills were on a daily basis.", "Data Science, to me, is a team business. I already mentioned in my previous articles how I value the different backgrounds in data science and the creativity that is involved in finding out solutions collectively.", "It is an extremely vast field, constantly in motion, and no Data Scientist can know everything. Many professionals even recommend specializing in one Data Science domain (e.g. NLP, Deep Learning) as it helps greatly to differentiate yourself in the field. Having a diverse team with expert knowledge in several areas brings better results than having one smart guy that can do a bit of everything.", "Hiring one Data Scientist by itself does not bring the strength of a team. Brainstorming can bring gold to the table.", "While I had to do some storytelling to explain my Master thesis at my graduation ceremony, I did not expect how complex, frequent and serious, this type of storytelling could be. I was not aware that it might be up to me to convince the Sales specialists that my project was worth their time and their client\u2019s time. I also did not expect how much weight visualization would carry in certain Data Science projects, when the results of your model do not matter if your Powerpoint presentation absolutely sucks. I also understood that it is not Minimum Viable Product anymore, it is Minimum Lovable Product.", "One of my colleagues always says \u201cLet\u2019s build a working skate board before we start building a plane\u201d . However, the skateboard should be very shiny and have an option that says \u201c I can fly under certain conditions\u201d even though it cannot, yet. It\u2019s the proof of concept principal. It needs to show off potential features that are not there, yet.", "Regarding code efficiency, the knowledge of my freshly graduated self was limited to \u201cfor loops are a necessary evil\u201d. I knew that training neural networks and certain machine learning models could take a while but apart from selecting features, reducing the size of the data and asking for a better laptop, my only weapon was patience.", "Firstly, most data sets analyzed during my degree did not represent an accurate picture of how messy data sets get in most industries. They commonly came from one or two sources at most and did not require very extensive preparation and cleaning. In business cases, data is often scattered everywhere, requiring multiple merges, lookups, filtering, cleaning, feature engineering.", "Especially in large complex projects, the data preparation can sometimes take as long as the predictions if the code has not been written efficiently.", "While I already knew how evil for loops were, I have learnt several basic Python \u201ctricks\u201d that I believe should be shared in any programming course for Data Science purposes. For instance, using list comprehensions instead of common for loops and using sets instead of lists for look ups can reduce the computing time of your code significantly! Python also has great packages that allow you to find the bottlenecks in your code (e.g. cProfile) or to simply time your different solutions to find the faster one (e.g. Timeit).", "I may have only been working in the field for a few years but I have too much to write about the topic to gather everything in one article. Part 2 of this article will be released next week!", "Follow me on Medium or on Twitter to get notified when Part 2 is published!", "Non-Fiction & Fiction Writer | Working on her Fantasy Debut Novel |
