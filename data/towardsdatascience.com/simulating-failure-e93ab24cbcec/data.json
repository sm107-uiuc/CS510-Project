In the chemical engineering area the machinery is often times a pump. The way that many process and reliability engineers estimate this is with industry charts and years of experience working with the pumps. But very few can tell me what the normal life of the pump is in our operating area. Often times because these pumps don\u2019t fail that often.", "So this begs the question, \u201cHow can I better understand this pumps patterns?\u201d", "An algorithm I often turn to in this case is the Monte Carlo Simulation. As you will see, this style will help us establish a base line that will give us a better idea of when failure are likely to happen.", "Let\u2019s get started. Below we set up some dummy data to feed into our algorithm.", "In the above code we generate some random data using numpy. This data set purposefully has more negative values then positive. You can think of each of these points as positive and negative changes in pump pressure. In fact, in a real world problem you should just take the first difference of your pump pressure reading to get similar data for your problem.", "Now to lets build the work horse function. We will walk through each section of this code as we go along.", "In this function the parameters mean the following", "current_pressure = pressure at which your pump is at right now, or what you want to simulate it at.", "final_pressure = pressure at which the pump either fails at or produces bad results in the product. For example, in the chemical space this could mean the your product starts to burn because it is moving through the pipes to slow. This is something in a real solution you will need to ask someone who is knowledgeable in your process.", "max_threshold = machinery has limits of what is physically possible. For example, if you were to dump a glass of water down the sink the drain can easily keep up, but if you were to put a fire hose in the same sink water would overflow. We have to try and simulate these physical barriers as best as possible this is the reason for this upper bound.", "iterations = this is the number of times we want to run the simulation.", "Now lets jump into what the function is doing.", "This line of code just gives us a place to store the time it took for each simulation to get to a \u201cfailed\u201d state. We will assume for this example that each data point in our sample was taken on an hour interval.", "This code is where the simulation begins. It generates a simulation for each iteration that you wanted. Then it let\u2019s us know how far along we are in our simulation with the print statement.", "hours_til_failure and psi_left are two variables that we reset at the beginning of each iterations. hours_til_failure, essentially keeps track of how long our pump has been running without failing during each iteration. psi_left is the variable that we will later validate against the final_pressure to see if we have met the failure criteria.", "Here while our \u201cnot_done\u201d variable is True, this chunk of code will grab a random sample from our data set, add an hour to how long the pump has been running, and add or subtract the appropriate amount from the pumps current pressure.", "The first if statement checks to see if we have gone below our final_pressure. If this is the case then the number of hours that the simulation ran is appended to the hour_distribution and the simulation starts over.", "The second if statement checks if our pressure has gone above our maximum allowed. if this happens then it adjust the pressure back down into the possible range.", "Let\u2019s try running this 1000 times with some made up pressures and limits.", "In the end the function returns the distribution of hours that our pump lasted over all the iterations. We can graph this using matplotlib.pyplot hist function.", "In this example we can see that the pump reached its failure condition most frequently around 90 hours of run time. However we also see that it hypothetically ran for almost 500 hours once.", "One last note of house keeping make sure that you take out any anomaly events from your data set, such as, startup of machine, or unexpected down time caused by outside events like natural disasters.", "Now, I have found that when trying to run these models for process engineers or reliability engineers it is often best to start with broader variables as inputs into the model. For example, if they tell you, \u201cwe know at 200 pounds of pressure an hour our chemical starts to burn up\u201d. Set your model to fail at 150, this way if you get challenged on different operating conditions you can say that you were optimistic in the run time ability of the machine. Once trust is established then you can hone the model into exact running parameters.", "We have talked about the following in this post:", "There are many fun ways you can tweak this model you can truly simulate any process that changes states. Another example of some place to use this is energy consumption by a process. Again this is a baseline model to help understand the process.", "I would love to hear your feed back and constructive thoughts.", "Your home for data science.
