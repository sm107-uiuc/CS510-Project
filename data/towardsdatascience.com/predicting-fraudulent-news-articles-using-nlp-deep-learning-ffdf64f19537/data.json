This problem is plentiful on the internet, the needs of which require us to experiment with machine learning and deep learning models to classify news that is potentially false.", "This post hopes to clarify \u2018how\u2019 to utilize Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning and Deep Learning to predict and identify fraudulent news articles. It also shares the methods, results and conclusions drawn from the analysis.", "The dataset containing real and fake news articles was obtained from Kaggle. The shape of the dataset was 20800 rows and 5 columns. There were 10413 real articles and 10387 fake articles in the dataset indicating that the dataset is balanced. The \u2018label\u2019 column indicates if the article was real or fake; 1 indicating fake and 0 indicating real.", "Since the text data was unstructured and messy, text preprocessing was required. A helper function was applied to the data to remove line breaks, new lines, hyperlinks, ampersand, greater than/less than signs, non breaking space, emails, new line characters and distracting single quotes. A new column \u2018length\u2019 was created that contains the length of the article text.", "The dataset also contained Null Values in the \u2018author\u2019 and \u2018article_title\u2019 columns that were replaced by \u2018Unknown\u2019. Articles were also removed whose length was less than 50 characters \u2014 the rationale being that articles less than 50 characters are not articles.", "A column named \u2018text_polarity\u2019 was added to the dataset. Using the TextBlob library\u2019s sentiment polarity function on the \u2018text\u2019 column returned polarity of text on scale -1 to 1 indicating negative to positive.", "It would be interesting to see how the distributions of text polarity differ between real articles and fake articles. Figure 3A and 3B below show the distribution of text polarity of real articles and fake articles respectively.", "The distribution of text polarity across both types of articles seemed to be evenly distributed with some articles being completely negative and completely positive.", "To check for any correlations between the different features in the dataset, a heat-map was used. No strong correlations existed in the dataset and the largest correlation value in the dataset was -0.12 between length and label, indicating a very weak negative correlation.", "Using the CountVectorizer method, the top 20 unigrams, bigrams and trigrams with and without removal of stop words were plotted. Stop words refer to the most common words in a language. In the example below, figure 5A and 5B show the top 20 trigrams in real articles and fake articles after removal of stop words.", "Next, a one-sample t-test was performed to test whether a population mean is significantly different from some hypothesized value. A statistical t-test was performed to establish whether the average text polarity of fake articles differs from the average text polarity of all articles.", "Hypothesis Testing: Is there a significant difference in the means of text polarity between articles that are fake and all text articles?", "Null Hypothesis: The null hypothesis would be there there is no difference in text polarity between articles that are fake and all text articles.", "Alternate Hypothesis: The alternative hypothesis would be that there is a difference in text polarity between fake articles and all articles.", "Based on the results in Figure 6 of a one sample t-test, there was a significant difference between the mean text polarity of all articles and the mean text polarity of fake articles. The low P-value of 0.0025 at a 5% confidence interval is a good indicator to reject the null hypothesis.", "This next step, which is the crux of our analysis, requires training models to predict whether a news article is fake or real. Before we can train the models, we need to convert the text into suitable input for these algorithms. To do this, we will use two methods that are called Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF (Term Frequency \u2014 Inverse Document Frequency) Vectorizer.", "CountVectorizer is used to tokenize a corpus of text by transforming it into a vector representing word counts in the respective corpus. It also allows us to remove the stop words in the text and examine the most popular \u2019N\u2019 unigrams, bigrams and trigrams.", "Conversely, TF-IDF are word frequency scores that are acquired by examining the corpus and calculating the \u2018Term Frequency\u2019 and \u2018Inverse Document Frequency\u2019. Term Frequency is how often the term appears in the document and Inverse Document Frequency assigns low weightage to words that are common across documents. Hence, the TfidfVecotrizer takes a collection of documents and assigns them to a matrix of TF-IDF features. This vectorized form can then be used as input to train models.", "Each of these two methods will act as input for a Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier and a Logistic Regression Classifier. Logistic Regression was used as the benchmark model. A benchmark model is a model that is used for reference to compare how other models perform against it.", "No hyper-parameter tuning was performed for logistic regression and it was trained with a C value of 0.01. Alternatively, for the Multinomial NB model, hyper-parameter tuning was performed using cross validation and found alpha = 0.1 to be the best value in both the CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer models.", "The LSTM (Long Short Term Memory) Neural Networks, are a particular type of recurrent neural networks. \u201c In a simple way, LSTM networks have some internal contextual state cells that act as long-term or short-term memory cells. The output of the LSTM network is modulated by the state of these cells. This is a very important property when we need the prediction of the neural network to depend on the historical context of inputs, rather than only on the very last input.\u201d [1] Assaad MOAWAD, The magic of LSTM neural networks (2018)", "The LSTM model was created with the maximum number of words used equal to 50,000 and the max number of words in each text to be 250. The LSTM model had a SpatialDropout1D value of 0.2, dropout value of 0.1 and recurrent dropout value of 0.1.", "To examine the results, accuracy and AUC-ROC score were calculated of the different inputs (Count Vectorizer and TF-IDF) together with the different models. Accuracy alone can be a misleading metric when assessing the model hence an AUC-ROC score and ROC graph was also looked at. AUC-ROC is a good evaluation metric as it looks at the model\u2019s ability to correctly classify the classes and also provides us with an idea of false positives and false negatives. If the AUC score is high, the model is doing a good job of predicting the class labels i.e. 0s as 0s and 1s as 1s. In this particular cases, if the AUC is high, it means the model is predicting real articles as real and fake articles as fake.", "Figure 7A shows the results of the different classifiers using CountVectorizer and TF-IDF transformed data. Figure 7B shows the ROC curve of the same classifiers.", "Logistic Regression with Count Vectorizer to tokenize the data gave us the best results. It achieved an accuracy of 95% and an AUC-ROC score of 95%. Although the LSTM model achieved a higher AUC-ROC score, it would be an overkill to use it since Logistic Regression performs better in accuracy and has a great AUC-ROC score. Also, Logistic Regression is less computationally expensive.", "The worst model performance was also by Logistic Regression with TF-IDF Vectorizer achieving an accuracy and AUC-ROC score of 0.88.", "Apart from just using accuracy as an evaluation metric, we also use the AUC-ROC score which plots the True Positive Rate against the False Positive Rate. We should also take into consideration the False Positive and False Negative Errors to evaluate our models\u2019 performances.", "False Positives (Type I Error): You predict that the article is Fake but is Real.", "False Negatives (Type II Error): You predict that the article is Real but is Fake.", "Figure 8A, 8B and 8C show the confusion matrix and classification report of each classifier.", "It is important that rather than just predicting if the news article is fake or real, we also have an estimate of the probability that the news article is fake or real. This will allow us to flag fake news articles and show the probability of it being fake.", "We can run into two sorts of problems with this approach. First, consider that the news article is predicted as fake by the model, but in reality, the news article is real. This is called a false positive and this mistake could be expensive, as it could lead to embarrassment for a company and also the potential loss of users. Though, this could be rectified quickly by building a mechanism to report articles that have been falsely flagged as fake. This could be one of the many directions the evolution of this project can head in.", "On the contrary, consider that the news article is predicted as real but is actually fake. The article would continue to get shared unchecked with more and more people being exposed to the fake news article while believing it is real. This is called a false negative and it has the ability to seed distrust and polarize online users on sensitive issues. This is more harmful to the validity of our model as well as the reputation of the company offering these services, as it leads to people distrusting the platform and its ability to separate truth from lies. To mitigate this issue, a mechanism can be built that allows people to report if the article is fake and then a team assigned to fact checking the article make the ultimate decision based on their analysis. These are just some solutions that can be implemented, neither are they meant to be perfect nor do they claim to be.", "You can find the full notebook with code here.
