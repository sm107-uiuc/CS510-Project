Data Science bootcamps promise you will learn everything you need to know, will get hands-on experience, and much more in a few weeks. So, despite the expensive cost, you have considered signing up for a bootcamp. And there is basically a good reasons for that: Data Science bootcamps can solve your problem (switching careers) without having to go through a master\u2019s degree or a PhD.", "Usually, data science bootcamps are intensive, nine to twelve-week programmes. They cover most of what is necessary to get started: from data analysis to deep learning. As an aspiring data scientist, you can benefit from professional career support (building a CV, job interviews) and join a large community working in data-related roles. But the most critical aspect of bootcamps is the interaction with like-minded individuals. You will meet people with similar goals to yours, are keen to share their experiences and learn together. Ultimately, those in your cohort (or so-called \u2018batch\u2019) can make the intensive weeks of study fly by.", "The sense of community is arguably bootcamps\u2019 most significant advantage.", "For example, students at General Assembly, a well-known bootcamp, emphasise that the best thing about the programme is the sense of community and the people they meet at events. But, those events are held at the General Assembly.", "So, the only reason you might want to pay a premium price for a Data Science bootcamp is for the community. You are paying for the opportunity to connect with students and instructors physically next to you. This is crucial because spending time with like-minded people in the classroom can reinforce what you have learned. Also, attending internal events is an effective way to increase your network. Once a lecture is over, you still have the chance to continue chatting over lunch and discuss what you have just learned. Therefore, bootcamps should allow you to live and breathe Data Science for nine weeks before you are back to your desk, isolated at home.", "Bootcamps sound great so far. But, because of COVID-19 and social distancing measures, Data Science bootcamps have switched to an online format. There are no more physical interactions with like-minded people or attending events after lectures. As a consequence, bootcamps \u2018lost their mojo\u2019 \u2014 there is no more sense of community or daily informal networking opportunities. Once a Zoom call is over, not many people are willing to stay online and continue chatting to increase their professional network. Therefore, from a curriculum point of view, any well-structured online course delivers similar outcomes.", "Networking requires mobility (literally going for a coffee), informal forums, and occasions to express your ideas and opinions. The casual environment is essential for aspiring data scientists like yourself. Why? Well, you are taking your first steps in a new career and might feel uncomfortable speaking in front of other people. Would you ask a simple question about a Python for-loop in a virtual meeting? Not many students would do that.", "That said, nothing replaces the human connection you can create from an informal in the office kitchen. If the key feature of in-class bootcamps no longer exists, then expensive bootcamps are not worth your money. Especially if you cannot afford spending thousands of dollars for an online course, let alone not working for three months. So, it is fair to say that online bootcamps might not deliver what they have initially promised and you will not achieve your your goals.", "As social distancing restrictions are being lifted, some Data Science bootcamps have adopted a hybrid solution, which addresses the lack of human connection and need for networking. One excellent example is the Le Wagon bootcamp in London:", "Until COVID-19 is over, hybrid bootcamps seem a viable alternative for students who want to fast track their data science career. If there are no hybrid bootcamps near you, then you will have to build those connections on your own. Below are some ways to connect with people working in data roles and engage with the community. I am sure most of us will be happy to answer your questions.", "- Kaggle at their Discussion page.", "- The sub-Reddit on Data Science.", "- LinkedIn groups, such as Data Science Central and Machine and Data Science.", "- Data Science blogs, such as Towards Data Science.", "Data Science bootcamps are expensive programmes designed to launch your new career. Their curricula include the essential topics required to get your foot in the door and, perhaps, land a job. Also, bootcamps provide a unique sense of community, informal events, and an excellent opportunity to network, which are crucial for people in a career change to data science. However, due to social distancing measures, most companies have switched to online classes, which negatively affected their competitive advantage: the sense of community and informal occasions for learning. Therefore, online bootcamps are not worth it if you are in a career transition. The good news is that, recently, bootcamps such as Le Wagon in London, have adopted a hybrid model. Students can now choose between studying online or in-class, thus, making the most out of their investment.", "Thanks for reading, here are some articles you will like it:", "Your home for data science.
