In reality, these roles require you to make hundreds of decisions every day.", "These might be big decisions, like:", "Getting better at making these decisions requires practice, and the only way to get that practice is to build things. This is why we strongly encourage the mentors and mentees at SharpestMinds to focus on building end-to-end ML projects. Collect and clean the data, train a model, deploy it. There are so many decisions of varying size hidden in that pipeline.", "The pressure to build an end-to-end project forces you to make a lot of choices\u2014similar to the ones you would make on the job building real products. In fact, it helps to think about your data science project as a product. Instead of just training a model to prove that you can, try to solve a real problem.", "There\u2019s no need to take this analogy too far. Building a profitable business as a hobby project, though impressive, would be overkill. The benefit of treating your project like a product is that encourages you to start with a problem and find a solution. The tech stack you use and the decisions you make while building will depend on the constraints imposed by the problem.", "It\u2019s rare in industry to go the other way\u2014to start with a piece of technology and try find a way to use it. Yet this is the path many hobby projects take. If your only tool is a hammer, and that hammer is a deep neural net, then every problem starts to look like a deep learning nail. But most nails don\u2019t need a neural net \u2014 they need a hammer, or maybe just a rock.", "Companies don\u2019t hire people because they know a specific type of algorithm (though data science interviews can sometimes make it look that way). Companies hire people to solve problems, to pick the best tools for the job, to make the right decisions.", "Building something to solve a real use-case will introduce trade-offs that you don\u2019t see in cookie-cutter data science projects and Kaggle competitions. If there is a real person on the other end waiting for results, you might need to optimize for inference time rather than accuracy. If it is a highly regulated industry, privacy and interpretability will be more important. These are the kinds of trade-offs you will have to make on the job.", "It\u2019s hard to get good at these decisions and trade-offs without experience. For many professions, you need to land a job to start accumulating that experience. But there is a wonderful difference when it comes to data science and machine learning\u2014you can get plenty of experience before getting hired. How? By building things.", "When you start building, the answers to the hundreds of decisions you\u2019ll face won\u2019t be obvious at first. You will make mistakes. But these mistakes are where the learning happens. Halfway through building, you might realize that your original choice of framework doesn\u2019t support the functionality you need. But next time you face a similar decision, you will be more informed having experienced that mistake first-hand.", "These types of mistakes also make great stories for interviews. Explaining the challenges you faced and the lessons you learned from building something is a great way to show off your problem solving skills and ability to learn. \u201cI originally implemented this with X, but it turns out X is not very good at handling Y so I refactored to use Z.\u201d That is the kind of story I would love to hear from a candidate \u2014 with more details of course.", "However, there is a cold-start problem when it comes to building end-to-end machine learning projects. As a beginner, it\u2019s easy to get get stuck trying to decide what the \u201cbest\u201d framework or the \u201cright\u201d database is for the job. I see folks get stuck in this planning trap often. I\u2019ve been there as well.", "The way out of the trap is to realize that action is better than inaction. Start with the tools you\u2019re most comfortable with. They will let you build faster and learn quicker. If they are the wrong tools, you\u2019ll find out why from direct experience. If you\u2019re completely new, just pick one of the popular tools and learn as you go. TensorFlow vs. PyTorch, PostgreSQL vs. MySQL\u2014if you don\u2019t know the trade-offs, it doesn\u2019t really matter. Pick one and start building. That is the only way you will begin to learn the trade-offs.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Machine learning and prog metal enthusiast.
