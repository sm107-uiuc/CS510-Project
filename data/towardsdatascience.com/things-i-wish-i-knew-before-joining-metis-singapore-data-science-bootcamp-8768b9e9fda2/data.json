Spoiler alert: Every single day is an uphill battle.", "The Metis Singapore Data Science Bootcamp is a 12-week long intensive program focused on Python Programming where you learn about Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Statistical Modelling and Big Data tools through the completion of 5 projects.", "These Bootcamps are known for being notoriously intense \u2014 and they are. Imagine cramming 1\u20132 years\u2019 worth of information into just 3 months.", "Every single day, I start my mornings with Pair Programming exercises, grab a 5 minutes break, then go straight to lessons immediately after. I\u2019d break for lunch and come back for more lessons, which typically end around late afternoon at 3\u20134 pm.", "While lessons have ended, I wasn\u2019t done with my day yet. Whatever free time I had was spent struggling to keep up with concepts I had learned the day before (or even further back) whilst at the same time, working on self-initiated projects with 2 week deadlines. And this whole cycle repeats itself for the entire 3 months.", "While it has been excruciatingly difficult, I can\u2019t say I didn\u2019t benefit from it at all. Prior to the Bootcamp, I was a self-studying junkie (Youtube, LeetCode, reading Data Science articles) and thinking I was progressing along fine. Until I got into the Bootcamp \u2014 which severely challenged that perspective. I\u2019m glad I went for it because I would\u2019ve been stuck in my little bubble thinking everything was fine, when in-fact, wasn\u2019t. The bootcamp made me realize that there was a lot more to learn in the field of Data Science, and equipped me with enough knowledge to legitimately get started on my own.", "It is extremely Statistics and Math-intensive, and these are the things I wish I knew before joining as well as the recommendations I have for you that are not a GOOD TO HAVE but a MUST HAVE before joining one.", "Surprise surprise. This is a Data-Related field. Obviously most, if not all, of your findings are going to come out in the form of graphs. You have to love looking at graphs, working with them, tweaking them (bar charts, line plots, scatter plots, etc.) and you definitely have to love sharing your findings with them.", "You question everything and want to verify the truth behind facts/figures presented to you. This is important because you are in a data-related field and you want to know if the data you\u2019re getting is valid.", "If this sounds like you, that\u2019s perfect because Statistics serves as a tool that allows you to make sense of, quantify and also test the validity of a dataset, which gives you confidence that your hypothesis is true and your model works. Which leads me to my next point.", "You also must know how (or at least appreciate) to apply Statistics in a pragmatic manner. With only 3 months in the bootcamp, the hyper-speed pace of each passing day isn\u2019t gonna wait for you to fully understand a concept before you\u2019re slapped in the face by another the very next day. Which also leads me to my next point.", "I\u2019m talking about calculus, like log, ln, differential equations, and etc. To understand statistical concepts and appreciate how to use them, you will need a sound grasp of mathematics. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll start realizing that you will be left in the dust as each day passes by.", "If you don\u2019t have these, I\u2019d say you\u2019ll be in for a rough ride. I didn\u2019t even know what Linear Regression was prior to joining, and I recommend that you gain at least an intermediate level of Statistics and Math if you want to get the best bang for your buck and survive this bootcamp.", "If you think you\u2019re well-prepared and the 4 aforementioned points like fun, then perfect! We can move on to talking about how you can cope with the coming 3 months.", "If you don\u2019t know and you don\u2019t ask \u2014 you\u2019re only hurting yourself because you\u2019ll stay clueless if you don\u2019t. It\u2019s not absurd if you don\u2019t know the content (I mean \u2014 that\u2019s why you signed up for the bootcamp, right?). It\u2019s only absurd when you\u2019re not clarifying your doubts when you know you have one.", "I don\u2019t mean this in the sense that you don\u2019t try your best and that it\u2019s okay to slack off when you have lapses of knowledge \u2014 but realize that trying to get a grasp on everything before you start moving to the next step results in you being way too slow and can lead you to end up not doing anything.", "This has stunted me from even starting a project. I wanted to know every single bit of code, study Linear Regression first and arm myself with a full arsenal of knowledge before beginning my project. As a result, I was left with very little time to do any actual work nearing the end and produced less-than-desirable results.", "You\u2019re never going to know everything at every stage of the way, and you\u2019re never going to be fully prepared. I never thought I\u2019d be so cliche as to use a overused quote, but as Nike put it,", "And really \u2014 just do it. There are going to be many times where you don\u2019t know anything, and that\u2019s fine. That\u2019s why you\u2019re in the bootcamp in the first place. If anything, you can always consult Google. You\u2019re gonna be using new code you have completely zero clue about even as you type it into your Jupyter Notebooks, and that\u2019s okay. Because you will learn after you use it.", "You always have to move forward every single day.", "The best way to learn is through an ITERATIVE PROCESS. When you start a project, you will hit many roadblocks. And as painful as it is, you have to live with not knowing what to expect \u2014 sometimes even not knowing how to google for an answer or not even knowing the right questions. It\u2019s fine. Just stay disciplined and push through. If you don\u2019t know, don\u2019t stay stuck.", "Try asking questions. Try googling. Try talking to people, try consulting your classmates, your lecturer, or even students from the previous batch (Black Raven (James Ng) and Edward Bingei helped me out a lot). You\u2019re going to make a lot of friends and among them, your best will be Google (seriously, Google\u2019s a lifesaver. Oh, and StackOverflow too).", "After you solve a problem in your project, you\u2019ll feel a great sense of achievement \u2014 and then immediately get stuck again on a new issue (which is pretty normal, by the way). Which then brings me to my next point...", "Things in this field are constantly moving, changing. To be honest, coding used to be a unicorn skill back then. Now everybody pretty much every Tom, Dick and Harry can code. You have to stay at the top, and to be at the top, you have to be learning continuously. You have to love the learning process.", "Apple wasn\u2019t built in a day and neither are any of the projects you embark on during this camp. Understand that a project is an on-going, built-on-previous-attempts process.", "You can have an impressive end-goal of what you want out of your project in mind, and draw out a huge Gantt chart of how you want to go about completing it, but the reality is, there are going to be a lot of obstacles that prevent you from doing so (things never going to go 100% according to plan anyway).", "Don\u2019t be so hung up if weren\u2019t able to build something amazing on the first try. Focus on completing something simple first, then improve once you\u2019re done!", "I think the above image presents the concept of Project Design the best. The idea of the creation of cars never stemmed from having the idea of a car itself. It spawned from the overarching idea of an increasing demand and need for better transportation options.", "Likewise, your projects will follow a process very much like this one. An overarching idea of what to achieve, and you improve on it (maybe even create a different product than you had initially envisioned) after CREATING YOUR FIRST FINISHED PRODUCT.", "Yeah, it is a lot. That\u2019s why it\u2019s called a bootcamp. And know that it\u2019s going to be hard \u2014 and that\u2019s okay. You\u2019re not alone. If you must know, I suffered A LOT during this time. Think staying up till 4am to rehearse and create slides for your presentation, and just getting a measly 2 hours of sleep before waking up to shower, freshen up and head over to Metis for your presentation.", "But it does get better. Because with each passing project, you become more proficient in coding, more familiar with Python and its syntax, the appropriate Statistical Packages to use, and become better with presentation and communication (which, I must say, is great because I love speaking to people). The journey is painful but when you look back, you\u2019ll be proud of what you have achieved \u2014 having survived that crazy and intense schedule and also having 5 Data Science projects under your belt.", "Just like how I emphasized that Project Design is an iterative process, so is your learning. Here are some tips you can keep in mind when you do your projects while you keep up the fast-paced syllabus.", "Keep ahead of the syllabus. Even if you haven\u2019t covered the statistical concept(which model to use) or programming syntax to be used in your projects in class yet, read ahead and do your project alongside the lesson plans.", "You\u2019re Gromit laying down the tracks and the train\u2019s the curriculum. It be like that. Get your project done up till the point where the instant you learn about your new statistical model in class, you\u2019re ready to plop it into your project as that lesson ends.", "Time management will be a huge issue because of the tight deadlines in this camp. However, these deadlines don\u2019t have to be your downfall.", "Your projects will always end with a presentation and a blog post (Not like this one, silly. Like my other blog posts about my projects). Don\u2019t wait till you\u2019ve finished writing all your code and analysis then you begin to start on them.", "Do your slides and write your blog post concurrently while your model trains, or when you\u2019re running a really long web-scraper. Get creative with how you can slot bits and pieces of work in!", "The requirement of graduating the Bootcamp is the completion of all 5 projects in the syllabus, 4 of which are self-initiated and self-led projects, each with an overarching statistical concept that you are expected to demonstrate after you\u2019ve learned them (please follow Tip 1: Start early and Study Ahead).", "Project 2: Linear Regression Project 3: Supervised LearningProject 4: Natural Language ProcessingProject 5: Passion Project (whatever you want)", "I suggest coming up with some idea of what you want to do before going into the camp, because most of your time will be spent learning the bootcamp material rather than brainstorming on what to do for the projects.", "It doesn\u2019t have to be very concrete, because you can refine these ideas as you progress with the bootcamp (and you have your instructor and your classmate to bounce ideas off with too). But you have to at least have an inkling of what you want to do if you don\u2019t want to be fussing over what to do while also keeping up with very technically-heavy material of the bootcamp.", "Remember why you\u2019re in this camp. Are you doing it in hopes of employment? Are you doing just to up-skill? Perhaps a quote from The TechLead can shed some light on this.", "\u201cI\u2019m not good at coding, but my at least code has business value.\u201d", "Ok, it isn\u2019t actually verbatim but it\u2019s pretty much inferred from his video here. What value does your code/project bring to the world? A good coder is not a memory storage (one who remembers all the syntax in a coding language), but rather one who knows what value his PRODUCT can bring to the world. Likewise, your projects should be one where people can see value in. Ask yourself these questions:", "You can refer to this for ideas. If not, you\u2019re also more than welcome to explore the blogs I\u2019ve written about the projects I\u2019ve done during the camp!", "If you don\u2019t feel a shred of worry from everything I\u2019ve said so far, GREAT! Go on a holiday before the camp because those 3 months are going to be one helluva ride. If not, forget the holiday and commit your time to preparing for it the very best you can because\u2026 those 3 months are going to be one helluva ride.", "I\u2019d also like to add, in my personal opinion, Data Science Bootcamps are something you should go for ONLY when you\u2019ve already decided you want to pursue a career in Data Science. Not when you\u2019re still exploring if it\u2019s a career for you. Otherwise, every single day in the Bootcamp will be torture. There have been students who have dropped out of the program (I\u2019m not trying to scare you, just telling you what actually happened).", "If there\u2019s anything the time-intensive structure of the bootcamp taught me, it\u2019s that you learn by doing and not by reading.", "There\u2019s really no point accruing all those Coursera or Udemy certifications if you can\u2019t do anything of value with that knowledge. Showcase what you can DO to the world. As JomaTech once said,", "\u201cIf you made an interesting analysis, but no one is there to read your analysis\u2026 Did you really make an analysis?\u201d- JomaTech on 5 Tips For Getting A Data Science Job", "I personally intend to enrich my learning by working on projects that focuses on real-world applications. In the process, I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll come across many things I don\u2019t know, and I\u2019ll be learning things that solve the problem, rather than learning MANY things that aren\u2019t useful.", "I know I said a lot of things about the bootcamp being intense, multi-tasking, being diligent and disciplined in studying, and staying ahead of the syllabus. But the fact is; nobody can work 18/hours a day, everyday for 3 months. Burnout is very common in the bootcamp. You gotta take a chill pill sometimes.", "Give yourself a reward yourself after every project. Take a day off to get refreshed, grab some drinks with your classmates, whatever. Just disconnect yourself from the material then get back in once you\u2019re done recharging.", "I really want to say I have been quite fortunate to have been surrounded by amazing classmates (of whom were leaps and bounds above my skill level) who were very helpful in guiding me along the way when I encountered any difficulties in the curriculum.", "We also played a lot (we went for more than a few drinks) and that helped offset quite a lot of the pressure from the bootcamp.", "Thanks for reading and if you wanna hit me up, you can do so over at my Linkedin or at xianjinseow92@gmail.com.", "Your home for data science.
