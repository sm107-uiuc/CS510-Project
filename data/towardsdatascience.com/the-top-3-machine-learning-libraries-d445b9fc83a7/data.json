That being said, it means there will be more unique articles about Machine Learning focused Python libraries. I hope to shed some light on new libraries and packages for you that you have either not heard of before, or have not used as much. Some of these libraries make the Machine Learning algorithm choosing process faster and easier, while some are about the Machine Learning algorithm in general. Continue reading if you would like to learn more about the top five Machine Learning libraries for Data Scientists and Machine Learning Engineers \u2014 that aren\u2019t scikit-learn, TensorFlow, etc.", "We will be discussing PyCaret, pickle, and imbalanced-learn, along with their respective overviews, tutorials with code, and benefits below.", "The main focus of PyCaret [3] is to apply Machine Learning algorithm practices with less code. As a result, choosing between different algorithms will become a lot easier and faster with this library. While there are countless companies that are trying to automate even Data Science and Machine Learning itself, I believe this product is hands down easier to use as well as free, intuitive, and tunable \u2014 shoutout to Moez Ali for creating this awesome library.", "Here is a short tutorial for implementing your PyCaret modeling in your Jupyter Notebook. It really as easy as it is below. Of course, there are additions that you can implement as well. You can set different parameters easily like Feature Selection, PCA Method, and many more. You can also plot your comparisons and feature importance in an easy-to-digest format.", "Here is an example of setup, comparison, creation, and tuning of your Machine Learning algorithm that will serve as your Data Science model:", "Follow the cited documentation from above to find more information on this Machine Learning library, as well as deeper dives into examples by the creator. The PyCaret library ultimately serves as the do-all Machine Learning algorithm comparer, picker, and creator.", "This next example, pickle [5], is a module that helps to serialize your Machine Learning algorithms so that you can then share and load to predict new data as your new Data Science model.", "This tutorial should give you enough information for you to start implementing your saved model, and predict new data. I would use this in testing as it is convenient to share with others on your Data Science team.", "Here is a quick pickle example:", "Overall, pickle is a great way to practice deployment on a smaller scale, and to reuse your saved Machine Learning algorithm of your Data Science model to predict new data.", "This Python package, imbalanced-learn [7], will allow you to increase your accuracy or reduce your error when you have imbalanced or small amounts of data. One of its main uses is oversampling using other algorithms like SMOTE/KMeansSMOTE and RandomOverSampler, as well as many more.", "SMOTE stands for Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique. In this example, you would generate new data that resembles the minority data. You can also designate undersampling the majority, or specific samples, in order to make the dataset that will be ingested into your Machine Learning algorithm more balanced. The way it creates the new, synthetic sample is by looking at nearby classes and drawing a line between them, and randomly creating a new point on that line. This means that the data is new, but falls between the current point and a nearby point.", "This tutorial is an easy way to apply your sampler to existing data that can then be applied to your current, imbalanced dataset.", "Pro-tip: print the before and after shape of the dataset to see the difference from over-sampling.", "Overall, imbalanced-learn is a great way to easily make your minority sample size increase by various methods and techniques of sampling.", "There are countless Machine Learning libraries, packages, modules, platforms, and frameworks out there. There are also several articles that describe the same libraries. I wanted to point out the best ones that I personally feel are also unique. You may have encountered some of these before, or they are completely new to you. I hope I shed some light for you if they are new to you, or if you have not obtained as much information on them. We discussed three of the top Machine Learning libraries:", "If you would want to learn more about the top five Data Science libraries, then follow this link here [8]:", "I hope you found my article both useful and interesting.
