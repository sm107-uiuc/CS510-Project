For my money, it might just be the MOST fun job one could ever have.", "While there is a lot of supply on the job market, most of that supply is concentrated at the entry-level. What it means though, and that\u2019s something for you to ponder, is that many people rush into the field ill-equipped and with unrealistic expectations compared to their actual skills.", "With that being said, if you are still reading, it means you really want to become a data scientist or you want to make sure you\u2019re a damn good one.", "I can help you achieve that. The reason I am more than qualified to do it is because I didn\u2019t abide by certain rules early in my career, and I paid the price. I basically broke every single tip I\u2019m about to share with you, and I can tell you with absolute confidence: it comes at a cost.", "You can learn by failing forward or you can learn from the experience of someone who has done it before you.", "So without further ado, here are my TOP 3 tips to make yourself as valuable as possible to your company.", "This might come as a surprise to you, but BY FAR the most important part of your job as a data scientist is to understand inside-out the business you\u2019re in. So many juniors come into the field thinking it\u2019s about \u201cpython vs R\u201d, or \u201cwhich plotting library should I use\u201d. Let me tell you: all of that is kindergarten bullshit.", "You were hired to help the company make more money or save more money. Use whatever tool you want, but to optimize a business, you\u2019ve got to know what the business is about: customers, suppliers, regulatory environment, competitors, company branding and positioning, etc.", "Now please don\u2019t get me wrong. I\u2019m not saying you have to be an expert in any of these subjects. But I will say this: as a data scientist, you absolutely must have a basic understanding of all the areas that could impact the business you\u2019re in.", "That is part of your job description, whether it is stated explicitly or not.", "Why? I\u2019ll repeat it: if you are to make suggestions to the business leaders of your company, be it through modeling or data exploration or what have you, the BEST way to set yourself up for success is by having a broad knowledge about the business.", "Talking about making presentations to management leads us to tip #2.", "If you think that you can\u2019t handle giving a presentation in front of a room of high-status stakeholders you have never met before\u2026you need to practice. A lot!", "Just a few years ago, I couldn\u2019t imagine myself doing that. In fact, I couldn\u2019t even give a presentation in front of my class at university. I would spend the night stressing about it, and come morning I was so exhausted from the lack of sleep that I would simply stay in bed and not show up. That\u2019s how I dropped out of not one, but two different bachelor programs. Both times, out of fear of giving a presentation.", "Fast forward a few years, I decided to do something about it. So I enrolled in an MBA. And I hated it. But you know what? It got me over my fear of public talking. Because during the MBA, we all had to do presentations, all the time. And after a few nerve-wracking sessions\u2026I kind of got used to it.", "Today, I am able to establish a connection with the audience, tell a story and get my point across. I also spent a lot of time learning the fundamental principles of visualization, a topic I now teach at university.", "Back to you and your career. As a data scientist, you need to be a decent presenter and a decent communicator. I can\u2019t stress this enough. The only reason this is the second tip and not the first is because I value substance over form, BUT not everyone will have the patience to see the value behind a weakly communicated message. So if you need to work on this, I suggest that you repeatedly put yourself in situations where you have to speak and you have to present an idea.", "I know, this is the opposite of what you hear everywhere, right? You expected me to say something like \u201cMake mistakes, that\u2019s how you learn\u201d.", "That is pure soft and lazy, junior and expandable mindset!", "The real pros, the ones that make it to the top, are the ones that would never allow themselves to fail. For them, making an error is simply not an option.", "And the ones that do make mistakes every once in a while, are the ones who think that it\u2019s OK, that they will somehow get better eventually, that they will become more disciplined and focused.", "Let me tell you a secret. It\u2019s not the result that matters. It\u2019s the mindset.", "Yes, the result inevitably stems from the mindset. And while you can\u2019t always control the result, you should never allow yourself to think that a mistake is even remotely acceptable.", "That means: you should quadruple-check your numbers. Review your hypothesis. Hunt for outliers. Perform tests. Print your presentation beforehand and look at it from different angles. The list goes on and it\u2019s up to you to find what works best for your style\u2026but do NOT make mistakes.", "The essence of this tip is to be accountable.", "It is as valid for a data scientist as it is for a soldier on the battlefield. Being accountable does not mean being sorry after shit has happened. No one cares about that. Rather, it means doing everything that you possibly can to avoid shit happening in the first place.", "How come I haven\u2019t given any technical advice? Just browse Towards Data Science, you\u2019ll find plenty there. If you can read and you have a minimum of drive and discipline, you can get better technically.", "But knowing HOW to apply WHAT you have learned takes a humble yet strong mindset, and that is what differentiates the senior data scientists from the mass of wannabes. It is also much harder to learn because it forces you to question who you are as a person, and not everyone is willing to work on that.", "The advice I have shared is based on my own experience and that of people I admire. It\u2019s up to you to use it. Good luck!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Growth stocks investor. Data scientist by trade.
