Models like UNITER, ViLBERT and LXMERT are trained on millions of image-text pairs with different objective functions and are able to learn an effective generic joint representation of image and text.", "These representations are then finetuned on a specific task to achieve state of the art performance on a myriad of image and language tasks like image QA, image-text retrieval, image grounding, image inference and more. When finetuning on a specific task, the amount of data available is only a fraction of the pretraining data used. Such small amounts of data often lead to the model overfitting and beats the goal of trying to build a generalizable embedding for image and text.", "So how do we prevent this overfitting? Adversarial training techniques for single modal tasks on images and text have been shown to make a model more robust and generalizable. This sort of training can be done by", "Applying adversarial training techniques to multimodal learning are a natural extension to the single modal techniques and this is exactly what the researchers at Microsoft Dynamics AI 365 Research did.", "They proposed VILLA (Vision-and-Language Large-scale Adversarial training), which is the first known adversarial training technique designed for vision and language. VILLA follows the second method of adversarial training since their goal is to build a robust model, irrespective of whether humans understand the adversarial examples. For the text modality, they add adversarial perturbations to the word embeddings. Previous works on image adversarial training add noise to the image pixels and find that robustness comes at the cost of performance. In VILLA, these adversarial perturbations are added to the extracted image-region features instead of the pixels and this improves both robustness and performance. During training, the perturbations are only added to one modality at a time while the other modality is kept constant as seen in the picture.", "VILLA also leverages \u201cfree\u201d training strategies (Shafahi et al., 2019; Zhang et al. 2019) obtains the gradients of parameters with almost no extra cost when computing the gradients of inputs. This way, the model sees more examples at no additional cost and training becomes more cost efficient.", "Adversarial training techniques generally ensure that the label of the adversarial example is the same as the original example. VILLA not only tries to do this but also tries to match the predicted class probabilities of both examples using KL-divergence. By doing this, the training loss function becomes smoother and the model can estimate it better. This further increases the model\u2019s performance.", "VILLA can be applied to both pretraining and finetuning stages to improve the generalizability of the learned embedding. When applied to UNITER-large, VILLA further improves its performance from 74.02% to 74.87% on VQA, and from 62.8% to 65.7% on VCR. With ensemble, the VQA performance is further improved to 75.85%. VILLA also improved UNITER\u2019s results to state of the art on 4 additional tasks.", "VILLA is also model agnostic. It was applied to another large scale pretrained model, LXMERT and showed a gain in performance on VQA.", "Here\u2019s a link to the paper if you want to go into more detail about how VILLA works and click here to see more of their publications and other work.", "Your home for data science.
