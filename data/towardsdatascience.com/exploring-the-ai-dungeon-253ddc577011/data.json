Behind the scenes is a neural network with 175 billion parameters being fed massive amounts of data scraped from the internet. The result is a machine that can understand and respond to questions posed in GPT-3. It is not yet able to speak or write anything other than English. But it does have an understanding of basic grammar. This means that if you ask it to tell you what a triangle is, it will say \u2018a three-sided object\u2019 or something similar.", "I must admit: I hate writing introductions. So I wrote the first two sentences of the paragraph above, plugged it into AI Dungeon with some context, and out came the remainder of the paragraph. (As we\u2019ll see in a moment, GPT-3 is severely underselling itself here.)", "It\u2019s obviously not perfect, but some allowance should be made for the fact that AI Dungeon runs a weaker version of GPT-3 and is configured to be used as a text-based game rather than a way of cheating at writing. As the following sample demonstrates, the full GPT-3 (to which access is currently severely limited) could be mistaken for a college-level writer.", "There is an ongoing debate in my family about the origin of the word \u201ccowboy.\u201d We know the term was originally used to describe a herder or drover of cattle. Some of my family maintains it was coined in Spain, describing the Mexican or Spanish version of those workers.", "My father\u2019s family, on the other hand, insists the term was used by Anglo cowboys to describe the tough but generally peaceful herders or drovers.", "The debate came up again a few weeks ago when we went to watch \u201cLone Ranger\u201d with my father and his wife, my stepmother, Barb. The man riding the white horse was a sheriff, not a cowboy, they insisted.", "I finally admitted I didn\u2019t really care where the term came from and we all had a good laugh over it. (from the GPT-3 repo; direct link)", "Occasionally, the AI\u2019s awkwardness and repetition betray its identity:", "Glacier Ridge has had its students participate in various competitions and competitions. (from the GPT-3 repo; direct link)", "In all fairness, many human writers suffer from similar flaws. Few humans, however, can write in Spanish, French, Hungarian and Portuguese.", "Remember Eugene Goostman? In 2014, the chatbot made international headlines for passing the Turing Test, convincing 30% of a panel that it was human. Eugene Goostman is a 13 year-old boy from Ukraine, replete with the slang, initialisms, and an indifferent tone. Whether the chatbot successfully passed the Turing Test is still a subject of controversy; imitating a hostile 13 year-old is almost certainly an easier feat than passing as a human being in intellectual conversation.", "Naturally, I wanted to see how GPT-3 would fare in the Turing Test, but I needed some standard by which to evaluate its responses. Thankfully, Turing provided a sample dialogue between an interrogator and computer which I tried to replicate.", "In order to prompt GPT-3 to respond to the same line of questioning as in Turing\u2019s dialogue, I first assigned the interrogator the name \u2018Paul\u2019 and the computer \u2018Jack\u2019. My purpose in doing so was to avoid any confusion that the Interrogator and Computer were two individual characters in the dialogue. Then, I provided some context (italicized) about the ensuing discussion. There are some parallels between the sample dialogue and my coaxing of AI Dungeon, but the conversation largely falls apart halfway through.", "Whether a single dialogue is an indication of being able to pass the Turing Test is doubtful. However, if you consider Goostman as having passed the Turing Test, it appears as if GPT-3 can do the same.", "Through some manipulation of AI Dungeon, we can interview imitations of famous people from a variety of fields. Here\u2019s a snippet from fake Larry Page on big data:", "There are two main approaches [to improving our use of big data]. The first is automation, or what I like to think of as the smart pill\u2026The other approach is to analyze the data in a different way. For example, what are the stories behind all these numbers? Why did this person buy something? What\u2019s their story? If we can understand all that, we\u2019ll be able to target advertising so it really matters to people.", "There is also a part of the interview where Page starts talking about people wanting to kill him when he was six years old as a result of his sister being born, so consider the above excerpt with a salt-shaker in hand. You can read the full text of this \u2018interview\u2019 here.", "And some inspiration for your next article:", "The following is the headline of an article published in Towards Data Science, a Medium publication hosted at towardsdatascience.com: \u201cA new tool for data scientists to analyze their own code.\u201d", "You open up the article and read it. It\u2019s written by one of your colleagues, who goes on to explain that he or she has created a program called \u201cData Analysis Toolkit\u201d, which allows you to easily analyze your own code.", "I must admit that I am already in possession of such a toolkit. It\u2019s called \u201cscrolling aimlessly trying to figure out why my code is broken\u201d. Very innovative, if you ask me \u2014 apparently GPT-3 has different ideas.", "My experiences with GPT-3 via AI Dungeon deeply impressed me, but they also revealed its limitations. Ultimately, GPT-3 is uncannily imitating what has been scraped from the Internet rather than displaying general intelligence. Even the full version has trouble with all but the most basic arithmetic, and plays a comparatively weak game of chess.", "Judging it by human standards, GPT-3 can be mind-numbingly stupid. That hasn\u2019t stopped it from performing tasks previously thought to be the domain of highly-intelligent humans. This Twitter thread collates some of its achievements, which include writing fiction in a variety of styles, generating a working React app from a simple description of its function, and legal writing.", "I am fairly convinced at this point that people will lose their jobs because of advancements in language models like GPT-3. The only question in my mind is whether this will happen in the next five years or the next ten. Artificial General Intelligence may be far away from realization, but intelligence isn\u2019t a prerequisite to disrupting society.", "For now, I\u2019ll enjoy playing AI Dungeon and try not to consider that I might have to compete with it for a job in a few years. Who am I kidding? When that time comes, there won\u2019t be any competition.", "Your home for data science.
