I encourage you to read if you haven\u2019t already!", "Today, we will observe another important statistical concept in action and perform a hypothesis test. I will explain the statistical significance not only with a concrete and catchy example but also in simple terms. I will use the same dataset I used to explain the Central Limit Theorem \u2014 the life expectancy in the world of 186 countries as of 2018.", "The mean (\u00b5) of average life expectancy in the world is 73 with a standard deviation (\u03c3) 7 and it is an almost normal distribution. Using the Central Limit theorem, the standard error was calculated as 0.57 by dividing the population\u2019s standard deviation to the square root of sample size.", "Imagine a wanderer statistician who discovered an island where only 50 people live. All inhabitants are perfectly healthy and over 73 years-old. She conducts a small survey and learns that the average life expectancy is 76 on the island. Moreover, she finds out that everybody on the island has been doing intermittent fasting. Considering the average life expectancy of 73, this is an intriguing case!", "Now, our curious statistician wants to know if the intermittent fasting could be the path to live a longer and healthier life putting all other possible determinants aside. So, she decides to perform an experimental study where she seeks the answer to the question:", "Does intermittent fasting increase human lifespan?", "To understand the wanderer statistician\u2019s study and its results\u2019 significance, we need to understand the terms below:", "Don\u2019t feel intimidated by them, I will keep my word for simplicity. \ud83d\ude09", "A hypothesis is a statement about the relationship between variables. The hypothesis test is a way to test the results of a hypothesis, an observation, a claim, or an experiment to see if your results are statistically significant. The hypothesis test is constructed around two contrasting claims: Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis.", "The null hypothesis either describes the current status of the population/sample or states that there is no difference between the sample and population parameters. The alternative hypothesis, the opposite of the null hypothesis, either describes the future or desired state of the population/sample or states that there is a difference between the sample and population parameters.", "Our statistician sets the null and alternative hypothesis for her study as follows:", "Her goal is to observe if the intermittent fasting leads to an increase (from 73 to 76.) of the average human lifetime, which makes the hypothesis test one-tailed directional test.", "Many theorems assume a population or a sample follows a normal distribution. The widespread use of normal distribution derives from the easiness of assessing data points in terms of the standard deviation. Let\u2019s remember the important properties of the normal distribution:", "The standard normal distribution is a special normal distribution where the mean is 0 and the standard deviation is 1. Any normal distribution can be transformed into a standard normal distribution by subtracting the mean from each data point and dividing the subtraction by the standard deviation. This process is called standardization.", "Z-score is the result of a calculation applied to a data point during the standardization. In the standard normal distribution above, z-scores are on the x-axis (positive z-score indicates the value is above the mean and negative z-score indicates the value is below the mean), whereas cumulative probability values are on the Cumulative % bar and under the distribution.", "Z-score defines the data point\u2019s location in terms of its distance to the mean which is measured by the standard deviation. For example, by looking at the z-score and Cumulative % above:", "We can calculate the probability value, abbreviated as p-value, from a z-score or vice-versa.", "P-value is the probability of obtaining test results at least as extreme as the results actually observed during the test, assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. [Source: Wikipedia]. I put it in more simple terms:", "In a world where the null hypothesis is true, p-value indicates the percentage of random chance or noise involved in getting the test results at least as extreme as actual results.", "Let\u2019s analyze p-value further in our context:", "Say, we took a sample from France and found out that average life expectancy is actually lower than the global average by 1 point with a p-value of 0.16. This means, in a world where the null hypothesis is true, there is a 16% random chance that we would measure the average life expectancy in France at least 1 point lower than the global average.", "In other words, if the average life expectancy in France is actually higher than the global average by 1.42 points, we would still measure it is lower by at least 1 point about 1/6 of the time due to noise. Thus, the lower the p-value the more significant the results are since it is less likely to be caused by random chance or noise.", "P-value can be calculated with the z-table or a library from R or Python. Our curious statistician will take some help from the scipy stats package of Python and the norm object from the same library to denote the standard normal distribution. Furthermore, to calculate the p-value she will use the cumulative density function (cdf) method from the norm object. This method will yield the same probability values for a given z-score as in the Cumulative % in the standard normal distribution above.", "To complete her experimental study the only missing piece left is the significance level \u2014 denoted with \u03b1.", "The significance level (\u03b1) is the threshold p-value set to decide if the test results are statistically significant. It also represents how much of randomness we can tolerate in our test/study. The significance level is usually set to 0.05, 0.01 or 0.001.", "If the test result\u2019s p-value is less than the significance level (\u03b1), then we can conclude that the obtained test results are statistically significant and they are not due to a random chance or noise.", "It is important to set the significance level before starting the experiment. Otherwise, it won\u2019t be an objective test. Our curious statistician also knows that and sets the significance level to 0.05. Finally, she is going to complete the study and observe the statistical significance in action!", "2. She determined the null and alternative hypothesis:", "3. She set the test statistics and calculated the p-value:", "4. She determined the significance level at 0.05:", "When she puts all the pieces together to uncover the path of a healthier and longer life:", "Test statistics fell into the critical region, it means the test results are statistically significant and she rejects the null hypothesis!", "There is statistically significant evidence that the intermittent fasting increases the average life expectancy, at significance level 0.05. Obtained test results are not due to a random chance.", "In a world where the average life expectancy is 73, the probability (p-value) of getting 50 sample with mean 76 due to random noise is 0.0015 which is less than the 0.05.", "Whether or not the test results are called statistically significant depends on the significance level. With the p-value set to 0.001, the test statistics would no longer fall into the critical region. (Z-score of p-value 0.001 for a one-tailed directional test is 3.09)", "In that case, we would have concluded that test results are not statistically significant and accepted the null hypothesis. (Intermittent fasting does not increase the average life expectancy)", "The test of our curious statistician is called a z-test. If our sample size had been less than 30 or there had been two samples to compare, then this would be a t-test. If we had compared two or more samples this would be an ANOVA (analysis of variance) test.", "Hypothesis tests and statistical significance are used in almost every discipline from social sciences to physics. We can use them to compare the performances of different models in the context of machine learning. We can confidently perform a hypothesis test and determine which one performs better using statistical significance. Here is an article that I like about the use of statistical significance in machine learning:", "Thanks for reading!
