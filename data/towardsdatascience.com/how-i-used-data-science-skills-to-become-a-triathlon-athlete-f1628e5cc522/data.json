And by the end of this article, you will understand what I mean by that.", "My whole training for the Triathlon was focused on swimming for three reasons:", "Due these reasons, I focused 1 month before the contest, swimming (at least tried) every day of the week for 40 minutes in the pool. I also focused on paddling with just my arms.", "Cross-run and the mountain bike were easier to train for than swimming because I do both often. Since I followed it with healthy foods and natural nutrition, I felt ready for the contest.", "Okay, but what does all this have to do with Data Science?", "Well, this was my \u201cbaseline model\u201d, I knew that I wouldn\u2019t get a podium finish. But it was enough to complete, analyze and learn. That was my goal \u2014 to observe everything inside (my body performance) and outside (the competitors and the trail).", "From all my hyperparameters (my training in the three sports), I was looking to tune only the one i.e. swimming, which I knew would give me an acceptable final result.", "When I crossed the finish line, in my perspective, I saw many details that I had to improve for the next one. Furthermore, what I thought would be hard, wasn\u2019t that hard at all. The benchmark, and analyzing other experienced competitors, ended up being really crucial.", "As a good analytic person, everything that I got to realize, and thought be important to adjust weren\u2019t enough. I needed something quantities to prove that I was right in my thoughts.", "To accomplish that, I conducted an Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) using Python on the data of the Triathlon that I participated in.", "Basically, I did a scraping of the Triathlon website to get final result of all amateur athletes, made a few graphs and a simple inference analysis.", "Step 1: I would like to get an idea of how all competitors fared in the overall triathlon. So, as you can see, swimmers (blue) have a sharp majority with completion time under 20 minutes. On the other hand, bikers (orange) have a spread distribution and we can visualize 2 clusters. The first cluster of bike time is less than 70 minutes and another more than 70 minutes in average. The last one, the runners, have a tiny gap between 30\u201340 minutes.", "The next histogram uses the same analysis technique as above but it is now about transition time. We can conclude in the first transition (blue), can keep a time in a large range (0:00\u20131:30) than the second transition (orange). The second one, must take less than one minute to complete.", "After finishing the analyses for all amateur athletes, I took a snap of my category (M2529) performance. The main goal is to understand the distribution and if there is an opportunity to go up in the final ranking by taking a few minutes lesser.", "In the category data, two positions had a gap less than 5 minutes.", "The next graph is a histogram by category and easily we can affirm, the higher number of participants are between 30\u201344 years old.", "These three categories represent by 68% of all amateur athletes.", "To sum up, I would like to know which sport has the most influence over the final result. For that, I have chosen a scatter plot to understand the correlations.", "Although the scatter plot matrix is enough to understand the influence of each sport over the final result, below there are two correlation matrices to further explore the variables\u2019 relationships.", "In both scenarios, for the total athletes filtered by M2529 category, the biking time has a strong influence over the final result follow by running time and then the swimming time.", "Something really interesting is that Transition 1 had a strong impact in the final result of the M2529 category.", "These are all the insights that I gathered and learnt while doing my first triathlon.", "In the same way that I have used my basic data science skills to be more prepared for my next event, you could also do the same in your hobbies or routine. Just search for the data in it and useful insights will show up.", "My python script is messy and there are no comments but is really intuitive, so I apologize!", "Data science can be applied in almost all situations, so what are you waiting for?!", "Thank you for reading. Please share your comments and feedback below.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Surfista, natureba e engenheiro de produ\u00e7\u00e3o com \u00eanfase em Data Science\ud83c\udf31\ud83c\udf0d\u267b\ufe0f"],
