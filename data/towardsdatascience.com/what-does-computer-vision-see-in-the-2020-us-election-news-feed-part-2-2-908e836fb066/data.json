The Biden-Trump count stands at 264\u2013213 and Biden needs 6 more to win the election. As I wonder how narrow the margins (224\u2013213) were a while ago, I think these numbers stem from their campaigns' vigor and the press coverage of it for over a year. After reading part 1, you now have an extensive image analytical dataset on US elections, and you are ready to churn it through the visualization engine for insights. This article is intended to be more of a guide to visualizing image analytics rather than the insights themselves. So, I begin with the code, explanations, and structure of the visualization first and later proceed to a few insights from the news feed", "For illustration purposes, I collected a stock of images from Unsplash to show how to process and visualize data in image grids. Yes, we will plot the images on axes like how you plot data points!", "So, I searched for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden\u201d on unsplash.com to source about 15\u201320 images for each of the query terms.", "For these batches of URLs for \u201cDonald Trump\u201d and \u201cJoe Biden,\u201d I called the runvisionai function ( see Part1 for more, if you bypassed the opening code) to build extensive feature category level datasets.", "Do you recall the label_df data frame? I assign it or a subset of it to test_label.", "From here, there are many possible ways in which you can visualize the image datasets. TI wanted to build a view that gives me a one-stop overview of all the images in a grid and the corresponding feature charts for each image in another grid similar to the first image-grid structure.", "Say, I would like to display a grid of all the images in this subset of Donald Trump images where Cloud vision API has annotated at least one label. I want to design a function that allows me to pass the subset \u2018test_label\u2019 data frame and retrieve a grid of images. A sketch of the requirement to create my code schema looks like this:", "For each URL, I will use the Python Imaging Library (PIL) to open, read and convert the URL into a PIL image (function in Gist1 called in Gist2)\u2192", "Loop runs for each URL show the image in each subplot and repeats it till all images are plotted.", "The output of the above function is a one-stop overview grid of all the images for which Cloud Vision API identified at least one label. You can find it below:", "For the above grid, I want to chart the labels in the same order to glance at the label grid for key trends quickly. If any interesting label pops for a picture, I need to find the corresponding image with the label bar chart's same coordinates in the label-grid. The logic for the label-grid is very similar to the image grid. You can find the code below:", "I used bar charts representing the labels arranged in the descending order of its confidence score. The label-grid output for the above images is plotted below. Let\u2019s take a closer look at image-9 below( row 2: and column:3) and find its image equivalent in (row2, colum3) in the image grid.", "For example, IMG-9 ( 2x 3 in the below grid) has labels different from other label bar-charts. The key labels are figurines, toys, miniature, cartoons, souvenirs, and action figures. You can confirm this by looking at image 9 in fig .4", "I can think of a few applications on the fly. One of them in the home security space where a mobile notification is triggered to house residents when the CCTV image feed detects protest and crowd labels simultaneously.", "The logic and code are very similar to the label detection and visualization part. The logic is the same, but the results are slightly different. Apart from clothing and accessories, there are not any major eye-catching objects in the images. Once the images are loaded, you can zoom in to view the below image and object grids.", "For face detection and visualization, I had to tweak the code a bit. For every face, we have five different facial emotions/features: joy, sorrow, anger, surprise, and blurred. Apart from these, there are also exposure and headgear features. For this project, I required emotion scores and one non-emotion feature to see and compare.", "Each emotion is scored on a likelihood scale of 0\u20135, where", "I wanted to represent the emotions in point plots where the x-axis has categorical values. So, I flattened the dataset's cross-tab structure, where I brought the emotions from different columns to a single column. The emotion-grid and the image grid are plotted below in that order.", "From the below emotion grid, you can observe the scores for each face against each emotion. Fig 6 is a bird\u2019s eye view of the faces and their emotions.", "If you want to plot each image's emotions, I prefer creating a bounding box for each face in the image and displaying the emotions beside the box. From the below grid, it is clear that the first three pictures contain a joyful person. Can you spot them below in the image grid?", "This is similar to facial emotions, as each color has red, green, blue, alpha, and pixel fraction values. I transformed RGB values into hexadecimal values for labeling the colors. I used the treemap charts to plot the colors and pixel fraction values against them to show color composition.", "You can see red, black, grey, and brown to be frequent colors concerning pictures associated with Donald Trump.", "Apart from these, you can also check for the safe-search explicit parameters. You can use the likelihood measures for adult, medical, spoof, violence, and racy pictures. I have taken 4 pictures from the set for illustration. In the below example, the first and fourth images are spoofs, and the charts confirm it.", "With the code for AI image annotation and visualization ready, we can now deploy this algorithm to", "Sources: I have taken two mainstream media websites to understand their selection choices of images to report 2020 US election news. Their website links are mentioned below. The approach I have used is very similar to the one outlined above for Unsplash images.", "I considered the last 12 days, i.e., Oct 20- Oct 31, as a sample for this article. I built image analytical datasets and have created visualizations for all the images published within that time frame. I found it easier to compartmentalize the time horizon into 3-day windows to ensure enough images in each window for meaningful analysis. In this part, I will focus on the difference between the publications concerning labels, objects, landmarks, and logos. The x-axes represent count, and y-axes represent the feature in all the graphs below. I plot the annotated labels, logos, and objects by varying the 3-day windows and the websites in a 5x2 grid.", "In the case of labels, you can look at the pictures in the links and compare them with the below charts to differentiate between prominent labels.", "Oct 29\u201331: NYT seems to have many themes and annotated labels in this period compared to CNN. Interestingly, you can observe that there are quite a few automotive-related themes on the right \u2014 { Motor vehicle, automotive design, automotive exterior, car, Land vehicle, vehicle door}. On the left, you find labels associated with air travel/ airplane. Some pictures were probably taken while boarding or getting off the plane in different states for a campaign rally. The color labels, red and blue, are common to both websites.", "Oct 26\u201328: Again, a lot more variety in labels on the right. Interestingly, you can observe architecture, building, and Roman temple themes in NYT images. If I saw these charts without looking at the images, I infer the photos on the left are speech photos with the American flag and photos near airplanes after landing/before boarding. The photos on the right seem to contain more vibrant themes such as the metropolis, buildings, town, high visibility clothing, city, and landmark along with speeches. I would surmise the latter set might have more engagement than the former set of labels on a website for the same topic due to the variety and vibrant themes.", "You can link individual labels to the site engagement metrics such as bounce rates, session duration, pages/session to see if any labels are consistently driving better website engagement performance.", "Oct 20\u201325: Similar observations as above. Please comment in the article if you find any other interesting patterns.", "I have also plotted the objects and logos similarly identified by AI, as described above. You can zoom in and check them below. Again a lot more variety of logos on the right side of the chart compared to the left.", "From the landmarks data, you also have the lat-longs of landmarks identified by AI in the picture. You can check out the Kepler visualization of them below.", "Other features: The colors and facial expressions would make interesting visualizations. I found many pictures projecting joy quite frequently, occasionally followed by blurred, anger, and sorrow in that order.", "I have not explored the face's physical features, such as roll, tilt, pan angles, facial landmarks, and distance between bounding polygons. But a few ideas could be interesting to look at. For example, bounding boxes of faces can be used for automating social distancing checks. You can map the number of faces identified, whether a person is wearing a mask (labels/objects), and the distance between the faces' bounding boxes to check if social distancing is followed.", "To look at the images across multiple news websites, I used Google images to extract all the images related to rallies undertaken by Presidential candidates. In this case, I compared the images resulting from the search query \u201c Biden Rally 2020\u201d with the images resulting from the query \u201cTrump Rally 2020\u201d. For these queries, I extracted 100 images each for annotation and analysis. In all visualizations, the Biden Rally images are on the left and the Trump Rally images to the right.", "You can have a look at the logos chart below. To get at least 5 logos each, I have relaxed the logo identification confidence score to 0.5 instead of the 0.9 that I used for labels and objects. There are lists of company logos identified by AI for each query in the charts below. In some cases, it works well. For example, the Adidas logo was identified in this picture with a 0.8 confidence score.", "For most other cases, the confidence scores are in the range of 0.5\u20130.6, so take them with a pinch of salt. For example, the WeWork logo was identified in this image. I am not sure if it is obvious from the image. You can try to spot it\u2014a finding Waldo exercise.", "Joy is the most frequent facial emotion detected, followed by blurred features. The median of each of the emotion score for both queries is 1 (unlikely that the emotion was detected)", "The color RGBs and pixel fractions for both sets are plotted below.", "If a picture is worth, a thousand words to a consumer, its worth is amplified multifold to the organization with the rise of AI and computer vision algorithms. We have seen computer vision can unlock a vast repository of data sourced only from the images. In this case of US election news feed image analysis, we could extract extensive image data sets and churn them to generate insights. You could potentially use the code outlined in these set of articles your extant projects or potentially extend it to new applications.", "Many applications and operationalization would materialize if we can use these image data points as antecedents or independent variables to explain changes /effects on outcome KPIs. A few examples include:", "I think we have only scratched the surface in terms of insights and visualization using AI and image analytics. Happy exploring the seas of data!", "Image Credits used in the article:", "Below are the images from Unsplash that I used for charting the image grids. Thanks to all the photographers.", "Your home for data science.
