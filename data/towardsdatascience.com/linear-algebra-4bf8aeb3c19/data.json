It is a branch of mathematics in which letters are used instead of numbers. Each letter can represent a specific number in one place, and a completely different number in another. Notations and symbols are also used in algebra to show the relationship between numbers. I remember about 17 years ago when I was an ordinary student in applied mathematics(ordinary graduate today!), I was so curious about some research in algebra, done by Maryam Mirzakhani(1977\u20132017), at Harvard University about analogous counting problem. This science has evolved a lot throughout history and now includes many branches.", "Elementary algebra includes basic operations on four main operations. After defining the signs by which fixed numbers and variables are separated, methods are used to solve the equations. A polynomial is an expression that is the sum of a finite number of non-zero terms, each term consisting of the product of a constant and a finite number of variables raised to whole number powers.", "Abstract algebra or modern algebra is a group in the algebra family that studies advanced algebraic structures such as groups, rings, and fields. Algebraic structures, with their associated homomorphisms, form mathematical categories. Category theory is a formalism that allows a unified way for expressing properties and constructions that are similar for various structures. Abstract algebra is so popular and used in many fields of mathematics and engineering sciences. For instance, algebraic topology uses algebraic objects to study topologies. The Poincar\u00e9 conjecture proved in 2003, asserts that the fundamental group of a manifold, which encodes information about connectedness, can be used to determine whether a manifold is a sphere or not. Algebraic number theory studies various number rings that generalize the set of integers.", "I believe that the most influencing branch of algebra in other sciences is linear algebra. Let\u2019s suppose that you went out for jogging, that can\u2019t be easy these days with Covid-19 lockdown, and suddenly a beautiful flower catches all your attention. Please don\u2019t be rush and pick it, just take a picture, others can enjoy it, as well. After a while when you look at this picture, you can recognize the flower in the image, because the human brain has evolved over millions of years and able to detect such a thing. We are unaware of the operations that take place in the background of our brains and enable us to recognize the colors in the image, they are trained to do this for us automatically. But, it\u2019s not easy to do such a thing with a machine, that\u2019s why this is one of the most active research areas in machine learning and deep learning. Actually, the fundamental question is: \u201cHow does a machine store this image?\u201d You probably know that today\u2019s computers are designed to process only two numbers, 0 and 1. Now, how can an image like this with different features be stored? This is done by storing the pixel intensity in a structure called a \u201cmatrix\u201d.", "The main topics in linear algebra are vectors and matrices. Vectors are geometric objects that have length and direction. For example, we can mention speed and force, both of which are vector quantities. Each vector is represented by an arrow whose length and direction indicate the size and direction of the vector. The addition of two or more vectors can be done based on ease of use using parallelogram methods or the method of images in which each vector is decomposed into its components along the coordinate axes. A vector space is a collection of vectors, which may be added together and multiplied by scalars. Scalars generally can be picked up from any field but normally are real numbers.", "A matrix is an ordered array of numbers in 2 dimensions, generally m rows and n columns. If two matrices have the same size, which means that, each matrix has the same number of rows and the same number of columns, like the other one, they can be added or subtracted element by element. We can only multiply the matrices, just when the number of columns in the first matrix is the same as the number of rows in the second. For instance, let suppose that the inner dimensions are the same, n for an (m\u00d7n) matrix times an (n\u00d7p), then the resulting in an (m\u00d7p) matrix.", "Another important concept that is used wildly in machine learning is tensor. A tensor is an algebraic object that describes a multi-linear relationship between sets of algebraic objects related to a vector space. Tensors can take several different forms, in general, two-dimensional and higher two-dimensional tensors are also known as matrices. Matrices are used to create the order between the data of an issue and the classification of its information.", "For example, a tensor is used in image processing, might one dimension for width, one dimension for the height, and one for colors and also one for focus information. To link all the concepts, we learn above, we can say, the tensor with zero-dimension is the scalar, with one dimension is the vector and finally with two dimensions is the matrix. In recent years, libraries for use in programming languages have been developed to facilitate the use of tensors as well as their rapid processing. One of these is TensorFlow which was developed by Google. Google has also developed a special-purpose integrated circuit called the Tensor Processor Unit (TPU) for efficient and faster tensor calculations for neural networks.", "Eigenvector and eigenvalue are the other important concepts that are widely used in machine learning. An eigenvector of a linear transformation is a nonzero vector that changes by a scalar factor when that linear transformation is applied to it. The eigenvalue is a special set of non-zero scales that the eigenvector would be stretched by it. If the scales are negative, the direction would be the opposite.", "The prefix \u201ceigen\u201d is derived from the German language and means characteristic. The eigenvector has various applications in engineering sciences, one of which is its application in machine learning algorithms to perform feature reduction and dimensional operations.", "In machine learning, we need fundamentals of working with data in vector and matrix form, acquire skills for solving systems of linear algebraic equations, and finding the basic matrix decompositions and a general understanding of their applicability. Actually, you must know what vectors and matrices are and how to work with them, including the knotty problem of eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and how to use these to solve problems.", "If you want to learn more about linear algebra, don\u2019t start from scratch and in an academic style. Rely on definitions and try to solve some problems with machine learning algorithms and its hidden engine methods.", "Your home for data science.
