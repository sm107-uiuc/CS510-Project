This article is about performing prediction on test data based on the models that we have trained using train data. Most of the time, the data modeling and prediction part is the most interesting as it requires you to think and tweak the underlying parameters to improve the results. Before we start, make sure that you have installed Orange. Kindly read the first part for setup and installation if you have missed it, there will be links at the bottom for you to navigate the entire Data Science Made Easy series. First and foremost, I will explain to you on how to use the Predictions widget. Then, I will cover some of the most common models that can be used for data modeling.", "Predictions widget accepts two input. One is the dataset, which usually comes from test data while the second one is the \u201cPredictors\u201d. \u201cPredictors\u201d refers to the output from any Model widgets. You can connect as many Model widget with Predictions widget as you like. There are a few days to setup the whole data modeling and prediction process.", "The first one is via two different File widgets that holds data for both train set and test set.", "You should see something similar to the image above. At line 71, we can notice that the model predicted it as Iris-virgica but the actual class is Iris-versicolor. You can also see the confidence level of each of the predictions.", "You can test out other models and add on top of it as shown in the figure above. Remember to connect the model with the correct dataset as training data.", "You will notice that there is one big problem with the output from Prediction widget. It only shows the result based on one row of data. If you intend to get the overall result or some insights from it. You will need to use some of the Evaluate widgets. We have covered this in the previous article. Kindly check it out before you proceed. We will try out just one of the widget.", "You should obtain a similar result as shown in the figure above. You can test it out with other models to see their performance.", "Alternatively, we can rely on Data Sampler widget to split the data into both train set and test set if you do not have a dedicated dataset for testing. As I have mentioned in the previous article, Data Sampler widget has similar functionality as train_test_split of sklearn.", "Do not get confuse between both the Predictions widget and Test & Score widget as they perform different tasks.", "I will roughly explain some of the available models and the parameters that can be modified for each one of them. This is to provide a better understanding to the beginners. For the advanced readers, you can find most of the information from the official documentation.", "Tree widget refers to decision tree learning algorithm with forward pruning. It can be used for both discreet and continuous dataset. The interface has the following parameters:", "You can connect it with Tree Viewer widget as shown in the figure above to get more information on how the tree looks like.", "You should be able to obtain a similar result as shown in the figure above.", "Random Forest is an ensemble learning method that builds a set of decision trees. It can be used in a variety of tasks such as classification and regression. The interface has the following parameters:", "Linear Regression widget attempts to find the best fit line based on the data points provided. It can learn and identify the relationship between a predictor variable x and the response variable y. Please be noted that Linear Regression widget can only be used on regression tasks. You can set the type of regularization and its respective strength.", "The concept of regularization is not within the scope of this tutorial. Feel free to check it out from other sources. Based on the official documentation, Lasso regression minimizes a penalized version of the least squares loss function with L1-norm penalty while Ridge regularization minimize it with L2-norm penalty.", "Logistic Regression widget works slightly different from Linear Regression widget. Even though it has the word regression in it, it only works for classification tasks.", "The parameters are almost similar to Linear Regression as you can choose between Ridge or Lasso regularization. Besides, you can modify the strength as well with C=1 as the default value.", "This time we have learned how to use Predictions widget to do prediction based on train set and test set. Alternatively, we can do so by splitting the dataset into two using a Data Sampler widget. We also went through a rough explanation on the difference between Predictions widget and Test & Score widget. Then, we moved on to a few commonly used learning algorithms for data modeling. We started off with Tree widget which can be connected to a Tree Viewer widget to show the decision trees. Then, we moved on to Random Forest widget and its respective parameters. Finally, we explored both Linear Regression widget and Logistic Regression widget. Linear Regression widget can only be used for regression tasks while Logistic Regression widget is meant for classification task. Thanks for reading the part 4 of Data Science Made Easy tutorial. In the next part, I will be covering Image Analytics using Orange. \u2764\ufe0f", "Your home for data science.
