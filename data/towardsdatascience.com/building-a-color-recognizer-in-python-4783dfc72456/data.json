This process is also known as \u201cColor Detection\u201d. We will create a basic application that will help us to detect the colors in an image. The program will also return as the RGB values of the colors, which is really helpful. Many graphic designers and web designers will understand how RGB values can be helpful. Building a color recognizer is a great project to get started with Computer Vision.", "If you haven\u2019t heard of Computer Vision before, this is the best time to learn about it. Most of the machine learning and artificial intelligence fields are strongly connected to Computer Vision. As we are growing and exploring, seeing the outside world has a big impact on our development. This goes the same for the machines, they see the outside world using images, and those images are turned into data values that computers can understand.", "In previous posts, I showed how to detect faces and also how to recognize faces in an image, these are great projects to practice python in artificial intelligence and computer vision. Let\u2019s do some work!", "We will use three main modules for this project. They are NumPy, Pandas and OpenCv. OpenCv is a highly optimized library with a focus on real-time applications.", "OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open-source computer vision and machine learning software library. OpenCV was built to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products.", "As mention earlier, there are three modules we will use for this project. To use these modules we have to install the necessary libraries. Library installation is a very easy step using pip. Pip is a package management tool. We will do the installation using the command-line interface. Here is the line to install all 3 libraries at once:", "After the installation is completed, we have to import them to our program. Open a new file in your favorite code editor. Here is the code on how to import the installed libraries:", "OpenCv is imported as cv2. And for other libraries, we imported them \u201cas\u201d so that it is easier to call them in the program.", "Perfect! Now, we can move to our next step, where we will define the image we want to use to test our color recognizer application.", "You can choose any image you want. I will save my image in the same folder as my program, which makes it easier to find and import.", "To give you some idea, here is the image I will use for this project:", "Great! Are you ready for some programming? Without losing any time let\u2019s move to the next step.", "Let me ask you a nice question. Did you know that machines are so pure? Well, I think they are because they learn whatever you teach them. They are like a big white canvas. And your program is your brush :)", "First, we have to teach them the colors. To do that we need data that includes color names and some values to match with those colors. Since most of the colors can be defined using Red, Green, and Blue. That\u2019s why we will use the RGB format as our data points. I found a ready csv file with around 1000 color names and the RGB values. Here is the GitHub link. We will use this csv file in our program. The screenshot of the file to give you some idea:", "Let\u2019s import colors.csv file to our program using read_csv method. Since the csv file we downloaded doesn\u2019t have column names, I will be defining them in the program. This process is known as data manipulation.", "In the following steps, we will define two functions. To make the application work smoothly, we need some global variables. You will know how global variables can be helpful when working with functions.", "This function will be called when we double click on an area of the image. It will return the color name and the RGB values of that color. This is where the magic happens!", "This function is used to define our double click process. We will need it when creating our application part.", "I hope you are still with me! It may look a little complicated but when you start writing them in your editor, the big picture will come to life. I do my best to keep things simple and easy to understand. I will add my contact info at the end of this article, reach me if you need any help.", "I am glad you made it to this step. In this step, we will open the image as a new window using OpenCV methods. And in that window, we will use the functions we defined earlier. The application is so simple, it returns the color name and color values when you double click on a certain area on the image.", "First things first, let me show you how to open the image file as a new window using OpenCV.", "Secondly, let\u2019s call the mouse click function that we created. This gives more functionality to our application.", "Here is the while loop to start our application window working.", "If you worked with OpenCV projects, you may be familiar with this step. We have to define how to end and close the application window. Otherwise, it will run forever since we used while(1) to start the application. Adding the following lines is a good practice for your future projects.", "Currently, I am working on a demonstration video for this project. I received many positive feedbacks about the demonstration videos, it gives a better understanding of the program and application process. The video will be published on my youtube channel.", "(Update: Video is ready and available below. Thanks \ud83d\ude0a )", "Congrats!! You have created a cool computer vision application that recognizes colors in an image. Now, you have some idea of how to use computer vision in a real project. Hoping that you enjoyed reading my article. I will be so happy if you learned something new today. Working on hands-on programming projects like this one is the best way to sharpen your coding skills.", "Feel free to contact me if you have any questions while implementing the code.", "Follow my blog and Towards Data Science to stay inspired.
