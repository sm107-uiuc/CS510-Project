When they tried to find the least contact with the ground needed for the robot to walk, they had found an impossible value \u2014 the computer had calculated that the robot could walk with 0% contact of the feet with the ground.", "How could a robot possibly walk without making contact with the ground?", "When they ran the video, they found something amazing. The computer had come up with a gait in which the robot could invert itself and walk using its elbow joints, thus reducing the contact of the feet to 0.", "If this task was given to a human, it seems highly unlikely that they would consider a robot walking gait that didn\u2019t use legs. The AI came up with a unique solution by itself.", "So the question then arises \u2014 Was the AI creative?", "Creativity is a skill we usually consider uniquely human. For all of history, we have been the most creative beings on planet Earth. Birds can make their nests, ants can make their hills, but no other species on the 510.1 million km\u00b2 surface of the Earth comes close to the level of creativity we humans display.", "However, just in the last decade we have acquired the ability to do amazing things with computers, just like the robot. With the AI boom of the 2010s, computers can now recognise faces, translate between every language, take calls for you, and beat players at the world\u2019s most complicated board game, to name a few.", "All of a sudden, we must face the possibility that our ability to be creative is not unrivalled in the universe.", "So is creativity no longer a uniquely human trait? Can AI be creative?", "The usual argument against computers being creative goes that they can only do what they are told to do. Humans are the ones programming them, they are just slaves to the instructions given and carry out tasks accordingly. They are robots \u2014 a term that came from the Czech word robota, which literally translates to forced labour.", "Humans on the other hand, are not bound by rules, they can innovate, think outside the box; they can be creative \u2014 create things out of nothing.", "But this argument fails at two levels.", "Firstly, it is egotistical to think that humans are free from the bonds of \u201cprogramming\u201d, because in reality, we, just as computers, inherently run on a set of basic rules, except instead of in 0s and 1s, our programming is in A, C, T, and Gs.", "It is these rules built up against one another that creates the complexity we define as creativity. Yet the same applies to computers. In possibly one of the hottest fields in computer science at the moment \u2014 Machine Learning, computers learn due to the amalgamation of calculations of thousands of artificial neurons. It is easy to dismiss computers as just a combination of many simple rules, but complexity is nothing but compounded simplicity.", "Secondly, consider how an AI learns. In one of the most successful methods today, the computer is fed thousands, if not millions of pieces of data relating to the task for it to learn. If it needs to detect tumours in images, for example, it is fed images of x-rays with the tumours highlighted. It attempts to detect the tumour, and based on whether it is right or wrong, it adjusts itself to be more accurate. After seeing millions of these images, the computer learns how to highlight images of tumours.", "Complexity is nothing but compounded simplicity.", "Humans learn almost the same way. We repeatedly try things, and based on whether we are correct or incorrect, we adjust our approach until we reach a certain level of competence.", "So even though our methods of learning are quite similar, when computers do unique things, we often find ways to avoid calling it creative.", "When humans come up with something novel and surprising, it\u2019s seen as creative genius and called insight.", "When computers create something novel and surprising, we consider the creator as the one being creative, or consider it dangerous and require the AI to explain itself.", "In many cases, this explanation is warranted. If a self driving car made the decision of swerving to avoid killing its passengers or staying on course to avoid killing pedestrians, the families of the casualties would want an explanation as to why the AI made its decision, even though getting the answer to that question won\u2019t be easy.", "On the other hand, how about when an AI learns to generate paintings in the style of Monet? Do we consider the AI to be as creative as an artist doing the same thing? Usually, this creativity is brushed aside, with the argument that the computer did it with raw math, whereas humans would do it with intuition.", "In fact, every time computers learn to do something we thought was uniquely human, we change our assumptions to considering that activity simple for computers to do.", "For example, automatically captioning videos, playing chess, and even spam detection were once considered extremely difficult, or even impossible for a computer to do, but are now the norm. In essence, we are turning a blind eye to how far computers have come by consistently brushing off their creativity by belittling the tasks they perform.", "It is important to keep in mind how far AI has come compared to humans. However, it is also important to understand their shortcomings.", "We humans have a modest aptitude in many domains, whereas AI has supreme competence in only one extremely narrow domain.", "Humans can learn to walk, speak, understand, paint, make music, communicate with others, amongst many things. AI would only be able to do one of these, but do it very well.", "For example, researchers trained an AI to transfer the styles of paintings to the content of ordinary photographs. Unlike humans, AI can digitally reproduce thousands of these stylised paintings in an hour. However, the same AI can\u2019t do just about anything else.", "So one could argue that without a human creating and deploying an AI to do these tasks, the AI can\u2019t do anything \u2014 as their creators, their creativity is actually our creativity.", "However, without the math of the thousands of neurons in the AI calculating values, the paintings won\u2019t be made either.", "The creative output \u2014 the paintings, depend on both the AI and the human, so they can\u2019t be attributed to any without including the other.", "This combination of both AI and human is not clearer in any domain more than the quintessentially creative subject \u2014 Art.", "There is a myriad of artists using a combination of their artistic insight and AI\u2019s creative ability to create amazing displays of creativity online.", "Twitter users Manoloide and Robbie Barrat use computers to create amazing works of art; AI generated art made by Robbie Barrat was even featured on the cover of Bloomberg\u2019s magazine.", "The AI by itself doesn\u2019t have any taste or insight as to which art looks good, but without the AI, the humans wouldn\u2019t be able to make the amazing creations they do currently.", "To conclude, people often say that computers can only do what they are explicitly programmed to, and thus that they can\u2019t be creative. However, with the rise of machine learning, AI can now learn certain skills.", "This being said, the AI will only be as good as its training, and won\u2019t be able to do anything in areas other than the narrow domain it was trained for. This requires humans to assemble datasets and code the AI. The AI doesn\u2019t have any judgement or nuance in its understanding either. Which is a skill humans bring to the table.", "Therefore, when put together, AI and humans can achieve great things. They can become the best chess players in the world, transfer styles of world famous paintings to thousands of images, and find extremely creative solutions to problems we thought impossible to solve.", "I\u2019ll leave you with a quote that best summarises this idea by American historian Melvin Kranzberg \u2014", "A lady came up to the great violinist Fritz Kreisler after a concert and gushed, \u201cMaestro, your violin makes such beautiful music.\u201d Kreisler held his violin up to his ear and said, \u201cI don\u2019t hear any music coming out of it.\u201d You see, the instrument, the hardware, the violin itself, was of no use without the human element. But then again, without the instrument, Kreisler would not have been able to make music.", "AI is the paintbrush for the future of creativity. For it to create its art, it requires a human wielder, and for the human to make art, it requires the paintbrush\u2019s strokes.", "Your home for data science.
