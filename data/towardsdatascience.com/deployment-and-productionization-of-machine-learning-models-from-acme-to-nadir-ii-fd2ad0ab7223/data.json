It also includes all the applications, software, and tools. It trickles down to encircle all the configuration aspects such as compatibility and also parts like data and documenting the workflow bit by bit.", "A machine infrastructure encompasses almost every stage of the machine learning workflow. To train, test, and deploy machine learning models you need services from data scientists, data engineers, software prog engineers, and DevOps engineers. The infrastructure allows people from all these domains to collaborate and empower them to associate for an end to end execution of the project.", "Some examples of tools and platforms are AWS(amazon web services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure machine learning studio, Kubeflow: Machine-Learning Toolkit for Kubernetes.", "Architecture deals with the arrangement of these components(things discussed above) and also takes care of how they must interact with them. Think of it as building a machine learning home where bricks, concrete, iron, are integral to the infrastructure, applications, etc. The architecture shapes our home by using these materials. Similarly, the architecture here provides that interaction among these components.", "Versioning and Reproducibility: The \u201cit\u201d IT jargons", "Let\u2019s understand first what is versioning and reproducibility.", "It is common software and IT practice where you create and manage multiple releases of a product all of which have the same general function but are improved, upgraded, or customized.", "In machine learning, for the given data different models are built and we keep track through version control tools like DVC and Git. Version control will keep track of changes made to the model at each stage and keep a repository.", "During the research stage, the stage where we build a machine learning model. Once the model is tested and only then it is deployed. After Deployment this model is assumed to be used on the same data that is used to build the model and is expected to give the same results. We deploy the entire model pipeline, not just the algorithm. Reproducibility ensures the ability to duplicate a model such that given the same raw data as input both models return the same output ( Same data means same with features, etc).", "Let me throw some light on what affects the reproducibility so that, it will help you understand better. Suppose the model that you built earlier was giving you a 20% error. Imagine that your database has been changed and when you try to build the model again you aren\u2019t aware of the additional training data which your database is injecting to the model and therefore resulting in an additional error.", "There are a lot of factors that affect reproducibility. Therefore this versioning and version controls help us keep track of it. Mostly it has been seen during model improvement.", "There are various other system challenges from reproducibility to configuration issues to data issues. In architecture, there are key points like reproducibility, scalability: the ability of the model to serve many people among other points that one must keep in mind.", "So, this article was written mainly to give you insights on basic terminologies used in deployment. I hope you enjoyed the article.", "Your home for data science.
