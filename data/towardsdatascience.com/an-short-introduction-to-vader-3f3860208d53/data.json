For the past 2 years, Spotify has run a clever marketing campaign where it compiles a playlist of your top 100 played songs of the year. This usually does the rounds on social media as people share what they\u2019ve been bobbing their heads to and singing in the shower for the last 365 days. I thought this would be the perfect playlist for me to try out some semi-supervised sentiment analysis while hopefully discovering some interesting truths about my own listening habits.", "Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner (VADER)", "VADER is a module in the nltk.sentiment Python library that was specifically created to work with text produced in a social media setting, however, it of course works with language that originates in other contexts. VADER is able to detect the polarity of sentiment (how positive or negative) of a given body of text when the data being analysed is unlabelled. In traditional sentiment analysis, the algorithm is given the opportunity to learn from the labelled training data. A classic example would be predicting the star rating of a movie review based on the written review of a given critic. The star rating would be the target variable and the text would be the predictor variables.", "In the sentiment analysis of song lyrics, we do not have any labelling. The lyrics are not rated on a scale of 0 to 10 (0 being negative and 10 being positive). So how is VADER able to gauge sentiment, then?", "VADER uses a lexicon of sentiment-related words to determine the overall sentiment of a given body of text. Below is an example of how the lexicon is structured, with each word having a valence rating:", "VADER has built this labelled lexicon using Amazon\u2019s Mechanical Turk, which is a crowdsourcing platform that pays \u2018crowdworkers\u2019 to perform tasks en masse, resulting in an impressively efficient method for doing this.", "The incredible thing about VADER is it doesn\u2019t require a great deal of preprocessing to work. Unlike with some supervised methods of NLP, preprocessing necessities such as tokenisation and stemming/lemmatisation are not required. You can pretty much plug in any body of text and it will determine the sentiment.", "VADER is even smart enough to understand the valence of non-conventional text, including emojis (i.e. :-( ), capitalisation (i.e. sad vs SAD) and extended punctuation (i.e. ? vs ???). This is what makes the module so good at analysing social media text. Additionally, VADER removes stop words automatically so there is no need to do so yourself.", "We can use pip install nltk in the command line to install the library on our device. Then we need to import VADER into our programming environment using the first line of the code snipped below.", "We can then initialise the sentiment analysis object and use the polarity_scores() method to determine the sentiment of a string. The output of this is four normalised scores:", "Let\u2019s get to it. Out of my most played 100 songs last year, 66 had lyrics that I was able to obtain using the methods outlined in one of my previous articles (a significant portion of my music library is electronic and has no lyrical element).", "The plot below shows the \u2018amount\u2019 of positivity and negativity in the lyrics of each song. Songs with more positivity than negativity will have a positive compound score and therefore have positive sentiment, and vice versa.", "To my surprise, 45 (68%) of the songs were deemed as having positive sentiment. Going into this analysis I was expecting the majority of my songs to have a negative sentiment.", "This is likely because the lyrics of a song obviously don\u2019t paint the whole picture. For example, sentences with a strong sentiment about \u2018love\u2019 could appear lyrically positive, however, with a sad melody behind them, they could firmly sit in the sad love song category.", "Looking forward it will be interesting to see how my listening habits change over the years. Unfortunately, Spotify has only offered its users a playlist with their top 100 most played songs for the last two years, but when more data becomes available I think some interesting analysis could be done. Especially if it were to include Spotify\u2019s own ratings of the songs on metrics such as \u2018danceability\u2019 and \u2018energy\u2019 that are available through their API.", "Thank you for reading this far! I hope you enjoyed this short introduction to VADER and can go on to try it on your own datasets. I\u2019d love to hear what you get up to in the comments. If you\u2019d like to reach out to me directly then feel free to leave me a message on LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
