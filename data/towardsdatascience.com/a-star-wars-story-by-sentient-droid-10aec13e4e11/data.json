The following code shows the model architecture using PyTorch.", "The story generation is done by taking a single word and text length as inputs. The word is passed to the model to get the next most likely word and we continue this process until the text length is reached. Top K sampling is used to introduce some randomness in choosing the next most likely word.", "The following are 12 examples of generated text with various input word and text length.", "I thought this was funny mentioning Han is an idiot. we can see the sequence, though it is not great but makes sense.", "The following is a different sequence generated for jedi. so far, smaller text length seems to make more sense.

Though we are not interested in the most accurate model to predict each word in the training data perfectly, we are looking to generalize the model. having a balance between overfitting and generalization. The current loss of the model is 4.1. I would like to test increasing epochs, increasing the batch size, reducing the learning rate, increasing the layers and hidden dimensions to get lower loss and better prediction. With my 1080Ti it is taking a very long time to train. I am waiting for AWS team to grant me Sagemaker ml.p2 instances to fine-tune this!", "Your home for data science.
