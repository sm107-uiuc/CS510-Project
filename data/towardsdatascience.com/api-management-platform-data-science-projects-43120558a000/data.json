In such cases, APIs offer the right solution to your data science project.", "And, to make the most of APIs, there is a need to enforce API management. With an API management platform, such as the Rakuten RapidAPI Enterprise Hub, you can abstract most of the day-to-day administrative pain points of creating or consuming APIs and realize increased productivity.", "These solutions assist you in designing, implementing, monitoring, securing, analyzing, managing, and growing your API program.", "In this article, I\u2019m going to talk about how an API management platform can help in enhancing your data science projects.", "An API management tool will provide you with centralized visibility into the performance of your internal APIs and external API subscriptions. As you use more APIs in your data science projects, it becomes difficult to keep track of them.", "In fact, according to a 2017 study, an average company uses more than 300 different APIs. With these many APIs to take care of, simplifying their tracking process is required to optimize their value and deliverability.", "Otherwise, it can be difficult to assess and improve their performance, enhance the developer experience, or make informed decisions.", "An API management solution will give you the enhanced visibility and control you need to know what is happening with your APIs.", "With a single central location to manage your data science APIs, you can get rid of redundant APIs, identify performance inconsistencies, and ease the orchestration of the different moving parts of your APIs.", "API governance refers to the practice of establishing various policies that control the use of an API product.", "It involves a wide range of management, administration, visibility, monitoring, and other measures that streamline and govern the adoption of APIs.", "As a data scientist, having an API management platform will let you outline the terms and conditions that make your APIs accessible by different personas within and outside your enterprise.", "It\u2019s what you need to implement access management and safeguard against unauthorized use, undertake audit trails to discover abnormal usage trends, and blacklist or whitelist APIs.", "Furthermore, managing your APIs makes it easy to analyze and monitor their performance.", "Most of these solutions come with intuitive dashboards that allow you to get quick insights across all APIs used by your team. This way, you can evaluate and maintain the health of your APIs.", "You can also use such a platform to collate APIs according to their different functions. For example, if you have different APIs that pull data sets for data visualization, you can group them and monitor their performance easily.", "Also, even if there are multiple versions of an API, such a platform will allow you to track and govern the various versions effortlessly.", "Most API management platforms come with a built-in developer portal that allows users to find APIs, learn how to consume them, test them out interactively, and ultimately register to get API keys.", "These portals act as a repository of everything pertaining to using the given APIs \u2014 from providing documentation, code snippets, tools, and other helper resources.", "If you can use the portal to search for public and internal APIs, sign up to them, and incorporate them into your applications, you can greatly improve the capabilities of your data science projects.", "Instead of having to create functionalities from scratch, you can use an API management solution to discover new APIs and save your development time, costs, and efforts. This will allow you to concentrate on improving the offerings of your core product.", "More so, leveraging APIs can lead to several improvements across most crucial elements of your data science projects. According to a recent study, users who adopted APIs realized a significant increase in productivity (at 59%), direct revenues (at 43%), and innovation (at 51%).", "Therefore, the ability to find and connect to APIs is an important feature you can take advantage of to increase the efficiency of your projects.", "When using APIs in your data science applications, security should be an important consideration.", "Currently, with the increased utilization of APIs, attackers are shifting their focus from the traditional targets to a new area that hasn\u2019t been extensively exploited yet: application programming interfaces.", "APIs are highly susceptible to attacks because they expose the underlying enactment of a computing technique.", "Since they provide programmatic access to data and services, this also enlarges the attack surface area \u2014 unlike other user-facing applications.", "According to a recent report, the number of API vulnerabilities has been rising tremendously year-over-year, increasing by about 154% from 2015 to 2018.", "By managing APIs, you can enforce their security and realize the value you initially envisioned with your data science projects.", "A management platform can help you to maximize your API\u2019s security from various types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle, denial of service (DoS), injection, or social engineering attacks.", "Besides authenticating and authorizing access, an API management tool can assist in setting up various security measures for your APIs.", "These include configuring the OAuth token authorizing system, instituting policies to block bad actors, revoking compromised APIs, implementing API key rotation, applying quotas and rate limiting, and setting permissions for accessing APIs.", "Also, as earlier mentioned, such a platform will increase the visibility into your APIs. This heightened visibility lets you analyze the API activities against normal usage patterns, discover unauthorized intrusions based on strange behaviors, and identify threats as early as possible before the extent of damage is amplified.", "API monetization, just as the name suggests, refers to the process of earning revenues from your APIs. Monetization allows API providers to grow their pursuits and discover new opportunities with developers, partners, and customers.", "Depending on your objectives, there are three main monetization options you can pursue with your API program: providing it for free, the consumer pays, or consumer gets paid.", "For example, if you have created an algorithm that performs sentiment analysis, you can expose it as an API and allow other developers to use it to find the opinion expressed in documents or articles.", "And to generate some money from the use of your sentiment analysis API, you can monetize it by charging other data scientists for using it.", "Most API management solutions offer an easy way to monetize and unlock value from your API products.", "These platforms will provide you with a centralized payment center for your APIs, the ability to implement subscription plans, billing capabilities, and more.", "APIs are widely used in data science projects. However, ad hoc API adoption often leads to performance discrepancies, security issues, and reduced productivity.", "An API management plan provides a single source of truth to bring unity, cohesion, and versatility to your APIs.", "With a platform to manage and control your APIs, you can optimize their value and make the most of your data science projects.", "So, are you using (or planning to use) a tool for the management of APIs?", "Or, do you have any comments or questions?", "Your home for data science.
