His triangular face with unblinking, wide-set eyes gave him an uncanny resemblance to a mantis. \u201cI am pleasantly surprised that a man of your age has such a deep knowledge of analytical technologies.\u201d", "Domnall decided not to mention that he had just described the same technologies for the eighth time now, including two times to the recruiter and five times to the manager\u2019s subordinates. The interlocutor\u2019s surprise indicated poor communication in the company, but Domnall planned to improve that, too. His lips carved with a genuine smile.", "\u201cSo when can I start implementing my knowledge here?\u201d", "\u201cI\u2019ll inform HR later today.\u201d The man checked something in his papers, muttered a ridiculously low number under his breath, and added in a calming voice, \u201cSuch amount doesn\u2019t require acceptance of my superiors, so it should be processed quickly\u2026\u201d", "\u201cIt shall be twice that, I think\u2026\u201d Domnall corrected politely, not sure if his hearing faltered, or was it rather his memory weakened by the telenovelish pace of the ongoing recruitment process.", "\u201cTwice?\u201d The manager was clearly surprised.", "\u201cThe recruiter assured me it\u2019s the wage for this position.\u201d", "\u201cImpossible\u2026 He must have had something wrong.\u201d The man shrugged off the inaccuracy and folded his hand as if to pray. \u201cListen. You can start here on Monday morning. From what I\u2019ve heard, you\u2019ve already sunk a lot of costs seeking employment. Even if you find a better-paid job within a few months, the difference won\u2019t cover the losses you\u2019ll generate until then. It just doesn\u2019t pay off!\u201d He leaned forward and tipped the wink to his future employee encouraging him to move closer. He whispered confidentially, \u201cBesides, even if you don\u2019t consider the base pay high, we offer a great stock option package. We plan an IPO in two-three years.\u201d He straightened up and finished in a full voice, \u201cAfter so many conversations with your future coworkers, you are surely aware that our cashflow is going to skyrocket soon!\u201d", "Domnall blinked in confusion. In his mind, he was frantically analyzing his private cashflow which has, since he substituted the new value for income, tipped to a stable downward trend.", "\u201cStock options?\u201d he asked. \u201cIt means I\u2019ll be able to buy company shares for a set price, not at market value?\u201d There was no way in hell for Domnall to recall the details of the pilot episode of this soap opera. \u201cThe problem is, that with this salary I won\u2019t be able to save anything to invest.\u201d", "The manager let out a jolly laugh.", "\u201cYou\u2019ll pay for shares with your bonus! You\u2019ll get up to ten percent extra each year!", "Domnall refreshed in his head the cash flow chart, which shyly and slowly, nevertheless surely, started to grow. But the learned distrust prevailed over his optimism.", "\u201cWhat does the bonus depend on?\u201d", "\u201cThe usual stuff, the performance of the company, team, and yours, of course\u2026\u201d The man waved a hand dismissively, but seeing the applicant\u2019s questioning gaze, he sighed impatiently and recited, \u201cSeventy-five, twenty and five percent respectively.\u201d", "The graph arrow buried its head.", "\u201cApart from that, we have a wide range of attractive perks for our employees\u2026\u201d", "\u201cLike a three percent price reduction on designer clothes and holidays in Dubai?\u201d", "\u201cNot only on that! There are also discounts on victualling!\u201d", "Domnall looked at the manager with interest renewed. Collecting coupons for grocery stores strongly conflicted with his plan of reaping the benefits of his education. However, if it could help him balance the monthly calories intake, the proposed salary should cover his rent, student loan repayment and daily commute.", "Mantis-man probably sensed his hesitation, because he greedily rubbed his hands and announced proudly, \u201cYes! Up to ten percent in some really fancy restaurants!\u201d", "When, despite this revelation, the applicant\u2019s eyes dimmed, the manager said with a badly concealed irritation, \u201cYou know very well, how much effort we put in for this meeting to happen. Don\u2019t you consider that work and money that we have invested to find and evaluate you, are also a part of your salary?!\u201d A contemptuous grimace on the man\u2019s face betrayed his disgust caused by Domnall\u2019s sudden confusion, but he forced himself to throw the applicant another lifebuoy, \u201cBesides, we also have Fresh Fruit Mondays!\u201d", "\u201cWith such a wage ladder, I would also consider offering Dough Tuesdays, Meat Wednesdays, Sweet Thursdays and Fish Fridays.\u201d", "The manager frowned, irked. He gathered the papers from the counter and pushed back his chair.", "\u201cI\u2019ll think about it,\u201d he growled clearly offended, \u201cWe will call you.\u201d", "Episode 6: Passionate, more passionate, hired!", "Domnall is a brilliant guy. However, job-seeking is long-term entertainment, and will probably take him a while. Especially that job interviews don\u2019t happen every day.
