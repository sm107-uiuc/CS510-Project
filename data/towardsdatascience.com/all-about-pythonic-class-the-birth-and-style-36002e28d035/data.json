We will try to cover the very basic concepts of how a Python class is formed and destructed with a simplified narrative. The creation and destruction of a Python class, more specifically a Python 3.x class, inevitably juxtaposes with a number of seemingly discrete topics.", "More importantly, a reader needs at least moderate knowledge of the Python data model, special methods, metaprogramming, and how the interpreter works behind the scene. Also, there are some repetitions, circular discussion, and oversimplifications that are inevitable \u2014 e.g. we had to stick with objects to explain the behavior of a class.", "Let\u2019s write a basic class for Her Excellency Miss Foo, a famed post-rock guitar practitioner in our locality, who has requested us to write a program that will keep track of her students\u2019 names, money that they will pay her and assign an email address with her domain name. She is a developer herself but with a tight daily schedule and asked lazy programmers like us for help. She will, however, use this blueprint or class into her own script. Example of real-life code reuse, huh! Let\u2019s help her.", "We just have written a skeleton Student class and passed the interpreter a pass statement telling her to keep it intact until we assign anything to it. We also create two Student class entity in the statements [2] and [3]. Two most important points to note here that despite being derived from the same class Student, student_1 and student_2 have different identities and locations in the RAM-- statements [5] and [4].", "On a Sunday morning, Andrew Thompson got admitted into her class. Miss Foo will charge him 5,000 bucks every month. Let's add his name", "On a Friday morning, Marc Byrd, a friend of Andrew, enrolled in the class. As he is a beginner, Miss Foo has to pay more effort and attention to him. Marc will pay 6000 bucks a month. Let\u2019s log his name into the registry book.", "Notice the approach we have adopted in the aforementioned example serves our purpose but makes it complex to go further.", "We can make the situation a bit more flexible by avoiding repetition and ensuring code reusability by literally writing a blueprint of what properties the Student class and its objects will get.", "Now what we have here is,", "The statement [2] can be rewritten as Class.objectMethod(object). In our case, it is equivalent to Student.details(student_1).", "An interesting note that we can override an instance method like a variable on the fly. For example, we can change details() the callable function into a new string.", "Notice that details has now become a string object which is not callable. The __dict__ is a dictionary that contains what variables the object has.", "Notice that details has now become a string object which is not callable.", "Continuing from the first of this series, a discussion on Python Data Model, we will frequently meet the \u2018cliche\u2019 and repetitive notion \u201cIn Python, everything is an Object.\u201d", "They are either a prototype or metaclass of type or objects of some other classes", "This might be compared to the days when we had just started our *nix journey where we were told at least hundreds of times that everything from a textfile to the keyboard \u2018is a file.\u2019In Python 3.x, a class is also an object. That is, we can treat a class as an object. We can manipulate and modify a class on the fly like the aforementioned examples:", "By treating the class itself as an object, we can change its type [3] Why is this possible? To be precise we can run a loop to see that our regular data types, even type itself is derived from type metaclass. We'll have an in-depth chapter on metaclasses. For now, a metaclass takes properties from other classes to generate a new class with additional functionalities.", "So, from the above examples, it is clear that classes and objects in Python are the same things under the hood. They are either a prototype or metaclass of type or objects of some other classes", "An old-style class used to be declared as class A() while a new style was class A(object) that \"inherits from the object, or from another new-style class.\" According to the documentation:", "\"Up to Python 2.1, old-style classes were the only flavour available to the user. The concept of (old-style) class is unrelated to the concept of type: if x is an instance of an old-style class, then x.__class__ designates the class of x, but type(x) is always <type 'instance'>.... This reflects the fact that all old-style instances, independently of their class, are implemented with a single built-in type, called instance.... The major motivation for introducing new-style classes is to provide a unified object model with a full meta-model.", "Python 3 has only a new-style class. Even if you write an \u2018old-style class\u2019, it is implicitly derived from object. New-style classes have some advanced features lacking in old-style classes, such as super, the new C3 mro, some magical methods, etc. Keep in mind that we are using Python 3.x throughout our articles.", "Guido has written The Inside Story on New-Style Classes, a really great article about new-style and old-style classes in Python.", "In the next part, we will discuss Class Life Cycle", "Your home for data science.
