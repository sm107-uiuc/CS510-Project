It\u2019s 10pm. The coffee machine is gurgling, announcing that a fresh pot has been brewed. There are still at least four hours of work left. You know this because you\u2019ve been here before; as has everyone else in the room.", "The data processing team had the results cleaned, weighted and calculated two weeks ago \u2014 a week after the survey was out of field, so why are we all nursing so-so filter coffee at 10pm?", "Well, the client has 20 departments and each one needs a separate PowerPoint deck with their own results; each deck has 30 slides and most slides have two charts. That\u2019s close to 1,000 charts manually created from the tables by copying and pasting the right data into the right slide in the right document.", "Finally, just as you\u2019re almost done and there\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel, with only the odd little bit of spot-checking left, that email arrives. That email that announces the client\u2019s epiphany: a newly defined age segmentation will capture their target audience in a more refined way, please run the tables and slides again. Is one of the junior researchers crying?", "It doesn\u2019t need to be that way. One of the big promises of Python, is its ability to automate the boring stuff (Al Sweigart\u2019s book is a great introduction to this concept). There is no real value, but a huge amount of risk in the manual copy/paste process. In this second instalment of Automating Survey Data Analysis with Open Source Software, we will show you how your team could have those 1,000 charts ready almost as soon as the fieldwork is finished, ending up with more than one thousand charts in almost two hundred PowerPoint files \u2014 in less than 10 minutes.", "To illustrate the workflow, we will be using The Stackoverflow 2019 developer survey, which looks at the tools and preferences of around 90,000 people who code. Our aim will be to create one PowerPoint slideshow for the technologies being used in each country represented in the survey. We will be using the Python libraries: pandas, python-pptx and Quantipy (a library specifically meant for survey data) along with Jupyter Notebooks.", "As with all our projects, we start with a standard directory layout (more on that \u2014 our standardised workflow \u2014 in a later post) where we store the original datafile (we always work on a copy so as to have a clean reference to go back to). After the initial library imports, we are interested in looking at a variable in the data called: LanguagesWorkedWith, which looks like this::", "Respondents could select more than one language they have experience working with. This means that instead of a single value in the data column, there is a list of values separated by a character (a delimited set). In the example above, the first respondent has experience of: HTML/CSS, Java, JavaScript and Python.", "After converting the survey data and schema CSV files into the Quantipy data and meta-data file formats, we can create a Quantipy dataset (a dataset is a Python object, specifically designed to work with survey data, that allows convenient access to the data for analysis and exploration).", "One of Quantipy\u2019s convenience functions, dataset.crosstab(), allows us to easily check the results for the different technologies the respondents say they have used.", "This looks good: JavaScript is the most popular in our data, the same as reported by Stackoverflow when they published the results. So, we\u2019ll continue.", "We\u2019ll start by looking at which variables are available to us: Since we\u2019ve decided to look at what technologies people use in different countries, we\u2019ll add the \u201chave worked with\u201d and \u201cdesired\u201d variables that relate to: languages, databases, platforms, web-frameworks and miscellaneous technologies.", "We also do another sanity check; calculate the percentages of responses coming from each country, and compare it to the published results. These match, so we continue.", "Now we loop through the countries and calculate the result for each variable in the variables array we defined above.", "Now that we\u2019ve calculated the data, we write the final loop that creates the PowerPoint document:", "The pptx template file should be an empty presentation, and the slide_layouts references what master slide will be used to insert the results. In this case we use an empty slide, but we can also use chart placeholders for better control.", "We\u2019ve put the above together into a notebook, published on Github, and when the notebook is run, we end up with 179 slide decks, one for each country. Each slide deck has ten slides, so that\u2019s 1,790 slides your team doesn\u2019t have to generate by hand.", "The beauty of running the above in a Jupyter Notebook is that it can become part of a pipeline. We\u2019ve already written about automating the data processing pipeline (preparing the data) by chaining together Jupyter Notebooks, and next up in the series will be automating the pipeline for the output. This will consist of creating a so-called \u201cchart specification\u201d, an Excel file that defines what slides should be generated. Once a proper chart spec is ready, it can be automatically run on a dataset each time a project is started.", "Automating and further abstracting the build of the above PowerPoint files will be the topic of our next post.", "Geir Freysson is co-founder of Datasmoothie, a platform that specialises in survey data analysis and visualisation.
