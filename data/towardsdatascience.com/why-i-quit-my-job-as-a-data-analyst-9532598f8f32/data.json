Lack of growth with data analytics, but growth and Machine Learning with Data Science."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "anchor_text": "https://datascience2.medium.com/subscribe", "paragraph_index": 20}], "all_paragraphs": ["I want to first mention that this is my personal experience, so take my points and advice with a grain of salt. My goal is to inspire you to look at what you do at your current job, and ask what you should be doing at a different job that could be better for you (or for the same job for that matter, along with its respective, possible improvements). In my situation, I was a Data Analyst for less than a year, so it is critical to point out that there are always different companies that could have different requirements and day-to-day experiences than mine. However, deep down, I knew I wanted something else, and something more for myself.", "Starting as a Data Analyst, I really enjoyed the unique blend of both technical and business, along with the soft skills required for my role. I got the chance to make some impact on some major parts of the business. But, something that I did not get the chance to do was approve or escalate my findings to upper management or leadership. You can spend days or months analyzing data only to find a Product Manager using some of your dashboards for a few minutes, even though you made sure to have it updated and refreshed daily with valuable metrics. So what was I not liking? I really wanted to have a bigger impact on the projects I was working on for my company. I wanted to be able to not only present findings, but I wanted to implement the respective change for those findings as well. I wanted to implement automated processes that would solve those problems found from the metrics pulled and findings discovered. I then noticed I was performing mainly ad-hoc tasks, or after-the-fact, but nothing else. I was always looking at the past and not into the future.", "Below, I will be expounding on the specific experiences that lead me to change my career, and what about the next, current career that I loved.", "An experience with lack of growth:", "As previously mentioned, you could probably tell I was struggling to grow in my role. Although somewhat short-lived, I could see how I would be set in the same day-to-day processes for years to come. What I was experiencing was a lack of growth in my role. To reiterate, yes, this experience may be vastly different for you, but it also might be exactly what you are feeling, too.", "At the beginning of my role, I loved creating Tableau dashboards, developing interesting insights, and visualizing them. A few stakeholders would request some key metrics or key performance indicators that would also need to be visualized. I usually used Tableau or Google Data Studio \u2014 sometimes using homemade Python code to developed charts and plots as well. The process started with the request and the resulting dashboard I created. The stakeholders then applauded how beautiful it looked, and thanked me for my metrics described. I notice a few days go by to the end of the week and I get a few looks at my dashboard, sometimes even hundreds. But then the next week comes, and I get, say, 20% of that first-week viewership. I could come off as selfish when thinking of metrics of my own metrics, but when I spend half of my life working (ish), I want to see a great impact and validation of that said work.", "A month goes by, and I already have four more dashboard requests, and that first dashboard I make is number 50 on the list of dashboards used by the company \u2014 one of the least used dashboards.", "I think to myself, I am doing the same thing over and over again. I am not sure who is being impacted, or what process was changed because of the visualized metrics that I gathered from a SQL query. All I see are powerful stakeholders and leadership collaborating in a meeting every now and then, and sometimes point out a nice graph I made in a different meeting. Now I know, maybe this implies that I just make poor dashboards, but the point is that I made what was requested and that I was not in the position to come up with new ideas, new results, and new processes. That was the lack of growth I felt.", "I also want to stress the focus on not only the professional setting, but the academic setting as well. When performing Data Analytics, I started to find a different field to practice, and eventually go to school for. I recommend looking at other paths when switching your career, whether that be any of the following:", "I eventually changed my career to Data Science. Yes, that sexy, perhaps the cliche career of the past few years. But, there is a reason why it is so alluring. Or, several reasons. I want you to know that you do not need to become a Data Scientist to find happiness, but to really evaluate your current career, and your day-to-day experiences, and perhaps question what would be a better alternative for you in the future. Furthermore, you could also stay in the same role, but discuss with your manager some possible changes that would really drive your passion and motivation.", "What I was lacking in Data Analytics, was found in Data Science. That is not to say I do not do any data analytics at work currently, because that is usually a prerequisite to most projects \u2014 what you start off first with, before creating and producing a Data Science model. But, I found that I could look at those insights, and suggest a better process, then make that said process, and integrate it into the current system. It is important to note that there are times though when you receive some daunting work that drives most of the business, and it can be all on your shoulders (ish). However, it is a great way to grow and challenge yourself, and there are always people to help you if you need it \u2014 which is expected. To make it a little easier to read, while summarizing, I am going to highlight some key points to what turned me off from Data Analytics, and what attracted me to Data Science.", "Data Analytics \u2014 lack of growth", "Going back to what I said previously in the Data Analytics section, I eventually switched my field while studying specifically Data Science in a master\u2019s degree program. While it is of course not necessary to perform this step when changing careers, I found it especially useful after studying a different field completely from my current job as a Data Analyst. I studied Biology, along with Chemistry for my undergraduate degree. Therefore, I really felt that I needed a more traditional path for studying Data Science.", "I recommend reading about the various options for learning and practicing a different career, whether that be school or cheaper, and even free online tutorials. I was able to study Data Science and Machine Learning after work, which also drove my passion for Data Science, while also leading me to quit my job as a Data Analyst at the time.", "My personal experiences were to inspire you and reflect on your current situation. I hope you learned some new information that is beneficial to you and finding your passion, whether that be Data Science or something totally different. A lot of these key points that led me to a different career can also be said about other career changes as well.", "It is important to note that Data Analytics is incredibly broad, so, depending on your position, you may be performing different tasks that are possibly more exciting and challenging. I was swept away by the Data Science craze, and I am glad I was, because it really made me more passionate about my job. A job that composes a lot of my day.", "Whereas I was performing similar tasks as a Data Analytics over the months, I got to learn, practice, and implement new learnings that I did even in my own free time, for my current Data Science career.", "To summarize, there are several reasons why I left Data Analytics for specifically, Data Science. Some key reasons that best summarize my experiences are:", "Thank you for reading! Feel free to comment and discuss down below. Perhaps you had a different experience, and maybe you are in a totally different career field and looking to switch.", "Your home for data science.
