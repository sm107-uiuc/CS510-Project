Here is the model performance when a margin of 0.5 is used.", "We can see that there has been virtually no change in the MAE or RMSE parameters through modifying the \u03f5 parameter.", "That said, we want to ensure that the SVM model is not overfitting. Specifically, if we find that the best fit is achieved when \u03f5 = 0, then this might be a sign that the model is overfitting.", "Here are the results when we set \u03f5 = 0.", "Given that we are not seeing higher accuracy when \u03f5 = 0, there does not seem to be any evidence that overfitting is an issue in our model \u2014 at least not from this standpoint.", "When using the same features, how does the SVM performance accuracy compare to that of a neural network?", "Consider the following neural network configuration:", "The model is trained across 30 epochs with a batch size of 150:", "The following MAE and RMSE are obtained on the test set:", "We observed that when \u03f5 was set to 1.5 for the SVM model, the MAE and RMSE came in at 29.5 and 44.6 respectively. In this regard, the SVM has matched the neural network in prediction accuracy on the test set.", "It is a common misconception that SVMs are only suitable for working with classification data.", "However, we have seen in this example that the SVM model has been quite effective at predicting ADR values for the neural network.", "Many thanks for reading, and any questions or feedback appreciated.", "The Jupyter Notebook and dataset for this example are available at the MGCodesandStats GitHub repository.
