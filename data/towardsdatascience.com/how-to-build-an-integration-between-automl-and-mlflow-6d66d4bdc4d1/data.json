We can automate various stages of the process like data preparation, feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter selection. In this tutorial, we will focus mainly on model selection.", "There are numerous benefits in using this approach such as:", "MLFlow is an open-source platform used to monitor and save machine learning models after training. The great thing about it is that it can integrate with other frameworks such as H2O or Spark building a uniform and easy to use environment.", "Now let\u2019s dive into the steps to use AutoML in practice.", "TL;DR: The code is stored in Github.", "To get the environment ready we need to install the new dependencies found in the folder of the project:", "Also we need to start the MLFlow server by typing in the terminal:", "Now we should be able to visualise all the experiments (training steps) we run. We can also start the Jupyter lab notebook which is the environment where we write our code:", "H2O is a distributed framework and in order to use it locally we need to start a server. This might take a minute or so, depending on your setup:", "MLFlow uses the concept of experiments to track the progress of a machine learning model.", "If the experiment is already created, we just reuse it.", "We have reached the most interesting part, using auto ml to do the training. Multiple models are trained in parallel and validated (6 fold cross-validation) using an independent subset of the data. Every new training run will save some validation metrics and the model that has performed the best (leader).", "We have decided to run 10 models. Using the get_leaderboard function we get to see what machine learning algorithms have run:", "And the training is recorded in MLFlow, and we can compare it with future experiments:", "The last step is to actually do the prediction with the newly elected leader. For the purpose of this tutorial we will just use the validation data, but in practice we need to use new data.", "Again we use MLFlow to read the latest run in the experiment and load the GLM model. If we never run the training we can throw an exception to notify the user that he has to do that first.", "We\u2019ve seen how in a few simple steps we can have an automated process for model selection, tracking and loading/saving the best machine learning model for a given set of data. Although on competitions like Kaggle we can see that humans are still easily beating AutoML frameworks, we can still use them as another tool in our data science kit, to boost and improve our performance.", "Your home for data science.
