You read all of the Medium articles on how to learn SQL, Python, R, etc. The dos and don\u2019ts of the data analytics world, and now you\u2019ve landed your first data analytics job.", "That\u2019s a great accomplishment brought on through a lot of hard work and patience, but now you\u2019ll need to utilize a different set of skills to ramp up and make the most of this new opportunity and get over the impostor syndrome we all feel when entering a new and unknown space.", "Here are the four quick tips on ramping up at your new job.", "I felt very lucky when I started my first data analyst job because instead of throwing me in the deep end without my pool floaties, my boss set my first task to set-up meetings with key people within the company. This got me in contact with all the right people at the get-go. If I had the simplest questions on how to connect to a particular data source, or what\u2019s the best way to join two tables, I already had a starting point.", "If your boss hasn\u2019t given you the assignment to connect with certain people, ask them which people you should connect with on your very first day. If you need to be more explicit, ask for the following type of people:", "Networking with these individuals will help you cover your basis to a lot of questions you may have when starting a new job. Everything from best practices, system permissions and set-up, and how to further connect with others who can help.", "When I start these meetings, I keep them short, 30 mins tops. I first start by providing a quick introduction, when I started, and what my role consists of, and then I ask them to share their role and how you can help them with the job that they do. This creates a mutual understanding that although you are new, you are willing to help and share information where possible. This goes a long way in building strong relationships in the workplace.", "By customers, I don\u2019t mean the people your company sells to. Your customer is anyone who you have to deliver a product or service to. Monthly KPI reports to the VP? The VP is your customer.", "Knowing your customer is crucial in any job. Your success is determined by how well you deliver your product to your customer.", "Your customer could be your boss, and it could also be someone from another department. For example, I have to calculate our teams spend and submit it to accounting at the start of every month for them to calculate their accruals. Therefore, I see them and treat them as my customer. I make sure to understand what they want, how they want it, and when. I do what I can to keep my customer happy.", "It\u2019s important to identify and connect with your customers early on. In the beginning, it may not seem obvious that you have other customers outside of your team, but due to your access and proximity to data, you\u2019ll end up with some ancillary tasks which you\u2019ll have to support. It\u2019s best to get ahead and recognize these customers and tasks so that when you plan your workload you factor in the time associated with delivering to all of your customers.", "Knowing how to access and interpret data is the first step of a data analyst. Making full use of the data you have to understand the industry and what makes it move is your next step. Yes, your manager and team will help you get up to speed in understanding what the company is about, their revenue model, etc. It\u2019s up to you to dig deeper to find out the industry standards used, what are the market factors that can affect your industry, laws and regulations that govern your companies activities.", "A great first step, if you\u2019re working for a public company, is to go through the companies annual and quarterly filings, also known as the 10-K and 10-Q respectively. Here\u2019s an example of Google\u2019s 2019 10-K. Do you need to read it word for word? No, but you should read most of part one to get a better understanding of your companies goals and risks, and reading the financials will give you a good idea of the metrics deemed important for your industry.", "If your company is not public, try to find a related company that has gone public. For example, Squarespace isn\u2019t a public company, but their competitor Wix is. You can look at Wix\u2019s 10-K to get an idea of what metrics are important to the industry.", "Learning this information is vital for how you perform your analytics and how you present your findings. It\u2019s an immense value add if you can tie your findings in a way that really takes your company, industry, and market into consideration.", "I landed my first data analyst job by learning SQL and gaining experience with whatever small SQL related work I could find. Landing this job was a giant first step, but there are many more steps to take. If you want to grow as a data analyst then you need to set a road map on what to learn next, and how to apply what you have learned. For the best results take a few months on the job and take notes on how things can be improved. Is there reporting that can be automated? Are there requests that you get often which can be turned into a self-service dashboard? Can all of your data sources be verified for completeness and accuracy if someone comes to ask you to prove your work? See what\u2019s relevant to your job right now, and then based on that make a learning plan to help cover those needs or nice-to-haves.", "Your work doesn\u2019t end with your day-to-day, you need to continue to learn, apply, and grow to get past the feelings of impostor syndrome. If SQL is the only thing you\u2019ve learned so far, here are some ideas of subjects to tackle next:", "Here\u2019s the Udacity course that I\u2019m currently taking to further my knowledge and skill-set in data analysis and to further build on my existing skill-set (the link below is an affiliate link and I may be compensated if you enroll in a class):", "The first step is always the hardest, and now you\u2019ve made it over your first hill. You have the knowledge and experience to go further and you have nothing to hold you back. Keep learning and keep growing. I wish you the best!", "If you found this article helpful and are looking for more advice similar to this then consider signing up for my monthly newsletter here.", "Your home for data science.
