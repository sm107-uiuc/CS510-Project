Can all of the data we collect be used to better understand ourselves and maybe even just help us be better too?", "Before jumping into the analysis, here are three \u201cteaser\u201d data visualizations and questions that data helped me notice and answer from the last year:", "The majority of my manually logged time went to personal projects in 2018, which is great. I still maintained decent client, freelance income, but my focus remains on own stuff and businesses. . If these are your goals, this is where your time should go. But happened in June and August? Both months saw a decent time log drop. Both months had me speaking and attending more conferences as well as more travel, including a week long trip with friends to Tibet and around Sichuan. My sleep tells another story though too.", "I slept on average 7.23 hr per night in 2018, but what happened starting in mid-June? Why did my sleep average drop? World Cup! Like many I stayed up later and drank a bit beer more as I enjoyed an epic month of football action. Ironically other areas also dropped too. I wrote less and had less workouts. See below for the specific charts.", "I had a relatively consistent year of running in 2018, until the last quarter of the year? What happened? Suddenly my run training load dipped signficantly. This was due to a series of minor to a bit more major injuries, and I couldn\u2019t train. What was the cause? Below I examine a series of other tracked data points and currently my working hypothesis is one contributing factor was a decrease in both mobility/stretching and strength training.", "These are three data visualizations I created using simple but regular self-tracking and data collection data visualization using QS Ledger. If you are interested in creating similar charts or becoming more data-driven in the year ahead, signup for my newsletter to receive early access to my course, Google Data Studio for Quantified Self and the Data-Driven Life in early 2019.", "Annual reviews are a staple of goal-directed people, and it\u2019s something I like to do myself. But in view of my central thesis that data can be used to improve human lives, I like to go a bit beyond just nostalgic reflection or hopeful and strategic aspiration. I like to fuel my year in review with data.", "Let me tease out my core belief briefly here: We have now enough cheap technology, sensors, small computers (i.e. phones and wearables) and cloud storage to enable both tracking a lot of areas and storing a huge amount of data on a life. This activity is often grouped under monikers like quantified self, self-tracking, personal informatics, or the data-driven life.", "Basically, it\u2019s people collecting data on a life and trying to use it. Quite simply, I can and should use data and self-tracking so our lives can be better understood and improved. This is data-driven personal development 101.", "So, it\u2019s with those goals and hopes in mind, I\u2019m happy to share the latest edition of my year in data!", "This year\u2019s report includes a look at how I wrote, my computer usage time and project time, my trends in tasks completed, books and articles read, my fitness efforts, and a bit of my photos taken on my phone. For health, I place an emphasis on running but also have some general health and wellness data on sleep and HRV too. Obviously there is a ton of data one might use to slice and dice and tell your year in review story. I choose these since they matter to me and are relatively accessible to anyone to track.", "One bonus this year is that, unlike last year\u2019s year in data, I\u2019m also open sourcing and sharing all of the code I used to create these graphics. So for anyone with a few technical skills and some time, you too can build your own data-driven year in review. Moreover with a few tweaks you can change the look and feel or make additional observations and analysis too. You can find the code at QS Ledger, and I\u2019ve shared a few of the specifics on how to do this at the end of the post.", "Hopefully by the end of the next year, I\u2019ll have a web or mobile app to make it even easier for anyone to do and even create a full-on book about your year\u2026 using data.", "Let\u2019s take a look at the story of my year in data!", "(NOTE: While outside of the scope here, I have also done some work on a deeper statistical analysis and machine learning approach to using this data. For now I\u2019ll have to leave that topic for a future write-up. )", "(NOTE: This section goes a bit deep into the details, so feel free to skip below to get directly into the analysis and data viz!)", "First things first, it\u2019s probably worth telling you a bit about what I track and why I track all of this stuff.", "One of my core belief is that data and tracking can help us better understand our selves and empower self-improvement. I don\u2019t just track because I find it an amusing hobby. I track my life in order to better understand myself and, in turn, make improvements and personal optimizations. Tracking started as a somewhat skeptical questioning of where my time was going and expanded into other areas to understand how activities in a life affect one another.", "What did I track in 2018? I didn\u2019t make too many explicit tracking changes in 2018, compared to what I tracked in 2017, besides changing how I track habits (I now use Habitica) and how I measure my device screentime (I use Apple\u2019s Screentime). That said, I do track my fair share of things and will continue to do so.", "If you are looking for ideas on things you might track, check out my post: What should you be tracking in 2019? where I go into a two-step process of what to track and how to enage with your data towards your goals.", "Unlike 2017, my main focus in 2018 was not on the how-to of tracking but on data engagement. My objective was to make data useful and meaningful. I stopped using Tableau, which was the primary data tool I used for my analysis and charts in my 2017 Year in Data blog post. Tableau is quite expensive and being a drag and drop tool means that it\u2019s not as easy to reproduce data visualization like you do in code. It also means it\u2019s not extensible to creating a future web tool or shareable scripts.", "With this year focused on data science with Python, I have transitioned to using Pandas and Matplotlib to do most of my data analysis work, including this year\u2019s data review. It\u2019s not pixel perfect yet, but I\u2019m quite content with the results. On the day-to-day and week-to-week, I use a combination of IFTTT, Google Sheets and Google Data Studio to power my personal data dashboards.", "Practically-speaking, this change to Python Data Visualization translated into spending a good amount of my time on learning Python and writing code for data collection, data visualization and even some machine learning. this was my first time using Python in many years, and I\u2019m really happy with the language and tools available. I shared my learnings and process across several speeches at PyCons around the region. You can find the latest version at: How to Become a Data-Driven You: From Data Collection and Data Processing to Data Analysis and Data Visualization to Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python.", "Additionally, the underlying code has all been open sourced and is available on Github at QS Ledger. In fact, nearly everything in this post can be reproduced using your own data and that code. The only real work I did, besides the data analysis in code, was assembling the charts into a single image and adding a few styles with Photoshop.", "To recap, in 2018, I tracked my steps, HR and sleep on the Apple Watch, runs with Strava, strength workouts with Fitbod app, photos taken with PhotoStats.io, books read with Goodreads, articles read with Pocket/Instapaper, tasks with Todoist, Heart Rate Variability with HRV4Training, Podcast listening with PodcastTracker.com, project time with Toggl, and Computer Time with RescueTime. These are all the areas in which I have longitudinal data across the entire year.", "Additionally, I have some periodic check-in data for blood pressure and weight, and I did a few other short tracking experiments, including glucose monitoring and a rather amusing poop tracking experiment.", "Spanning health, productivity, creativity, time and a few other areas, these charts are my attempt to tell a data story. 2018 was a year where I went beyond self-tracking and data accumulation and I started to become more conscious about using and engaging with my data towards an end in mind, namely building a world where data can improve lives. Now my goal is to help people learn about possibilities of using tracking data to reach their goals and bring more accessibility to personal data analysis too.", "So inspired by all the data I collected, analyzed, visualized and built on, here is my year in data!", "Before jumping into my specific data visualizations, let\u2019s quickly look at my last weekly review of 2018. Here is what my productivity dashboard looks like:", "Here are my health and fitness stats:", "I\u2019m happy to say I closed out 2018 with some good exercise and a bit of a break. Globally, you can see some of the trends in sleep and exercise. My sleep had some big dips in weekly 27 to 29. What happened there? My running peaked early in 2018, but I didn\u2019t quite manage to keep that trend in the second half. I see similar trends in mobility and strength training. My productive time saw generally positive trends but with some interesting dips during the year.", "These personal data dashboards and reports were created using a combination of Google Forms, Google Sheets and Google Data Studio. You can signup for my newsletter to get first access to my course Google Data Studio for Quantified Self and the Data-Driven Life in early 2019.", "Let\u2019s look at breakdown of this tracking data below.", "I\u2019ve been tracking both my computer time and my manually logged project time for a number of year. This presents an interesting opportunityt to explore various changes in where my time goes in a year.", "Overall, here is what my last year looked like:", "My Biggest General Takeaway about My Time: I spent 25% of my total time on my computer and a bit under that amount than on project time. This ratio of project time vs. computer time remains a clear measurement of my productive efforts. 25% of a day, week or year on the computer seems like a good number, and I don\u2019t really think I can make greater efforts in 2019. I can get more effective and balanced in some ways. For example, I\u2019d like to be a bit more consistent around client work such that I have less clustering and more regular output. Moreover, I deserve to get paid so I need to think and drive my efforts to renumeration in the year to come. Basically I\u2019ve created a series of side project over the last 2 years, so I plan to true targeting campaigns and efforts to generate revenue. Globally though, if I follow my general time management and time allotment to similar effect in the year to come big things will eventually happen. Push that boulder!", "I ran two marathons and two half marathons in 2018 and did my fair share of fun runs and training along the way too. I\u2019m a fan of running and find having this kind of regular exercise has had very positive impact on my creativity and life satisfaction. I\u2019m still trying to get more consistent in my strength training and mobility/stretching. Here is what my year in fitness looked like:", "One of the most startling realizations from looking at this data and comparing it with 2017 was the sharp decrease in mobility training time. I did not do anywhere near as much post-workout recovery (roughly 40% decrease in mobility time from 2017 to 2018). This has lead me to wonder if this lack of stretching and recovery was a factor in why I had more injuries and poorer performance in 2018.", "For now, I\u2019m going to assume it was and will aim to increase my mobility work towards 2017\u2019s levels. I hope this alleviates my aches and pains and provides a stronger foundation for running well in the year ahead. I should be able to tease out an effect in the coming months.", "My strength training dipped in the second half of the year. I want to get a bit stronger and more muscular in the year ahead so strength training will be key pursuit and hopefully I can tease out more of my progress (or lack of) from data too. Consistency is king.", "I remain a huge fan of Todoist. Todoist is an excellent task manager in the spirit of GTD and provide great data accessibility which makes it one of the best task trackers too.", "Once I again I checked off a lot of tasks in 2018. I didn\u2019t note it in this data analysis, but I\u2019ve started to focus more on higher priority tasks over just checking off a bunch of medium importance stuff. Overall, a very consistent output in 2018 as we can see in the data:", "While the main heat map shows a year of fairly consistent task completion, the bottom half of this visualization allows me to notice patterns and certain periods of increased activity on certain projects.", "For example, for productivity tasks, we see a consistent pale purpose across nearly nearly every Sunday of the year. This is when I check off a tasks or two doing my weekly review and set my goals. Similarly my coding studies is often scheduled and completed on Saturdays, and the heatmap reveals this trend as well with some notable density in more tasks going on then. It would be interesting to find a way to visualize project tasks in better way so we see them in differ day of week quadrants.", "In contrast, I see several projects with periodic clustering. This is true for Data-Driven You (an online course and book project), Language Learning while I attempted to learn some Thai in April, and a scattering of Travel tasks leading up and during certain trips.", "Overall, I\u2019m happy with the tasks I\u2019m getting done and will continue to push myself towards my goals. In the future, I hope to be able to better connect my tasks with my goals, which I\u2019m attempting to track as well now in a consistent manner.", "2018 was a year I really embraced writing as a professional pursuit. I published 26 blog posts, prepared dozen or so lesson articles for a course I\u2019m creating, and I have a work-in-progress manuscript. Writing is a habit for me, and I still do a lot of writing as a form of learning and research, but it is slowly coming together towards actual publishable manuscripts.", "My writing behavior deserves better data analysis, but for now, here are a collection of data visualizations based on WordCounter, a Mac tool I use to count how many words I type each hour in a selected set of writing apps:", "A few obvious takeaways on my writings:", "Since I getting healthier, losing weight and become more physically active, I\u2019ve discovered a lot about myself and being human. While I could have placed this at the beginning, I placed this visualization at the end since it offers an interesting way to view the other aspects of the year in relation to these trends.", "My Biggest General Takeaway about My Health: I didn\u2019t have time for a true statistical data analysis just yet, but these health visualizations do hint at some degree of connections and correlations between a slightly negative trend in my health and the effects in various areas of my life see in the other charts. For example, one might ask: did my dip in sleep and increase in drinking affect my fitness performance, creativity, and learning? Did doing less stretching and mobility impact other areas? How did getting up at a certain time affect a day or the day after? These are all questions I hope to explore in the future, both for myself and others.", "For now my main actionable item is structure more time for sleep and stretching add some meditation too. Basically, don\u2019t just plan for the projects and goals but include relaxation items too.", "In turn, I am overdue for some some blood biomarker testing to see if there are some nutritional or other imbalances I can work on. I have an open source database on the most common and useful blood biomarkers, if you would like more info or know what tests to get.", "For full details and infographic on what I read and when as well as my personal favorite books and articles, see: 2018: Year in Reading.", "The photos we take can also tell a story about our lives. This is the motivation behind why I built PhotoStats.io, a mobile app for Apple and Android that lets you locally count and parse out your photo-taking life. Along with helping you track your photo history and tag the images, the app provides some simple charts and graphs. The AI-powered auto-tagging feature can also help you classify and understand what\u2019s in your photos.", "So, what did my year in photos look like?", "My photo data reveals a few interesting things. It shows that I take most photos on the weekend. I take a lot of photos of animals (dogs and cats) as well as plenty of nature photos too. The map I created using the PhotoStats.io export and MapBox map designer tool shows a clear view of where I went this past year, including trips to Laos, a Sichuan road trip and marathon in Xichang, conference in Malaysia, and a trek around Tibet. I can also see my main hubs last year in Singapore, Bangkok and Qingchengshan, near Chengdu.", "Like a lot of people, 2018 saw me stepping away from most social media. Facebook and Instagram has too much \u201cperformance\u201d art and life, rather than authentic living, and it can turn into both a negative for me in terms of time and enjoyment of the life shining brightly in front of me. That said, I did end up sharing about 35 photos on Instagram in 2018, mostly early in the year and when I had some Europe friends visiting.", "Overall, I find photo data remains a very interesting way to understand a life, and I plan to continue maintaining and adding features to PhotoStats.io app. If you are interested, you can checkout the app at www.photostats.io. Assuming you have most of your photos from recent months, it should do a good job giving you some general trends.", "Ok. That\u2019s a lot of data and data visualization for a single year. Overall, 2018 was another good year for me. I stayed healthy and worked on things that mattered to me. I made some financial progress and worked on my big vision goal, namely creating a world where data can help improve and augment our lives.", "Obviously, this kind of year may not be always the case, and a future year might see much worse trends in my life and in my data. I might get sick, injured or depressed. Life happens. I remain committed to trying to tell my tale each year in data, an authentic and personal one, whether that life is a good one or not.", "Going forward I hope to make this kind of tracking and data analysis more and more accessible and understandable to everyone. I\u2019m current creating a course on an online course on Google Data Studio for Quantified Self (planning to release in early 2018) and a longer course on How to Track a Life. I\u2019m also making solid progress on QS Ledger, the main code that powered all of the reports this year.", "If you are excited about the possibilities of using data for empowering our world and our lives, join my newsletter or hit me up with a comment, email or social share. The more people bugging me and joining me will definitely push me to do more work in these areas in the year ahead!", "I hope you enjoyed this post and found it interesting and inspiring.", "Best of luck and happy tracking in the year ahead!", "All of the data visualizations for my year in review in data were created using QS Ledger, a python data science project focused on data collection and data visualization of your personal tracking data. They were then assembled using Photoshop.", "The one exception were the maps. Those were created using MapBox Map Designer and an export of the underlying data into a CSV with the Longitude and Latitude. It\u2019s a pretty simple process using MapBox\u2019s online dataset and mapping tools.", "In this section, I want to briefly go through how you can create your year in data using QS Ledger.", "PS \u2014 If you are interested in the backstory and data science involved in QS Ledger and using Python for Self-Tracking, check out my detailed slides at How to Become a Data-Driven You: From Data Collection and Data Processing to Data Analysis and Data Visualization to Machine Learning and Deep Learning with Python.", "In order to follow along, you are going to need to have been tracking one of the data points integrated with QS Ledger. The project currently integrates nearly 20 different tracking services, like Strava, Fitbit, Oura, RescueTime, Todoist and many others.", "Install Anaconda and download code and notebooks", "To get started, I recommend downloading and using the Anaconda Distribution.

First we will collect our data from the API and then run some data analysis code.", "While the details might different slightly from service to service, the essential aspects are basically the same: collect data before running (and/or tweaking) the data analysis.", "RescueTime is one of my favorite tracking services. It allows you to track your computer usage time in incredible detail.", "In of Jupyer Notebook, navigate the file directory and open up rescuetime_downloader.ipynb in the rescuetime directory. If you like, you can look at the code online at: https://github.com/markwk/qs_ledger/blob/master/rescuetime/rescuetime_downloader.ipynb.", "Inside of that notebook, you\u2019ll see multiple steps to getting RescueTime setup for collecting your data. Follow those steps with your own authorization keys.", "Once you are done ,run all of the cells to start collecting your data. This might take several minutes depending how long you have been using RescueTime.", "The end result should be a few exported csv files, and you should be ready to do some data analysis!", "Now it\u2019s time to open up rescuetime_data_analysis.ipynb and run the data analysis.", "The first part of this notebook provides some general data analysis of your time spent on your computer, including a breakdown of your top categories and apps, a monthly breakdown of productive vs. distracting time, and a few other reports. I recommend walking through this first part one by one to get a general idea of your data.", "The second half of that data analysis allows you to set a target year and then view your year analysis. By default it\u2019s set to the current year, but you can adjust that to view a comparison with a previous year. Once again we see a breakdown by top apps and months. Additionally there is a heatmap that allows you to view which days of the year were most productive or had the most computer time for you. Finally there is an hourly chart showing which hours of the day you were most productive.", "Here is a heatmap of my daily productive time:", "While admittedly the code does need some cleanup in the year ahead, most of the code is pretty well-documented and explicit in what it is doing, so you should be able to tweak and adjust to view different aspects of your time data. If you have any issues, drop a note in the issue queue on github.com.", "Next Steps: Data Collection and Data Analysis of other services.", "Now that we\u2019ve looked at an example of data collection and data analysis using RescueTime, you can continue to collect and generate data reports for your other tracking services. This includes data on workouts, sleep, tasks completed and many more.", "I highly recommend comparing different tracking data side by side using the same visualizations to see if you can notice any possible trends or connections.", "Moreover, there is an example notebook showing how to combine multiple data sources into a single data frame.
