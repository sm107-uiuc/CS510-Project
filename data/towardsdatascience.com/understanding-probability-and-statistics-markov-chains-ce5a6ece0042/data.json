This article will explain the fundamental concept of Markov process in an easy to understand manner.", "Markov chains are used throughout the finance, automobile, food, gaming industry and are experienced nearly everywhere in everyday life. Hence it\u2019s a must-know topic for all statisticians.", "Weather, gambling, stock price, human behaviour are all Markov processes amongst many others.", "This article will aim to explain the following key topics:", "Let\u2019s consider that an object moves in a random manner. This object could be a football, a chess player making his/her next move, exchange rates, stock price, car movement, the position of a customer in a queue, a person moving on the road, players on a football field, etc.", "These objects move in a random manner. Therefore, we can conclude that the objects are stochastic in nature. These objects essentially represent an entire system. It\u2019s interesting to note that all of these systems can have a Markov property.", "If an object moves in a random fashion and its movements are memoryless then that object has a Markov property.", "As an instance, let\u2019s consider that our target object is a football being kicked around by a group of football players. The football can be in any state next. As an instance, it can move right or left. If our target object is a share price of a company then it can get any numerical value next such as 0.999, 1, 2, 3, etc. Now, we stated above that the Markov property is memoryless. It implies that the future movement of the object depends only on its present state. And that is the most important concept to understand.", "This brings us to the concept of Markov chains.", "Let\u2019s consider that an object moves in a random manner. Therefore the state of the object (or system) can change. This change is known as the transition and each transition has a probability associated with other transitions.", "Consequently, this mathematical system can transition from one state to another and that transition is based on a probability.", "This system is an example random process. Let\u2019s assume that it can be in state A or B. Let\u2019s also consider that when the object is in state A then there is a 40% chance that it will remain in the state A and 60% chance that it will be transitioned into state B\u00a0as\u00a0demonstrated\u00a0below:", "The key to note is that the process has a Markov property, which implies that it is memoryless. As a result, the probability of future transitions is not dependent on the past states. They only depend on the current state. This is the reason why we consider it to be memoryless.", "A Markov chain is a random process that has a Markov property", "A Markov chain presents the random motion of the object. It is a sequence Xn of random variables where each random variable has a transition probability associated with it. Each sequence also has an initial probability distribution \u03c0.", "Consider an object that can be in one of the three states {A, B, C}. Subsequently, this object started at state A and can go to another state B or to state C and so on. All of the states, A, B, C, etc are in the state space (a set of all possible states).", "This brings us to the two main components of a Markov chain:", "The state space is the set of all possible states (places) that a random system can be in.", "The point to note is that S is the state space that is a set of all possible states that the object can be in.", "The second component is the transition probabilities. The transition probabilities are a table of probabilities. Each entry i, j in the table informs us about the probability of an object transitioning from state i to state j.", "Therefore, there will be a probability associated with all of the states which need to be equal or greater than 0. Plus, the sum of probability values needs to be 1.", "If you want to understand the basics of a probability distribution then read this article that explains the subject of probability from the basics. I highly recommend it to every data scientist:", "The transition probability informs us about the possible next state that the object can be in along with its associated probability. Hence, the next move of the object is dependent on its current value only.", "Let\u2019s consider we have a transition probability\u00a0matrix:", "The table above shows that if our target object is in the Up state then there is a 60% chance that it will transition to the Down state and 40% chance that it will remain in the Up state. Furthermore, if the target object is in the Down state then there is a 60% chance that it will transition to the Up state and 40% chance that it will remain in the Down state.", "The key to note is that the knowledge of the present state is only required to determine the probability distribution of the future state. Any other historic information is meaningless.", "This section will explain the concept of Markov Chains using an easy to understand example.", "Let\u2019s consider that we attempt to forecast the ratings of a list of counterparties. Each counterparty has a current rating. For example, a counterparty Alpha can have a rating A or B or C. Therefore, {A, B, C} are the states in the state space.", "We have been given a transition probability matrix. This matrix is also known as the stochastic matrix. The transition probability matrix informs us about the probability of the counterparty transitioning to another rating.", "Counterparty Ratings State Space = {A, B, C}", "It\u2019s important to note that the sum of the probabilities row or column-wise is 1.", "Therefore, if a counterparty has a rating A then there is a 30% chance that it will be transitioned to the rating C and 50% chance that it will transition itself to the rating B whereas it has a 20% chance of staying at the rating A.", "The random process also has a probability distribution which I will explain shortly.", "This brings us to the important theorem:", "If a Markov chain is {Xn} and has a state space S, with transition probabilities {pij}, its initial probability distribution as {\u00b5\u1d62} then for any i that is an element of S, we get:", "Therefore let\u2019s also consider that the present probability distribution of a counterparty is\u00a0as\u00a0follows:", "The probability distribution of a Markov chain can be represented as a row vector \u03c0 as\u00a0shown\u00a0below:", "The probability distribution adds up to 1.", "With this information, we can start understanding the process better. As we progress with time, we can start estimating the probability for the object to be in a particular state. As an instance, for a counterparty to be in rating C next, we can sum the product of the present probability distribution and transition probabilities for all of the states:", "It informed us that about 31% of the time, this counterparty will have the rating C after one step. Once we have this information, we can start forecasting an object that moves in a random manner with higher confidence.", "This brings us to the stability of a random variable. This is the last important section of this article. This section will introduce the topic of stationary distributions of Markov chains.", "Let\u2019s consider that our target random process is required to be estimated and we want to understand the stability of the random process.", "We understood that a Markov chain has a probability distribution. The word stationary implies that the subject is constant\u00a0and\u00a0we\u00a0know\u00a0that\u00a0our\u00a0random\u00a0object\u00a0can\u00a0move\u00a0to\u00a0any\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0possible\u00a0states. The subject in this instance is the probability distribution of the random process\u00a0and\u00a0not\u00a0the\u00a0random\u00a0object\u00a0itself.", "Therefore, if a statistical distribution of a Markov chain is stationary then it means that the distribution does not change as the time progresses.", "As a result, if a transition matrix is P and probability distribution is \u03c0 then the stationary distribution of a Markov chain is the one where \u03c0 = \u03c0 * P", "It is important to understand the convergence and the central limit theorem. Every data scientist must know these concepts. This link explains it in a simplified manner:", "This is a very important concept to understand. It informs us that regardless of where the system with stationary probability distribution was at the start, over time, the amount of time the system spends in a state is going to be as approximated by its probability distribution.", "Furthermore, the chain will always have the same probabilities which it started with.", "Subsequently, if {X\u2099} is a Markov chain and it has a stationary distribution {\u03c0\u1d62} then if P(X\u2099=i)=\u03c0\u1d62 for all i then P(X\u2098=i)=\u03c0\u1d62 for all i, as long as m > n.", "This information can help us in forecasting a random process.", "This article explained the following key topics:", "Your home for data science.
