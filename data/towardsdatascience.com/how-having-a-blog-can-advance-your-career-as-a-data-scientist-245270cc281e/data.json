I know it was for me \u2014 sharing thoughts and opinions on subjects where there are more experienced people than me. Nevertheless, even as a beginner to intermediate data scientist (or software engineer), having a blog can kickstart your career.", "I started blogging in August of 2019, roughly 4 months after starting my first job as a data scientist. That might sound strange at first because there are a ton of people out there with more experience not blogging about what they do. And I can\u2019t reason why.", "Maybe it\u2019s a lack of time, but it probably isn\u2019t \u2014 as publishing 2 articles per week takes around 4\u20138 hours for me \u2014 depending on the amount of code I need to prepare. Lack of will and motivation is a more likely scenario \u2014 mostly because people aren\u2019t aware of the benefits of blogging.", "Blogging as a side hustle has multiple benefits \u2014 and that will be the topic of today\u2019s article. These benefits come from a single guy perspective, sure, but are easily transferable. The only problem is \u2014 blogging requires action and being able to work many hours before seeing results \u2014 something not everyone is willing to do. I\u2019m sure you don\u2019t fit into this category.", "So without much ado, let\u2019s get started with the benefit number one.", "Blogging is a massive reputation builder. I\u2019m still a college student, and I had college professors come up to me and compliment my writing. And if anything \u2014 writing skills only improve with time. Getting positive feedback by someone you admire keeps the motivation levels up.", "Another group of people you want to read your content are potential employers. There are two ways they can find you:", "The first option is slightly better because they can see your progress over time. If you know your sh*t, chances are potential employers will agree with your views and opinions, making you that much easier person to hire.", "From that point, job interviews should become a formality. You can\u2019t expect this to happen if you have 3 posts to your name, sure, but you need to start somewhere. Start small, but more importantly \u2014 start today.", "Having a blog also benefits you as a freelance data scientist \u2014 as it provides proof of expertise in some domain, and that\u2019s not something an average freelancer has. As a result, you could either get more work or charge more \u2014 or both.", "To summarize \u2014 everyone wants to be a data scientist. For that reason, you need to somehow stand out from the crowd. Everybody knows Pandas and Scikit-Learn, but being the guy who can teach those will work wonders for you.", "Data science and other tech professions are full of advanced and not-so-easy-to-understand topics. Let me show you an example.", "A week or so ago I was interested in treating time series as a supervised task with Python. Doing so would allow me to use algorithms like eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). The only problem is \u2014 absolutely no one online can demonstrate how to make predictions for new, unseen data! Guides go only as far as telling you how to forecast on the test set \u2014 and that doesn\u2019t make the cut.", "So I decided to write my own class for the task \u2014 XGBTimeSeries \u2014 based on XGBRegressor and able to handle hourly, daily, monthly, and yearly time series data, for now. It also creates different variables \u2014 like is it a weekend, did the value occur in the work hours, and many others \u2014 based only on the frequency.", "And yeah, I intend to write about it \u2014 a lot. As it was not the most straightforward thing to do, and the model class is around 400 lines of code, I doubt it will fit into a single article. The more realistic scenario is that I will make a mini-course out of it. Let me know if you\u2019d be interested in something like that.", "Anyway, I digressed here a little, but I hope you get the point. Here\u2019s a quote I like particularly:", "\u201cIf you can\u2019t explain it simply, you don\u2019t understand it well enough.\u201d \u2014 Albert Einstein", "The quote applies to blogging, as it forces you to see things as simple as they were intended to be. There\u2019s no point in writing about something you don\u2019t understand because it would confuse both you and the reader.", "Make sure you understand the damn thing first and then try to explain it like your reader is a 5-year-old.", "Finally, let\u2019s talk about money. No one can tell you exactly how much you can earn, but after roughly 10 months I make anywhere between $1.5K to $3K a month \u2014 affiliate marketing included. Most importantly, blogging enables me to have options. Let me elaborate.", "If you\u2019re only working 9\u20135 you depend on that job. What would happen if you stopped working tomorrow? Blogging provides you options because you can have multiple streams of income if you become good enough at it \u2014 thus not being dependent on your daily job entirely.", "And that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Blogging about what you do creates a personal brand around you. This won\u2019t happen in a month, sure, but give it a couple of years. I\u2019m not quite there yet, but I\u2019m already seeing the impact of a personal brand in my everyday life.", "\u201cI write good articles, so readers should come to me\u201d \u2014 is a bad attitude to have. Also, that\u2019s not how things work. As a personal brand owner, you\u2019re responsible for getting readers to your blog. That\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing recently over at Better Data Science, and it\u2019s not the easiest thing in the world.", "Hosting your content enables you to control it just the way you want, publish your products, and promote affiliate products \u2014 all of which can result in substantial income in the long run.", "Also, the \u201cI don\u2019t know what to write about\u201d thing comes up a lot. It surprises me because data science evolves daily, and new things come up all the time. There are a lot of things to write about, and the list of topics will just get larger with time.", "To recap \u2014 starting a blog as soon as possible will kickstart your career \u2014 as long as your ideas aren\u2019t completely wrong. But I trust you know what you\u2019re talking about.", "There are amazing free places to start, like Blogger or Medium \u2014 with the latter having an in-built audience, which reduces the marketing efforts. You just have to write good quality content consistently and make it appealing to the readers. There are a lot of ways to expand this, but you should always start simple \u2014 otherwise, it\u2019s to easy to burn out.", "What are your thoughts? How did having a blog affect your career? Feel free to leave your thoughts in the comment section. Thanks for reading.", "Loved the article? Become a Medium member to continue learning without limits.
