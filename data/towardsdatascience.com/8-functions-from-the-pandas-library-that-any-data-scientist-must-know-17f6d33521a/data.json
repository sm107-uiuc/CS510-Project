Pandas developers describe the library as \u201ca fast, powerful, flexible and easy to use open source data analysis and manipulation tool\u201d.", "In a short version, we can just say that Pandas is a library that we will always need in order to read and understand our structured data. By structured I mean any tabulated data, like excel files and so on. If you didn\u2019t get these terms no worry, they aren\u2019t important for this guide.", "What I want you to don't forget is even simpler: Pandas reads data and transforms them into a bunch of Series, think about Series like a \"single column with multiple rows\". These \"bunch of Series\" are called DataFrame inside Pandas.", "I\u2019ll be using a dataset that I have worked on the past. Our data content is about the crimes in the city of Atlanta, Georgia. You can get the raw version and more informations by clicking here.", "Alright, finally we are able to start doing some questions and answering them with code. Let\u2019s do it!", "The first question you need to answer here is: \"What format does my data have?\". The answer will guide your next step. By default we work with .csv (comma-separated values) but you can have any type.", "Didn't find your format above? Click Here and you can find the correct code to load your data.", "By \"navigate\" I mean travel across your dataset without problem. By default we can just use our column name to verify our entries inside an specific column, but there are also more advanced ways using the Python's slice.", "Bellow you can verify the difference between some core ways to navigate.", "Let's say that you need to count how much values are higher than 10, 100, 1000! Ah, I think you get it\u2026 how can you do? How you can get all the empty cells that aren't with a target lower than 100, for example. Let's put it on code.", "During the Data Cleaning phase its really important to verify if your dataset has empty values and, from that, decide how you will take care of that. Unfortunately missing values aren't just NaN entries, but can be -1, 0 or even \"missing\" strings. I'll leave here a bunch of ways to fix this issue.", "By default the info() method described above can do the work, but there are other ways to process. That need to be done during Data Cleaning/Wrangling! If you export your processed dataset with the incorrect dtypes you will need to take care later on (time wasted). It's a really simple step, but an important one.", "Commonly we do that during the Data Wrangling phase, when you need to modify the actual ones based on some issue with the metrics, for example. There are a bunch of ways to do that, and you can check it bellow.", "Even with that bunch of informations, I know that it\u2019s never enough. So I\u2019ll answer others questions as well. Think about like as a bonus.", "Both are great tools during the Exploratory Data Analysis phase. Instead of writing really big lines of code, you can just extract what really matters and use it for a while. Really interesting approach!", "The first one, crosstab, will literally \u201ccross\u201d two Series and return a single object. You can use the result to plot some really important informations to your clients for example.", "The groupby will group the entire dataset based on a single or small list of columns. Instead of cross them, the result will be the column followed by all the other column's values that match the grouped one. It's easier to understand with a image.", "Ah, I really love this one! Just plot what you want to see! Pandas has a inbuilt function called plot that uses Matplotlib (a plot library) under the hood. As response, it can do the job for you with a really simple approach! Let me show that.", "Hope that you have like this content and can apply your new knowledge with mastery! If you want to keep learning something interesting every day, I\u2019ll be glad to become your teacher here at Medium!", "Also you can check my Github profile. I\u2019ve been working with some Data Science projects for a while. All key concepts are there to learn and reuse!", "Your home for data science.
