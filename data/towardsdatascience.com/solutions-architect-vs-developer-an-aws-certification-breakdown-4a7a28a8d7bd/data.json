So why wouldn\u2019t I want to become an expert in it?", "I knew that, on average, AWS certified workers make north of $130,000, according to Global Knowledge.", "But what I did not know was which certification I should be going after. Solutions Architect or Developer?", "From conducting research on the internet, I discovered that mean salaries are higher for Solutions Architect (only very slightly). So naturally, I gravitated towards that.", "However, once I looked at the objectives for each exam, I felt I would get more out of the Developers certification (as I am a developer myself).", "Little did I know, there is tremendous overlap between the two, and once you get one, it\u2019s rather easy to get the other. So I got both.", "So which one is right for you? Let\u2019s find out!", "Understand the differences between the AWS Solutions Architect and Developer certifications, and ultimately determine which you should pursue.", "Here are the objectives for the AWS Cloud Developer (DVA-C01) examination:", "There is a significant focus on best practices for developing on AWS (not surprising). I found this content to be a little more applicable to my day to day work, so naturally, it was more intriguing to me.", "The AWS Developer exam takes a deep dive into Serverless computing, as this is a practice AWS wants developers to embrace.", "The services in focus are Lambda, DynamoDB, Step Functions, X-Ray, API Gateway, ECS, CloudFront, SQS, SNS, and Kinesis.", "Older versions of the exam explored deeper into EC2, and you will notice this if you review exam materials from 2018 or before. This is not the case anymore. It is a serverless computing focused exam.", "I am not saying EC2 won\u2019t appear on your exam. It will. But focus your attention on the serverless services.", "This exam is great for developers who are learning how to build using AWS. Whether it be for personal use or a job, the knowledge you acquire while preparing for this exam will provide you with all you need to be successful.", "You do not have to be super technical to succeed. The exam creators do not make you code on the test. They will ask you, \u201cwhich is the correct API\u201d type questions, but no background coding knowledge is required.", "Let me rephrase that. Background coding knowledge may help you, but it is not needed.", "Here is an example question: Your web application is uploading a 10GB file to an S3 bucket every few minutes, and you want to minimize the time it takes for each upload to complete. How can you achieve this?", "Answer: use the Multipart upload API.", "There are many ways to learn the answer to this question, and questions like this one. You could have hands-on experience with S3 buckets, read through the API documentation, or learned it from an online course.", "The idea here is that if I were bringing AWS to my company, what are the best practices I could use to leverage the latest and greatest technologies from AWS?", "Or, if I were starting my own company from the ground up, how can I develop my applications in a cloud environment?", "If either of these questions applies to you, this exam is right for you.", "If you are curious about how you can prepare for this exam, I\u2019ve written the following article about my experience:", "Here are the objectives for the AWS Solutions Architect (SAA-C02) examination:", "The main focus for this certification, if you could derive from the objectives, is designing the best possible architecture for your systems.", "A heavy focus is on the following services: EC2, VPC, ECS, Elastic Load Balancers, CloudWatch, EFS, EBS, FSx, and the CI/CD tools.", "This certification is for those who perform some type of solutions architect role.", "The exam will test your ability to design architectures that are secure, robust, and use AWS technologies.", "A lot of questions will be scenario-based. Here\u2019s an example: you are working for a large scale Aerospace Engineering firm, and you need your NoSQL database to be highly scalable and able to handle frequent schema changes. Which AWS service should you use?", "While training to become a solutions architect, you\u2019ll learn about all of the AWS service offerings and how to make them work together in the best way possible. Questions like this will become a cakewalk for you.", "The idea here is that if I were bringing AWS to my company, how could I best design my application architecture so it is secure, high-performing, resilient, and cost-optimal?", "Or, if I were starting my own company from the ground up, how can I best architect my applications using AWS?", "If you are a developer or play a different non-solutions architect role, you will still benefit from the lessons learned from this certification.", "As a developer, I found the concepts extremely valuable. Also, this gives me the confidence I need to leap into a technical lead or solutions architect type role in my future.", "If you are curious about how you can prepare for this exam, I\u2019ve written the following article about my experience:", "I noticed there is a ton of overlap between the two certifications. Hence, as I completed the AWS Developer Certification, I immediately scheduled the Solutions Architect exam for two weeks later. Without much more preparation, I passed the second exam with flying colors.", "The knowledge I had acquired from the Developer certification made it rather easy to take that step. Let\u2019s take a look at what you learn from both.", "The core AWS services are going to appear everywhere, and they are tested on every certification exam you take.", "What do I mean by the core AWS services?", "These services cover compute, security, database, monitoring, deployment, and serverless on AWS.", "A vast majority of the questions revolve around these services, so the more you know about each one individually, the better.", "Also, it pays to have a solid understanding of security. Understanding VPC\u2019s, Cognito, STS, subnets, security groups, and NACLs will make your life that much easier on both of these exams.", "And why stop at only the Developer and Solutions Architect certifications? Once you have this foundational knowledge, you can get any certification you want! Here is a full list of certifications you can acquire: AWS Certifications.", "It is also worth mentioning that preparing for these exams will also allow you to acquire the Google Cloud Platform or Microsoft Azure certifications more easily. Much of the concepts and principles are the same, just with different names.", "For some final thoughts, I highly recommend taking both exams. However, if you must choose one, hopefully, this will help you decide:", "Developer: take this exam if you are either a developer or someone trying to learn AWS from a developer\u2019s perspective. The knowledge you acquire throughout this training will lie a foundation for creating truly incredible things on AWS.", "It will also allow you to be involved in AWS development-related discussions, which I find rather interesting.", "Solutions Architect: take this exam if you are a technical architect of some type or are trying to learn how an architect thinks within the AWS landscape.", "Regardless of your role, having a solutions architect perspective will only benefit you.", "No matter which certification you choose, you open the door to limitless opportunities. Harness the power of AWS and turn your dreams into a reality. You will have the ability to build anything you could ever imagine.", "All you have to do is take that first step and get started.", "Your home for data science.
