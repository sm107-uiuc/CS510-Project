We want to have control over the gender attribute. Let\u2019s say 0 indicates male and 1 indicates female. After training, we can expect the encoder to map the faces somewhat like this.", "At a high level, each gender occupies somewhat of a disjoint area of the latent space so that the decoder can easily learn to reconstruct the face with the correct gender.", "Here is how a fader network differs.", "We force the decoder of a fader network to use given attributes of the image, in addition to the latent representation to reconstruct the image", "A fader network is an autoencoder, except that we feed in to the decoder, not only the latent representation, but also the attributes of the image that we want to control.", "In order to force the decoder to use the given attributes for reconstruction, we must destroy all information about the attribute in the latent space.", "In our example, given a point in the latent space, I should not be able to tell the gender of the face. By destroying any information about gender in the latent space, the decoder is forced to use the given attribute that we feed it to reconstruct the image with the correct gender.", "In order to destroy attributes in the latent space, the fader network introduces a discriminator on its latent space. This discriminator tries to learn the attributes of images from only their latent representation. In our example, the discriminator tries to learn about the gender of an image from a 2-D latent space. After it is trained, it serves as a loss function to the autoencoder by penalizing any encoding of the attributes in the latent space.", "After a significant amount of training, we ideally would want to see the discriminator perform no better than random guessing because it would indicate that we\u2019ve successfully destroyed all information about the attributes in the latent space.", "With a fully trained fader network, we can control the attributes of a reconstructed image by changing the values of the attributes. In our example, we can slide our gender attribute between 0 and 1 (male and female), and we would see an interpolation of a face between male and female.", "We can train the fader network to control over multiple attributes, but as we increase the number of attributes we want to control, we get a lower quality of reconstruction and realism.", "Recall that the loss function of an autoencoder is simply the reconstruction loss. In a fader network, the overall loss function is a weighted sum of the reconstruction loss and the discriminator loss (a higher value from the discriminator loss indicates that the discriminator can easily discern the attributes from the latent space).", "As in most ML training sessions, one can use stochastic gradient descent for all optimizations for fader networks.", "In the beginning, set the weight of the discriminator loss to 0 so the autoencoder can first get good reconstruction", "For a given batch of images\u2026", "As we increase the weight of the discriminator loss, the gender attribute starts the disappear more and more from the latent space, which gradually forces the discriminator to use the given gender attribute during reconstruction.", "I\u2019ve implemented a fader network using Google Colab on the handwritten digit dataset MNIST. The attribute that we are controlling over is the digit value of the image. The encoder and decoders are convolutional and deconvolutional neural networks respectively. The discriminator is a simple multilayer perceptron that outputs a 10 dimensional probability vector for the digit values. We compute the discriminator loss as cross entropy between the discriminator\u2019s output and a one-hot encoding of the digit value. The reconstruction loss is a mean square error between the pixel values. Recall that the overall loss is a weighted sum of the reconstruction loss and discriminator loss. The weight of the reconstruction loss is always 1. The weight of the discriminator loss starts off at 0 and is incremented by 3 after each epoch, and caps off at 15. It takes about 10 minutes to train 50 epochs. After training, we demonstrate a fade to another digit chosen randomly.", "Your home for data science.
