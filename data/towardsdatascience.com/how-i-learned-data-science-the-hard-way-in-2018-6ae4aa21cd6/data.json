As I explored the job offers, nearly all of them listed education in maths, statistics, computer science or at least a quantitative field as a requirement. And I don\u2019t have it.", "Can I break the status quo, and join this community I aspire to be in? I decided to teach myself the hard way.", "One question was intriguing to me. How much can I learn over a six-month period if I\u2019m pushing myself to the limit?", "Scott Young\u2019s story has been an inspiration to me. He taught himself a four-year computer science curriculum on MIT OCW in one year, working on the subjects 35\u201360 hours a week. You never know your limits until you give it a try. Sometimes, it is even fun to do things that seem impossible.", "This May, I started my own version of MIT challenge. The first course I took was the Single Variable Calculus on MIT OCW. I soon rediscovered my longtime love of mathematics and became absorbed in these online lectures. My favorite one was the Linear Algebra class from Gilbert Strang. For a couple of weeks, I would wake up to his humorous lectures and feel like being with an old friend.", "During the intensive study period, I picked a new subject as the focus of the week and worked on it for as many hours a day as possible. To be most effective in my learning, I tried different learning techniques: setting dedicated study hours with breaks in between, learning actively through exercises and note taking, repeating rehearsals to create long-term memories, combining visual and auditory materials, and teaching the concept to a friend. These techniques helped me to achieve an ambitious learning target each day.", "The beginning was the most difficult, yet the steep learning curve can be very fulfilling. By mid-June, I had almost watched all the maths lectures I could possibly find on MIT OCW. Laying a foundation in maths is only the first step. But it is a big one forward.", "One challenge when I got started was \u2014 You don\u2019t know what you don\u2019t know.", "When I came across the summer program Advanced Statistics and Data Mining in Spain, I had no idea how to select the courses. Should I do Bayesian Networks or Bayesian Statistics? The course names all seemed too foreign to me. Nevertheless, whatever the course was, I just threw myself out there, to be in that learning environment.", "Choosing to be surrounded by people who have more expertise than I \u2014 This led to real changes. I met a diverse group of people from telecommunications, computer science, finance, mathematics \u2014 who all share a passion for machine learning. I learned as much from them as from the courses.", "After getting some hands-on practice on programming with Python, I was ready to go on with the machine learning course from Andrew Ng. His lectures on machine learning and deep learning are so good that I almost got addicted to watching them. The exercises provided in his courses were tremendously helpful to test my understanding of the theories and to implement the algorithms in codes.", "Many other data science and machine learning resources were also a big help: DataCamp, Introduction to Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani, Learning from Data by Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa, and a series of MIT OCW lectures \u2014 Artificial Intelligence, Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science, and Introduction to Algorithm.", "I found, when it comes to studying machine learning, it is almost inevitable that you will come across some contents which you don\u2019t understand. I took the advice from the \u201cReading Mathematics\u201d manual by Cornell University \u2014 putting something aside for some time when you do not understand it right away:", "\u201cYou may often (perhaps usually) find that when you return to something you left half-understood, it will have become clear in the light of the further things you have studied, even though the further things are themselves obscure.\u201d", "Then I thought I should keep myself engaged with a data science community. So I moved to Berlin. Here I joined weekly data science project groups, attended meetups hosted by a variety of companies, and volunteered for machine learning conferences.", "I highly recommend applying to conferences as a volunteer, especially for those with a limited learning budget. In return, I had the amazing chance to meet with data scientists and ask them questions, and talk to companies that are hiring. I feel fortunate to have met mentors who have been sharing their valuable advice with me over time. This is truly an amazing community to be in.", "Then I came to Kaggle. I have been postponing doing competitions on Kaggle because I thought I might not rank well. I found it is much better to see Kaggle as a learning platform than a competition platform. Looking at how other people tackle data science projects on Kaggle has been one of the most effective ways for me to learn.", "Looking back, at some point in time, I was afraid. In my first academic conference, I found it difficult to justify my reason there as a business graduate. I found it difficult to be sitting in a room where I did not understand much of the presented topics.", "But, and this is a big but here, things got better, a lot better and I almost forgot where I got started. I almost forgot that half a year ago, I had not taken a math or science lesson for 10 years, and today I am solving different data science problems with public datasets. By the end of 2018, I am preparing for interviews with companies for which I would not have dreamed of being a data science candidate 6 months ago.", "After you have embarked on this journey, everything around you seems to have changed. You start to look at each problem from a new perspective and wonder: would machine learning be a solution?", "Live the fear. Keep on going.", "Your home for data science.
