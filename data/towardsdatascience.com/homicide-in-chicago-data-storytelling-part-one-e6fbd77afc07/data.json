As a resident of Chicago, I am aware that most of these shootings are confined to certain parts of the city but to truly understand the the true nature of this violence, I decided to dig deeper into the data available from the City of Chicago.", "It may well be that the odds of getting arrested for a homicide are less than half. The odds get much better if you are a criminal living in a high crime district.", "This blog post is divided into two parts. Part one covers data cleaning and part two which can be found here goes into data exploration and visualization.", "I performed the data cleaning, exploration and visualization using Python in a Jupyter Notebook with the hope of uncovering some interesting insights along the way. I have also used the python libraries below. The full notebook, supporting code and files can be found in my GitHub.", "I used publicly available data from the City of Chicago\u2019s data portal linked below to explore crime in Chicago from January 2001 to February 2018.", "The notebook work flow is as follows:", "The original dataset from the city data portal was in .CSV format but was too large (at 1.5 GB) for my laptop\u2019s resources. I could not fit the whole file in memory so I used pandas' TextFileReader function which allowed me to load the large file in chunks of 100,000 rows and then concatenate the chunks back together into a new dataframe.", "After loading the dataset, I used some of panda's built in functions to explore the characteristics of the data as shown below.", "Next we view the basic statistics on columns", "The next line of code previews the first 5 lines of the dataframe.", "Next I visualized each geographical distribution scatter plot for each of the crimes in the group to understand how the 4 crimes are distributed across the city.", "After a few basic observations, it was time to retrieve a dataframe with the homicide data and do some data cleaning before I could go on to explore it at depth.", "Find all the null values in the dataframe for further cleaning.", "From the cells above we can observe:", "Next I created a list of columns to keep and updated the dataframe with the new columns.", "After dropping the NULL columns, I updated the dataframe with the columns that I thought to be most relevant in helping me understand the homicide picture in Chicago.", "So far I had created a leaner pandas dataframe with just the relevant data from the original crime dataframe. In the next section we will get our hands dirty exploring and visualizing the new homicide dataframe.", "Now that we have performed some data cleaning, we can start to visualize it to get the bigger picture of crime in Chicago. To be able to pick up from where we left off, I stored the new data in pickle form which is a way in Python of saving an object to file for later retrieval. Pickling accomplishes this by writing the object as one long stream of bytes.", "The data exploration and visualization of this Chicago crime dataset is continued in the second part of this post.", "Your home for data science.
