This was done using monthly Met Office data from January 1959 \u2014 July 2020 (contains public sector information licensed under the Open Government Licence v1.0).", "In this instance, a Monte Carlo simulation is built on the same data in an attempt to generate a scenario analysis of a range of temperature values.", "Firstly, let\u2019s take a closer look at the data itself.", "This is the mean monthly minimum temperature for Braemar:", "Let\u2019s analyse the time series in more detail. Firstly, let\u2019s plot a histogram of the distribution:", "From looking at the histogram, we can see that the distribution shows negative skew. Let\u2019s calculate this to confirm.", "From this analysis, we observe that the distribution is negatively skewed, and therefore doesn\u2019t necessarily follow a normal distribution (at least not fully).", "Here is a QQ plot of the residuals:", "In particular, we can see that values in the upper quantiles deviate from the normal distribution line. With a median temperature of 2.2\u00b0C and a mean temperature of 2.72\u00b0C (Braemar is one of the coldest areas of the United Kingdom), values significantly above this lie outside the bounds of a normal distribution \u2014 we would expect that with lower temperatures recorded in the upper quantiles \u2014 the distribution would assume a more normally-shaped pattern.", "Additionally, modelling weather patterns can be quite tricky as the distribution will vary based on geography. For instance, temperature distribution at the equator will be quite different to that of the poles. In this regard, understanding the distribution of the time series in question is necessary in order to model weather simulations accurately.", "For this simulation, 1000 random values are generated. Since the distribution has been identified as negatively skewed, this means that the generated random values must also follow a similar negatively skewed distribution.", "To do this, skewnorm from the scipy library can be used. As was previously indicated, a (or the skew parameter) is set to -0.05.", "Here is a sample of the generated array:", "Here is a plot of the generated data, which shows a very slight negative skew:", "The mean and standard deviation for the original series is calculated:", "Now, the generated random numbers that form the assumed distribution are multiplied by sigma (standard deviation), with the product then added to mu (the mean).", "Here is another example of this procedure (with a normal distribution being assumed). Let\u2019s generate a histogram of the temperature simulations:", "You will notice that the lowest simulated temperature of -11.32\u00b0C lies just below the lowest mean monthly temperature value of -8.6\u00b0C as recorded in the original data. From that standpoint, the model did reasonably well in estimating the extreme minimum values that could be expected on a monthly basis.", "That said, a limitation in this example is that we are working with monthly data \u2014 not daily.", "Suppose we wished to predict the lowest daily minimum temperature instead. Would this model be of use in this scenario?", "In fact, the lowest recorded daily minimum temperature for Braemar came in at -27.2\u00b0C on 10 January 1982, which greatly exceeds the lowest simulated temperature of -11.32\u00b0C by the Monte Carlo model.", "This indicates that the distribution may be more negatively skewed than the monthly data suggests. Use of daily data might show greater negative skew, and may be more informative for the Monte Carlo simulation.", "Let\u2019s lower a (our skew parameter) down to -2 and see what happens.", "A minimum mean monthly temperature of -12.34\u00b0C is recorded. This is still much higher than the minimum daily temperature recorded.", "In this regard, while a Monte Carlo simulation was useful for modelling monthly data \u2014 such a simulation still cannot compensate for a scenario where we do not have the data we want.", "The likelihood is that taking daily temperature data for Braemar would mean a much more negatively skewed distribution. That said, the mean and standard deviation of that series would also likely vary significantly \u2014 without knowledge of these parameters then the Monte Carlo Simulation is limited in terms of being able to estimate daily values.", "A Monte Carlo simulation can be strong when we have the right data \u2014 but it does not necessarily make up for a lack of data.", "This has been an introduction to how a Monte Carlo simulation can be used to model extreme weather events.", "Many thanks for your time, and any questions or feedback are greatly appreciated.
