Regardless of what programming language you use or what your target application field is, following the specific guidelines of good software development is essential in building a high-quality, maintainable project.", "Data science projects \u2014 may be more than other types of software projects \u2014 should be built with the mentality of maintainability. That is because, in most data science projects, the data is not constant and is frequently updating. Moreover, it is expected from any data science project to be extendable and to be crash-resistant. It should be immune to any mistake in the data.", "Because every single part of the code in a data science project is build to fit a specific shape or form of data, if a wring data is given to the code, it might break it down. Of course, you never want your code to break, no matter what data it is fed. Hence, when designing and building the code, there are a few things to keep in mind to make your code more resilient.", "There are many guidelines to follow to design and write good, stable code. However, in this article, we will focus on what I think is the 5 most important rules \u2014 or skills \u2014 needed to build a solid data science project.", "So, let\u2019s get right to it\u2026", "We can\u2019t talk about good software without mentioning documentation. Now, there are two steps to keep your code clean and well documented. The first step is commenting on your code. Comments are critical to walking people reading your code and \u2014 most importantly \u2014 your future self, through your thought process when you wrote the code.", "Comments need to be simple, not more than two sentences, and straight to the point. Never forget writing a descriptive docstring whenever you define a class or a function or create your own modules. When writing comments, always remember:", "Comments are not there to explain code to people; code is there to explain comments to the computer.", "Once your codes and comments are done \u2014 well, for the time being since code is never done \u2014 you need to build sufficient documentation to your code. Documentations are external explanations of the code written \u2014 usually \u2014 in plain English. Documentations are often created using documentation processing tools, such as Sphinx and DocUtils. Documentations are often a part of your project\u2019s website.", "When it comes to best practices, it\u2019s a good idea to start writing your documentation before you start coding. It will act as a guide to what needs to be done. Unfortunately, most of us \u2014 including myself \u2014 don\u2019t follow this rule. However, we all need to start practicing it.", "When we write code, we often write it based on some variables and datasets. However, it is very common that your code may contain some bugs that will only appear in some particular cases or with a specific dataset. Therefore, testing your application before deploying it can be crucial.", "But, testing can get quite complicated, especially when it comes to data science projects. Often, data science projects are tested using reviews from other data scientists because most of the well-known testing methodologies are difficult to apply in case of data science projects.", "That is because a simple change in data could lead to significant changes in the performance of the code. Through the years, researchers and developers have looked for the best way to test data science projects. They found out that the best way to test data science applications is through unit testing.", "Unit testing is a type of testing that is used to detect changes that may break the flow of your program. They help with maintaining and changing the code. There are many Python testing libraries that you can use to perform unit testing.", "Getting a little bit specific to data science projects, when dealing with data, one thing we need to be careful with is managing our data. We need to consider many things, such as how are your data created? How big is it? Will it be loaded every time or stored in the memory?", "When working with data, we need to be very careful with memory management and how the code is interacting with the data. One thing to consider is how Python functions call affect the memory usage of your code. Sometimes, function calls take up more memory than you realize.", "One way you can overcome that is by using Python\u2019s automatic memory management capabilities. Here\u2019s how Python deals with function calls:", "If you\u2019re wondering how you can write code that uses this automatic memory management, wonder no more. Itamar Turner proposed 3 different way you can make your functions more memory efficient:", "Last but not least, to help you build resilient projects, make use of tools built specifically for data science. Of course, there are well-known tools, such as IPython, Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib.", "But, let me shed some light on two not very known tools:", "Nowadays, building a good data science project is not enough to make you stand out. You need your project to be crash-resistants and memory efficient. That\u2019s why using some software development skills; you can take your data science project to the next level and make it stand out.", "The software development skills we discussed in this article are:", "What we didn\u2019t talk about, though, is the most crucial skill any developer must obtain, which is the ability always to be working on improving your skills and knowledge base, as well as keeping up to date with recent technologies and tools.", "Your home for data science.
