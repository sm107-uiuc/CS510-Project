it.\u201d He was referring to concerns around consumer data privacy, something which is as relevant today following the Facebook/Cambridge Analytica scandal as it was during the early Dot Com years.", "McNealy\u2019s comments raise two questions. Firstly, is he right in what he\u2019s saying? Secondly, if he is, what is there to be done about it?", "The answer to this first question is almost certainly: who knows? We live in an era of extensive and ever-growing data collection, so much so that it\u2019s hard not to call us all somewhat digitally illiterate. But ignorance is a weak excuse in a discussion of privacy; ignorance circumvents any discussion by deferring to the, \u201cwhat you don\u2019t know can\u2019t hurt you,\u201d approach. But ignorance does support a stronger argument \u2014 what I\u2019d obtusely call the, \u201cyou\u2019re not special,\u201d argument.", "In his wonderful book New Dark Age, James Bridle discusses big data and algorithms which have been optimised beyond our wildest fantasies. He invokes science fiction writer Iain Banks in a discussion of Infinite Fun Space. Infinite Fun Space is where hyper-sophisticated artificial intelligence go and play, building worlds literally inconceivable to the human mind, while we mere humans exist in a fully optimised \u2014 and highly boring \u2014 world.", "The, \u201cyou\u2019re not special,\u201d argument is a meshing of ignorance and hyper-intelligence: who cares if you have no privacy, because the only things that can make sense of your data are computers who have better things to be doing. While I don\u2019t like this argument, it does highlight that much of our privacy anxieties are just social anxieties, anxieties that emerge from exposure to other people. These anxieties aren\u2019t going away, but through sensible social media management and a form of collective transparency (we\u2019ll get onto this), some of these concerns can be ameliorated.", "But privacy isn\u2019t just about feelings and desires we\u2019d rather the world didn\u2019t know. Privacy can have extremely serious consequences for one\u2019s finances and identity. Privacy in this regard is one of the much applauded benefits of Bitcoin; while the transaction is necessarily transparent, the person behind the transaction remains anonymous. Ensuring privacy in these areas is vital, and where a great deal can be gained from doing so, malicious actors will spare no expensive. If McNealy is right about privacy, then, it\u2019s not good enough to suggest we just get over it.", "There\u2019s another version of privacy which we shouldn\u2019t just get over; behavioural privacy. Behavioural economics contains an idea called nudging \u2014 small changes in how a choice is framed which can have a significant and predictable impact on the outcome. I\u2019ve previously written about how big data and nudging can combine into hypernudges \u2014 ultra-targeted, personalised nudges that feed off a huge assortment of data to influence a person\u2019s choices. Classic examples of hypernudges are personalised ads, such as adverts that show a product you were recently looking at on a different site. For some, these ads are creepy, while for others they\u2019d rather see an ad for something they\u2019re interested in than for something they\u2019re not. Either way, hypernudges rely on a waving of your data privacy.", "Regardless of whether McNealy is right to say we have no privacy, privacy is more complicated than McNealy suggests. Privacy can mean several different things, and be violated more many different reasons. But assuming McNealy is right, what can be done about it?", "Well, how do we forgo our privacy? Often, we think about our personal data as a currency which we transact with for various services. I\u2019ve argued previously this isn\u2019t a good way to think, because currency is worth the same amount no matter who owns it; data is not. An interesting alternative idea has been discussed by legal data scholar Karen Yeung \u2014 the collective right to privacy. Here, privacy is not just an individual idea, but a social idea, one that remains even if an individual, \u2018sells,\u2019 their personal data.", "But big data changes this. With enough data, systems can often make accurate predictions about individuals who may have never provided them with any data. Regardless of the purpose of this privacy transgression, it is a transgression, and it raises serious moral \u2014 if not legal \u2014 concerns. But equally, the big data genie is out of the bottle, and thus we must start considering how to live in a post-privacy world.", "If our collective right to privacy is dead, and our control over our individual right to privacy increasingly waning, what alternative is there? The answer may be what data economist Ernst Hafen calls the, \u201cright to a copy.\u201d Under this proposal, we will have the right as citizens to request a copy of any data that anyone collects about us. This, of course, doesn\u2019t solve the privacy issue, but it does return to us some empowerment and control.", "For Hafen, this is important: with these copies, he proposes the creation of a central repository of data. This repository, he suggests, has two advantages: it would be democratically managed, and would de-monopolise data, forcing big tech to compete on quality of service, not through data-hoarding, rent-seeking tactics. This central repository is one version of what I call collective transparency.", "To an extent, the right to a copy already exists, with social media services such as Facebook and Twitter allowing users to download copies of all their data. Achieving collective transparency, then, is less about returning control of data and more about building new data infrastructures. This is where the problems with collective transparency emerge: people still want privacy; such large amounts of data could be used for very unwelcome purposes; how do we ensure democratic control of the repository and no foul play?", "These issues are valid, and until (or if) collective transparency becomes an active project, tangible technical answers to these problems are likely to be hard to come by. One early solution may build on blockchain technology, levering a pseudonymous approach like that of Bitcoin to retain transparency without exposing people. Cryptocurrencies have also been able to incorporate voting features, which may resolve democratic issues, though which such an important resource, a public and transparent governance structure seems necessary. This would push us to the very limits of dataified democracy.", "Collective transparency may also not be the solution. Maybe something else will come along? Maybe we will discover the economic limits of big data which guarantees our privacy simply because it\u2019s not worthwhile to violate. But if we accept McNealy\u2019s proposition, and accept that we have no privacy \u2014 what Jean Baudrillard called, \u201cinvoluntary transparency,\u201d \u2014 collective transparency seems like an intriguing option to replace what we have lost.", "Your home for data science.
