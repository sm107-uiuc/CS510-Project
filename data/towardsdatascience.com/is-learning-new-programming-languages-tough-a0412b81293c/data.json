You have to invest time to find good resources, learn the new comment structure, and prepare your brain for the new language you want to learn. A Chinese proverb says:", "Learning is a treasure that will follow its owner everywhere.", "One type of treasure for us data scientists is learning a new programming language with a purpose. How we can convert the fear to a treasure? let me tell you how.", "Many software engineers, during their bachelor or master courses, have to learn different programming language i.e., C#, C++, Python, R, Matlab, etc, based on their interest or the courses and the interest of the professors in the university. But for some people that want to start their career as a data scientist, programming is new. Like many of you, after completing my Ph.D., I decided to enter industry. I was surprised when seeing job applications that needed qualification like this:", "During my master and Ph.D., I was using Matlab for doing data science projects as any researcher, I knew only a programming language that I used in my daily work. But, many organizations and job positions for data scientist projects prefer to use Python or R because they are open source and companies do not have to pay for a license. So, I started learning R.", "Like everyone else, I thought that change was difficult, we also know how interesting it is to learn a new topic. I tried to figure out how to learn a new programming language, I recognized the 4 steps will help me:", "Yes, if you want to learn it great, you have to start to create an application in the new language, as Tim Sanders is saying:", "Education without application is just entertainment", "If I wanted to get a job, I had to learn it great, so, I started to convert a project from Matlab to R. I recognized that:", "When you have a focused workflow for learning, then you shouldn\u2019t be afraid to learn new programming languages", "I created the workflow and I converted the fear to a treasure, I learned a lot, did the first project, was happy and I got the job that I wanted to have. I was a senior data scientist that knows two analytics programs.", "After two years of working with R and doing different analytics projects, I found it:", "Here is a comparison between Matlab and R:", "But after two years I decided to take on new challenges in a company whose common data science tool was Python.", "When I interviewing for the new position I told the interviewer that I do not see any challenges in learning Python because I used a workflow that worked for me. I know:", "there is no challenge in learning a new programming language, when you learned already some of them.", "I applied the same workflow again, finding the best environment, a good book, an online course, and learn with a purpose or application. Yes, it worked again, the first day I took up my new position, during learning, I wrote my projects in Python, with Anaconda and Pycharm. If you are a data scientist and work with Python, you know, it has roughly all the things that you need for doing a great project and how enjoyable python programming is.", "The main benefit I got from these changes was at a time when I was taking over an old project that was written in R and I was able to contribute to the project. Nowadays, I am working on a project that the data collection part of it, is done in Matlab and my customer is doing simulation in Matlab, I do not have a problem with their source code and I am leading the data science part of it. Also, I sometimes mix Python and R to do a good project when I see restrictions in a Python package.
