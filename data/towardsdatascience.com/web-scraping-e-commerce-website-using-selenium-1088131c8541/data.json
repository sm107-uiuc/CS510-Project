I have designed this particular post to be beginner friendly. So, if you have no prior knowledge about web scraping or Selenium you can still follow along.", "To understand web scraping, we need to understand HTML code basics. We will cover that as well.", "There are a lot of things to talk about concerning HTML basics but we will focus on the things that will be helpful (at least most of the times) in web scraping.", "Before we go into the actual scraping of an E-Commerce site let us scrape the site shown in the Figure below (from the HTML code in Fig 1 LEFT)", "From the Figure (Fig 2) above note the following:", "To conduct web scraping, we need selenium Python package (If you don\u2019t have the package install it using pip) and browser webdriver. For selenium to work, it must have access to the driver. Download web drivers matching your browser from here: Chrome, Firefox, Edge and Safari. Once the web driver is downloaded, save it and note the path. By default, selenium will look for the driver on the current working directory and as such you may want to save the drive on the same directory as the Python script. You are however not obliged to do this. You can save it anyway and provide a full path to the executable on Line 5 below", "This is the most important part of web scraping. In this section we need to learn how to get HTML elements by using different attributes.", "Recall: Elements of a web page can be identified by using a class, id, tag, name or/and xpath. Ids are unique but classes are not. This means that a given class can identify more than one web element whereas one id identifies one and only one element.", "One HTML element can be identified using any of the following methods", "Multiple HTML elements can be identified using any of the following (the result is a list of elements found)", "Note: id cannot be used to identify multiple elements because id can only identify one element.", "We can identify and loop through both elements identified by container1 class as shown below", "Now that you got the feel of how selenium work let us go ahead and scrape the actual site we are supposed to scrape. We will be scraping online book store [link].", "Clearly, we can notice a pattern implying that looping through the pages will be simple because we can generate these URL as we move along the loop.", "On inspecting the site here is the HTML code for the highlighted region (representing one book)", "Before we go into coding lets make some observations", "Lets go through some lines so that you understand what the code is actually doing", "This book is rated 4-star but this fact is hidden as a value to the class attribute. You use get_attribute(class) to access such an information. On extracting content on line 24 by using text function, you will get such a string", "Therefore we had to splitting the string before using the function in line 28\u201338 to get the actual star as a number.", "What we need is just the number 22 to mean that we have 22 copies available. We achieve that with line 25 where we are using regular expressions to extract the number.", "Recall that line 16 above locates all the books in the page. Therefore, in order to scrape all the books in one page we need to loop through the list generated in that line as shown below", "Once you have understood the previous example of scraping one book then this one should be easy to follow because the only difference is that we want to loop through all the books extracting the links (lines 33 through 38) and then loop through those links to extract the information we needed (line 42\u201384).", "In this snippet also we have introduced try-except blocks to catch cases where the information we want is not available. Specifically, some books misses description section.", "I am sure you will also enjoy to see selenium open the pages as you watch. Enjoy!", "The key concept to understand here is that we need to loop through each book in each page, that is, two loops are involved here. As stated earlier we know that pages URL follows some pattern, for example, in our case we have", "We can easily create a Python for-loop to generate such URLs. Lets see how we can generate the first 10", "Therefore, we can scrape all books in all pages simply as below", "The only difference between this snippet and the previous one is the fact that we are looping through pages with the loop starting in line 34 and the fact we also write all the information scraped into a CSV file named all_pages.csv .", "We are also using try-expect to handle exceptions that may arise in the process of scraping. In case an exception is raise we just exit and close the browser (line 94)", "Web scraping is an important process of collecting data from the internet. Different websites have different designs and therefore there\u2019s no particular one scraper that can be used in any particular site. The most essential skill is to understand web scraping on a high level: knowing how to locate web elements and being able to identify and handle errors when they arise. This kind of understanding comes up when we practice web scraping on different sites.", "Here are more web scraping examples:", "Lastly, some websites do not permit their data to be scraped especially scraping and publishing the result. It is, therefore, important to check the site policies before scraping.", "Join medium on https://medium.com/@kiprono_65591/membership to get full access to every story on Medium.", "You can also get the articles into your email inbox whenever I post using this link: https://medium.com/subscribe/@kiprono_65591", "As always, thank you for reading :-)", "Your home for data science.
