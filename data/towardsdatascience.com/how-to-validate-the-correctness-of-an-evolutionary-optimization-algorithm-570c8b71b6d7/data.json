These algorithms try to imitate nature mechanisms and solve an optimization problem. For example, the Genetic Algorithm (GA) uses inspired biological mechanisms such as reproduction, cross-over, selection, mutation, and recombination to find the best solution for an optimization problem. Another example can be an Imperialist Competitive Algorithm (ICA) where social mechanisms like domination, revolution, and colonization are used to find a solution [1]. Evolutionary algorithms are usually performing well in complex optimization problems where using classical approaches is mathematically difficult. They can easily deal with nonlinear problems without being stuck in local minimums.", "To optimize a problem with an evolutionary optimization algorithm one can use a certified toolbox. However, for some algorithms, either there is no available certified toolbox or one may prefer to implement his/her own code with any program languages. In this situation, the most important questions are \u2014 How we can trust the written code? How we can validate the correctness of our implemented evolutionary or metaheuristic code?", "In this post, some of the existing ways to check and validate the correctness of an implemented evolutionary optimization algorithm have been addressed briefly. In addition, a discussion regarding the performance evaluation of optimization algorithms is provided using an example of Ackley function.", "There are different ways to check the correctness and accuracy of an implemented metaheuristic multi-objective optimization algorithm (e.g. Genetic Algorithm (GA) or Differential Evolution (DE)). The following approaches can be addressed briefly to check the correctness of the implemented optimization algorithm:", "A) Comparison with classical approaches: In some problems, it can be possible to run both the classical approach and multi-variate GA to make sure the results are correct and accurate. However, in most cases, because of mathematical complexity using a classical approach for comparison is not possible.", "B) Using Well-known Benchmarks: The correctness of the code can be also proven though existing benchmarks. The used algorithm can be validated via well-known benchmarks [2\u20136].", "C) Using Expert Idea: An expert of the system can check the results and their rationality. They should all agree that the final results are logical. If for a problem exact minimum cost value is needed, then using an expert idea would not be convincing.", "D) Convergence: The convergence of the implemented multi-objective genetic algorithm can be easily observed through the plot of cost vs. iterations. There are also other factors such as roundoff errors and local extrema that have the same perspective.", "E) Domination Factor: The new generation of optimization algorithms such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, and MOPSO usually have a function to separate dominant results from non-dominant one. So, all final results should be dominant and with a proper initial population, it is very rare to be trapped by a local minimum. However, there is no guarantee that they find the global minimum of the system. For more information regarding the domination please check [8].", "The following figure shows Ackley function with a equal to 20, b equal to 0.2 and c equal to 2 [9]. This function is one of the well-known benchmarks used for evolutionary or metaheuristic optimization. It has one unique global minimum and several local minimums.", "The above figure can be easily generated using the bellow MATLAB code:", "By increasing the value of b to 1000 the following figure can be obtained. As can be seen in this function there are many local minimums and a narrow unique global minimum.", "It is possible to also put c equal to zero and remove all local minimums. Then the following figure can be obtained. A flat surface with a narrow and deep hole as a global minimum. In this case, the plot of Fitness vs Number of Iteration is not useful.", "To have a clue about the performance of an optimization algorithm lets simplify the problem. First of all, we can discretize the area. Consider X and Y have a range of -5 to 5 with a step size of one and point x = 0 and y = 0 is the global minimum value. So, there will be 121 possible combinations of X and Y. The probability of finding the optimal value randomly should be 1/121. In the worst-case scenario, what is the probability of finding the optimal value?", "The answer should be the total number of newly generated values (considering all algorithm section such as initial population, mutation, crossover, recombination, etc.) during a certain number of iterations divided by total possible combinations of inputs (genes). In this case, only the number of newly generated value and the accuracy of discretization can improve the performance. The following expression can be used as the probability of error for this example.", "The above expression can be used as the upper bound probability of error for not only the worst-case scenario but also for any other scenarios. This expression can also prove that when the step size is small enough (N \u2192 \u221e) in the discretization and the number of iterations is infinite (huge computation power is needed) then the probability of error should be zero.", "It should be noted that the worst-case scenario is given because the nature of the problem can easily be bypass or reduce the effect of strategy in an evolutionary algorithm. In other words, the strategy of an evolutionary optimization algorithm has a low effect on performance and accuracy for this example.", "Finding the performance and accuracy of evolutionary optimizations is still an unanswered research question. In many cases, the strategy of the algorithm is affecting performance. For instance, Arnold, D. V. et al. [10] has proposed a method to measure the effect of step size in the output performance of an evolutionary optimization algorithm. But this research cannot be considered as a general solution for accuracy and performance evaluation of evolutionary optimization algorithms.", "The computational effort that is related to the number of iterations, initial population and internal function evaluations that can be related to the performance or accuracy of a metaheuristic algorithm. So, calculating the big O for an optimization algorithm is useful.", "The problem dimensions including the number of objectives, constraints, range and number of input genes plus structure of optimization algorithm can be related to the performance [11].", "The correctness of an evolutionary optimization algorithm can be validated through different methods summarized as follows:", "[1] Atashpaz-Gargari, E., & Lucas, C.
