The CDMP is the best data strategy certification you\u2019ve never heard of.

The test is open book, but the 100 questions on the exam must be completed within 90 minutes \u2014 not a lot of time to be looking things up. Therefore, it\u2019s important to be extremely familiar with the reference material.", "When you schedule the exam ($300), DAMA provides 40 practice questions that are pretty reflective of the difficulty of the actual exam. As a further resource, check out this article about the process of studying for a certification.", "It\u2019s possible to sit for the exam online while monitored via webcam ($11 proctoring fee).

This is just fine if you\u2019re interested in getting your CDMP Associate certification and moving along. If you\u2019re interested in the advanced tiers of CDMP certification, you\u2019ll have to pass with a 70% (CDMP Practitioner) or 80% (CDMP Master). To get certified at the highest level, CDMP Fellow, you\u2019ll need to attain the Master Certification and also demonstrate industry experience and contribution to the field. Each of these advanced certifications also require passing two Specialist exams.", "This brings me to my final point, which is about why \u2014 purely from a career advancement standpoint \u2014 you should chose to put yourself through the studying and exam taking process for CDMP: certification from DAMA is associated with high-end positions in leadership, management, and data architecture. (Think of CDMP as getting credentialed into a semi-secret society of data ninjas.) Increasingly, enterprise roles and federal contracts related to data management are requesting CDMP certification.

It\u2019s around 600 pages, but if you mainly focus your study time on Chapter 1 (Data Management), diagrams & schemas, roles & responsibilities, and definitions, then this should get you 80% of the way toward a passing score.", "In terms of how to use DMBOK, one test taker recommended 4\u20136 hours per weekend for 8\u201310 weeks. Another approach could be reading a couple pages each morning and evening. However you tackle it, make sure you\u2019re incorporating spaced repetition into your studying methodology.", "In addition to being your study guide for the exam, the DMBOK is of course useful as reference book, and you can drop it on your colleague\u2019s desk if they need to learn data strategy or if they\u2019ve nodded off during a webinar.", "The CDMP covers 14 topics \u2014I\u2019ve listed them in order of the prevalence with which they occur on the exam and provided a brief definition for each.", "Data Governance ( 11%) \u2014 practices and processes to ensure formal management of data assets.
