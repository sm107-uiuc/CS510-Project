The problem is that the data is often about people, but to the reader\u2019s eye, maps are inherently about area. The biggest areas on the map get the reader\u2019s attention, ignoring how many people in the data relate to that area. That\u2019s okay if that data you are showing happens to be normalized by area \u2014 such as population density \u2014 but often this isn\u2019t the goal of our visualizations.", "The problem is that the data is often about people, but to the reader\u2019s eye, maps are inherently about area.", "Sometimes a cartogram is a better choice, but most cartograms are either skewed beyond recognition, or highly manual to create. Therefore, I\u2019ve created a Python package to automatically scale the parts of any map by any variable, without any overlapping shapes and with minimal distortion.", "Introducing mapscaler! All you need is a GeoPandas DataFrame, including one column that has values by which to scale each polygon. Mapscaler will do the heavy lifting from there \u2014 scaling each polygon to the appropriate size, then rearranging them (minimally) until they don\u2019t overlap.", "This can make your maps much more intuitive to the reader, and also surprisingly beautiful! Here\u2019s some examples to illustrate:", "Political analysts love to color geography by political preferences. Here\u2019s a typical map style, using data from the 2000 Presidential election between George W. Bush and Al Gore:", "This is a poor visualization! The goal is to convey information about how people voted, but this hides an entire dimension: not all of these counties have equal voting populations! The eye is easily fooled by color proportions. The 2000 election was one of the closest in history, with a victory margin of only 5 electors! You\u2019d never guess it from this map. A better approach would scale the counties by how many votes were cast. This way, the reader gets a sense for how many people voted for which party, AND a sense for the geographic distribution of voters, too:", "If you prefer \u2018bubbles\u2019 rather than retaining the original shapes, mapscaler can do that too:", "If you have Facebook, you (hopefully) know that they track everywhere you go with your phone. Recently, Facebook\u2019s \u2018Data For Good Program\u2019 has released anonymized data to demonstrate the decrease in mobility as a result of COVID-19. Here\u2019s a map you\u2019ll find at this link as of this writing, showing how much people in each state are staying put:", "When most people look at this, their eye will be drawn to the brightly colored states in the middle of the country, or at best, the Midwest. That is, after all, where most of the AREA of the US lies! A better map would scale the states by population, to show how the population is actually distributed:", "In the latter graph, your eye gets drawn to Texas plus the coasts. That\u2019s how it should be, since that\u2019s where most people actually live! This map, with the same data, tells a better story.", "To show the flexibility of mapscaler, here\u2019s an example done with a more local area. North Carolina\u2019s Department of Public Instruction publishes their spending; here\u2019s all dollars spent on children with disabilities in 2018, by county:", "Of course, this map is not very useful, without knowing where the children actually go to school:", "Mapscaler can be downloaded from PyPi with pip install mapscaler. It also includes some built-in maps to get you started; I\u2019ve posted some sample code in the official documentation. Hit me up with feedback or questions!", "Your home for data science.
