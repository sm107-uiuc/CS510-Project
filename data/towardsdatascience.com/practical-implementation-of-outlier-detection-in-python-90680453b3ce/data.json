If the data include even if one outlier, it has the potential to dramatically skew the calculated parameters. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to analyze the data without those deviant points. It is also important to understand which of the data points are considered as outliers. Extreme data points do not always necessarily mean those are outliers.", "In this article, I will discuss the algorithm and the python implementation for three different outlier detection techniques. Those are Interquartile (IQR) method, Hampel method and DBSCAN clustering method.", "Each dataset can be divided into quartiles. The first quartile point indicates that 25% of the data points are below that value whereas second quartile is considered as median point of the dataset. The inter quartile method finds the outliers on numerical datasets by following the procedure below", "The concept of quartiles and IQR can best be visualized from the boxplot. It has the minimum and maximum point defined as Q1\u20131.5*IQR and Q3+1.5*IQR respectively. Any point outside this range is outlier.", "I will take a dataset with Airbnb data from Kaggle. The dataset contains listings of thousands of Airbnb rentals with price, rating, type and so on. I will focus on the numerical price value of the rentals and create a function that can be applicable to any numerical data frame column. Let\u2019s begin.", "This boxplot shows a number of outliers in several segment of rental types.", "As seen in the boxplot, the majority of the outliers are removed. One can also perform this IQR method in individual rental type and that will remove all the deviant points and result in a cleaner boxplot.", "This method applies Hampel\u2019s filter to the data to detect outlier. The process of finding the outlier is below.", "I used the same dataset\u2019s price column to find the outliers.", "DBSCAN stands for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise. I would like to apply this clustering algorithm to find out outlier in the same dataset. This algorithm performs better when there are data points having cluster of similar density. This method tends to group the data points together which are closely located, considering those as neighbors. Python\u2019s sklearn.cluster has the class implementation of DBSCAN which takes two important arguments. The first and the most important one is the eps value which is the maximum distance between the data points that can be considered as neighbors. There should be an optimum value need to be chosen for eps. This publication [1] provided the procedure to find the optimum value where eps values are plotted against data points. At some point, the eps value shows the highest change in the slope and that\u2019s the most optimum value. The second important argument is the min_samples which is the minimum number of data points that should be inside a group to be considered as a cluster. Higher the min_samples given as input, less the number of clusters and vice versa [2].", "Our Airbnb price data has some high-end rentals that could be considered as outliers but the fundamental difference between DBSCAN and IQR or Hampel is those high-end rentals can also form a cluster given that the minimum number of data points are there. Let\u2019s see the code for DBSCAN.", "IQR or Hampel method are very successful for extreme outliers with a single pattern whereas DBSCAN is a better choice if we have data of different patterns. Let\u2019s say if we have a linear data as well as a circular data, DBSCAN will be able to differentiate the samples into different groups. In our case, some extreme high-end rentals are grouped together and form a cluster. This cluster then is isolated from some other data points which have smaller rent value (considered as outlier in this method but good data points in IQR of Hampel method). Again, one needs to figure out what is the requirement and apply the best method. As mentioned earlier, some extreme data points are not always outliers. Consider the following scatterplot with the linear fit. It does not seem to have any outlier.", "Now let\u2019s have the same scatterplot with an extreme data point.", "The point is outside the main distribution but lies on the fitting line very well. It may not be an outlier but an extreme data reading. This kind of outliers can be included to make a better training model for machine learning. If there is enough number of data points outside the main distribution even if those are not on the fitting line, they will form a cluster and that is where DBSCAN is very successful.", "[1] Nadia Rahmah and Imas Sukaesih Sitanggang, \u201cDetermination of Optimal Epsilon (Eps) Value on DBSCAN Algorithm to Clustering Data on Peatland Hotspots in Sumatra\u201d, 2016 IOP Conf.
