Whenever I am facing any kind of problem, I will first think of how this could be solved by using a machine learning approach.", "For instance, when I was searching for a property to rent in Singapore, I would like to know the price range of one particular area. In other words, given the criteria I want, what is the optimal price range of that particular area. Obviously, there are several approaches to get the answer.", "First, if I know that the price range of a certain area beforehand, I can have a rough idea of what is the price range base on the location of the area. Secondly, I can go to various property websites such as propertyguru and 99.co to filter out the conditions that do not satisfy my preferences. From there, I am able to get an estimated price range. Thirdly, I can build a machine learning model by scraping websites to find the optimal price range based on my preferences.", "As a data science enthusiast, I chose to train a model that is able to give me the price range of any area. After some days, I manage to train a model with acceptable accuracy. However, is this the best approach?", "If you just want an answer that is good enough in a short period of time, just forget about machine learning models, use heuristic approaches will do.", "Let\u2019s talk about an example of a business problem in the workplace. Let\u2019s say you are working in an e-commerce company on a project to ban listings that are illegal to sell. For example, guns, undeclared pharmaceutical products, adult products and etc. The operation team already has a method or a list of keywords to find out these products but would like to spot not only more illegal listings but also they want the results to be highly accurate. Given that you not only do not have clean labeled data but also given a short period of time to find more illegal products, how will you tackle this problem?", "One of the approaches could be to explore image models. Get some labeled image and then train an image classifier. Besides, you can train a text model to classify those listings, or maybe you could just combine both text and image model to do it. You have only a short period of time, and you are worried whether you are able to deliver the result, what could you do?", "Since the operation team already has a set of keywords they are relying on, you probably should just use a rule-based approach as this is the fastest way. Later on, you could ask your team to relabel the existing data to make sure the data is clean enough. Then, you could train a better-performing machine learning models.", "In short, the rule-based algorithm provides you a great way to achieve the desired precision you need. However, machine learning models are still the best option to perform in the long run.", "Now, let\u2019s picture another real-world scenario. You are working as a data scientist in the finance industry and are responsible for fraud detection project. Your company is a third-party company that has access to internet transaction data. Your job is to detect suspicious transactions with desirable accuracy. Besides, the explainability of the model is also a very important aspect.", "For instance, when the person in charge (PIC) of this project, question you about why there is a fraud transaction with a huge amount of money, but it is not being caught by your model? Or why there are so many transactions being flagged as fraud but they are actually just ordinary transactions? Your model should be explanatory so that you will be able to explain it to the PIC.", "The recall rate could be taken as your model\u2019s priority metric. This is because if your model happens to misclassify a large number of fraud cases, it would be very costly to the bank. As a data scientist, how can you tackle this problem?", "You can either build a deep learning model which could detect unusual behavior of human. However, you could barely explain if your model\u2019s prediction goes wrong. On the other hand, you could build a ruled-based model. Therefore, you are able to explain your results to the PIC.", "If either the cost of a decision produced by your model is too high or your model requires explanatory power, the rule-based approach will be a better option to go with.", "Thank you so much for reading till the end.", "Machine Intelligence is the last intervention that humanity will ever need to make. \u2014 Nick Bostrom", "The quote above shows the huge potential of machine learning to be applied to any problem in the world. This article is not telling you that machine learning does not seem like a good option to be implemented in business. However, I hope you can understand under which circumstances machine learning would not be a good option to go with.", "I hope you will like this article which offers you a different perspective on machine learning.
