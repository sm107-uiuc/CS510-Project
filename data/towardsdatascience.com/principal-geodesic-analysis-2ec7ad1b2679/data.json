This time it is the extension of Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to Riemannian space. Readers are expected to have an understanding of PCA. To recall PCA once again, the following article can be helpful Understanding the Mathematics behind Principal Component Analysis. I also recommend readers to go through my previous article on Geodesic Regression where necessary concepts on Riemannian geometry are discussed.", "PCA is a well-known technique for data analysis by representing the data in terms of its principal constituents. Two of the well-known applications of PCA are noise reduction and dimensionality reduction. Let\u2019s review PCA with a simple example of noise reduction.", "Real-world data are noisy. Noise can be introduced by the environment where we collect data or by the collection procedure itself. Let\u2019s discuss the scenario in Figure 2.", "The dotted data points on the left are the output from the source. As we can see the source can be perfectly modeled by line P1, meaning that the nature of output from the source is one-dimensional. P1 is the principal component in this case. On the right, we can see that when the source output is polluted with noise, there is not a perfect fit just with P1. The data points now tend to extend in the dimension perpendicular to the line. To get a perfect fit here, we need another principal component P2 perpendicular to P1. Now we can represent noisy data points as linear combinations of P1 and P2.", "When we are to model a source by analyzing noisy data, we need to find a way to nullify the effect of noise for better modeling. PCA serves that purpose. When we project data into principal components, we can clearly visualize the significance of each component. Like in Figure 2, component P2 is less pronounced than P1 and we can infer that P2 has arisen due to noise and has to do little with the data source. In such a case, P2 can be discarded as noise and P1 can be used to model the source. The fact that noise components are less pronounced is because noise values carry less or no correlation to one another while the source output is highly correlated.", "Likewise data like images, despite being represented in thousands of dimensions, contain most of the information only in their few principal components. Thus, when we subject such data for processing, insignificant components can be discarded keeping only a few significant ones thereby largely reducing dimensionality. This will make data processing efficient.", "There are many ways to calculate PCA, the most effective one being the calculation of Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix. Mathematically, major principal components are the ones that have the highest variances of the projection of data points onto them.", "Just like in the previous article where we extended Linear Regression to data lying in the Riemannian space, we will now extend PCA to finding principal components for data lying in the same. This is called Principal Geodesic Analysis and we will find out the major geodesics that represent the given data.", "We will make use of the mathematics we discussed in the previous article. So, if you haven\u2019t already, I would once again recommend you to go through the article before moving forward.", "Before going to PGA, let\u2019s define the concept of mean in Riemannian space which we call Intrinsic Mean.", "The mean of a set of data points is a point, the sum of the distance from all the data points to which is minimum.", "In Euclidean space, this is easily computed by dividing the total vector sum of all data points by the number of data points. But, in general manifolds, the unique existence of mean cannot be guaranteed. However, if we have a well-localized data set, the mean exists and is unique. Computing the mean requires solving the gradient descent optimization of the function:", "where the gradient is given by:", "Now that we have defined mean, we can go on and define principal geodesics. Please note that defining geodesics requires defining two parameters: a point and a vector in tangent space at the point and the geodesic is given by exponential map computed from the parameters.", "In PGA, the principal geodesics are defined such that they all pass through the mean point. Since we have figured out the mean, now we need to figure out a vector in its tangent space. Like in PCA, the principal geodesics are a curve that has the highest variances of the projection of data points onto them. Mathematically, the vector parameter (of a geodesic) can be defined as:", "We can normalize data points in PCA to translate their mean to zero because a group of data points carries similar information when scaled, translated, or rotated. However, such things are not possible with the Riemannian manifold. The main challenge in the above equation is to find the magnitude of the projection of data points on the geodesic G. Let\u2019s discuss calculating the projection.", "It is pretty obvious that the projection of any point x in the geodesic curve G is defined as:", "We will now linearize the manifold at the mean point and approximate projections in the tangent space. The geodesic G passes through the mean. Linearizing the manifold refers to considering a small space of manifold as a Euclidean space where we can carry out vector operations. Hence the value of projection can be approximated by approximating Log(x,y) as:", "We can instead represent the Log map of the projection as:", "But what we need here is actually the length of the projection from the mean, therefore we need the magnitude of Log map.", "We can see that on linearizing the manifold, the projection simply reduces to minimizing vector distance and the magnitude of the projection is similar to the one we do in vector space. Thus, for this condition, we can write down the solution of the above minimization as similar to the PCA i.e. a dot product:", "Finally, the PGA problem reduces to be to a PCA problem:", "All the approximations we did was to convert a PGA problem to a PCA problem. Just in case if things got confusing, we can summarize everything in 3 steps:", "3. Compute PCA of the mapped values {vi}. The blue dots in Figure 3 are points in the tangent space and hence PCA can be found out with Euclidean operations. An exponential map of the obtained PCA values and the mean will define principal geodesics.", "Let\u2019s carry out a simple example of PGA on a spherical manifold. Let\u2019s define some functions as we did in Geodesic Regression:", "Now, we will generate synthetic data and carry out PGA on it. We will take data points lying on two geodesics with tangent vectors v1 and v2 centered at point p and add random noise to them to get our data points. Furthermore, there are 20 points along with the first and 10 points along the second geodesic. Finally, we will concatenate data points to create a data matrix y.", "Now, calculating principal geodesics are fairly simple. We will just carry out 3 steps as described in the previous section.", "We can see that the major two principal vectors we get (in the decreasing order of magnitudes) have a similar direction to the vectors v1 and v2 we used when generating data points and that the mean is also close to p. Please note that we need not compare magnitudes of v1 and v2 with obtained principal vectors because we are interested in finding out the principal geodesics and it is only the position and the direction of geodesic orientation that matters. Furthermore, a change in the magnitude of principal vectors will change the length of geodesics which is not so significant.", "Finally, we can define geodesics by an Exponential map of mean and two major principal vectors obtained. Figure 4 closely depicts the scenario in the example:", "The dotted points are synthesized data points along two geodesics and the two red curves are geodesics G1 and G2 fitted to the data points. The intersection of data points is the mean point. So, we can clearly observe that we have represented the data points by two principal geodesics.", "Your home for data science.
