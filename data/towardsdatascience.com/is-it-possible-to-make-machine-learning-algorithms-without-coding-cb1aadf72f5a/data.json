There you have another obstacle to sort! But that\u2019s not necessarily the case if you focus on understanding the theory behind it in the first place. Here\u2019s a little guide to help you go through that process.", "1. Importance of Data Analytics. (1 min read)", "2. Machine Learning Contribution. (1 min read)", "3. Understanding the Basics: Data-validation process, imbalanced datasets, supervised and unsupervised methods. (2 min read)", "4. Introduction to Decision Trees and Random Forest. (2 min read)", "5. Application using Orange. (6 min read)", "Thousands of data sources exist nowadays from which we can extract, transform and load data ranging stock prices, medical records, surveys, population census, and logged behaviors, among others. Also, there\u2019s a huge variety of fields in which we can apply these techniques and a wide range of useful applications inside each field, such as fraud detection, credit scoring and asset allocation in relation to the finance domain.", "But how much can I contribute with this knowledge to a company? A LOT! Just put yourself in the situation of a credit risk analyst at a bank. \u201cShould I lend money to this client or should I reject his application? How much information should I request him or her without risking to lose the interest rate associated with the lending? Are his periodical payslips enough? Or should I also ask him credit records from other financial institutions to guarantee the repayment?\u201d. Data Analytics and machine learning models play a major role in automating routine tasks such as this one, handling bulks of information and optimizing metrics to enhance the business sustainability.", "The ultimate goal is to make meaningful and interpretable inferences about data, extract relationships between variables and detect patterns to forecast the outcome of a variable.", "Let\u2019s see the case of tech companies. In order to perform and grow their business value, their focus must be set on improving business metrics and delighting users. Data analysis provides these companies with insights and metrics that are constantly changing and that allow them to build even better products. The mission: Understand users, how the offered product fits into their life, what motivates them and how was their experience in order to improve it. All this and much more can be attained with the use of data.", "Truth to be told, there\u2019s probably not a need for Machine Learning in your company budget. Why is that? Because the majority of the companies need improvements in processes, customer experience, costs reductions and decisions making, all of which can easily be attained with the implementation of traditional data analysis models, without the need of recurring to more complex ML applications.", "Despite the above mentioned, traditional data analytics models are static and have limited use with fast-changing unstructured data inputs that are rapidly and constantly suffering changes. That\u2019s when the need for automated processes with capacity to analyze tens of inputs and variables emerges.", "In addition, the resolution process differs greatly between both methods, as ML models focus on receiving the input of a determined goal from the user and learning from the rapid-changing data which factors are important in achieving that goal, instead of being the user who sets the factors that will determine the outcome of the target variable.", "Not only it allows the algorithm to make predictions, but also compare against its predictions and adjust the accuracy of the outcome.", "Data-validation process:In the process of performing a machine learning algorithm and selecting the best way in which we can analyze data, we split it into two subsets: training subset and testing subset, in order to fit our model on the train data and make predictions on the test data as an emulation of real-life problems.", "How we perform the splitting of data is not trivial as we don\u2019t want to bias any of the subsets. For e.g., while processing data of a sample of a company\u2019s clients, we don\u2019t want to split train and test subsets without including an equally-represented sample of each category in both of the subsets. As a result, we say that data splitting must be performed in a stratified way and randomly.", "Imbalanced Datasets:Data is said to be imbalanced when instances of one class outnumber the other(s) by a large proportion. In the process of data classification, the model might not have enough instances of a class to learn about it, and as a result will bias the analysis.", "There are several sampling methods to deal with this issue including Undersampling, Oversampling, Synthetic Data Generation and Cost Sensitive Learning. In this article, I\u2019ll dig into Oversampling moving forward.", "Decision Trees algorithms are structured as a hierarchy of questions and answers about the observations in a dataset in order to help the model to make classifications. An example would be the following scheme, which is a simplification of a basic structure of questions to determine the salary of a Baseball player:", "In the graph, we see the representation of a two-level decision tree in which the first-step classification is related to the number of years as a professional player that an individual had, and conditional to the response to that question is the number of hits per season. In the example, the determination of the salary of each player in the league will be made following the guidelines of this model.", "The most suitable model will be the one that better represents the actual relation among the variables under study (if the salary of a baseball player and years of experience were linearly correlated, probably a linear regression would be the most suitable model to use). Random Forest is one of a variety of techniques that allow us to represent more complex relations between variables that are not necessarily linear, exponential or logarithmic.", "For e.g., in the scenario of having a player with less than 4.5 years of experience, the decision-making of his salary is uniquely dependent on his professional experience, not on the amount of hits.", "The ultimate goal of the scheme of questions is to split the observations in a way that the resulting groups are as different from each other as possible. Observations will finally be organized in sections according to which different conditions are met:", "Classification mechanisms utilizing Decision Trees are based on \u201censembles\u201d of a large number of individual trees. Let\u2019s use a simple metaphor to illustrate the concept:", "Each blind man has a task: Deduce the animal based on the part of the body that he touches. For the purpose of the article, the metaphor would mean that each blind man is a model and the elephant is the value to predict. Were they to be all touching the same part, they\u2018d probably deduce incorrectly which is the animal. As a consequence, it would be better to have them distributed to be able \u201clearn\u201d from different sets of \u201cinformation\u201d. Furthermore, we\u2019ll try to combine the models (or blind men), that independently are not effective in their predictions, in order to optimize the output of the model.", "Instead of touching a part of an animal, the model will actually analyze a selected dataset (with reposition of samples), obtained with Bootstrapping. Unfortunately, this method doesn\u2019t guarantee that the selected datasets are not correlated mainly because \u201cstrong\u201d predictors generally prime over other indicators. That\u2019s where Random Forest comes to play as its main feature is randomly selecting datasets ignoring \u201cstrong\u201d predictors.", "Orange is an open-source tool that allows us to perform a wide range of data-manipulation tasks such as data visualization, exploration, preprocessing and modeling creation without the need to use Python, R or any other piece of code. It\u2019s ideal if you\u2019re taking your first steps in this long learning-path.", "It\u2019s also suitable for more advanced users as it includes Python widgets to input Python scripts to complement the widgets it has to offer. Go to the following link to proceed with the installation of the program.", "In this case, I\u2019ll be utilizing a dataset containing a sample of 150.000 clients of a financial institution. The column \u201cSeriousDlqin2yrs\u201d will be the target variable upon preparing our model.", "You can find the dataset in this link to my GitHub.", "Note: Don\u2019t worry about the gray \u201cApply\u201d button as it\u2019s only used to confirm changes made to the values in each feature, for e.g. after modifying \u201cRole\u201d or \u201cValues\u201d tabs.", "3.

With these tools, you\u2019ll get a better view of the descriptive statistics of each feature in the dataset, such as mean, dispersion, minimum, maximum and missing values.", "Filter columns data to avoid incorrect values that interfere in the accuracy of the analysis. We can set conditions for the features such as values below X amount of equal to Y amount.", "Select important features for your analysis from the original dataset and create a new dataset with only those features utilizing the widget \u201cSelect Columns\u201d. This is the widget in which you can determine selected columns and indicate target variable for further analysis.", "Data Sampler widget is used to split the filtered dataset into train and test subsets. In Orange\u2019s interface we can select a \u201cSampling Type\u201d to input our desired sampling method. Particularly, I selected 70% of the entire data to be included as \u201cTrain sample\u201d leaving the remaining 30% as \u201cTest sample\u201d. As mentioned earlier in the article, data-selection for the subsets is performed randomly and with stratified samples, as Orange\u2019s interface reflects.", "In order to solve the Imbalanced Dataset problem explained above, I decided to perform the Oversampling technique instead of a SMOTE as I believe that the widget for this feature is not included in Orange.", "1 . Select \u201cDefault\u201d values, which are the minority class from the training subset, as we want to randomly replicate the observations to balance the dataset. In the visualization, you will see that links or edges between the widgets have legends, in which you must indicate what data you want to pass to the \u201creceiving\u201d widget. In this case, \u201cSelect Rows\u201d widget contains a Train subset, from which \u201cMatching data\u201d or \u201cDefaults\u201d will be sent. On the other hand, we find \u201cUnmatched data\u201d , which are \u201cNo defaults\u201d from the Train subset, that are directly sent to the \u201cConcatenate \u201dwidget.", "An advantage of Oversampling method is that it leads to no information loss in relation to Undersampling. Its disadvantage is that, since it simply adds replicated observations in the original data set, it ends up adding multiple observations of several types, thus leading to overfitting.", "2. Data Sample widget randomly replicates a fixed number of observations", "3. Concatenate widget joins both new observations with \u201cold\u201d ones, in order to finally obtain a balanced dataset to submit to our model.", "Let\u2019s move on to the fun part: Modeling Random Forest.
