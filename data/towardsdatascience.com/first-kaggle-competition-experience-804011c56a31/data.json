Doodle Recognition Challenge\u201d by Google AI Team, hosted on kaggle.", "Special Mention: Team \u201crm-rf /\u201d was a two-member team consisting of my Business partner and friend Rishi Bhalodia and myself.", "Picture this: A race that goes on for three months. There is no finish line, there are high-scores. You\u2019re a seasoned runner in your school.", "You\u2019re against people speeding on SuperCars (GrandMasters with a LOT of experience) while I was running barefoot. Sure, I was pretty good against my friends, but against a car?", "In a sense, it was like a PUBG game where we just free-fall into the middle of the fight and grabbed onto any gun we could, tried to make it to the \u201csafe zone\u201d.", "The Safe Zone for us was the medal area.", "So why is everyone so addicted to Kaggle?", "Personally, I learned much more in the 1 month of competing than any 1 month MOOC that I have ever taken up.", "The \u201cExperts\u201d on kaggle are always generous with their ideas. We were surprised by the fact that many people would almost give out their complete solutions-being on the Top LB positions!", "Every night we\u2019d make a good submission, the next day you wake up and you would have fallen by 20 ranks on the LB! Hit Reset and work again towards a better submission and then repeat again every day.", "Finally, We got to 385/1316 on Private LB: Our ideas on the given compute allowed to get to just this rank. It was definitely an amazing experience, I\u2019d definitely compete more and try to perform better.", "On many occasions, when we\u2019d manage to land a Top 100 submission, after sleeping soundly-we\u2019d wake up to a public kernel that would have completely thrown us down the LB by 50 positions!!", "People who compete in competitions are truly passionate, there is always an overflow of ideas, always an overflow of talent. For us, it was just giving it our best shot and living for a few weeks on minimal sleep and breaking and building conda environments while trying to convert the ideas shared in the discussions into code.", "In the end, I really learned why Kaggle is the Home to Data Science.", "It was always a dream goal of mine to perform well in kaggle competitions. For starters, I had kept the bar at 2 Top 25% submissions.", "Even though the competition had a large number of file size and a few interesting challenges, we were aiming our best for a medal.", "Goal: The goal is to identify doodle(s) from a dataset of CSV(s) files containing the information to \u201cdraw\u201d or create them.", "Challenge is: The number of files in the challenge was ~50 Million!", "Personally, I had already done a LARGE number of MOOC(s) and I was confident given that how many times I had gone over the definition of a CNN, it\u2019d be pretty easy to land a bronze medal. Of course, I was very wrong.", "We\u2019re very grateful to Kaggle Master Radek Osmulski for sharing his Fast.ai starter pack-we built on Top of it along with a few tricks from Grandmaster Beluga.", "Mistake 1: As beginners, its always suggestive to start a kaggle competition when the competition is fresh.", "The number of ideas that overflow in a competition is just huge! Even the LB Top scorers are very generous with sharing their approach-it\u2019s just a matter of if we could figure out the missing nuggets of information and be able to convert their ideas into code.", "We started the competition almost past mid-way since its launch.", "Mistake 2: We learned about \u201cexperimenting\u201d, validation.", "The starter pack works on 1% of the data, I tried experimenting with 5% of the data, followed by 10% of the data and this had shown a consistent increase in performance.", "Next: I decided to throw all the data at the model, the training ran for ~50 hours on my 8 GB GPU. We had expected a Top score with this approach and instead the model accuracy fell to the floor!", "Lesson learned: Experiments are very important and so is validation. The starter pack relies on \u201cdrawing\u201d the images into memory and then training the model on them. The issue with Linux is, it keeps a limit at the number of files unless specifically formatted against that.", "We didn\u2019t do a validation check and trained against a portion of the data. A reflective validation set is certainly something that you must install while getting started.", "This approach showed a consistent increase in performance.", "Ensembling: Our best submission was a \u201cBlend\u201d of a ResNet 152 trained with fastai (v1) on 20% of the dataset and the MobileNet Kernel by Kaggle GM Beluga.", "You will find many better discussions in the competition discussions, so please excuse this post if these ideas don\u2019t get you a Top LB score.", "This was really a personal summary of the things that I\u2019ve learned competing.", "Finally, I\u2019ve pledged to compete a lot more, hopefully, you\u2019ll find team \u201crm-rf /\u201d somewhere on the LB in the recent competitions.", "I\u2019ve been bitten by the \u201cKaggle Bug\u201d and I would probably prefer competing in the future over signing up for more MOOC(s)", "See you on the LB, Happy Kaggling!", "If you found these interviews interesting and would like to be a part of My Learning Path, you can find me on twitter here.", "If you\u2019re interested in reading about Deep Learning and Computer Vision news, you can check out my newsletter here.", "Your home for data science.
