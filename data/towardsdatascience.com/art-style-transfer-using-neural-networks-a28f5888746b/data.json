They employ a similar concept to graphic filters and detectors used in applications like Gimp or Photoshop, but in a much powerful and complex way.", "A basic example of a matrix operation is performed by an edge detector. It takes a small picture sample of NxN pixels (5x5 in the following example), multiplies it\u2019s values by a predefined NxN convolution matrix and obtains a value that indicates if an edge is present in that portion of the image. Repeating this procedure for all the NxN portions of the image, we can generate a new image where we have detected the borders of the objects present in there.", "The two main features of CNNs are:", "This is the typical structure of a Convolutional Neural Network:", "Thanks to papers like \u201cVisualizing and Understanding Convolutional Networks\u201d[1] by Matthew D. Zeiler, Rob Fergus and \u201cFeature Visualization\u201d[12] by Chris Olah, Alexander Mordvintsev, Ludwig Schubert, we can visually understand what features are detected by the different CNN layers:", "The first layers detect the most basic features of the image like edges.", "The next layers combine the information of the previous layer to detect more complex features like textures.", "Following layers, continue to use the previous information to detect features like repetitive patterns.", "The latest network layers are able to detect complex features like object parts.", "The final layers are capable of classifying complete objects present in the image.", "The possibility of detecting complex image features is the key enabler to perform complex transformations to those features, but still perceiving the same content in the image.", "One of the most important papers regarding Art Style Transfer is \u201cA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\u201d[2] by Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, Matthias Bethge.", "Its main finding was that the Content of a natural image and its Style can be separated and processed independently of each other, which allows us to \u201cextract\u201d the style from a classic art paint and apply it to our own images.", "Many of the other Neural Style Transfer models discussed here took this idea and expanded it with faster and more complex networks, but still using this foundation.", "Gatys et al. model is based in a VGG-19[3] neural network, which is commonly used for visual object recognition and rivals human performance.", "Then, it uses pieces of it to define some functions:", "Then it runs several optimization rounds (thousands or more) that will introduce changes in our working image that will decrease the Total Loss, thus producing a mix between our photo and the painting style.", "All the previous German Shepherd artistic images were generated using this method.", "You can also generate your own artistic pictures using this method going to the artcopypaste.com web site.", "These networks tackle the main disadvantage of models like the previously described have: The time it takes to produce an artistic image.", "They are based in models like the one described in the paper \u201cPerceptual Losses for Real-Time Style Transfer and Super-Resolution\u201d[4] by Justin Johnson, Alexandre Alahi, Li Fei-Fei.", "These models pre-train a CNN with a specific style, which can take a few hours in a GPU, and then these networks can be used to apply the selected style to any image nearly in real-time and also to apply styles to movies in a few minutes.", "They are composed of two CNNs:", "The structure of the Image Transform Network is similar to:", "This image down-sampling and up-sampling help detect higher-level features of the images. In a way, it works like a lossy compression but for image high-level features (not pixels or colors as in a JPEG image).", "Using the same images and styles as before, it will produce the following results:", "These networks also generate a pre-trained model, but not limited to only one style, this model aims to be able to reproduce any style present in the style image.", "One way to create this type of network model is described in the paper \u201cExploring the structure of a real-time, arbitrary neural artistic stylization network\u201d[7] by Golnaz Ghiasi, Honglak Lee, Manjunath Kudlur, Vincent Dumoulin, Jonathon Shlens.", "Another very similar model, is described in \u201cArbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization\u201d[8] by Xun Huang, Serge Belongie.", "This model consists of three Neural Networks:", "Golnaz Ghiasi et al.[7] paper expands the initial work described in \u201cA Learned Representation For Artistic Style\u201d[10] by Vincent Dumoulin, Jonathon Shlens, Manjunath Kudlur, which implemented a model similar to Johnson et al[4], but by manipulating the normalization parameters of the Style Transform Network it was capable of applying 32 painting styles to the images.", "Thanks to the addition of the Style Prediction Network, the model is able to apply any number of styles, even styles for which it was not trained. This network produces a vector of normalization parameters S that represents the detected Style present in the Style Image and applies them to the Style Transfer network to generate the Artwork.", "To train this model, not only requires a large image dataset to use as content for training Style Transfer Network (in this case, the ImageNet dataset consisting of 14 million images) but also a large style image dataset to train the Style Prediction Network (in this case the Painter by Numbers dataset, consisting of 80.000 art paintings and the Describable Textures dataset, composed of 5600 textures).", "Fortunately, there are pre-trained models readily available that can be used directly:", "You can also test your own images with this model in the artcopypaste.com web site.", "This model is detailed in the paper \u201cUniversal Style Transfer via Feature Transforms\u201d[11] by Yijun Li, Chen Fang, Jimei Yang, Zhaowen Wang, Xin Lu, Ming-Hsuan Yang", "It tries to discard the need to train the network on the style images while still maintaining visual appealing transformed images.", "It first trains a series of Decoder networks that connect to the different layers of a VGG network. The VGG network acts as an encoder. It is loaded with the ImageNet weights and fixed. Each decoder structure has the inverse structure of the VGG up to the point where the decoder connects to the encoder.", "Using an image dataset, the decoders are trained to regenerate the original image feed to the VGG. And once they have been trained, their weights are fixed for the rest of the process.", "This produces a set of Encoders-Decoders that translate the original image to features with different levels of complexity, but that is capable of reconstructing the original image, either performing a single level transformation or, for better generation quality, a multi-level transformation.", "In practice, the whitening process helps capture content features present in the content and style images. And the coloring process, on the other hand, helps capture style features. Finally, the process blends the content and style features given specified relative weights to each one. This blend is what is then fed to the Decoder to continue the process.", "Some examples of this model are the following:", "This work is far from describing all the existing neural network models to perform the fascinating process of art style transfer, that is in constant evolution.", "The best example is Gatys et al. separation between the Content and the Style of an image, that was taken and expanded by almost all other models.", "I also just wanted to show, using a few examples, how we can get a deeper understanding of what we consider an object in an image, despite all the possible transformations in color and form it can suffer, and get a better idea how we perceive the world we see around us.", "Other related stories: Artificial Intelligence Beginnings (Build a Neural Network from scratch in Python)", "5: Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala, \u201cUnsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks\u201d (2015), https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434", "7: Golnaz Ghiasi, Honglak Lee, Manjunath Kudlur, Vincent Dumoulin, Jonathon Shlens, \u201cExploring the structure of a real-time, arbitrary neural artistic stylization network\u201d (2017), https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.06830", "Your home for data science.
