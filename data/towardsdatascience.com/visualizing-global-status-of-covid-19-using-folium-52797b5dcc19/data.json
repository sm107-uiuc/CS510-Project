With the majority of the world stuck in lockdown with dwindling economic activity, everyone one of us wants to know how well we are doing in terms of curbing this pandemic and when would it finally end?", "Though predicting the end of this pandemic is a million-dollar question and would be a subject of another blog, this article is about understanding and visualizing how all countries are performing to curb its spread. In this blog, we aim to categorize countries into groups based on their confirmed cases, deaths, and patients recovered data and then visualize them on a map.", "We would be using the PPDAC approach to solve this problem. We will start by discussing our problem, followed by planning to solve it. Once we have figured this out, the next step is collecting necessary data and performing our analysis on it. Lastly, we would present our conclusions and communicate our results.", "We would walk through each step one by one.", "The problem we are trying to solve is to categorize different countries into different groups named \u201cLow-Risk\u201d, \u201cHigh-Risk\u201d, \u201cStability\u201d and \u201cRecovery\u201d. At this point, we can only vaguely define these groups. We can label any country as \u201cLow-Risk\u201d if the spread of Covid-19 is increasing, the growth is still liner but there is a prevailing risk for exponential growth. Using similar criteria, a \u201cHigh-Risk\u201d country is where COVID cases are growing exponentially. The \u201cStability\u201d phase can be defined as a situation where cases are decreasing and exponential growth has been halted. Lastly, Recovery is when cases are very low and the country is on the path towards the complete eradication of pandemic. Since new cases cannot be the only matrix for determining the status of any country, we need to have similar criteria for reported deaths and successfully recovered.", "Once we have developed a vague understanding of our tags, we need to develop criteria on how we move from a dataset containing new cases, deaths, and recovered to one with our tags. For this, we have to take a step back and understand the pandemic graph.", "We have seen this graph enough now, explaining all the wisdom of flattening the curve so the health care system is not overstressed and most desperate for medical attention can get it the most. But we can dig a little deeper than this. As we can see from the graph, the number of cases starts to increase more or less linearly after which they increase exponentially. The exponential growth touches the peak, after which it starts to decrease. This is a general trend for any epidemic, it reaches the max, where the trend reversal starts. This point is called the death of the virus, since at this point either all the people are infected and there are no more people left in population to infect causing the virus to die or in the other case, measures like social distancing, lockdown have been taken, which deny new host to the virus resulting in its death, or we might have the ultimate savior, a vaccine essentially killing it.", "With that understanding, we can now look at another interesting feature, the derivative or rate of change at a specific point. This defines how new cases are increasing or decreasing per day. Take a look at the graph below:", "As we can see the derivative demonstrates four specific behaviors. The first one, when the rate of change is positive and linear, after this point it becomes exponentially positive. After reaching the highest point, where the gradient is zero, it starts to become exponentially negative and eventually becoming linearly negative. All of these four different behaviors of derivative can be correlated to our labels, low risk, high risk, stability, and recovery. This idea can be expressed using the image below:", "Wow, we had a lot of information over here and we still have some way to go. By the way, if you are interested in learning how I made these graphs, please check it here.", "Now that, we have defined how derivatives can help us determine the status or labels for any specific country, there is another catch in the tale. We have noticed that the number of cases can still increase even if the country is in the Stability phase, taking it back to low-risk or high-risk phases. To cater for that, we need to somehow check if the situation is getting better or moving towards worse.", "We can do this by comparing derivative at any particular day against the 14 days average derivative(14AVd). If we subtract 14AVd with derivative on a particular day and the value is negative, this means that derivative on a particular day is higher than the 14-day average, implying that the situation is moving towards worse. Vice versa, if the answer is positive, it means the situation is getting better and disease is on its path towards eradication.", "Now, we can apply the above-mentioned rationale to all the data sets for confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery. Once done, we can apply the K-means algorithm to find clusters of groups. Since we are more interested in visualizing and simply understanding the k-means results, we need to reduce our dimensions from three dimensions of new cases, deaths, and recovery into two signals.", "The new case signal is vital in determining the situation of any country. We would call this signal as \u201cStrength Signal\u201d. It determines how fast or slow the virus is spreading in a specific country. However other data sets of deaths and recovery are two outcomes of the disease. Either, anyone can die due to this disease or recover from it. Henceforth, death, and recovery can be combined to generate an impact signal. We can subtract recovery from deaths. If the outcome is a negative number, it means deaths are greater than recovery, and the situation is moving towards worse, and in other cases where the outcome is positive, implying recovery is increasing and the situation is getting better.", "Take a look at the quadrants below, do they make sense?", "With this, we have updated our definitions for different tags, establishing essential links from data sets of new cases, deaths, and recovery to labels or tags for a specific country.", "When we go coding, we will call this approach \u201calgo\u201d. No particular reason for calling this \u201calgo\u201d. It\u2019s just I couldn\u2019t come up with something better :D", "Lastly, we can feed these two signals of \u201cStrength\u201d and \u201cImpact\u201d into the k-means algorithm to generate clusters of the groups, determining the label.", "Huff, if you are following along, pat on the back and cheers.", "We will be using a data set compiled by HDX and would be applying the aforementioned rationale on it using pandas. The data set can be found here. The data set contains the daily count of new confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery for each country and it is updated on an almost daily basis.", "Once we are done with coding, we just need to update the data set and new labels for each country would be calculated automatically.", "Now its time to get our hands dirty with the code. We would start by downloading all the relevant data sets for new confirmed cases, deaths, and recovery from the HDX website here and put them inside a folder named \u201cdatasets\u201d.", "Now some pre-processing is required. Few countries have more than one column associated with themselves, like Australia which has eight columns associated with it, each for its one state. We need to add all these columns to have data for the whole country.", "Next, we need to make each of the data sets as a pandas data frame, extract the last 14 columns of the data, calculate the derivative and use it to calculate the 14 day average for all the countries.", "Full python implementation along with code explanations can be found here. With this, we have completed our data pre-processing exercise and are good to move ahead.", "We have come far enough to implement k means to our data. The idea is to apply k-means clustering among two strength and impact signals, and see if we can find some clusters that are close enough to our earlier developed rationale. The python implementation for KNN can be found here. Once we run this python script, we end up with the cluster graph shown below:", "Now we need to see which cluster can be labeled as \u201cLow Risk\u201d, \u201cHigh Risk\u201d, \u201cStabilization\u201d and \u201cRecovery\u201d based on our previously developed rationale. As we can see, the bulk of the countries are trapped near the origin while there are only a few that are doing exceptionally good or bad in their quest. However, as we can see, the clusters are not formed as we have expected. We have ended having three clusters on the left, marking regions that can be called regions of the low, medium, and high risk while there is exceptionally no country in the recovery phase, painting a picture that is dismal as well as contrary to facts.", "The main problem with our data set is the problem of outliers that are making the clustering process difficult. As we can see, there is a country towards the right side of the graph, doing exceptionally well. But it has made clustering job impossible for us since it\u2019s taken as a cluster of its own. To combat these problems in data, we can try to code our earlier rationale using a simple if-else function and see its results.", "Curious about the country on the right. Check it over here.", "A simple Python implementation of our earlier developed rationale can be found over here. The following graph is generated.", "Yeah, that\u2019s more like it. Accurately painting pictures of our world as per our rationale. However, the outlier on the right mentioned above is missing over here to emphasize the major clusters in the data set. With status labels being assigned, we can move towards the last and most interesting segment of our project, geo data visualization.", "We would be visualizing our data using Geopandas and Folium. Installing geopandas can be tricky at times. If you are struggling at any phase, please take a look at how anaconda\u2019s environment can be created to manage dependencies here.", "Once our environment is created and Geopandas and Folium are up and running, we can implement code here to generate a global visualization of our performance against coronavirus.", "Please use this link to check the status of your country.", "And we have finally ended up visualizing the world status on Covid-19. The results are updated till 11 April 2020. Want to visualize current status? Just cone this repository, change the files in folder dataset and execute jupyter notebook here.", "Up at the end, a histogram showing counts of countries in each status can help us further understand the status of the world.", "As we can visualize, the maximum part of the world is trapped in \u201cLow risk\u201d with decreasing frequency towards stability and recovery. This is still a ray of hope for the world where many countries are recovering. The highest frequency of low risk and high-risk emphasis the importance of still sticking to self-quarantine and social distancing.", "With, data visualization done, it\u2019s important to discuss the shortcomings of our data and algorithm. The strength signal used is not a very strong indicator of the direction, the country is headed in. A random pop up of few cases can drastically impact a country\u2019s status. The other major point of contention is missing testing data. It cannot be stressed enough that the status of any country can be false since it\u2019s not aggressively testing its citizens. In actuality, the virus can be spreading at a much quicker pace than visualized here.", "In the end, I would conclude by saying, by no means I\u2019m an expert in pandemics, but if anyone reading this happens to be one, please feel free to reach out to me with your recommendations. Together we can make this data more accurate and representative of ground realities. Meanwhile, here is the link to the visualization web app, play around, and have fun.", "Special thanks to Ahmad Saeed for his help in this project.", "Your home for data science.
