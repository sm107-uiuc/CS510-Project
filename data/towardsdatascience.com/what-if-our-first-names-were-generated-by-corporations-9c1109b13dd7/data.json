It has always been one of my favorite data sets to explore and this time around I found a rather unique use case.", "While leading analytics at Eventbrite, we use a rather simple framework to help us define success, diagnose issues, and identify opportunities. While I can\u2019t share what I did at Eventbrite, I discovered that I can use the baby name data to simulate a made-up company and use it to demonstrate the measurement framework. Let\u2019s go!", "To get the baby name data set to a usable state we have to set the stage with some made-up background context. Say there was a world where a company was founded in 1990 called iNamed Inc. They come up with names and market them to future parents. They then get royalties for each of their names given to a newborn.", "The going rate for names is $5 for every newborn baby named using one of their names. On top of this flat rate, iNamed Inc. gets an additional $0.50 per letter in that name (this adds a variable component). On top of that, they only get paid if a name has been used for at least 5 babies in any given year (the original data set removes any names occurring less than 5 times to protect against identification).", "In this situation, we can view each unique name like a unique customer or user and the value they bring to the company is the number of babies born with that name. For example, Ayden, Jaxson, Kaydence, Jayceon, and Zayden are all hit names generated by iNamed Inc. between 1990 and 2010 (you could say they have quite a distinctive style). Together these names account for 165k births and $1.3M in revenue. It looks like naming is good business!", "Running the numbers we can plot iNamed Inc.\u2019s revenue. Starting with less than $100k in-year revenue in 1990, iNamed Inc. grew to $1M in 2001, doubled to $2M in 2006, and recently hit $3M at the end of 2018 (depicted in the plot below). Despite the initial growth, revenue growth has been declining in the last decade.", "This s-shape curve is common in many businesses. Revenue starts low and then accelerates as the slope steepens quickly. There then comes a point of inflection and the slope starts to decrease. This decrease is gradual at first, but then suddenly and quickly starts to flatten to where revenue increases only slightly year over year.", "iNamed Inc. is no exception to this s-curve with little growth in the last decade. They only have one more year to come up with good names before the baton is passed to a new name-generating company and understandably, iNamed Inc. wants this last batch of names to be a good one.", "So what happened at iNamed Inc.? What are the root causes of the slowdown in growth? And based on those, what recommendations can we make to the name designers so they can better focus their efforts in 2019? Using a framework can help us answer these questions.", "To understand this business and how its changed, let\u2019s start by building a simple framework. From my experience, using a mathematical-like equation is often the fastest and easiest way to understand what makes a business tick.", "At the end of the day, iNamed Inc., a for-profit company, cares about revenue; thus, let\u2019s start our framework with it at the right end of our equation. As we continue, we will fill in terms to the left of the equal sign all totaling to revenue.", "Next, we have the names themselves \u2014 without them, iNamed Inc. wouldn\u2019t make any money. We\u2019ll add names as a term on the far left end of our equation. In this case, an active name is one that meets the definition of having at least 5 occurrences and therefore qualifies for royalties.", "To fill in the middle, we need to incorporate both of the ways a name company can make money: per birth and per letter.", "In order to make our equation mathematically stable, we need to adjust these two metrics a little. Adding births per name and revenue per birth incorporates both ways we can grow revenue while making the units work. In this case, we assume that revenue per letter does not change and isn\u2019t necessary to explicitly add to the equation.", "Below we see each of our framework metrics across the years.", "By looking at these four plots we can already learn a lot about the business:", "We will dive into each of these three terms and understand how each is changing with sub-metrics of their own. To dig deeper into our Yearly Active Names, let\u2019s go back to our framework and add another layer to it.", "Active Names can be split into two different strategies: the creation (or acquisition) of new names and the retention of returning names. New names are defined as active names that were first considered active names in that year. Returning names are defined by any active name whose first occurrence was from a previous year.", "Here we have two major trends:", "So while iNamed Inc. has not been able to pump out new names like they used to, it appears there has been a larger decline in the popularity of past names. Digging into retention we can cohort each year of new names and plot the percentage of names still in use 1, 10, or 15 years later. This, depicted in the below heat map, helps in the understanding of how the popularity of new name cohorts is changing over the years.", "If you haven\u2019t seen a plot like this before it can be a little overwhelming so let\u2019s go through each aspect individually.", "Using this framework and only 6 plots we now have a rather deep understanding of the iNamed Inc. business, its history, and potential opportunities for improvements. Furthermore, using these same plots we can now set goals and monitor the success of the business moving forward.", "Note that the active creator aspect of the framework by itself assumes each name is worth the same value. In reality, we all know this isn\u2019t true \u2014 as the 80/20 rule tells us that 20% of names account for 80% of births. The framework takes this into account with our second term (births per name). A similar deep dive into what drives births per name and its interaction with active names can help us further understand the business and identify opportunities.", "Overall, when going through this data I was pleasantly surprised to see how closely the name data matched that of a mature company. By using this fictional company as an example I hope you can see how setting up a framework like this can be valuable in diagnosing and understanding any real business. Additionally, because each metric is part of a mathematical equation, it\u2019s easy to drill up and drill down from any metric to another providing a holistic understanding of why we have the goals we do and how they impact the company at large.", "As a lead product analyst at Eventbrite, I\u2019ve set up a very similar (and more complex) version of this framework across our product teams that have helped us monitor product health, quantify success, diagnose issues, and identify opportunities.", "Not only is this a useful framework but also a real strategy. Having teams focus on improving select terms in the equation (i.e. births per name) allows for a variety of strategic directions that all easily relate to revenue. These teams can then further define the framework with their own sub-terms. In practice, these sub-terms often represent hypotheses as to why they believe their users behave the way to do. As teams then experiment, these hypotheses are validated based on whether the metric of focus moves or not.", "Enjoy iNamed Inc.\u2019s top 5 names in each decade below.", "Your home for data science.
