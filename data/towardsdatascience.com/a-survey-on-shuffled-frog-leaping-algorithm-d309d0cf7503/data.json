Other names for the frog jump optimization algorithms include the frog jump algorithm, frog leaping algorithm, and SFLA algorithm. This algorithm was first proposed by Eusuff and Lansey in 2003, although many papers have since been submitted to improve this algorithm. At the bottom of the download link is the main article of the frog optimization algorithm.", "The SFLA algorithm is an algorithm based on Metaheuristic memetics. The memetic algorithm is a population-based algorithm used for complex and significant optimization problems. The main idea of \u200b\u200bthis algorithm is to use a local search method within the structure of the genetic algorithm to improve the aqueous performance of the search intensification process. The memetic algorithm first encrypts the sum of the initial answers, then Ibn algorithm calculates the utility of each response based on a fitness function and generates new solutions.", "The SFLA algorithm is inspired by how frogs search for food. This algorithm uses the Nomometric method to search locally among subgroups of frogs. The frog hybrid jump algorithm uses the hybrid strategy and allows the exchange of messages in local search. This algorithm combines the advantages of the Nomometric algorithm and particle group optimization. In the frog hybrid jump algorithm, words are exchanged not only in local search but also in global search. Thus, Local and Global searches are well combined in this algorithm. The frog hybrid jump algorithm is highly searchable and easy to implement. The frog hybrid jump algorithm can solve many nonlinear, undetectable, and multi-state problems.", "This algorithm combines the advantages of two categories of genetics-based algorithms (such as memetics) and social behavior-based algorithms (such as the PSO bird algorithm). It seeks to strike a balance between extensive scrutiny in the space of possible answers. In this population algorithm, a population of frogs (answers) consists, each frog will have a chromosome-like structure in the genetic algorithm. The whole population of frogs is divided into smaller groups, each group representing different types of frogs that are scattered in different places of the answer space. Each group of frogs then begins a precise local search around their habitat.", "Each frog in each category is influenced by other members of its group as well as other groups. After a few steps, the mixing takes place, and the information is spread among all the groups to establish the condition of convergence and reaching the answer. How to find the best solution in this algorithm consists of two stages of global and local search.", "In the formation of the initial population, first, the number of groups and the number of frogs that should be in each category are determined. If the number of flocks and the number of frogs in each crowd are considered to be 1, then the total number of specimens will be F = m * n. The cost function is then calculated for all samples produced. Sorting and distributing the total number of selected frogs is calculated based on the calculated cost function so that the example with the lowest cost function and the best position is in the first place. The position of the best frog is stored in the whole population. The whole frogs are then divided into m of the selected category so that there is one frog in each class.", "The method of division is as follows: in the ordered population, the first member is in the first category, the second member is in the latter category, and so on until the trustee is selected and placed in the \u201cm\u201d category, then the 1 + m member It will be in the first category and so the process of dividing the frogs will continue.", "The evolution of groups The division of frogs between different categories of each group repeats the evolutionary steps in a predetermined number. After this step, all the frogs are combined, and the global search step is repeated.", "The SFLA algorithm\u2019s meta-exploration strategy is summarized in the two main stages of Global exploration and Local exploration according to the following steps.", "Select M, N. M represents the number of memeplexes, and n represents the number of frogs in each memeplex, so the total population size of the pond is obtained by the relation f = m * n.", "From the available space, sample F virtual frogs U(1), U(2),\u2026, U(F).

Record the position of the best Px frog in the population. (U = Px(1)).", "Divide array X in Y that each of them contains n frogs.", "Each Yk memeplex(k = 1, 2, 3, \u2026\u2026, m), is evolved by the local search frog jump algorithm described below.", "After a certain number of memetic evolution has taken place in each memeplex, place the memeplexes (Y1,\u2026, Ym) in X, so that the relation X = {Y(k), k = 1, 2, \u2026., m} is established. Then, Update the best position of (Px) population.", "Stop if the convergence conditions are met. Otherwise, go to the fourth step of the global search.", "In the fifth stage of the global search, the evolution of each memeplex is performed independently N times. After the memeplexes have evolved, the algorithm returns to the global search to complete the combination. The following describes the details of local search in each memeplex:", "Set im, and iN to zero, im counts the number of memeplexes, and iN counts the number of evolution steps.", "The frogs\u2019 goal is to move to optimal positions by improving their memes. The method of selecting submemeplex is to assign more weights to frogs with higher performance and lower weights to frogs with lower performance values. Weights are assigned by a triangular probability distribution, Pi = {2(j-1 + n) / n(n+1), j = 1, \u2026, n}. To build the submemeplex Z array, q frogs are randomly selected from each of the n frogs in each memeplex. The ones in the submemeplex are denoted by PB and PW, respectively.", "The new position of the worst frog in the submemplex (frog with the worst performance) is calculated by the relation U(q) = S + PW. S is the step size (rate of jump) of the frog, and it will be obtained:", "If the new position is better than the previous one, then replace the new U(q) with the former U(Q) and go to step 8 of the local search. Otherwise, go to step 6 of the local search.", "If no better result is obtained in step 5, then the step size of the frog is calculated using the following equation:", "And the new position (U (q) is calculated by the relation U(q) = S + PW. If U(q) is within the possible space, the value of the new efficiency f(q) is calculated. If f(q) The new one is better than the previous one, then replace the new U(q) with the former U(q) and go to the eighth step of the local search. Otherwise, go to the seventh step of the local search.", "If the new position is not in the achievable area or is not better than the previous position, a new frog (r) is randomly generated in an available location and replaces a frog whose new position is not suitable for advancement. Calculate f(r) and set U(q) equal to r and f(q) equal to f(r).", "After the mimetic change of the worst frogs in the submemeplex, place the frogs in the Z in their original position on Yim.
