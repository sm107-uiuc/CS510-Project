Reaping the benefits of AI systems requires more than solid business cases, well-executed AI implementations, and powerful technology stacks. It often requires the collaboration of AI and people to provide the right experience to customers. But, companies usually struggle to do this well.", "Many analysis highlights how to build AI systems from the lenses of executives and data scientists. Instead, this case study looks at the issues using a personal anecdote and from new perspectives: the ones through the eyes of front line staff and customers. I discuss various practical solutions, such as 80\u201320 rules in AI and smoothing hand-offs between machines and humans, to help teams to overcome the last mile hurdles of AI delivery in the real world.", "Like What You Read?

Jess was in a very good mood because she just came back from a Hackathon (a 3-day ideation and prototyping competition) her company organized. Jess is a Financial Advisor at a bank in Toronto. She was describing how fantastic (and unreal) all the Artificial Intelligence (AI) ideas and prototypes were as we stopped at a vendor booth to update my phone plan.", "A lady, named Joanne and probably in her early 20s, welcomed us and suggested a few good options; I signed up for one of her suggestions. While Joanne was processing the transaction, she turned to Jess and said: \u201cLooks like there is a special offer for you, would you like to hear about it?\u201d.", "Joanne looked at the screen for 2 seconds and said: \u201cWe\u2019d like to offer you 10G of data for $75 per month. It\u2019s an amazing deal!\u201d", "Jess looked puzzled and said: \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense. I am only paying $65 for the same amount of data and service.\u201d", "All of us laughed to defuse the awkwardness. And Joanne went back to complete my transaction. We left in 5 minutes.", "On our way home, Jess mentioned how disappointing the AI was, and joked how big companies could not get it right and miss a sale opportunity. She said the AI prototypes she saw at the hackathon is much more capable.", "I said: \u201cWell, that\u2019s the difference between AI in the real world and the lab\u201d. She looked impressed at what I said, finally.", "Let\u2019s align on the background and the definition of AI systems before breaking our experience down to highlight a few common issues of AI systems. Feel free to skip this if you are familiar with the concept.", "How was Jess\u2019s offer generated? In this story, the offer Joanne presented was generated by a Recommender System (RS). RS helps drive sales by analyzing customer behaviours and offering personalized products and services. Some RS rely on a machine learning algorithm called Collaborative Filtering to decide what the best offers are for customers; some RS rely on simpler algorithms, such as logistic regression or rule-based methods, while some use more advanced algorithms, like Deep Reinforcement Learning. Amazon and many e-Commerce and digital companies were early adopters of RS. Many traditional businesses (e.g. Telco and banking) followed shortly after and are in the journey of defining their own ways.", "What is an AI system? RS is an example of an AI system. More specifically, AI systems are full-stack solutions (e.g. front and back ends) that offer a context-aware experience to users by processing a large amount of data using Big Data technology and choosing appropriate interactions based on autonomous machine learning algorithms.", "There are a few distinctive differences between an AI system and traditional software solutions. Here is the most important one: AI systems interact with users based on autonomous and continuous learning and decisioning, instead of following a set of static and pre-designed rules by designers and engineers.", "Let\u2019s connect the dots. In the story, the RS recognized that Joanne (an end-user) was discussing product changes (context awareness) with Jess and me; it provided an offer (an interaction based on Big Data and machine learning) that Joanne could share. The offer would probably be different given another customer and context (e.g. calling to complain about services, instead of considering product change). The RS is a full-stack solution because it has a front-end interface to interact with Joanne and a back-end to support data storage, machine learning, and system integration.", "There are many other examples of AI systems, such as the self-driving car, robo-advisor, Alpha-Go, Siri, robots from Boston Dynamics, Roomba, etc.", "Now, what\u2019s wrong? The story highlights a number of common ways an AI system can fail in the real world. Let\u2019s break it down.", "This example highlights a fundamental and common issue: the disconnect between humans and AI systems. Human-AI collaboration is the last mile problem of AI systems.", "UX designers may argue that this is just a typical solution that was poorly designed. Applying Design Thinking and best practices of interface design should solve the problem. Correct, but only to some degree. The unique feature of autonomous interaction requires us to think deeper. If we cannot fully control and comprehend the responses from AI systems, how do we pre-design the key, if not all, aspects of the user interaction?", "So, what are the solutions? Here I propose a number of tactical solutions to help companies to maximize the promises of AI systems.", "Asking the AI systems to provide the right answers 100% of the time is impossible, both mathematically and practically. So, the best we should aim for is having the right enough answer with a reasonable amount of investment. To do this, I suggest exploring the following,", "2. From Poor to Better Execution", "Most AI systems rely on human staffs to act at some point, good execution is the key to realizing the promised business value. Good execution comes down to this one component: smooth hand-offs between machines and humans. To achieve smooth hand-offs, both AI systems and humans need to work together\u2026", "Imagine this: the RS provides three simple lines that Joanne can digest and follow in less than 10 seconds (or even shorter)\u2026", "Working with AI systems is more complicated, but the rewards \u2014 material business benefits and more engaged and valued staff \u2014 can be worth it.", "3. From Troublesome to Engaging Feedback Mechanism", "Lastly, the true power of AI systems comes from their capabilities to learn and improve. However, they cannot do it without meaningful feedback from the environment, front line staff in this case. Meaningful feedback refers to information that describes the whys of customer behaviours. Many front line staff ignore the opportunity to capture and share this information due to clumsy UI and a lack of incentive. Here are a few simple considerations\u2026", "Once the feedback is captured, data science teams need to tie it with the learning mechanism of the AI systems. It is tricky from a technical standpoint, there are lots of considerations around the timing of processing. Yet, once implemented, AI systems can learn from the unique information about customers, fix flaws in the systems\u2019 learning, and improve continuously and autonomously. More meaningful feedback leads to smarter AI systems that can provide exponential business benefits.", "By exploring and implementing these considerations, the benefit is to increase the probability of success of the AI system, especially when they interact with humans in the real world.", "The RS example only revealed some, but representative, issues of AI systems. As the investment of AI translate into real-world solutions \u2014 many will interact closely with front line staff and customers \u2014 companies should pause and sanity checks their thinking on the human-AI collaboration experience. Here is where disconnections usually happen. Also, keep in mind that many best practices in technology development, such as \u201cstart small and iterate\u201d and \u201cbeing user-centric\u201d, still apply.", "Overcoming the last mile problems is crucial in realizing the heart-warming promises of AI. Having a holistic diagnosis and surgical fixes is critical. Early and lightweight solutions that improve the interactions, executions, and feedback mechanics can help companies to avoid major setbacks in deploying AI systems in the real world.", "Like What You Read?
