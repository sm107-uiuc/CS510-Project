How do we know if a medical test is reliable enough to use in a clinical setting?", "While a highly accurate coronavirus test may be useful where there is a higher incidence, why is it less informative in populations with lower rates of disease? This sounds counterintuitive and confusing, but does have applications for determining the utility of your own binary classifiers!", "We define the validity of a test by measuring its specificity and sensitivity. Quite simply, we want to know how often the test identifies true positives and true negatives.", "Our sensitivity describes how well our test catches all of our positive cases. Sensitivity is calculated by dividing the number of true-positive results by the total number of positives (which include false positives).", "Our specificity describes how well our test classifies negative cases as negatives. Specificity is calculated by dividing the number of true-negative results by the total number of negatives (which include false negatives).", "The important question is whether a model is meaningful? Simply going by sensitivity and specificity rates won\u2019t cut it! To determine how meaningful or clinically useful a test might be for a population, we need underlying information about the expected incidence or prevalence of a disease. We use Bayes\u2019 Theorem to understand this:", "We take a population of 1 000 000 people, where 10% of them have a certain disease. We use a very reliable test with 98% specificity and sensitivity. Here Event A describes the unconditional probability of this disease in the population. P(A) = 0.10.", "Event B is the unconditional probability of our test coming up positive. We can calculate P(B) by looking at how many total positives we would get. In this population, we expect 98 000 true positives, calculated by multiplying the disease rate by the total population and sensitivity. For false positives, we take the probability of not having this disease (0.90) and multiple it by the population and (1-Specificity). So we get 18 000 false positives in this scenario. Our P(B) or total positives is then 11.6%.", "Now things get a little bit more complicated. All of these values describe how accurate this test is for this population. But it doesn\u2019t tell us the chances that one person who tests positive has the disease. We need to apply Bayes\u2019 Theorem, using these unconditional values as our prior assumption.", "Then if someone takes a test that comes out positive, what is the probability that the disease is present?", "Here we can start to define our variables.", "So here we see that even with high sensitivity and specificity, the test may not be as accurate in some populations. Using Bayes\u2019 Theorem, we can calculate this quite easily.", "What would happen though if the disease was less common in our population? Recall that sensitivity and specificity remain at 98%.", "Since the disease is now rarer, the posterior probability of receiving a positive test result when you have the disease is lower. As the prevalence of disease decreases within the population, so does our positive predictive value!", "When generating a biomedical test or another model with binary classification, keep in mind when it might be useful. Looking at how well our test works for our specific population because with a low enough prevalence of disease \u2014 it might not be very useful!", "It follows that if you\u2019re generating a classifier for something that might be rare in the general population, you need very high sensitivity and specificity for a high positive predictive value!", "Your home for data science.
