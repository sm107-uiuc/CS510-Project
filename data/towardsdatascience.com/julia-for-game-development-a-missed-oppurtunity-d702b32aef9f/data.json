Though in a way it is certainly similar to writing any other software, something about all of the pieces coming into play in a marvelous way fascinates me about programming a game. Here is a short demo I recorded to show the modular vector image data loading algorithm I created that I put on Youtube for those who are interested:", "Bu t all of these development endeavors in a series of different languages including C#, GDscript (Godot) and C++ (Steamworks API) have got me thinking a lot about my favorite programming language:", "After all, Julia and game programming seem like a match made in heaven. Games require a quick language based on data. Julia is substantially faster than the scripting king of game programming right now. On top of that, Julia code can be written quickly and efficiently, especially compared to a language like C++.", "There are two main languages that are used for modern game development (for the most part,) C# and C++. C++ has been a dominant force driving the computer industry for decades now and is certainly a great language. C++ has a fair share of domain advantages, being that it is object-oriented and some-what duck-typed. This is a huge step away from the other language that is more than likely used far more often, C#. C# is a statically-typed, high-level scripting language that can be compared to a language like Python,", "though it might be a little more difficult.", "If you are a proper Julian, you might have realized that we could say the same thing about Julia.", "\u201c Julia is a statically-typed, high-level scripting language that can be compared to a language like Python.\u201d", "The biggest down-side to using C# is probably its proprietary licensing. C# is a weird case where only certain components are open-source and others are hidden from view. In addition, it goes without saying that C# is indeed slower than Julia.", "C++ on the other hand is probably beyond sufficient for game development. The problem? Taking a jump from a language like C# or Python to C++ can be jarring. I actually learned C++ as my first programming language when I was much younger for whatever reason, and", "Using C++ now frustrates me in a way because I can\u2019t fly through functions like I could in a higher-level language, and an operation that would normally take me thirty minutes to program quickly turns into an hour to an hour and a half. Of course, this isn\u2019t the fault of C++, but to me, it wouldn\u2019t make a lot of sense to use C++ for everything when Julia is able to do what I need to do.", "I think one of Julia\u2019s biggest advantages in the game-development world would be its tremendous speed. Julia\u2019s syntax is far easier than C#\u2019s while running at about 1.5X the speed. Going from C# to Julia actually wouldn\u2019t be too big of a jump, either. Both Julia and C# are statically-typed programming languages that focus on the immutability of data and type dispatch.", "Julia has precisely the \u201c right slowness\u201d for games, too. Julia\u2019s biggest hindrance in terms of speed is probably pre-compiling and startup times. While these issues might be significant in some cases, Julia is still faster than C#, and startup times in games translate to load-times. And with the simple observation that most loading time is spent moving data, not loading modules, I think it\u2019s safe to say this concern would be nil.", "There are already Julia developers working on some really cool Julia Game projects that might actually surprise you. Here\u2019s a map loader for .BSP map files:", "And here is a very simple paddle-ball clone written in Julia:", "On top of these showcases, we also have the adequate tools necessary for game development inside of Julia. For example, SDL2 (low-level) and SFML (high-level) both have Julia ports that are definitely worth checking out.", "There is one significant downside to Julia for game development at this current point in time. Not only is this a problem for game developers, but also software-engineers, scripters, and even data-scientists.", "Julia does have a toolchain for compiling executables, but it just isn\u2019t there yet. It seems like a lot of these are still in development and not necessarily prioritized by Julia computing. So what do I think?", "I think that Julia definitely has the potential to overtake a language like C# mono or C++ due to its easy syntax and quick speed, but I think Julia still has a certain distance to tread before this is a reality. Though I will of course always be focused on the statistical and analytical side of Julia primarily, I would be absolutely delighted if better compiled executables in 1.0 came into fruition. From what I know about Julia\u2019s compiled executables (I've tried, but the final .x64_x86 files have never run,) they are doing some kind of strange system state saving for dependency environments. And I guess that is where I\u2019ll leave it, Julia took everything; a package manager, a language, statistical programming and just made it better. I understand why implementing something like compiled executables without natively-supported headers might be a real challenge. So with that in mind, I will wait patiently,", "but you can\u2019t expect me not to get excited!", "Your home for data science.
