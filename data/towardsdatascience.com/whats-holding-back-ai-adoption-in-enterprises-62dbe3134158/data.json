Data is large and a highly regarded one in the data community. I\u2019ve always looked up to the event and was excited to be accepted to speak at Strata London in the past week. Here\u2019s a roundup of the event and some key learnings.", "With carefully curated content from academia, enterprises, and researchers there was a lot to look forward to. O\u2019Reilly events are known for their exceptional focus on diversity, and the 4-day event brought together an interesting collection of talks and speakers from around the world.", "There was a mix of different session formats to serve a little bit of everything: 16-hour trainings, 4-hour workshops, business case studies, executive briefings, and technical deep-dives. The conference chairs were deeply knowledgeable & easily accessible, which made the hallway chats enjoyable.", "Here\u2019s a recap of learnings from the top trends covered in the conference. I\u2019ve linked to the most interesting ones that also have public session decks. Given the crazy number of parallel track sessions (13 when I counted, more on that below), this listing is biased based on the ones that I could attend or track.", "Enterprises are struggling with the adoption of AI, and this was a recurring theme across tracks including the keynote by Ben on \u2018Sustaining machine learning in the enterprise\u2019. From a recent O\u2019Reilly survey, here are top bottlenecks that are holding back the adoption:", "While company culture can be a non-starter, I\u2019ve seen the top 5 in this list across clients. There were sessions covering each of these challenges, including a separate track on enterprise case studies. Few noteworthy sessions: \u2018Why managing machines is harder than you think\u2019 by Pete Skomoroch, and Shingai Manjengwa\u2019s on the next best alternative to hiring unicorn data scientists.", "The keynote by Cait O\u2019Riordan on how the Financial Times adopted data science to hit 1 million paying subscribers a year ahead of their target, was outstanding.", "\u201cData governance is to data assets, as HR is to people\u201d was a good analogy from Paco Nathan in his session on Overview of Data Governance. Starting with a historical evolution of data and enterprise architectures, it covered the issues facing different segment of companies today and provided a future outlook.", "Sundeep Reddy\u2019s session offered a contrasting perspective of public governance and data, by looking at India\u2019s booming digital economy and the dilemma faced by a billion people navigating the public rollout of India stack.", "A session provocatively titled, \u2018Using data for evil\u2019 drew large crowds and was the fifth part in a series by Duncan Ross. Complemented with a session on AI for Good, he shared examples from DataKind UK on doing good with data. The dangerous contributions of AI to fake news was covered in Alex Adam\u2019s session on Synthetic video generation and on how it can be detected.", "I spoke on how AI can save our planet\u2019s biodiversity, using case studies from Gramener\u2019s work with Microsoft AI for Earth. The 4 examples showed how NGOs are using deep learning solutions to detect, identify, count & protect endangered species.", "Who best to talk about the latest in text analytics than Mathew Honnibal, the creator of the wildly popular open-source NLP library on Python, Spacy. He shared tips on improving the success of NLP projects. The session on predicting policy change in China using just the text archives of \u2018People\u2019s Daily\u2019 was very intriguing for its simple, but sound methodology.", "Scarcity of data or labeled corpus is a major challenge in NLP, and Yves Peirsman\u2019s session on Dealing with data scarcity in NLP had some useful tips on handling this.", "No conversation in AI today is complete without talking about interpretability and explainability. The session by Eitan Anzenberg explained the need for explainability and covered frameworks like LIME. Yiannis Kanellopoulos covered case studies on accountability of models in Fintech.", "Apart from these themes, there were technical sessions covering several aspects of streaming data processing, implementation, and productionization of ML algorithms on popular platforms/packages such as Spark, Tensorflow, AWS, Google Cloud, Azure, R.", "Sessions of such variety meant running 13 parallel tracks through the day, and the printed agenda was an unwieldy, extra-wide landscape sheet! While this gave an interesting mix of topics, picking one posed a big dilemma. This problem of plenty also had the negative effect of reducing engagement levels (and attendance) in the sessions.", "Here are the full event agenda and listing of all publicly available slide decks.", "There were ample networking opportunities with this highly engaged audience of practitioners. AI was not just a part of the sessions, but was on the exhibit floor, with drinks dished out through the day by Makr Shakr\u2019s robotic bartender!", "If you\u2019re wondering where to get started for an invite to one of the upcoming O\u2019Reilly events, this ebook is a useful resource. Written by Alistair Croll, the person behind Strata, it talks about the way events managed, how talks are selected, and what causes heartburn to the organizers. It offers an inside view on what it takes to submit a quality entry and get picked. A useful, quick read I\u2019d recommend.", "Your home for data science.
