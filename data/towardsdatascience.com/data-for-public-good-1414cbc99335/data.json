Well, with recent revolution in big data and data science, a few big changes are taking place in this area over the last few years:", "Public sector organizations mostly collect and analyse data on an ad hoc basis. Only designated national agencies (e.g. statistics bureau) consistently collect, host and disseminate data on annual basis (e.g. population census, household surveys, agricultural census etc.). Typically these datasets have limited number of features and observations, and they are usually small samples taken from large populations.", "These data collection efforts have been almost exclusively government endeavors. Non-government organizations would rarely venture in this area due to a lack of required resources and expertise. They would typically depend on quasi-quantitative approaches or government reports for their business decisions.", "Things have changed recently. The universe of big data, data science and machine learning that is transforming the business sector is also hitting public sector enterprises. Now there is an ever-increasing awareness of the power of data in decision-making process. The nature of data is also changing \u2014 for example, freely available remote sensing datasets are now available on many aspects of social, economic and environmental systems. However, public sector capacity to manage and analyse these large amounts of data has not changed much, mostly due to the lack of computational resources and human capacity.", "The second line of transformations taking place in public sector is in the adoption of new methods and techniques to collect, store, access and analyse data. In the recent past the valuable data and information collected by government agencies were greatly underutilized. Only few people, mostly academic researchers, would gain access to those data and use them for academic research.", "Tools and techniques applied were also restricted. Data analysts would do rudimentary analyses (some descriptive statistics, frequency/ count tables, bar diagrams, time series plots or pie charts) and put them in annual reports and call it done! Policy decisions were informed by data at best, rather than driven by data.", "Application of data science in public service is currently wide ranging and is widening every day. Here are just a few of many:", "Crime management: Local law enforcement agencies often do not have the necessary resources for crime management in communities. Novel algorithms are now being applied using a combination of historical crime rate, socio-economic data and other data sources to predict crime hotspots. These new tools are helping law enforcement efficiently allocate their limited resources to ensure public safety in communities.", "Agriculture: machine learning has been a game changer in agriculture. Reducing water use by automated irrigation system, disease detection, yield prediction and weed detection are a few of the many applications that are transforming agriculture.", "Medicine: The following quote from Stanford\u2019s Biomedical Data Science Initiatives summarizes the enormous possibilities of data science in medicine:", "\u201cFrom curing individual patients to healing entire populations, we are leading the way to a healthier world. A world where your data transforms not just your health, but the health of people everywhere. Where doctors instantly search millions of medical records to find what worked for patients just like you. Where new drugs are developed \u2014 and new uses are identified for existing drugs \u2014 at rapid speeds. Where we can finally predict diseases in both people and populations and prevent illness before it even occurs. By harnessing the power of large-scale computing and data analysis, we\u2019ll make this world a reality.\u201d", "Humanitarian programs: From rebuilding Haiti in the aftermath of earthquake, to fighting Ebola in Liberia, data science tools have helped vulnerable people around the world to recover from crises. Early warning systems are also being tested to proactively manage some of the big challenges humanity is facing.", "Social programs: Just check out the DataKind projects to find out the enormous possibilities in wide ranging issues data science can help with. Mapping poverty, predicting human rights abuse, finding missing children, preventing home fire injuries, forecasting water demand \u2026 what not!", "Environmental management: Data science tools and techniques are bringing tremendous potential in sustainable environmental management \u2014 from getting insights by analyzing large datasets, to predicting where the next forest fire will occur, to classifying land use systems using remote sensing and deep learning.", "Wildlife monitoring: Wildlife researchers and managers are installing automated cameras in the wild to take animal photos. Millions of those images are being processed and analysed using machine learning and cloud computing technologies for taxonomic classification, measuring diversity and monitoring wildlife movement.", "Global development: Data and technology is constantly changing our knowledge about some of the biggest global problems and how to tackle them. Measuring and monitoring progress on global agenda such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is one such indicative example.", "Tackling big challenges requires big efforts, but data science applications in public good have mostly been subsidized by organizations and individuals. But there are just too many problems that are waiting for a solution. UNHCR\u2019s data scientist, for example, outlined 10 data science challenges that humanitarian organizations are facing. This is just 10 big problems in one sector. There are plenty of others in all sectors of the society needing help.", "Your home for data science.
