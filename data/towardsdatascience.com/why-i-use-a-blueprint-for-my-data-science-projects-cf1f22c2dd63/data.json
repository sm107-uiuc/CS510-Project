Of course, I had to keep in mind some key features, such as:", "A couple of options came to me, and the first one was to work with Jupyter notebooks. Notebooks are efficient as they allow to code, document, and report with one single toolkit!", "The problem with notebooks is that it is pretty hard to do collaborative work with other team members. Also, I have always believed that a notebook was not the perfect framework to perform unit tests. In the end, it is very tempting to deliver a notebook as the output of my projects, but most of the time, this is not what my bosses/clients were expecting. People are buying an app, and notebooks are not apps.", "I have spent some time on the Internet looking for a solution that could meet all my needs, and after a while, I finally found a small python package called cookiecutter.", "What cookiecutter does is simply use a blueprint of your project, and map it with a JSON configuration file. Your blueprint will set all the variables specific to your project. The massive advantage of working like this is that you can reuse your blueprint for as many projects as you need. All you have to do is to set the variables cookiecutter needs, to make this blueprint your project.", "You can access cookiecutter\u2019s full documentation with the link below, but all you need to know is simply how to install it :)", "That said, I chose not to waste any more time and started implementing my blueprint. I have released it, and it is available on GitHub: https://github.com/mysketches/data-science-blueprint", "I have tried to develop a template, keeping in mind to :", "After a few experiments, I think I have reached that goal, and this is what I\u2019d like to share with today.", "Before installing the blueprint, you must know that it is heavily working with Docker. Therefore, you must have Docker installed on your machine. You must also have the rights to run Docker without being an admin. If this is not the case, please have a look at the piece of documentation that I have written: https://data-science-blueprint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation/requirements.html", "To interact with the blueprint, you will also need to have access to the make command, to run directives defined in the Makefile file.", "Installing the blueprint comes with two steps. First, you shall install the cookiecutter package. To install cookiecutter, please first install git and pip. Then, you can run this command:", "After installing cookiecutter, you can install my data science blueprint:", "Cookiecutter will prompt you to set values for the blueprint parameters. On your console, during the installation of the blueprint, this should look like this:", "The process is iterative, one question after the other. And that\u2019s it!", "To benefit from the Jupyter notebooks and the shells, you will first need to build your environment. Move to the root of your project, where the file Makefile is located, and type in the following command:", "After your environment is built, you can start it, and this will launch the Docker containers that will give you access to your Jupyter notebooks and your shell.", "For the sake of this demonstration, I have written a bunch of python scripts to load some data, and let you play with it. I guess this will help make this blueprint your own, and make it easier to update it to your needs.", "I\u2019ve decided to work with a data sample of the visitors and travellers arriving in New Zealand from June 2014 to June 2019. Read the full description of the dataset here: https://www.stats.govt.nz/information-releases/international-travel-june-2019", "I have created a Jupyter notebook to present a brief exploration of the data, and a script that operates some plain transformations on the data.", "To load the data, you can use the following command:", "You are of course invited to update/remove those samples as you wish.", "The data science blueprint allows you to load Jupiter notebooks where you can create your exploration/machine learning notebooks, and version them in your project, with the rest of the code.", "When your environment has started, you can access your notebooks on a browser, to this URL: http://localhost:8888 (port 8888 is the default)", "You also have access to a shell that you can plug in thanks to this command:", "As you are in your environment, you\u2019ll see the prompt changing. From the terminal, you have now access to a Python env where your project has been deployed as a package. You can, therefore, write scripts like this one, and import your project as a package.", "The blueprint also provides command-line interfaces. You will then be able to call some modules of your project from a terminal. Instead of opening a Python shell, you can install your project as a Python package, and call your modules directly as if you launched a program.", "First, you will need to install dependencies and package your project.", "Once your project is deployed as a package, it is available to all the Python scripts that would run on the machine where it was deployed. For the sake of this tutorial, I have developed a small command-line script that generates a list of subsamples of lorem ipsum text. This is quite trivial, but the purpose of this demonstration is just to show you how easy it is to call.", "The full documentation will get into more detail about how to set up endpoints for your projects.", "You can first call the command line and get info about how to use it", "The data action Let\u2019s call the lorem command then and generate some text.", "The program will output a list of lorem ipsum\u2026", "I thought it was essential to give you the chance to work your project with tools to test your code. This is something you can easily do with the make command:", "This will give you the output of your unit tests", "You can also do some code coverage, to check whether unit tests cover all your code", "This is the output you will see", "Thanks to the flake8 package, it is possible to test the coding conventions of your project. This will be very useful to ensure that the coding requirements are respected. This is very valuable, especially when working with a team with many engineers.", "You can launch the code profiling with this command:", "If you have coding conventions errors, they will automatically be reported in the console like this:", "The blueprint that I have been working on, shows some features that \u2014 I guess \u2014 could interest you, especially if you wish to create a data science project:", "I have also spent some time writing decent documentation for this project so that you can get to know how to use all its features. You can access the full documentation here: https://data-science-blueprint.readthedocs.io/", "But the most important for me is that you can make this project your own. This is important to me that you can fork it, reach out to the source code, and update it according to your needs.", "Here is the link to the Github project: https://github.com/mysketches/data-science-blueprint", "Your home for data science.
