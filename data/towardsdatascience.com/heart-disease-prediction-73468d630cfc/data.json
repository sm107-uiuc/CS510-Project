Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease, heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias) and heart defects you\u2019re born with (congenital heart defects), among others.", "The term \u201cheart disease\u201d is often used interchangeably with the term \u201ccardiovascular disease\u201d. Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart\u2019s muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.", "Heart disease is one of the biggest causes of morbidity and mortality among the population of the world. Prediction of cardiovascular disease is regarded as one of the most important subjects in the section of clinical data analysis. The amount of data in the healthcare industry is huge. Data mining turns the large collection of raw healthcare data into information that can help to make informed decisions and predictions.", "According to a news article, heart disease proves to be the leading cause of death for both women and men. The article states the following :", "About 610,000 people die of heart disease in the United States every year\u2013that\u2019s 1 in every 4 deaths.1", "Heart disease is the leading cause of death for both men and women. More than half of the deaths due to heart disease in 2009 were in men.1", "Coronary Heart Disease(CHD) is the most common type of heart disease, killing over 370,000 people annually.", "Every year about 735,000 Americans have a heart attack. Of these, 525,000 are a first heart attack and 210,000 happen in people who have already had a heart attack.", "This makes heart disease a major concern to be dealt with. But it is difficult to identify heart disease because of several contributory risk factors such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, abnormal pulse rate, and many other factors. Due to such constraints, scientists have turned towards modern approaches like Data Mining and Machine Learning for predicting the disease.", "Machine learning (ML) proves to be effective in assisting in making decisions and predictions from the large quantity of data produced by the healthcare industry.", "In this article, I will be applying Machine Learning approaches(and eventually comparing them) for classifying whether a person is suffering from heart disease or not, using one of the most used dataset \u2014 Cleveland Heart Disease dataset from the UCI Repository.", "As always, you can find the code used in this article in the Github Repository.", "The dataset used in this article is the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset taken from the UCI repository.", "The dataset consists of 303 individuals data.

I have imputed the mean in place of the null values however one can also delete these rows entirely.", "Now let us divide the data in the test and train set.In this project, I have divided the data into an 80: 20 ratio. That is, the training size is 80% and testing size is 20% of the whole data.", "All the models discussed above are applied to get the results.", "The evaluation metric used is the confusion matrix.", "The confusion matrix displays the correctly predicted as well as incorrectly predicted values by a classifier.The sum of TP and TN, from the confusion matrix, is the number of correctly classified entries by the classifier.", "Similarly let us look at all the confusion matrices for each classifier.", "To sum up, here are all the accuracies at once for all the classifiers.", "We see that the highest accuracy for the test set is achieved by Logistic Regression and SVM which is equal to 80.32%.The highest accuracy for the training set is 100% achieved by Decision Tree.", "The algorithms are implemented with the default parameters only.", "Heart Disease is one of the major concerns for society today.", "It is difficult to manually determine the odds of getting heart disease based on risk factors.
