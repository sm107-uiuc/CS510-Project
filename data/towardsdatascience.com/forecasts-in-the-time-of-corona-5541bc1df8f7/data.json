My answers all boil down to: \u201cbuddy, right now I can barely give you an accurate forecast of what\u2019s going to happen this afternoon\u201d. But that got me thinking: how should we be approaching forecasting at the moment? And what even is forecasting anyway?", "The underlying problem with forecasting is that we can\u2019t actually predict the future. When we say we\u2019re going to \u201cforecast\u201d something that we\u2019re actually saying is that we\u2019re going to do one of three things (or a combination):", "Here, we focus on the history of the metric we\u2019re trying to forecast, and assume the patterns in that history are going to persist into the future. So if we\u2019re forecasting ice-cream sales we\u2019ll only look at data on previous ice-cream sales, and assume the peaks in summer and weekends will continue.", "Once we\u2019ve made that assumption, all we need to do is build models that accurately describe that history (or \u201ctime series\u201d), and then use those to project forward into the future. Models such as ARIMA fit into this category.", "Here, one builds a model of the metric one is interested in, using data on the various factors that have the most influence on it, or correlation with it. Our ice-cream forecast, in this case, would involve understanding the relationship between ice-cream sales and temperature, rainfall, week day, school holidays etc. A key point here is you need to both be confident you\u2019ve captured all the key factors that influence the forecast metric, and have a good forecast of those factors themselves. So if you have a bad weather forecast, that\u2019s going to hurt your ability to build a good ice-cream sales forecast off it.", "Weather forecasts and predictions of sporting events and elections are good examples of this kind of forecasting.", "Here we make no attempt to divine trends or relationships from data, and instead just imagine what could happen and then see how that would play out in the various systems/processes we\u2019re interested in. You may be thinking \u201chang on, that\u2019s just guessing?\u201d, and yes, that\u2019s exactly what it is. But that\u2019s also the appeal: you\u2019re not lulling people into a false sense of security with seemingly-precise numbers, and the human imagination can do a better job than any machine in speculating how once-in-a-lifetime scenarios might play out.", "This is a simple approach, but more common than you might think. Pension, investment, and mortgage providers do a lot of this, and a bank\u2019s stress test is essentially a pessimistic scenario analysis. Obviously these tend to be more useful before everything has gone sideways but can be useful in the midst of a crisis when one isn\u2019t sure how things are going to play out.", "For forecasting to work you need to be confident in two things:", "The more eagle-eyed of you may have spotted an issue with the second point: if said major events are unpredictable, how do we know there aren\u2019t enough of them to sway the outcome? Let\u2019s explore that point a bit more with an example.", "Imagine a forecaster who works for the UK government, and is tasked by the tourism minister with forecasting how many international visitors will arrive in the UK by month next year. Looking at the data, they think to themselves: \u201cwell this looks pretty regular and stable, this shouldn\u2019t be too hard\u201d, and build a forecast like the one below using a seasonal ARIMA model. They include some nice, clear 95% prediction intervals so that the tourism minister can get a feel for how much uncertainty there is around this forecast.", "How did they do? Whilst I don\u2019t have the updated numbers for visitor counts to the UK, at the time of writing air tickets are down to almost zero, according to industry data helpfully summarized by BCG here, so we can assume total visitors are doing something similar. In summary, not great.", "What happened? Well, one could argue that nothing really went wrong: there\u2019s a 95% lower bound prediction interval and we exceeded it, but we should expect that 1 time in 20, so, what\u2019s the fuss? The problem with this reasoning is that we didn\u2019t just exceed the lower bound a bit. We crashed through it and didn\u2019t stop until we hit the ground. Using the normal distribution assumptions underlying the prediction intervals, this kind of event has a probability of 0.000002% i.e. we should only observe something like this once every 5 million years!", "Rather, the problem is that the prediction intervals are only a statement about aleatoric uncertainty, based on what the algorithm has observed in the data it was trained on. Put another way, forecast prediction intervals are themselves only a forecast of the uncertainty, and so only show the minimum bounds of real-world uncertainty.", "In fairness, epistemic uncertainty is un-quantifiable (if it was quantifiable, it would be aleatoric) and so hard to show on a chart. One thing the forecaster could have done would have been to accompany the forecast with a view on how the crises of 2001 and 2008 affected travel numbers. This would have made it clear that they were just offering a \u201cnormal year\u201d forecast and in the real world, anything can happen. Hindsight is a wonderful thing.", "As we\u2019ve seen, whatever forecast you happen to be looking at is going to be a bit wrong most of the time, and a lot wrong some of the time. Because of this, it\u2019s vital to always know how much error you are OK with, and what you\u2019ll do when errors exceed those bounds.", "The most important part of any forecaster\u2019s job, therefore, is to understand what kind of errors the client or system one is forecasting for is most sensitive to. If you\u2019re forecasting for inventory, will it be more expensive to over-stock or run out? If you\u2019re forecasting to set a target, will it be better if targets are routinely beaten or frequently missed? A common mistake forecasters can make is to sink hours into different forecasting techniques and models, but only minutes working to understand how the inevitable errors will impact the system or client they\u2019re building a forecast for.", "Luckily, this kind of thinking comes naturally to us when the decision is framed properly. I\u2019ll bet the last time you threw a party you bought more food and drink than you ended up needing. Far from being irrational, this is because the cost of over-forecasting is low (excess can be stored cheaply) and the cost of under-forecasting is high (is there anything sadder than a party that\u2019s run out of booze?).", "As you\u2019ve probably gathered, data-based forecasting isn\u2019t going to be all that helpful over the coming months, as we have large amounts of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. We don\u2019t have a good handle of how, or whether, people will want to travel in the months ahead. Even when we do start to understand that, any forecast built off that understanding runs a high risk of getting shredded by unpredictable events, such as a second wave, political decisions, economic impacts (can\u2019t fly if there are no airlines), or, on a happier note, new treatments or vaccines.", "So what can we do if we can\u2019t forecast? The most effective approaches are going to be a combination of:", "Using Scenario analysis to outline several possible outcomes, and mapping how they impact what you\u2019re interested in. Note that this doesn\u2019t have to be fancy, and in many industries and fields there are many of these already being developed that can be used off-the-shelf. In doing this, it can be tempting to pick a \u201cmost likely\u201c scenario, based on the information you have, and then design plans around that. But that\u2019s falling back into the forecast trap: the information you have now can be irrelevant tomorrow.", "Clearly assess the sensitivities to risk of the client, system, or decision(s) you\u2019re making, and compare those sensitivities to the possible scenarios. Note that you should be trying to make decisions that will maximize your ability to meet your objectives regardless of which scenario plays out, even if it\u2019s not the optimal one in each particular scenario. Your risk tolerance also comes into play here; you may be prepared to accept a decision that runs the risk of ruin in some scenarios if there\u2019s a big pay-off in others.", "Finally, given circumstances are likely to continue to evolve quickly, exploring how you can improve your ability to be flexible and responsive will enable you more effectively to meet that change, and less reliant on the guesswork inherent in scenario analysis.", "So when would be the right time to return to forecasting? Well, if possible you may not want to. Forecasting is an uncertain business, and the less you can base your decision making on it, the more robust your decision making will be. That doesn\u2019t mean you should never fire up an ARIMA model or look at a weather forecast again, many decisions require some view of what is going to happen in future, but it does mean that you should always have in the back of your mind: what would I do if this turns out to be really wrong? How can I quickly adapt if it does?", "In an important sense, forecasting is now more than ever much like picking winners on the stock market: there\u2019s a huge degree of randomness, few can do it well, and it\u2019s very hard to distinguish the talented from the merely lucky. But, we can use the same tools and approach that good fund managers use to manage their portfolios: understanding their risk tolerance, picking strategies like diversification that can weather a range of outcomes, and ensuring they can flexibly move funds around to take advantage of opportunities. And of course, never forgetting the age-old investing maxim: Past performance is no guarantee of future results.", "Your home for data science.
