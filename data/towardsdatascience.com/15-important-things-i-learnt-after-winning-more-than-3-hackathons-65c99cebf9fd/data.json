The aim of any hackathon is to let your imagination guide you to push the boundaries of your knowledge and skills in this field.", "I started my hackathon journey 2 years back after learning intermediate android and data science skills. I have been part of more than 20 hackathons till now including online as well as offline hackathons.", "Note : These are the hackathons where I have reached the Final stage and does not include merely registering in the hackathon.", "To give a quick glimpse of my achievements in Hackathons, I am the Winner of Smart India Hackathon, Winner of Online Data Science Hackathon and Runner Up of IIT Madras Hackathon.", "During this journey, I have shortlisted 15 important tips for everyone before they participate in a hackathon from my own experience.", "With so many hackathons coming up, don\u2019t try to register for multiple hackathons at a time. This might distract you from focusing on any of them sincerely. Keep it as simple as possible and give your best shot at one hackathon at a time.", "Hackathon is more about learning than winning", "You should shortlist hackathons which will improve the skills you are learning.", "Often people team up with their close friends in all of their hackathons. You should start forming teams with people who can contribute with their skill set to the hackathon.", "Always form team with people having diverse set of skills which are required for the hackathon so that you can widen the scope of your solution.", "Tip : Form teams with people having different skillset than yours so that you can learn from them. I always try to create team with new people for hackathons as it helps in improving my teamwork skill and also get the experience of coordinating with strangers in such a short period of time.", "Once you have created your team, you need to understand the problem mentioned in the hackathon. You need to understand the reason behind the hackathon and the solution which they are trying to get out of the hackathon.", "This phase requires time and effort as you have to wisely select your hackathon. Choose hackathons where you have an idea and you can help in providing a solution.", "If you are still unclear about the idea , then you can refer to previous implementations of that problem on internet to see how people have tackled it.", "Do not copy ideas directly from internet. Hackathons are about your own ideas and how you implement it.", "If your problem depends on some particular domain, you will need to research on that domain to get a clear idea about the problem. For instance few hackathons have themes based on agriculture or health. It is suggested to find someone having experience in that domain to guide you to understand the problem clearly.", "You need to sit down with your team mates on discussing your ideas and how you can solve the problem. Keep noting down all the ideas you all get because you never know which idea can be your USP \u2014 Unique Selling Point", "USP \u2014 An idea which can provide important solution to the problem and has not been implemented before.", "Categorize your ideas into 2 parts \u2192 Must do ideas and normal ideas", "Must do ideas are the important ideas which you have to complete during your hackathon whereas normal ideas are the one which you don\u2019t find that important to be completed entirely. This will help you during the time of hackathon when you have limited time.", "Before you start working on the solution, divide the project among all your team mates. Make sure everyone contributes to the solution as it will help in accomplishing your solution quickly. If a particular person of a team does 80% of the project, you might complete the project but you won\u2019t learn teamwork qualities or how a team actually works together.", "Since you are expected to accomplished so much work in 24 hours, you must make a plan and set your goals. I always allocate sub parts of my work into hours. For instance, I allocate 2 hours for a particular feature and try completing it in the given time.", "Remember to keep a buffer time of 2\u20133 hours in the end. There will be time when few things will take more than the time you have allocated or there may be changes suggested by the judges in your solution.", "\u201cA man who does not plan long ahead will find trouble at his door.\u201d \u2015 Confucius, Chinese philosopher", "Most of the teams do not complete their project entirely. It is completely fine since each team gets a short period of time to create a valuable product.", "It is more about your ideas and the effort you put in to make it as a product.", "Remember what I told you earlier? Since you have categorized your ideas into Must do ideas and normal ideas, you can prioritize the work according to them. This will allow you to complete important features of your project during the hackathon.", "There will be mentors assigned during the hackathon. Take guidance from them. The assigned mentors have great experience and knowledge about their field so don't feel shy to approach them. They are assigned to help you so discuss your ideas with them and make your solution much better. If you are stuck at something, do not waste your precious time in debugging it for hours. Ask for help from a mentor who has an idea about your assigned work.", "The solution you have decided to work on might not necessarily be the one the judges would be looking. Take feedback from mentors on which ideas to focus.", "Taking feedback will help you focus on important ideas and avoid you from wasting time on ideas which are not valuable to them. Time is precious.", "You will be working for 24 or maybe 36 hours on your solution continuously. It is recommended to take 10 minutes nap to refresh you minds so that you can continue your work effectively. Trust me, this helps a lot in improving your productivity.", "After my hackathon is completed, I approach other teams and spend a hour to discuss on the ideas which they thought. This helps in getting to know about the different ideas which I failed to think of.", "Sharing knowledge with people helps you in growing and generating new ideas.", "Always test your project multiple times before presenting it to the judges. In almost all of the hackathons I have participated, I have seen apps and websites getting crashed during judging round.", "Prepare for the best and be prepared for the worst.", "Keep screenshots and videos of your implementation ready with you if possible.", "After hours of continuous work and days of brainwashing, you get 5 minutes to explain your work. You need to deliver all your hardwork in those 5 minutes.", "Effective Presentation not only helps in connecting with your judges but also makes them concentrate on your core solution.", "Add limited and important content in your presentation and also include images for people to understand it easily.", "Remember the aim of any hackathon with which I started this blog?", "The aim of any hackathon is to let your imagination guide you to push the boundaries of your knowledge and skills in this field.", "Following are the important things you take away from any hackathon:", "And what difference does it make if you win?", "Winning the hackathon is just a cherry on the cake.", "Honestly, it is more about learning and improving yourself rather than winning. At the end of the hackathon, always ask yourself whether you are proud of what you have done. Getting the sense of accomplishment is more important than winning. I am always amazed to see the glowing faces of participants after giving their best shot in 24 hours. That feeling is priceless.", "Hope you guys like it !", "Your home for data science.
