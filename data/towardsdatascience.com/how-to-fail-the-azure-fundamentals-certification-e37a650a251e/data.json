Azure Fundamentals acts as the starting point for many people working with the Cloud.", "It shows you have a good, high-level understanding of Azure, which is great but also what throws a lot of people. It isn\u2019t about whether you can architect a web-app and automate your deployments with a CI/CD pipeline.", "Instead, the certification\u2019s strength comes with the business-user perspective that it targets, but this is also where many of the more technically-inclined of us will struggle.", "That\u2019s not to say this certification isn\u2019t useful for techies; it certainly is. In-fact the overview of cloud concepts, infrastructure, security, and services is a must-have for anyone working with the Cloud.", "The course isn\u2019t technically challenging, but it is broad. We will be reciting the support level we need for 24/7 access to customer phone lines, or what setup our IT admins need for deploying VM\u2019s with Powershell scripts.", "So hopefully, it\u2019s understandable that despite its fluffy facade \u2014 this is a tricky certification to approach. Let\u2019s have a run-through of what to do \u2014 and not do \u2014 to ace AZ-900 the first time around.", "The amount of time you need to prepare for the exam will vary significantly. If you\u2019re a senior Cloud engineer who\u2019s transferring from AWS to Azure, you probably don\u2019t need more than a day at tops.", "If you\u2019re wondering why Microsoft offers a certification covering those fluffy white things in the sky, give yourself a few extra days.", "If you\u2019re a developer, but haven\u2019t had much exposure to the Cloud. Three to four hours every day for a week should be enough \u2014 or two weeks to be safe.", "Easily the best place to get started is Bill\u2019s very own Azure Fundamentals Learning Path.", "Officially, it should take you a total of nine hours and 48 minutes. For me, it took much longer.", "If you simply read through it, and watch the short videos, just under ten hours is probably right. But I would recommend a more active approach, trying a mix of:", "1.Taking plenty of notes. A small recommendation from me for note-taking \u2014 try out notion (it\u2019s fantastic).", "2.When you see new terms, such as load balancer, read more about it. Ask questions like \u2014 Why is it a layer-4 load balancer? Etc.", "3.Try using the services. Using Azure for some mini-projects will take your understanding to a whole new level.", "At the same time, don\u2019t go overboard with these extra steps. We will continue this more active approach to learning throughout the following steps, so don\u2019t exhaust yourself.", "Altogether, I would recommend spending around fifteen hours on this \u2014 but of course, work at your own pace.", "Next up is FreeCodeCamp\u2019s AZ-900 tutorial video on YouTube. After grinding through Microsoft\u2019s learning path, this is a welcomed change of pace.", "This video is the best I\u2019ve seen for AZ-900, and at three hours long, it covers a lot.", "Although it explains everything at a high-level, you probably won\u2019t pass the course from this video alone. But it\u2019s excellent for consolidating much of what we learned in the official learning path. The video format makes it much easier to follow too!", "The same approach to taking an active approach to our learning applies here too. Make notes, do some extra reading, and get in some practice.", "Initially, I was hesitant about paying for one of the many practice tests available online. After I finished my first test, I\u2019d scored a measly 56% \u2014 a sure fail.", "So if there is one thing I can recommend, even more so than the official learning path, or FreeCodeCamp\u2019s video. You should invest in a practice test.", "Secondly, if there\u2019s one thing I can recommend more than buying a practice test. Read the test reviews!", "Many of the practice tests out there are outdated, so exercise a little caution.", "I used Skillcertpro, which comes with seven practice tests.", "Whether you use Skillcertpro or another platform, work through every single exam they provide. I found that I would get a cool 92% on one exam, then 60% on the next. They can vary a lot.", "Finally, at this stage, an active approach is super important. Take the practice exam, read through the results \u2014 make a mental note of what was you got right, and investigate what you got wrong via the official Azure documentation or elsewhere.", "For the exam, there are just a few extra things to take note of:", "After working through all of the material shown in this article, you will be more than ready for the exam.", "I hope you enjoyed the article! If you have any other resources you would recommend, or any questions, reach out via Twitter or in the comments below.", "Interested in applying your new-found Azure knowledge?
