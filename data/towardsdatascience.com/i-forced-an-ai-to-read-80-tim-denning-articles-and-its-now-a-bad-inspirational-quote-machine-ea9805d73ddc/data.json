But maybe I don\u2019t have to.", "What I can do (I thought, naively) is feed a machine learning model all of the articles on timdenning.com and get it to auto-generate whole articles for me in his style!", "After doing hours of model training on articles scraped from timdenning.com, generating sentences mostly yielded vaguely Tim-Denning-esque nonsense like this:", "The thing is you can create a landing page. each chapter of the blog of your writing gave you a digital product is the pain the person. the average email people get specific with writing at any age", "Occasionally, however, artificial Tim Denning comes up with some absolutely brilliant, bad inspirational quotes. Let\u2019s go through them now.", "Wow. Wise words indeed from Artificial Tim Denning there.", "If you want to find out how this works, I give a quick overview below. Otherwise, feel free to get on with your day!", "The goal is to get the main body-of-text from every article on timdenning.com/blog into one big text file which can be used to train a textgenrnn model.", "Instead of taking the time to manually copy/paste 80 articles into a text file, I decided to spend twice as long automating it", "For this, I used BeautifulSoup: a Python package that provides tools to assist with web-scraping.", "This simple implementation took several minutes to run as each call to an article was done sequentially. I managed to speed it up to just a few seconds by using threading, assigning each article extraction to a separate thread.", "I used textgenrnn to do all of the heavy lifting. It provides a fully trained language model out of the box, with the capability to generate random strings of text. You can also train it on a whole bunch of text, and the model will learn to give results resembling that training text.", "The results are heavily dependent on the amount of training text and the time spent training on it. num_epochs=10 was the minimum amount of training to get reasonably ok results.", "By default, the model actually generates character by character. By setting word_level=True, we force each word to be the data-points rather than each character. In my experience, this gives better results for this application.", "Once we have the model parameters saved, we can load them in from their files. Then all that\u2019s left to do is call the generate function. The code below generates 10 sections of text with a maximum length of 50 words.", "The temperature tag represents how much we allow the model to choose sub-optimal words. With a temperature of 0, the model always produces the same output. This is because it only ever picks the number-1-most-likely word.", "By increasing the temperature, we allow the model to produce less and less \u2018likely\u2019 sentences, resulting in more creative (but nonsensical outputs). I tended to find a temperature of 0.5 worked well.", "After all that work, we end up with outputs that sound like an overly-deep-thinking toddler, or Tim Denning blackout drunk at 4am.", "This isn\u2019t a new concept. Machine learning has been able to generate human-like sentences since the 60s. What is new is how easy it is to set up projects like this \u2014 I managed in just a few hours. With the advent of more and more powerful open-source Python libraries, the barrier to entry of machine learning is lower than ever.", "Maybe you won\u2019t get groundbreaking results without a bit more effort and a deep understanding, but is that really a problem? I massively enjoyed spending a few hours playing around, and learned a lot along the way.", "Even if you\u2019ve never done anything like this before, it\u2019s a great way to get started exploring what machine learning is capable of. To paraphrase the great philosopher Artificial-Tim-Denning:", "Make your next step a different", "You\u2019ve made it to the end, thank you! Please consider applauding this article and following me, I\u2019d really appreciate it! Plus, I\u2019ve got plenty of software projects in the pipeline that you won\u2019t want to miss!", "Check out my last project write-ups\u2014 a Facebook Messenger bot that deep fries images on command, and a Twitter Sentiment analysis project in Google Cloud.", "Your home for data science.
