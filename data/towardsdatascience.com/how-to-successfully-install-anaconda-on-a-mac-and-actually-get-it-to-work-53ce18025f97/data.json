The installation itself was no problem! The official guide is clear and comprehensive when it comes to the installation itself. You work through it, follow a few simple steps, and you\u2019re good to go!", "At the end, it tells you to verify that your installation was successful by typing a command like \u201cconda list\u201d and you\u2019re done!", "\u201cConda\u201d didn\u2019t work the first time I installed it. There\u2019s no handy link sitting there that will tell you what to do. You verify it and then you\u2019re done.", "There\u2019s nothing more frustrating than not even being able to open the program that you need.", "It\u2019s not an easy thing to get started in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and being unable to get the necessary tools correctly installed is just crippling. As you start to understand more of the language and commands that you need to make things work, you\u2019ll find that there are plenty of simple answers out there. But none of them make any sense when it\u2019s all new! Just Googling your questions can be challenging.", "I had actually done this to myself.", "I work on a MacOS (Mojave, if you\u2019re interested). After spending some time working in the terminal, I had turned it into something that was fast, efficient, and also very nice to look at. You can see everything that I did to make my terminal awesome here, but essentially, it\u2019s running", "Little did I know that this would make my Anaconda installation a tiny bit more difficult. One single line of code more difficult, as it turns out, but a million times more challenging for a newbie.", "This is the step-by-step installation process with a simple one-line fix that will allow you to \u201cconda\u201d anything you want. Even if you\u2019re using the lovely and amazing Zsh.", "So here\u2019s the thing: the installation was successful, but there was a tiny problem between Zsh and the way my terminal wanted to talk to Anaconda. This can happen for any number of reasons, but Zsh was the culprit here.", "It was incredibly easy to fix! But because I had no idea what I was doing, it took forever to figure out.", "No one else should have to go through that.", "The official installation guide is here if you feel like checking it out.", "The first time I decided to download Anaconda, I went through the normal graphical Mac installation. It worked fine as an application, but it just wouldn\u2019t work with my terminal.", "Unwilling to give up, I uninstalled Anaconda and then tried the command-line installation. That one is great because you can decide during installation that you want your terminal to communicate with Anaconda. You\u2019ll get a prompt during installation that asks, \u201cDo you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?\u201d", "I\u2019d recommend giving that one a big yes.", "Of course, it still didn\u2019t work. It probably would, though, if you didn\u2019t have a tricked out terminal! If you aren\u2019t using Zsh and Oh My Zsh, you might be set.", "So how do you get this to work the way it\u2019s supposed to if you\u2019ve made changes to your terminal?", "These are the simple steps for a successful Anaconda installation, even in the face of the dreaded \u201cconda command not found\u201d error message.", "You can go here to download Anaconda. Then scroll down a little to the part that says \u201cAnaconda 2019.03 for macOS Installer.\u201d", "You\u2019ll need to know which version of Python you have, so go to your terminal and type", "You have a couple of choices for your download. You can choose the graphical installer, which means that you\u2019ll install Anaconda the same exact way that you\u2019d install any other program. Or you can choose the command line installer, which means that you\u2019ll go to your terminal and type out (or copy and paste) the commands.", "We\u2019re going to do the command line installer, so click that link under your version of Python and your download should start.", "After your download is complete, head on over to your terminal.", "If you have Python 3.7, you\u2019ll run", "Keep in mind that if you didn\u2019t download Anaconda to your downloads folder, you\u2019ll need to change that path.", "Review the license agreement and accept it by hitting \u201cEnter\u201d about a million times until you get to the end. At the end, type \u201cyes\u201d if you want to agree.", "(It will prompt you. It will prompt you repeatedly if you miss it.)", "If you\u2019re happy with the location it suggests, hit \u201cEnter.\u201d You can change locations or cancel the installation by entering CTRL-C. Pay attention to this location! It will come in handy if you get the error message.", "Now hold still. Be patient. This can take a few minutes and you won\u2019t know if anything is happening at first. You could go and grab a beverage if you want, but be quick because the installer will ask, \u201cDo you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?\u201d and you almost certainly want to be there to type \u201cyes\u201d when you\u2019re asked.", "When your installation is complete, close your terminal window and open a new one for the changes to take effect. Want to see if it worked? In your terminal, type a command like", "and see what happens. If it works, you\u2019ll see something like this", "This is a very useful command if you want to know which packages and versions you have installed in your environment!", "If that worked, congratulations!!! You are now ready to start using Anaconda, Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder, and all of the other good stuff. Time to celebrate!", "On the other hand, you might be seeing this:", "The solution to this problem is actually very simple.", "(I know I already said that, but the Anaconda team reached out and let me know that not refreshing your terminal is the most common reason that people have problems at this point.)", "You\u2019ll need to know where your Anaconda binary directory is and what your username is. If you were paying attention during your installation, you already have this information! You want the location that you specified during installation.", "If not, there\u2019s a very, very good chance that if you simply followed the installation instructions, your directory is /Users/ if you\u2019re on a macOS. (Or /home/ on Linux or \\Users\\ on Windows10.)", "If you don\u2019t know your username, run", "I recommended modifying PATH to fix the problem (you can see the original fix below), but the Anaconda team reached out with some incredibly helpful information!", "You can read the full comment below, but here is a condensed version of the information that you can find in the comments section from the amazing Michael Sarahan:", "\u201cModifying PATH can cause problems if there are any other programs on your system that have the same names, that Anaconda then hides (shadows) by being found first. What \u201cconda init\u201d does is to set up a conda \u201cshell function\u201d and keep the other stuff off PATH. Nothing but conda is on PATH. It then defaults to activating your base environment at startup. The net effect is very much like your PATH addition, but has some subtle, but critically important differences:", "activation ensures that anaconda\u2019s PATH stuff is right up front. Putting anaconda at the front of PATH permanently is good in that it prevents confusion, but bad in that it shadows other stuff and can break things. Activation is a less permanent way to do this. You can turn off the automatic activation of the base environment using the \u201cauto_activate_base\u201d condarc setting.", "activation does a bit more than just modifying PATH. It also sources any activate.d scripts, which may set additional environment variables. Some things, such as GDAL, require these. These packages will not work without activation.", "So, rather than your tip on modifying PATH, what we recommend is following the directions at the end of the installer, should you choose not to run conda init:", "that will look like 2 commands:", "Note that in step 1, I changed the shell name from YOUR_SHELL_NAME to bash. You may need to adjust that yourself to your shell.\u201d", "Long story short, it\u2019s entirely possible that modifying PATH might cause you some problems down the road. It\u2019s smarter to go with activation because it isn\u2019t permanent and will allow some packages to run that might not otherwise.", "So, at the end of the installer, instead of running the original solution:", "(But make sure you change the directory location and shell to your own!)", "All you need to do to make things work is run", "(Definitely make sure you replace \u201cmyname\u201d with your username and change the path to the directory if you need to. If you look at the line above, /Users/myname/anaconda3 would be replaced by /Users/anneb/anaconda3 from the installation location earlier. Keep everything else the same.)", "If you didn\u2019t install Anaconda3, you would need to run", "making sure to change \u201cmyname\u201d and the directory location if necessary.", "You successfully installed Anaconda and are now able to run it from your command line!", "Thanks for reading!
