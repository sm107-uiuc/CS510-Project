During the hands-on session, our RC wanted to share his Jupyter notebooks with us. Since no one had access to the college\u2019s cloud and all other means of data transfer were not nearly sexy enough for sharing with everybody, he asked if anyone was using Linux.

That is what I learned in that workshop, and I shall show you how to do something similar here.", "Apache is the most commonly used Web server on Linux systems.
