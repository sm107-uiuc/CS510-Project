And on TV. But who still watches TV?!", "Oh, I can see you with the dollar sign in your eyes and the light-bulb above your head. Just learn the basics and you\u2019ll get a job. Easy! After all, when you really need water and there are no bottles of Fiji available, you buy the next best thing (Evian) or what is available (Dasani \u2014 because you really, really need water).", "With all the Marvel and DC Comics movies, how can we be short of Super Heroes?! Well, for starter, Black Widow and Iron Man are dead\u2026 Then, because what companies really need is super highly skilled data people. Not juniors.", "People with computer science, engineering, econometric/mathematics and business education/experience (yes, all of that combined). Not juniors.", "People that can use and speak an impressive amount of tools and languages. (To mention just a few: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Hive, Spark, AWS S3, C#, Scala, Tableau, Python, Matlab, Stata etc.). Not juniors.", "People who deeply understand business models and business logic. It is great to have tools, but knowing why and when you need them is just as important.", "They basically need life-long learners college graduates with ~7/10 years of experience. Not juniors.", "After having said that, it is clear that it won\u2019t be easy. Not easy doesn\u2019t mean impossible. Nothing that I have accomplished in my life is impossible. You can do it too!", "So how to do it? I don\u2019t have a universal answer. I just have my personal experience. And because I have nothing to sell, I can tell you the truth.", "It will take time. Do not trust bootcamps and other gurus who tell you that you will be job-ready in 3 to 6 months (talking about re-conversion \u2014 CS graduates or with CS experience can eventually be). It just won\u2019t cut it. You will need much more time and practice to actually be close to useful.", "There are tons of great free online resources to learn from (I can suggest a few if you need). Start with them to learn the basics until medium to advanced concepts. Then, you can consider paid programs \u2014 by being more advanced, you will be able to go much deeper and get more value out of your investment.", "I think that I suffered from not having a formal education in DS or CS on my resume. But that is just that, a feeling. Beware of bootcamps \u2014 very few actually showed good results.", "Then practice. I can\u2019t insist enough on how important practice is. I made the mistake to complete courses after courses before applying the concepts through projects. My reasoning was that I needed to know more (and more) before being able to use the tools. I was wrong. By making projects, you actually learn much more (actual experience) and retain more (thanks to the pain of having gone through the actual process \u2014 which is, for the most part, googling how to do what you want to do and adapting it).", "Another mistake that I have done is to make projects that I thought were cool vs. projects that actually showed I could do the job. For example, I developed an augmented reality game. Cool, but absolutely useless. I won\u2019t get a job as a Machine Learning Engineer (to get there, you need to be a good software engineer with mid to high knowledge of math/stats and strong domain expertise).", "What you need are projects where you get and process data, where you analyze and visualize data. Where you basically transform data into insights. For example, scrapping movie data to evaluate which is the best streaming platform between Netflix and Disney + (click here if you want to know the answer).", "Interestingly, what got me the job was not my technical skills, but my domain expertise \u2014 though once again, this is an educated guess, not a known fact.", "Yes, I got tested on Python and SQL. And it is important to be up to date on the technical skills. But I don\u2019t think I am a maestro. Plus, you can\u2019t really self-teach and practice ETL, data streaming, SQL at scale etc. For that, you actually need job experience. The snake biting its tail.", "Where I (think I) crushed it, is on the domain expertise. I spent many years in investment banking dissecting business models, identifying business processes and understanding value creation. This was insanely useful (to me). Why? Because during the (numerous) tests and interviews, I was able to identify what problems to look at and how to look at them. The company has (a lot of) internal resources to teach/help you answer those questions. They have much less to help you think, understand and identify business problems.", "Even though you are most likely bored out of your mind thanks to that quarantine, I will bullet-point what I just said so you can get straight to the point (I know, you wished you had known it was an option from the beginning):", "1/ the shortage of data people doesn\u2019t concern you. Companies are short on people with strong technical and business skills that are learned through a combination of high education and long experience, not juniors;", "2/ use free online resources to learn the technical skills and beware of bootcamps. It will take time before you reach job-readiness;", "3/ do projects as soon as you can. Even after the first course. It will be hard but this is by far the best thing you can do to really learn. Make projects that matter vs cool projects (your first job in the field won\u2019t be Machine Learning Engineer);", "4/ have a deep domain expertise. It happened more than once that the interviewers told me: \u201cwe prefer strong business sense to technical skills because you can learn SQL on the job pretty fast\u201d;", "5/ do not take #4 too literally, you will still need those skills to pass the CV screen and get the job.", "I am super excited to start this new job (Analytics Program Manager). I\u2019m not going to lie, it took me a long time and a lot of efforts to get there. Now, I know I\u2019m going to keep learning a huge amount \u2014 there\u2019s no end to what you can learn in \u201cdata science\u201d. The best part is that I will do it in the best possible conditions (hugely successful startup with brilliant people and resources).
