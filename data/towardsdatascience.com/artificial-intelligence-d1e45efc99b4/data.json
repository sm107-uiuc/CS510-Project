In his recent paper \u2018On the measure of intelligence.\u2019, Chollet describes two different definitions of intelligence dominating the literature:", "Assuming either definition, intelligence appears as a property in many natural systems. Life forms present intelligence in various ways, and the challenging task to describe and explain this phenomenon is at the heart of the so-called Cognitive Sciences. Other than that, since its founding conference in 1956, the longstanding human effort to build intelligent machines has been labeled by the term Artificial Intelligence (AI). Right from the start, the main ideas on how to make intelligent artificial systems gravitated around two approaches:", "Due to technical challenges and limited success on the symbolic front, many such methods fell into disuse, leading this paradigm to be commonly referred to as Good Old-Fashioned AI (GOFAI). Besides, the growing availability of computing power and data over the last decades drove machine learning to the forefront of AI research. If someone is talking about AI today, it is probably talking about machine learning.", "It is crucial to notice that when machine learning appeared as a research field, the \u2018learning from data\u2019 approach was already the subject of another discipline: statistics. This overlap between statistics and machine learning has generated some debate over the years, and a good reference to start a discussion on the issue is Breiman\u2019s paper \u2018Statistical modeling: the two cultures.\u2019. In a nutshell, the arguments go as follows:", "Due to the technical nuances on the various solutions proposed by both traditions, it is hard to classify every technique as pertaining to one or another approach. Perhaps it is more useful to acknowledge these \u2018two cultures\u2019 as two opposing extremes of a spectrum, where the tools proposed by each tradition are laid down in the continuum between inference-centric and prediction-centric methods.", "Now, having this background in mind, let\u2019s move on to the complexities of machine learning solutions. Even if we concentrate the discussion about AI on machine learning, it is still no easy task to wade through the rich terminology surrounding the field. When talking about such a system, I find it useful to think of every machine learning solution as made out of five somewhat independent abstraction layers.", "Besides, like any other computational system, the decisions on each of these topics will have to take into account other issues, such as budget limits, scalability, and maintainability. There are many options in this layer, ranging from a small system where data sits in your hard drive and is treated on a local Jupyter Notebook, to massive pipelines on multi-cloud environments.", "It may seem obvious, but it\u2019s worth stating: all machine learning solutions depend on data. Knowing which kind of data will be treated by the system will allow the system designer to make informed decisions about adequate modeling techniques to achieve the desired results. When talking about data, the concerns are usually about:", "Choosing a model is selecting the space of functions, or the hypothesis set, in which we will search for the best fitting model. The characterization of the previous layers will already inform this decision in some ways, deep learning models, for example, may require bigger datasets and specialized hardware to train. Additionally, there is a particular characteristic that is central to this layer:", "The direct assessment of the coefficients on a linear model or the thresholds on a decision tree can give us information about the relationship between the variables on the dataset. Other models, such as a Random Forest or deep neural networks, are hard to assess directly and may need additional tools to get some insight into its inner workings.", "The method, or learning approach, is where we define how data is used to search for a good model. It will heavily depend on the type of problems we are solving: clustering, classification, regression, control, etc. Most expositions about this aspect of machine learning tend to highlight three major approaches:", "Although the learning approach characterization may seem a mere formality, it is a crucial definition of a machine learning system design. The specification of an adequate learning approach for a given problem will guide all the model training setup, including its assessment methods, learning metrics, and expected results.", "It is worth keeping in mind that those three are not the only approaches available. Still, once you get a clear understanding of their characteristics, it will be easier to understand other learning variations, such as semi-supervised learning, online learning, adversarial learning, etc.", "Applications are designed to solve problems, regardless of the underlying technique. The application is the final product of the machine learning system design. Some well-known applications relying on machine learning nowadays are recommender systems, loan classifiers, anomaly detectors, and autonomous vehicles.", "It is important to remember that, virtually, any of those applications could be built using hard-coded rules. Keeping this in mind works as a reality check on the real necessity to make use of machine learning techniques on a given solution. Software engineering has a lot of complexities by itself, relying on machine learning to build an application adds yet another layer of complexity that can lead to a significant increase in the technical debt backlog.", "Artificial intelligence is a complex research field, and having a clear overall picture is very useful, if not needed, for people dealing with this technology. The next time you face an application built using machine learning, try disentangling each of its abstraction layers to understand the designer\u2019s choices in each one, it may improve your understanding of it. Finally, I hope this conceptual introduction may work as a simple map helping you navigate this vast field. For those wondering how to dig deeper into the subject, when in doubt, I always go back to Russell and Norvig\u2019s excellent \u2018Artificial Intelligence: a modern approach.\u2019.", "Your home for data science.
