Particularly for those coming to data science from an engineering background, data visualizations are often seen as something trivial, to be rushed through to show stakeholders once the fun modelling has been finished.", "Yet visualizations are often the main way complicated problems are explained to decision makers. For something so essential to so many people\u2019s daily work, data visualization is rarely directly taught, instead being something new professionals are expected to learn via osmosis. But this isn\u2019t the best approach. Data visualization is a skill like any other, and even experienced practitioners could benefit from honing their skills in the subject.", "Hence, this short lesson on the topic. This post is a little bit on the longer side, but aims to give you a comprehensive backing in the concepts underlying data visualizations in a way that will make you better at your job.", "At no point do I intend to teach you how to make a specific graphic in a specific software. I don\u2019t know what software might be applicable to your needs in the future, or what visualizations you\u2019ll need to formulate when \u2014 and quite frankly, Google exists \u2014 so this isn\u2019t a cookbook with step-by-step instructions. The goal here is not to provide you with recipes for future use, but rather to teach you what flour is \u2014 to introduce you to the basic concepts and building blocks of effective data visualizations.", "With that said, you can find the code (as three R Markdown files) to build this article on my personal GitHub.", "As much as possible, I\u2019ve collapsed those basic concepts into four mantras we\u2019ll return to throughout this course. The mantras are:", "Each mantra serves as the theme for a section, and will also be interwoven throughout. The theme of this first section is, easily enough:", "When making a graphic, it is important to understand what the graphic is for. After all, you usually won\u2019t make a chart that is a perfect depiction of your data \u2014 modern data sets tend to be too big (in terms of number of observations) and wide (in terms of number of variables) to depict every data point on a single graph. Instead, the analyst consciously chooses what elements to include in a visualization in order to identify patterns and trends in the data in the most effective manner possible. In order to make those decisions, it helps a little to think both about why and how graphics are made.", "As far as the why question goes, the answer usually comes down to one of two larger categories:", "These are the rationales behind creating what are known as, respectively, exploratory and explanatory graphics. Exploratory graphics are often very simple pictures of your data, built to identify patterns in your data that you might not know exist yet. Take for example a simple graphic, showing tree circumference as a function of age:", "This visualization isn\u2019t anything too complex \u2014 two variables, thirty-five observations, not much text \u2014 but it already shows us a trend that exists in the data. We could use this information, if we were so inspired, to start investigating the whys of why tree growth changes with age, now that we\u2019re broadly aware of how it changes.", "Explanatory graphs, meanwhile, are all about the whys. Where an exploratory graphic focuses on identifying patterns in the first place, an explanatory graphic aims to explain why they happen and \u2014 in the best examples \u2014 what exactly the reader is to do about them. Explanatory graphics can exist on their own or in the context of a larger report, but their goals are the same: to provide evidence about why a pattern exists and provide a call to action. For instance, we can reimagine the same tree graph with a few edits in order to explain what patterns we\u2019re seeing:", "I want to specifically call out the title here: \u201cOrange tree growth tapers by year 4.\u201d A good graphic tells a story, remember. As such, whatever title you give your graph should reflect the point of that story \u2014 titles such as \u201cTree diameter (cm) versus age (days)\u201d and so on add nothing that the user can\u2019t get from the graphic itself. Instead, use your title to advance your message whenever it makes sense \u2014 otherwise, if it doesn\u2019t add any new information, you\u2019re better off erasing it altogether.", "The important takeaway here is not that explanatory graphics are necessarily more polished than exploratory ones, or that exploratory graphics are only for the analyst \u2014 periodic reporting, for instance, will often use highly polished exploratory graphics to identify existing trends, hoping to spur more intensive analysis that will identify the whys. Instead, the message is that knowing the end purpose of your graph \u2014 whether it should help identify patterns in the first place or explain how they got there \u2014 can help you decide what elements need to be included to tell the story your graphic is designed to address.", "The other important consideration when thinking about graph design is the actual how you\u2019ll tell your story, including what design elements you\u2019ll use and what data you\u2019ll display. My preferred paradigm when deciding between the possible \u201chows\u201d is to weigh the expressiveness and effectiveness of the resulting graphic, as defined by Jeffrey Heer at the University of Washington, Heer writes:", "Keep this concept in the back of your mind as we move into our mechanics section \u2014 it should be your main consideration while deciding which elements you use! We\u2019ll keep returning to these ideas of explanatory and exploratory, as well as expressiveness and effectiveness, throughout the other two sections.", "Let\u2019s move from theoretical considerations of graphing to the actual building blocks you have at your disposal. As we do so, we\u2019re also going to move on to mantra #2:", "Graphs are inherently a 2D image of our data:", "They have an x and a y scale, and \u2014 as in our scatter plot here \u2014 the position a point falls along each scale tells you how large its values are. But this setup only allows us to look at two variables in our data \u2014 and we\u2019re frequently interested in seeing relationships between more than two variables.", "So the question becomes: how can we visualize those extra variables? We can try adding another position scale:", "But 3D images are hard to wrap your head around, complicated to produce, and not as effective in delivering your message. They do have their uses \u2014 particularly when you\u2019re able to build real, physical 3D models, and not just make 3D shapes on 2D planes \u2014 but frequently aren\u2019t worth the trouble.", "So what tools do we have in our toolbox? The ones that are generally agreed upon (no, really \u2014 this is an area of active debate) fall into four categories:", "These are the tools we can use to encode more information into our graphics. We\u2019re going to call these aesthetics, but any number of other words could work \u2014 some people refer to them as scales, some as values. I call them aesthetics because that\u2019s what my language of choice (R, using ggplot2) calls them \u2014 but the word itself comes from the fact that these are the things that change how your graph looks.", "For what it\u2019s worth, we\u2019re using an EPA data set for this unit, representing fuel economy data from 1999 and 2008 for 38 popular models of car. \u201cHwy\u201d is highway mileage, \u201cdispl\u201d is engine displacement (so volume), and \u201ccty\u201d is city mileage. But frankly, our data set doesn\u2019t matter right now \u2014 most of our discussion here is applicable to any data set you\u2019ll pick up.", "We\u2019re going to go through each of these aesthetics, to talk about how you can encode more information in each of your graphics. Along the way, remember our mantras:", "We\u2019ll talk about how these are applicable throughout this section.", "Let\u2019s start off discussing these aesthetics by finishing up talking about position. The distance of values along the x, y, or \u2014 in the case of our 3D graphic \u2014 z axes represents how large a particular variable is. People inherently understand that values further out on each axis are more extreme \u2014 for instance, imagine you came across the following graphic (made with simulated data):", "Which values do you think are higher?", "Most people innately assume that the bottom-left hand corner represents a 0 on both axes, and that the further you get from that corner the higher the values are. This \u2014 relatively obvious \u2014 revelation hints at a much more important concept in data visualizations: perceptual topology should match data topology. Put another way, that means that values which feel larger in a graph should represent values that are larger in your data. As such, when working with position, higher values should be the ones further away from that lower left-hand corner \u2014 you should let your viewer\u2019s subconscious assumptions do the heavy lifting for you.", "Applying this advice to categorical data can get a little tricky. Imagine that we\u2019re looking at the average highway mileages for manufacturers of the cars in our data set:", "In this case, the position along the x axis just represents a different car maker, in alphabetical order. But remember, position in a graph is an aesthetic that we can use to encode more information in our graphics. And we aren\u2019t doing that here \u2014 for instance, we could show the same information without using x position at all:", "Try to compare Pontiac and Hyundai on the first graph, versus on this second one. If anything, removing our extraneous x aesthetic has made it easier to compare manufacturers. This is a big driver behind our second mantra \u2014 that everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. Having extra aesthetics confuses a graph, making it harder to understand the story it\u2019s trying to tell.", "However, when making a graphic, we should always be aiming to make important comparisons easy. As such, we should take advantage of our x aesthetic by arranging our manufacturers not alphabetically, but rather by their average highway mileage:", "By reordering our graphic, we\u2019re now able to better compare more similar manufacturers. It\u2019s now dramatically faster to understand our visualization \u2014 closer comparisons are easier to make, so placing more similar values closer together makes them dramatically easier to grasp. Look at Pontiac vs Hyundai now, for instance. Generally speaking, don\u2019t put things in alphabetical order \u2014 use the order you place things to encode additional information.", "As a quick side note, I personally believe that, when working with categorical values along the X axis, you should reorder your values so the highest value comes first. For some reason, I just find having the tallest bar/highest point (or whatever is being used to show value) next to the Y axis line is much cleaner looking than the alternative:", "For what it\u2019s worth, I\u2019m somewhat less dogmatic about this when the values are on the Y axis. I personally believe the highest value should always be at the top, as humans expect higher values to be further from that bottom left corner:", "However, I\u2019m not as instantly repulsed by the opposite ordering as I am with the X axis, likely because the bottom bar/point being the furthest looks like a more natural shape, and is still along the X axis line:", "For this, at least, your mileage may vary. Also, it\u2019s worth pointing out how much cleaner the labels on this graph are when they\u2019re on the Y axis \u2014 flipping your coordinate system, like we\u2019ve done here, is a good way to display data when you\u2019ve got an unwieldy number of categories.", "While we\u2019ve done a good job covering the role position plays in communicating information, we\u2019re still stuck on the same question we started off with: How can we show a third variable on the graph?", "One of the most popular ways is to use colors to represent your third variable. It might be worth talking through how color can be used with a simulated data set. Take for example the following graph:", "And now let\u2019s add color for our third variable:", "Remember: perceptual topology should match data topology. Which values are larger?", "Most people would say the darker ones. But is it always that simple? Let\u2019s change our color scale to compare:", "Sure, some of these colors are darker than others \u2014 but I wouldn\u2019t say any of them tell me a value is particularly high or low.", "That\u2019s because humans don\u2019t perceive hue \u2014 the actual shade of a color \u2014 as an ordered value. The color a point is doesn\u2019t communicate that the point has a higher or lower value than any other point on the graph. Instead, hue works as an unordered value, which only tells us which points belong to which groupings. In order to tell how high or low a point\u2019s value is, we instead have to use luminescence \u2014 or how bright or dark the individual point is.", "There\u2019s one other axis you can move colors along in order to encode value \u2014 how vibrant a color is, known as chroma:", "Just keep in mind that luminescence and chroma \u2014 how light a color is and how vibrant it is \u2014 are ordered values, while hue (or shade of color) is unordered This becomes relevant when dealing with categorical data. For instance, moving back to the scatter plot we started with:", "If we wanted to encode a categorical variable in this \u2014 for instance, the class of vehicle \u2014 we could use hue to distinguish the different types of cars from one another:", "In this case, using hue to distinguish our variables clearly makes more sense than using either chroma or luminesence:", "This is a case of knowing what tool to use for the job \u2014 chroma and luminescence will clearly imply certain variables are closer together than is appropriate for categorical data, while hue won\u2019t give your audience any helpful information about an ordered variable. Note, though, that I\u2019d still discourage using the rainbow to distinguish categories in your graphics \u2014 the colors of the rainbow aren\u2019t exactly unordered values (for instance, red and orange are much more similar colors than yellow and blue), and you\u2019ll wind up implying connections between your categories that you might not want to suggest. Also, the rainbow is just really ugly:", "Speaking of using the right tool for the job, one of the worst things people like to do in data visualizations is overuse color. Take for instance the following example:", "In this graph, the variable \u201cclass\u201d is being represented by both position along the x axis, and by color. By duplicating this effort, we\u2019re making our graph harder to understand \u2014 encoding the information once is enough, and doing it any more times than that is a distraction. Remember the second mantra: Everything should be made as simple as possible \u2014 but no simpler. The best data visualization is one that includes all the elements needed to deliver the message, and no more.", "You can feel free to use color in your graphics, so long as it adds more information to the plot \u2014 for instance, if it\u2019s encoding a third variable:", "But replicating as we did above is just adding more junk to your chart.", "There\u2019s one last way you can use color effectively in your plot, and that\u2019s to highlight points with certain characteristics:", "Doing so allows the viewer to quickly pick out the most important sections of our graph, increasing its effectiveness. Note that I used shape instead of color to separate the class of vehicles, by the way \u2014 combining point highlighting and using color to distinguish categorical variables can work, but can also get somewhat chaotic:", "There\u2019s one other reason color is a tricky aesthetic to get right in your graphics: about 5% of the population (10% of men, 1% of women) can\u2019t see colors at all. That means you should be careful when using it in your visualizations \u2014 use colorblind-safe color palettes (check out \u201cColorBrewer\u201d or \u201cviridis\u201d for more on these), and pair it with another aesthetic whenever possible.", "The easiest aesthetic to pair color with is the next most frequently used \u2014 shape. This one is much more intuitive than color \u2014 to demonstrate, let\u2019s go back to our scatter plot:", "We can now change the shape of each point based on what class of vehicle it represents:", "Imagine we were doing the same exercise as we did with color earlier \u2014 which values are larger?", "I\u2019ve spoiled the answer already by telling you what the shapes represent \u2014 none of them are inherently larger than the others. Shape, like hue, is an unordered value.", "The same basic concepts apply when we change the shape of lines, not just points. For instance, if we plot separate trend lines for front-wheel, rear-wheel, and four-wheel drive cars, we can use line type to represent each type of vehicle:", "But even here, no one line type implies a higher or lower value than the others.", "There are two caveats to be made to this rule, however. For instance, if we go back to our original scatter plot and change which shapes we\u2019re using:", "This graph seems to imply more connection between the first three classes of car (which are all different types of diamonds) and the next three classes (which are all types of triangle), while singling out SUVs. In this way, we\u2019re able to use shape to imply connection between our groupings \u2014 more similar shapes, which differ only in angle or texture, imply a closer relationship to one another than to other types of shape. This can be a blessing as well as a curse \u2014 if you pick, for example, a square and a diamond to represent two unrelated groupings, your audience might accidentally read more into the relationship than you had meant to imply.", "It\u2019s also worth noting that different shapes can pretty quickly clutter up a graph. As a general rule of thumb, using more than 3\u20134 shapes on a graph is a bad idea, and more than 6 means you need to do some thinking about what you actually want people to take away.", "Our last aesthetic is that of size. Going back to our original scatter plot, we could imagine using size like this:", "Size is an inherently ordered value \u2014 large size points imply larger values. Specifically, humans perceive larger areas as corresponding to larger values \u2014 the points which are three times larger in the above graph are about three times larger in value, as well.", "This becomes tricky when size is used incorrectly, either by mistake or to distort the data. Sometimes an analyst maps radius to the variable, rather than area of the point, resulting in graphs as the below:", "In this example, the points representing a cty value of 10 don\u2019t look anything close to 1/3 as large as the points representing 30. This makes the increase seem much steeper upon looking at this chart \u2014 so be careful when working with size as an aesthetic that your software is using the area of points, not radius!", "It\u2019s also worth noting that unlike color \u2014 which can be used to distinguish groupings, as well as represent an ordered value \u2014 it\u2019s generally a bad idea to use size for a categorical variable. For instance, if we mapped point size to class of vehicle:", "We seem to be implying relationships here that don\u2019t actually exist, like a minivan and midsize vehicle being basically the same. As a result, it\u2019s best to only use size for continuous (or numeric) data.", "Now that we\u2019ve gone over these four aesthetics, I want to go on a quick tangent. When it comes to how quickly and easily humans perceive each of these aesthetics, research has settled on the following order:", "And as we\u2019ve discussed repeatedly, the best data visualization is one that includes exactly as many elements as it takes to deliver a message, and no more. Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler.", "However, we live in a world of humans, where the scientifically most effective method is not always the most popular one. And since color is inherently more exciting than size as an aesthetic, the practitioner often finds themselves using colors to denote values where size would have sufficed. And since we know that color should usually be used alongside shape in order to be more inclusive in our visualizations, size often winds up being the last aesthetic used in a chart. This is fine \u2014 sometimes we have to optimize for other things than \u201chow quickly can someone understand my chart\u201d, such as \u201chow attractive does my chart look\u201d or \u201cwhat does my boss want from me\u201d. But it\u2019s worth noting, in case you see contradictory advice in the future \u2014 the disagreement comes from if your source is teaching the most scientifically sound theory, or the most applicable practice.", "Let\u2019s transition away from aesthetics, and towards our third mantra:", "Think back to our first chart:", "As you already know, this is a scatter plot \u2014 also known as a point graph. Now say we added a line of best fit to it:", "This didn\u2019t stop being a scatter plot once we drew a line on it \u2014 but the term scatter plot no longer really encompasses everything that\u2019s going on here. It\u2019s also obviously not a line chart, as even though there\u2019s a line on it, it also has points.", "Rather than quibble about what type of chart this is, it\u2019s more helpful to describe what tools we\u2019ve used to depict our data. We refer to these as geoms, short for geometries \u2014 because when you get really deep into things, these are geometric representations of how your data set is distributed along the x and y axes of your graph. I don\u2019t want to get too far down that road \u2014 I just want to explain the vocabulary so that we aren\u2019t talking about what type of chart that is, but rather what geoms it uses. Framing things that way makes it easier to understand how things can be combined and reformatted, rather than assuming each type of chart can only do one thing.", "This chart uses two geoms that are really good for graphs that have a continuous y and a continuous x \u2014 points and lines. This is what people refer to most of the time when they say a line graph \u2014 a single smooth trend line that shows a pattern in the data. However, a line graph can also mean a chart where each point is connected in turn:", "It\u2019s important to be clear about which type of chart you\u2019re expected to produce! I always refer to the prior as a trend line, for clarity.", "These types of charts have enormous value for quick exploratory graphics, showing how various combinations of variables interact with one another. For instance, many analysts start familiarizing themselves with new data sets using correlation matrices (also known as scatter plot matrices), which create a grid of scatter plots representing each variable:", "In this format, understanding interactions between your data is quick and easy, with certain variable interactions obviously jumping out as promising avenues for further exploration.", "To back up just a little, there\u2019s one major failing of scatter plots that I want to highlight before moving on. If you happen to have more than one point with the same x and y values, a scatter plot will just draw each point over the previous, making it seem like you have less data than you actually do. Adding a little bit of random noise \u2014 for instance, using RAND() in Excel \u2014 to your values can help show the actual densities of your data, especially when you\u2019re dealing with numbers that haven\u2019t been measured as precisely as they could a have been.", "One last chart that does well with two continuous variables is the area chart, which resembles a line chart but fills in the area beneath the line:", "Area plots make sense when 0 is a relevant number to your data set \u2014 that is, a 0 value wouldn\u2019t be particularly unexpected. They\u2019re also frequently used when you have multiple groupings and care about their total sum:", "(This new data set is the \u201cdiamonds\u201d data set, representing 54,000 diamonds sizes, qualities, cut, and sale prices. We\u2019ll be going back and forth using it and the EPA data set from now on.)", "Now one drawback of stacked area charts is that it can be very hard to estimate how any individual grouping shifts along the x axis, due to the cumulative effects of all the groups underneath them. For instance, there are actually fewer \u201cfair\u201d diamonds at 0.25 carats than at 1.0 \u2014 but because \u201cideal\u201d and \u201cpremium\u201d spike so much, your audience might draw the wrong conclusions. In situations where the total matters more than the groupings, this is alright \u2014 but otherwise, it\u2019s worth looking at other types of charts as a result.", "If instead you\u2019re looking to see how a single continuous variable is distributed throughout your data set, one of the best tools at your disposal is the histogram. A histogram shows you how many observations in your data set fall into a certain range of a continuous variable, and plot that count as a bar plot:", "One important flag to raise with histograms is that you need to pay attention to how your data is being binned. If you haven\u2019t picked the right width for your bins, you might risk missing peaks and valleys in your data set, and might misunderstand how your data is distributed \u2014 for instance, look what shifts if we graph 500 bins, instead of the 30 we used above:", "An alternative to the histogram is the frequency plot, which uses a line chart in the place of bars to represent the frequency of a value in your dataset:", "Again, however, you have to pay attention to how wide your data bins are with these charts \u2014 you might accidentally smooth over major patterns in your data if you aren\u2019t careful!", "One large advantage of the frequency chart over the histogram is how it deals with multiple groupings \u2014 if your groupings trade dominance at different levels of your variable, the frequency graph will make it much more obvious how they shift than a histogram will.", "(Note that I\u2019ve done something weird to the data in order to show how the distributions change below.)", "If you want to compare a categorical and continuous variable, you\u2019re usually stuck with some form of bar chart:", "The bar chart is possibly the least exciting type of graph in existence, mostly because of how prevalent it is \u2014 but that\u2019s because it\u2019s really good at what it does. Bar charts are one of the most easily interpreted and effective types of visualizations, no matter how exciting they are.", "However, some people are really intent on ruining that. Take, for instance, the stacked bar chart, often used to add a third variable to the mix:", "Compare Fair/G to Premium/G. It\u2019s next to impossible to accurately compare the boxes \u2014 they don\u2019t share a top or a bottom line, so you can\u2019t really make a comparison. In these situations, it\u2019s a better idea to use a dodged bar chart instead:", "Dodged bar charts are usually a better choice for comparing the actual numbers of different groupings. However, this chart does a good job showing one of the limitations dodged bar charts come up against \u2014 once you get past 4 or 5 groupings, making comparisons is tricky. In these cases, you\u2019re probably trying to apply the wrong chart for the job, and should consider either breaking your chart up into smaller ones \u2014 remember, ink is cheap, and electrons or cheaper \u2014 or replacing your bars with a few lines.", "The one place where stacked bar charts are appropriate, however, is when you\u2019re comparing the relative proportions of two different groups in each bar. For instance, take the following graph:", "In this case, making comparisons across groups is trivial, made simple by the fact that the groupings all share a common line \u2014 at 100% for group 1, and at 0% for group 2. This point of reference solves the issue we had with more than two groupings \u2014 though note we\u2019d still prefer a dodged bar chart if the bars didn\u2019t always sum to the same amount.", "This is usually where most people will go on a super long rant about pie charts and how bad they are. They\u2019re wrong, but in an understandable way.", "People love to hate on pie charts, because they\u2019re almost universally a bad chart. However, if it\u2019s important for your viewer to be able to quickly figure out what proportion two or more groupings make up of the whole, a pie chart is actually the fastest and most effective way to get the point across. For instance, compare the following pie and bar charts, made with the same data set:", "It\u2019s a lot easier to tell that, say, A is smaller than C through F in the pie chart than the bar plot, since humans are better at summing angles than areas. In these instances, feel free to use a pie chart \u2014 and to tell anyone giving you flack that I said it was OK.", "Our last combination is when you\u2019re looking to have a categorical variable on both the x and y axis. These are trickier plots to think about, as we no longer encode value in position based on how far away a point is from the lower left hand corner, but rather have to get creative in effectively using position to encode a value. Remember that a geom is a geometric representation of how your data set is distributed along the x and y axes of your graph. When both of your axes are categorical, you have to get creative to show that distribution.", "One method is to use density, as we would in a scatter plot, to show how many data points you have falling into each combination of categories graphed. You can do this by making a \u201cpoint cloud\u201d chart, where more dense clouds represent more common combinations:", "Even without a single number on this chart, its message is clear \u2014 we can tell how our diamonds are distributed with a single glance. A similar way to do this is to use a heat map, where differently colored cells represent a range of values:", "I personally think heat maps are less effective \u2014 partially because by using the color aesthetic to encode this value, you can\u2019t use it for anything else \u2014 but they\u2019re often easier to make with the resources at hand.", "As we move into our final section, it\u2019s time to dwell on our final mantra:", "Think back to the diamonds data set we used in the last section. It contains data on 54,000 individual diamonds, including the carat and sale price for each. If we wanted to compare those two continuous variables, we might think a scatter plot would be a good way to do so:", "Unfortunately, it seems like 54,000 points is a few too many for this plot to do us much good! This is a clear case of what\u2019s called overplotting \u2014 we simply have too much data on a single graph.", "There are three real solutions to this problem. First off, we could decide simply that we want to refactor our chart, and instead show how a metric \u2014 such as average sale price \u2014 changes at different carats, rather than how our data is distributed:", "There are all sorts of ways we can do this sort of refactoring \u2014 if we wanted, we could get a very similar graph by binning our data and making a bar plot:", "Either way, though, we\u2019re not truly showing the same thing as was in the original graph \u2014 we don\u2019t have any indication of how our data is distributed along both these axes.", "The second solution solves this problem much more effectively \u2014 make all your points semi-transparent:", "By doing this, we\u2019re now able to see areas where our data is much more densely distributed, something that was lost in the summary statistics \u2014 for instance, it appears that low-carat diamonds are much more tightly grouped than higher carat ones. We can also see some dark stripes at \u201cround-number\u201d values for carat \u2014 that indicates to me that our data has some integrity issues, if appraisers are more likely to give a stone a rounded number.", "The challenge with this approach comes when we want to map a third variable \u2014 let\u2019s use cut \u2014 in our graphic. We can try to change the aesthetics of our graph as usual:", "But unfortunately the sheer number of points drowns out most of the variance in color and shape on the graphic. In this case, our best option may be to facet our plots \u2014 that is, to split our one large plot into several small multiples:", "Ink is cheap. Electrons are even cheaper. Make more than one graph.", "By splitting out our data into several smaller graphics, we\u2019re much better able to see how the distribution shifts between our categories. In fact, we could use this technique to split our data even further, into a matrix of scatter plots showing how different groups are distributed:", "One last, extremely helpful use of faceting is to split apart charts with multiple entangled lines:", "These charts, commonly referred to as \u201cspaghetti charts\u201d, are usually much easier to use when split into small multiples:", "Now, one major drawback of facet charts is that they can make comparisons much harder \u2014 if, in our line chart, it\u2019s more important to know that most clarities are close in price at 2 carats than it is to know how the price for each clarity changes with carat, then the first chart is likely the more effective option. In those cases, however, it\u2019s worth reassessing how many lines you actually need on your graph \u2014 if you only care about a few clarities, then only include those lines. The goal is to make making important comparisons easy, with the understanding that some comparisons are more important than others.", "Cast your mind back to the graphic I used as an example of an explanatory chart:", "You might have noticed that this chart is differently styled from all the others in this course \u2014 it doesn\u2019t have the grey background or grid lines or anything else.", "Remember our second mantra: everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler. This chart reflects that goal. We\u2019ve lost some of the distracting elements \u2014 the colored background and grid lines \u2014 and changed the other elements to make the overall graphic more effective. The objective is to have no extraneous element on the graph, so that it might be as expressive and effective as possible. This usually means using minimal colors, minimal text, and no grid lines. (After all, those lines are usually only useful in order to pick out a specific value \u2014 and if you\u2019re expecting people to need specific values, you should give them a table!)", "Those extraneous elements are known as chartjunk. You see this a lot with graphs made in Excel \u2014 they\u2019ll have dark backgrounds, dark lines, special shading effects or gradients that don\u2019t encode information, or \u2014 worst of all \u2014 those \u201c3D\u201d bar/line/pie charts, because these things can be added with a single click. However, they tend to make your graphics less effective as they force the user to spend more time separating data from ornamentation. Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler \u2014 so don\u2019t try to pretty up your graph with non-useful elements.", "Another common instance of chartjunk is animation in graphics. While animated graphics are exciting and trendy, they tend to reduce the effectiveness of your graphics because as humans, when something is moving we can\u2019t focus on anything else. Check out these examples from the Harvard Vision Lab \u2014 they show just how hard it is to notice changes when animation is added. This isn\u2019t to say you can never use animation \u2014 but its uses are best kept to times when your graphic looking cool is more important than it conveying information.", "As we wind down this course, I want to finish by touching on a few common mistakes that didn\u2019t have a great home in any other section \u2014 mostly because we were too busy talking about good design principles.", "Chief among these mistakes are plots with two y axes, beloved by charlatans and financial advisors since days unwritten. Plots with two y axes are a great way to force a correlation that doesn\u2019t really exist into existence on your chart. In almost every case, you should just make two graphs \u2014 ink is cheap. Electrons are even cheaper. The precise reasons are outside of the scope of this lesson, so check out this link for an extremely entertaining read on the subject. I\u2019ve borrowed Kieran\u2019s code for the below viz \u2014 look at how we can imply different things, just by changing how we scale our axes!", "Another common issue in visualizations comes from the analyst getting a little too technical with their graphs. For instance, think back to our original diamonds scatter plot:", "Looking at this chart, we can see that carat and price have a positive correlation \u2014 as one increases, the other does as well. However, it\u2019s not a linear relationship; instead, it appears that price increases faster as carat increases.", "The more statistically-minded analyst might already be thinking that we could make this relationship linear by log-transforming the axes \u2014 and they\u2019d be right! We can see a clear linear relationship when we make the transformation:", "Unfortunately, transforming your visualizations in this way can make your graphic hard to understand \u2014 in fact, only about 60% of professional scientists can even understand them. As such, transforming your axes like this tends to reduce the effectiveness of your graphic \u2014 this type of visualization should be reserved for exploratory graphics and modeling, instead.", "That just about wraps up this introduction to the basic concepts of data visualizations. Hopefully you\u2019ve picked up some concepts or vocabulary that can help you think about your own visualizations in your daily life. If nothing else, I hope you remember our mantras of data visualization:", "Hopefully these concepts will help you maximize the expressiveness and efficiency of your visualizations, steering you to use exactly as many aesthetics and design elements as it takes to tell your story. You\u2019ll know to match perceptual and data topology. You\u2019ll strive to make important comparisons easy, and you\u2019ll know to make more than one chart.", "Much luck. Go forth and visualize, and teach others how to as well. Our field will be so much the better for it.", "Mike Mahoney is a data analyst, passionate about data visualization and finding ways to apply data insights to complex systems.
