In this part I tried to display and briefly explain the main algorithms (though not all of them) that are available for regularization tasks as simply as possible.", "I find these algorithms particular useful. Most data scientists will find some of their models to overfit at some point during their career. The general idea behind these algorithms is that they try to minimize and even prevent overfitting.", "Its goal is to solve problems of data overfitting and when the data suffers from multicollinearity (Multicollinearity in a multiple regression model are highly linearly related associations between two or more explanatory variables). A standard linear or polynomial regression model will fail in the case where there is high collinearity (the existence of near-linear relationships among the independent variables) among the feature variables. Ridge Regression adds a small squared bias factor to the variables. Such a squared bias factor pulls the feature variable coefficients away from this rigidness, introducing a small amount of bias into the model but greatly reducing the variance.", "Ridge works very well to avoid over-fitting.", "If you have a model with a large number of features in the dataset and you want to avoid making the model too complex, use regularization to address over-fitting and feature selection.", "Ridge has one main disadvantage, it includes all N features in the final model.", "When you have highly-correlated variables, Ridge regression shrinks the two coefficients towards one another. Lasso is somewhat indifferent and generally picks one over the other.", "Depending on the context, one does not know which variable gets picked. Elastic-net is a compromise between the two that attempts to shrink and do a sparse selection simultaneously.", "In opposite to Ridge Regression it only penalizes high coefficients. Lasso has the effect of forcing some coefficient estimates to be exactly zero when hyper parameter \u03b8 is sufficiently large. Therefore, one can say that Lasso performs variable selection producing models much easier to interpret than those produced by Ridge Regression. Basically, it is reducing the variability and improving the accuracy of linear regression models.", "Lasso is a regularization technique for performing linear regression.", "Lasso is one alternative method to stepwise regression and other model selection and dimensionality reduction techniques.", "LASSO works well for feature selection in case we have a huge number of features (it reduce redundant features and identify the important ones).", "It shrinks coefficients to zero (compare to Ridge which adds \u201csquared magnitude\u201d of coefficient as penalty term to the loss function).", "If group of predictors are highly correlated, lasso picks only one of them and shrinks the others to zero.", "Other methods like cross-validation, stepwise regression work fairly well for reducing overfitting and perform feature selection. However, they mainly work with a small amount of features. Ridge and LASSO work well with a large amount of features.", "Combines characteristics of both lasso and ridge. Elastic Net reduces the impact of different features while not eliminating all of the features. Lasso will eliminate many features, and reduce overfitting in your linear model. Ridge will reduce the impact of features that are not important in predicting your y values. Elastic Net combines feature elimination from Lasso and feature coefficient reduction from the Ridge model to improve your model\u2019s predictions.", "Use elastic net when you have several highly correlated variables.", "Useful when there are multiple features which are correlated. Lasso is likely to pick one of these at random, while elastic-net is likely to pick both.", "Studies have suggested that the elastic net technique can outperform LASSO when used on similar data with highly correlated predictors.", "Similar to forward stepwise regression. At each step, it finds the predictor most correlated with the response. When multiple predictors having equal correlation exist, instead of continuing along the same predictor, it proceeds in a direction equiangular between the predictors. Least angle regression is like a more \u201cdemocratic\u201d version of forward stepwise regression. It follows the same general scheme of forward stepwise regression, but doesn\u2019t add a predictor fully into the model. The coefficient of that predictor is increased only until that predictor is no longer the one most correlated with the residual r. Then some other competing predictor is invited to \u201cjoin the club\u201d. It start with all coefficients equal to zero, and then it finds the predictor that is most correlated with y. It increases the coefficient in the direction of the sign of its correlation with y, and then it\u2019s taking residuals along the way and stopping when some other predictor has as much correlation with r as the first one has.", "It is useful when the number of dimensions is significantly greater than the number of points", "If two variables are almost equally correlated with the response, then their coefficients should increase at approximately the same rate.", "Doesn\u2019t work well if the data is high dimensional or has multicollinearity.", "If you\u2019re interested in more of my work you can check out my Github, my scholar page, or my website", "Your home for data science.
