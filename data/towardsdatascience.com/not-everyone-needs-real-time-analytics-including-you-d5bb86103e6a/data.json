Get data and make decisions on it in \u201creal time\u201d says the marketing copy, who wouldn\u2019t want that? But in my experience, for the vast majority of users, real-time analytics is NOT the solution that people actually need. The ROI is just not there until the organization is at a certain point.", "Most people can live with significantly relaxed constraints on query execution time and reporting latency by quite a bit, saving on a ton of cost and infrastructure, and not sacrificing much of anything besides bragging rights.", "There\u2019s lots of marketing out there that makes it seem like if you don\u2019t have all your data all the time you\u2019re missing out and will be left behind by a world that\u2019s doing AI every millisecond. As usual, marketers will do their marketing, and we should be skeptical of whatever it is they\u2019re hawking.", "Still, the basic premise is simple and compelling to beginning: \u201cWe need data/analytics/information to make decisions. There\u2019s no telling when we\u2019ll need this data to decide, so let\u2019s make sure we have it ALL THE TIME.\u201d There\u2019s also an implication that magical AI/ML sauce can be sprinkled on top of such systems to \u201ctransform your business\u201d.", "But all things come at a price, so what\u2019s the price we\u2019d be paying and what are we getting? Is this for me?", "To start, analytics infrastructure isn\u2019t free, so the usual trade-offs apply.", "Good analytics, in a broad sense, means that the analysis you can do and the results you get are good. At a fundamental level, it encompasses a number of things:", "Here, I\u2019m talking about \u201cFast with respect to how the analytics system operates/gives results\u201d. You could potentially argue that there\u2019s also a \u201cFast, as in development time\u201d component, but in this framework I consider that a and cost and cover it in the next section.", "The general rule of thumb is that the faster you want the analytical turnaround, the more compromises you\u2019re going to be forced to make. There are practical limits to the finite computing power we have access to, there\u2019s limitations of hardware to store, move and process large volumes of data. The only way around that is to use more complicated methods, do a lot of pre-processing, caching, maybe even using bespoke systems to get the performance you want.", "Doing work to build out a system has lots of costs involved, from developer time and the opportunity cost associated with that, to the raw cost of the systems and software you need to run your analytics. Replacing existing systems is even more expensive, with refactoring, testing, and lots of stress all around.", "Since no one should be compromising (much) on the \u201cGood\u201d part because no one willingly uses a system where they\u2019re wondering if the numbers are accurate. So in the end it boils down to trading speed and cost.", "And you could be correct. Is everyone complaining that they need something to make a decision and it\u2019s not ready? Have avoidable mistakes been made because you couldn\u2019t get your data ready in time? Then you should look into upgrading your infrastructure to something with less latency. It doesn\u2019t have to be a full-on big data lambda architecture stack of $$$. But something.", "If (as is more common) the bottleneck is on people sitting down and consuming the data to make decisions. Or just the decision-making process itself is slow? Then it\u2019s a lot less likely.", "I might even go so far as to say that decision-making time (or in the preparation to deciding) is the most important time you need data analytics available. Notifications from metrics when your systems break is another critical time to have them available (arguably you need to make a decision then too). Just about everything else is a nice-to-have. I feel this is the key to deciding how to balance the good, fast, cheap equation.", "They key is knowing and identifying what the timing of decision-making and building your metrics infrastructure to meet those needs. If something changes in your system and you NEED to respond within 5 minutes (or 5 milliseconds), your analytics has to move faster than that to give you time to react. For such a situation, having the low data analytics latency is of value to you, and you\u2019ll want to invest in systems to keep things speedy.", "Meanwhile, if managing sales accounts where every last sales contract takes months to land, and contracts last for years, it\u2019s going to be extremely unlikely that you\u2019re going to benefit for a low latency analytics system, the latency lives somewhere else. Similarly, if you\u2019re ONLY using your data for quarterly reports, and there\u2019s no actual business use case for doing it any faster, you probably don\u2019t need a fancy system either.", "Notice, this is largely an organizational issue, not a technological one. No amount of speedy analytics can force an org that\u2019s structured like molasses to move like anything but molasses.", "Scaled real-time analytics systems tend to be very complicated beasts. A certain amount of scale is implicit because (up to a point) you can do fairly low latency analytics with highly tuned and beefy database. (Yes I\u2019m conflating real-time w/ low latency a bit here.)", "Once you hit the limits of what a tuned database can do however, there\u2019s a need for processing streams of incoming data, doing some engineering trickery to bridge the fast short-term data w/ much slower permanent data stores. You\u2019ll need more computing power to handle the growing data volume, you\u2019ll need more network and storage, then people to maintain the systems. It\u2019s a significant investment and you pay a cost in maintaining all that machinery.", "Meanwhile, batch jobs can be much simpler, at the extreme a single weak analytics database, a SQL query, and a cron script that sends an email can be all that\u2019s needed to deliver a report on time when you have 8 hours to run the job.", "Look, I\u2019ve been an analyst, I get that it sucks to have to wait 10k+ seconds (~2hr 45min!) for a large query of death to come back. But how much money is your organization willing to spend to get that 10k seconds down to 5k seconds? 100s? 1s?", "Thanks to diminishing returns, the cost tend to rocket upwards as your time requirements get shorter. There\u2019s usually some low hanging fruit like upgrading to SSDs or newer hardware. But no architecture scales forever, so eventually you\u2019ll have to rip everything apart and put together something new, and that\u2019s costly. So if there\u2019s a business case for it, yeah, fight for the lower latency you need to do your job, to the point where the boss is willing to pay for it.", "YES, this is definitely a thing that could happen. Having more timely analytics can lead to a fundamental change in how the organization operates and all sorts of wonderful unicorns. But access to tons of noisy up-to-date data can also be a distraction. It\u2019s hard to predict from a pure tech point of view what you should do here.", "Instead, I\u2019d take a step back. This is a question of about the organizational structure itself. Is it willing, or even capable, of changing if given access to data faster? Are there people in place who have an understanding of how to use the data to make decisions, and can change processes to match? Maybe there\u2019s a use case example from a competitor that they want to imitate?", "Throwing tech at an organization that isn\u2019t ready to make use of it rarely works well. So if you\u2019re budgeting to upgrade your analytics infrastructure faster, you might have to budget extra for training on top of it.", "Your home for data science.
