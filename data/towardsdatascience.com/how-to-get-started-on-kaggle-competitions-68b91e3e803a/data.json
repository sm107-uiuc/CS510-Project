With the myriad of courses, books, and tutorials addressing the subject online, it\u2019s perfectly normal to feel overwhelmed with no clue where to start.", "Although there isn\u2019t a unanimous agreement on the best approach to take when starting to learn a skill, getting started on Kaggle from the beginning of your data science path is solid advice.", "It is an amazing place to learn and share your experience and data scientists of all levels can benefit from collaboration and interaction with other users. More experienced users can keep up to date with new trends and technologies, while beginners will find a great environment to get started in the field.", "Kaggle has several crash courses to help beginners train their skills. There are courses on python, pandas, machine learning, deep learning, only to name a few. As you gain more confidence, you can enter competitions to test your skills. In fact, after a few courses, you will be encouraged to join your first competition.", "In this article, I\u2019ll show you, in a straightforward approach, some tips on how to structure your first project. I\u2019ll be working on the Housing Prices Competition, one of the best hands-on projects to start on Kaggle.", "The first step when you face a new data set is to take some time to know the data. In Kaggle competitions, you\u2019ll come across something like the sample below.", "On the competition\u2019s page, you can check the project description on Overview and you\u2019ll find useful information about the data set on the tab Data. In Kaggle competitions, it\u2019s common to have the training and test sets provided in separate files. On the same tab, there\u2019s usually a summary of the features you\u2019ll be working with and some basic statistics. It\u2019s crucial to understand which problem needs to be addressed and the data set we have at hand.", "You can use the Kaggle notebooks to execute your projects, as they are similar to Jupyter Notebooks.", "The libraries used in this project are the following.", "The next step is to read the data set into a pandas DataFrame and obtain target vector y, which will be the column SalePrice, and predictors X, which, for now, will be the remaining columns.", "To get an overview of the data, let\u2019s check the first rows and the size of the data set.", "We have 1,460 rows and 79 columns. Later on, we\u2019ll check these columns to verify which of them will be meaningful to the model.", "In the next step, we\u2019ll split the data into training and validation sets.", "It is crucial to break our data into a set for training the model and another one to validate the results. It\u2019s worth mentioning that we should never use the test data here. Our test set stays untouched until we are satisfied with our model\u2019s performance.", "What we\u2019re going to do is taking the predictors X and target vector y and breaking them into training and validation sets. For that, we\u2019ll use scikit-learn\u2019s train_test_split.", "Now, we start analyzing the data by checking some information about the features.", "From the summary above, we can observe that some columns have missing values. Let\u2019s take a closer look.", "Some features have missing values counting for the majority of their entries. Checking the competition page, we find more details about the values for each feature, which will help us handle missing data.", "For instance, in the columns PoolQC, MiscFeature, Alley, Fence, and FireplaceQu, the missing values mean that the house doesn't count with that specific feature, so, we'll fill the missing values with \"NA\". All the null values in columns starting with Garage and Bsmt are related to houses that don't have a garage or basement, respectively. We'll fill those and the remaining null values with \"NA\" or the mean value, considering if the features are categorical or numerical.", "Most machine learning models only work with numerical variables. Therefore, if we feed the model with categorical variables without preprocessing them first, we\u2019ll get an error.", "There are several ways to deal with categorical values. Here, we\u2019ll use One-Hot Encoding, which will create new columns indicating the presence or absence of each value in the original data.", "One issue of One-Hot Encoding is dealing with variables with numerous unique categories since it will create a new column for each unique category. Thus, this project will only include categorical variables with no more than 15 unique values.", "Pipelines are a great way to keep the data modeling and preprocessing more organized and easier to understand. Creating a pipeline, we\u2019ll handle the missing values and the preprocessing covered in the previous two steps.", "As defined above, numerical missing entries will be filled with the mean value while missing categorical variables will be filled with \u201cNA\u201d. Furthermore, categorical columns will also be preprocessed with One-Hot Encoding.", "We are using SimpleImputer to fill in missing values and ColumnTransformer will help us to apply the numerical and categorical preprocessors in a single transformer.", "Now that we have bundled our preprocessors in a pipeline, we can define a model. In this article, we are working with XGBoost, one of the most effective machine learning algorithms, that presents great results in many Kaggle competitions. As a metric of evaluation, we are using the Mean Absolute Error.", "Using Cross-Validation can yield better results. Instead of simply using the training and test sets, cross-validation will run our model on different subsets of the data to get multiple measures of model quality.", "We\u2019ll use the cross-validator KFold in its default setup to split the training data into 5 folds. Then, each fold will be used once as validation while the remaining folds will form the training set. After that, cross-validate will evaluate the metrics. In this case, we\u2019re using the Mean Absolute Error.", "With cross-validation we could improve our score, reducing the error. In the next step, we\u2019ll try to further improve the model, optimizing some hyperparameters.", "XGBoost in its default setup usually yields great results, but it also has plenty of hyperparameters that can be optimized to improve the model. Here, we\u2019ll use a method called GridSearchCV which will search over specified parameter values and return the best ones. Once again, we\u2019ll utilize the pipeline and the cross-validator KFold defined above.", "GridSearchCV will perform an exhaustive search over parameters, which can demand a lot of computational power and take a lot of time to be finished. We can speed up the process a little bit by setting the parameter n_jobs to -1, which means that the machine will use all processors on the task.", "After tuning some hyperparameters, it\u2019s time to go over the modeling process again to make predictions on the test set. We\u2019ll define our final model based on the optimized values provided by GridSearchCV.", "We\u2019re almost there! The machine learning modeling is done, but we still need to submit our results to have our score recorded.", "This step is quite simple. We need to create a .csv file containing the predictions. This file consists of a DataFrame with two columns. In this case, one column for \"Id\" and the other one for the test predictions on the target feature.", "Finally, we just need to join the competition. Please follow the steps below, according to Kaggle\u2019s instructions.", "After submitting, you can check your score and position on the leaderboard.", "This article was intended to be instructive, helping data science beginners to structure their first projects on Kaggle in simple steps. With this straightforward approach, I\u2019ve got a score of 14,778.87, which ranked this project in the Top 7%.", "After further studying, you can go back on past projects and try to enhance their performance, using new skills you\u2019ve learned. To improve this project, we could investigate and treat the outliers more closely, apply a different approach to missing values, or do some feature engineering, for instance.", "My advice to beginners is to keep it simple when starting out. Instead of aiming at the \u201cperfect\u201d model, focus on completing the project, applying your skills correctly, and learning from your mistakes, understanding where and why you messed things up. The data science community is on constant expansion and there\u2019s plenty of more experienced folks willing to help on websites like Kaggle or Stack Overflow. Try to learn from their past mistakes as well! With practice and discipline, it\u2019s just a matter of time to start building more elaborate projects and climb up the ranking of Kaggle\u2019s competitions.", "Your home for data science.
