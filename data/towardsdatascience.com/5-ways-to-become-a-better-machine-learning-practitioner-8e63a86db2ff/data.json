But there are benefits to be realised from exploring adjacent tools, similar to tools within primary tech stack.", "You can expand your horizon vertically, where you can get expertise within a tool/language/software, or horizontally, where you explore adjacent and similar tools and languages to your proprietary tech stack.", "One notable benefit of expanding your horizon and knowledge when it comes to tools, libraries and software packages is that there\u2019s always a potential to add more technology and expertise to your existing skillset, which makes you in turn highly employable and marketable.", "You are literally increasing your value within the machine learning job market with each language, library and tool you gain experience in.", "Lately, I\u2019ve gained interests in psychology and understanding the human mind.", "My interest in this topic is not at the point where I need to go back to an academic institution to get the relevant knowledge.", "Still, I have purchased a couple of books on personality, the human mind and human behaviour.", "Exploring a different domain that, in some manner, relates to the whole discussion around AI provides me with versatility in my thinking and perspective when approaching machine learning problems.", "This is probably one of the most effective methods of ensuring you are the best ML practitioner you can be.", "Personal projects can be seen as one's curiosity to either explore solutions to problems or create an understanding of the world around them.", "Solution exploration and creation of understanding are examples of the advantages of technology; they are typically the primary output we as humans expect from technology application or other incarnations.", "Most ML practitioners start their learning journey through a series of video courses or ML/DS textbooks.", "There comes a time when anyone embarking on their ML learning journey will have to transition from online video courses or books to actual hands-on projects.", "For many, personal projects fill the void of experience and expertise between studies and a machine learning role.", "For some, a personal project is the beginning of a new tech startup, venture or business.", "For you, a personal project is an opportunity to showcase to the world your technical ability and creativeness.", "It\u2019s a door that leads to endless possibilities.", "Becoming a better Machine Learning Practioner is not just about getting a job promotion or having \u2018Senior\u2019 next to your job title.", "A good ML practitioner continuously improves their skill set, mindset, business acumen, collaboration skills and more.", "A good ML practitioner is always chasing knowledge and expertise.", "A good ML practitioner takes every opportunity to learn and teach.", "A good ML practitioner\u2026you get the point.", "It\u2019s understandable that the path to becoming an ML practitioner that provides unreplaceable value is hard.", "In my current journey of trying to become the best Computer Vision Engineer I can be, I\u2019ve faced obstacles and doubts; some call it imposter syndrome.", "But then I remember that as long as I\u2019m better than I was yesterday, then I\u2019m at least doing something right.", "The tips and advice in this article are helpful, but I\u2019m sure seasoned ML practitioners reading this article have one or two tips they can add to this list.", "Feel free to share any other methods of becoming a better ML practitioner that you are aware of in the comment section.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
