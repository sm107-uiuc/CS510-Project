I find many of these articles very subjective based on the perspective on the writer / data scientist, and find myself not necessarily agreeing with all the advice, or at least with what it takes to be a data scientist.", "I figured if I was not in agreement with all of these articles, I would write my own, ridiculously incredulous, version. Without further ado, my list of things you\u2019ll need to be a data scientist.", "By reading this article, you have failed.", "Wait wait, no you didn\u2019t. Let me start again.", "There are some things that school cannot teach you that practical experience can. Learning by the text book is not usually the way you\u2019ll learn things in your new job, rather, you\u2019ll keep trying different solutions and pitching different ideas to your stakeholders until one sticks. Throughout this process, you\u2019ll make notes of where you failed, and where you can improve.", "Additionally, you might be working in a fast paced job or be under pressure from deadlines. You might not have the luxury to attain the perfect solution. You\u2019ll have to figure out what % coverage you can get from a minimally viable product, and do pivot to less than obvious solutions when you inevitably hit a blocker.", "The reality is that in a lot of jobs, change is the only constant and the ability to flexibly solve problems in less than perfect ways, is the status quo. I say embrace it. You learn a lot about how to iterate and become a better problem solver over time.", "I feel like that school and boot camps teach you clean text book ways to solve problems. But solving problems in industry often does not mirror the cleanliness of the aforementioned environments.", "When learning any skill associated with data science, don\u2019t let perfection hinder your learning. Allow yourself to make mistakes. Seek feedback on your mistakes whenever possible. Ask a lot of questions. Failing is one of the best ways to gather knowledge. Don\u2019t be afraid to mess up on your home work, your personal hobby project, or a model you\u2019ve worked on at your job.", "Let me give you a hypothetical scenario: You work at a healthcare company (like I do!) and you\u2019re thinking about how physicians more efficiently manage their high risk populations. You want to build a model where you can project out the the number of emergency department visits a particular hospital will see due to cardiac related diagnoses, over the next six months.", "You decide to build a model. Great!", "What\u2019s your step 1? Maybe gather some data, do some exploratory analyses, build a model MVP, see how your model fits. That sounds good.", "Okay then, who is going to consume your model? Does it solve for a problem particular set of problems your customers are looking for a solution to?", "Of course, you are a data scientist on the food chain of many business higher ups that green light projects into production. How have you communicated the value of said model? What do predictions of emergency department visits six months in advance help in terms of patient care, and value savings? Do you have a dollar amount tied to this prediction? How could this possible reduce your customer\u2019s labor costs, and potentially free up resources to invest in other types of patient care?", "Have you thought about how you will explain the mechanics of the model? Are you using an ARIMA or a time-series regression model? Or are you considering a more complicated black box model, like an neural network, such as an LSTM? How do you plan on explaining how the inputs turn into outputs from any of these solutions.", "The reason I\u2019m mentioning some of these (not so) silly questions is that your communications skills are paramount to getting buy in from your peers at all levels.", "Think about it this way: there could be three steps up the data science food chain for you to green light a model\u2019s development: Convincing your data science peers, convincing your business stakeholders, and convincing potential customers. Specifically regarding the value of your model.", "And think about how you would talk to these three groups. Would you talk to data scientists in the same way you\u2019d talk to an MBA, in the same way you\u2019d talk to a physician? There might be overlap, but you would still need to do lots of tailoring of how you might pitch your ideas.", "More over, I\u2019m particularly inspired from wisdom I\u2019ve received from my more product focused data scientist peers about their own experiences. When working as a data scientist supporting products, you inevitably work with product managers to successfully push out new products for your company. When rolling out a product, feature, or model, what do you define as a metric of success? How do you work with your stakeholders to 1) Develop hypotheses, 2) Develop a framework to test those hypotheses, 3) Use analytics / machine learning to support/reject those hypotheses, and 4) Use those conclusions to drive answers to valuable business questions?", "Learning these skills is tricky, but I\u2019ve taken habit to identify mentor figures which I can observe and learn from. I seek feedback from stakeholders of all sorts to see how I can improve. I assess with my manager what I think seems to be working, and perhaps what isn\u2019t (see a trend here with #1?).", "The common denominator in many of these situations is learning how to talk the talk as much as walking the walk. Be clear. Be communicative. And never assume anyone knows what you are talking about, ever.", "There are many taxonomies of \u201cdata scientists\u201d these days. When I read articles about how to be a data scientist, they increasingly rub me the wrong way because they treat training as a one size fits all approach. To date, Data Science means different things to different people and different organizations. Broadly speaking, I\u2019ve seen a few broad definitions of data science. I particularly like the way AirBnB dichotomizes Data Science specialties, but their way is by no means the \u201cgold standard\u201d.", "Are you more interested in story telling, exploring cuts of data, getting to the bottom of mysteries that lie beneath the data? Maybe you are a Data Science Analyst, focusing on building stories and being a detective when it comes to anything data oriented.", "Are you interested being more oriented towards building models and algorithms, doing lots of heavy lifting with your programming chops, and implementing models that power products? Perhaps you want to think about being a Data Science Builder or Data Science Modeler.", "Or maybe you like to do empirical testing, generating hypotheses, determining how to derive causal conclusions using various research methodologies, then using statistics to validate those conclusions. Perhaps you might be a Data Scientist specialized in Inference.", "These are just examples of the various dimensions of data science. Most taxonomies will have skills that will overlap, though if you\u2019re more oriented towards being a Data Science Analyst (as I am), you are good at piecing data together, weaving a story, and communicating the results. You might know how to build models or conduct A/B tests, but that may not necessarily your specialization (or interest).", "This is where school CAN help you, for sure. Having a set foundation of technical skills will set up you for success in the long run, at least in terms of learning the newest fancy techniques or the newest cutting edge tools.", "What does this mean? Well for starters, understanding some level of statistics. I recommend starting from the basics (such as descriptive and inferential statistics) all the way up to basic modeling techniques (learning the mechanics of regression models, at minimum). You\u2019d be surprised how far this will take you, because the understanding of fundamental concepts core to these topics will allow you to learn more complex techniques faster and easier.", "I\u2019m a Psychologist by training, so technically math never came natural for me. But through all my stats courses, I picked up knowledge of calculus and linear algebra. Understanding the basics here will let you understand the mechanics of the models you use more readily. The use of said math will vary by company, by team, and by project. If you\u2019re building algorithms, you might spend time brushing up on your calculus and linear algebra quite a bit, but if your not, you could probably get away by just knowing the basics. Your mileage may vary.", "Finally, programming skills. Python. R. SQL. Maybe Scala and Java. Go read a few books on these. Watch Udemy/Coursera/Data Camp videos. Do Hacker Rank and/or LeetCode exercises. Invariably, you will get tested on your programming skills in interviews at some point, so I suggest getting to a fluent state of knowing some languages. Again, your mileage may vary on how deep you need to go: you might be on a team that puts code into product frequently, so you may benefit from doing lots of online coding challenges and understanding some basic computer science. Or maybe you\u2019re on a team that has more skilled data engineers to put your code into production. Having skills to write (potentially modular) scripts in python might be enough.", "If you are really in search of resources, you can always check out these links for programming and machine learning.", "(Seriously though, it\u2019s not too hard to search for various resources to learn the required skills).", "Personally, I read several books (and took notes), worked on hobby projects to learn R and Python, and polished those skills a bit more by doing coding challenges.", "You\u2019ll notice however, I prioritized soft skills first in this list, because I think, in my most uninformed, less than perfect, point of view that those skill can take you far in your career. Anyone can pick up a textbook, learn the newest fancy algorithm or program in the hottest language, but it seems most lists I read discount one of the hardest parts of the job: learning how to learn (again) and learning how to collaboratively work in a diverse team like a well oiled machine.", "Michelle Tat is a Queer-Trans Chinese-American activist living in Greater Boston. She currently is a Product Analytics Manager at athenahealth, and is also a co-chair of the Massachusetts Transgender Political Coalition. You can find her posts about data, social justice, and cats on Twitter at @tatinthehat.", "Your home for data science.
