Multiple different measures are used to estimate this, and in this article, we will describe these measures, and discuss the difficulties associated with obtaining these metrics.", "There are three principal measures of disease lethality: the case fatality rate (CFR), infection fatality rate (IFR) and mortality rate (MR). The mortality rate can be calculated by dividing the number of deaths by the total at-risk population. This tells us the probability of a person dying within a population. On the other hand, the CFR uses the same numerator but instead divides it by the number of confirmed cases. That is, it indicates the percentage of people that die given that one is infected (and report it). The IFR is identical to the CFR, except that it divides deaths by the total number of people who have been infected. This takes into account people who are infected regardless of whether they report or not. In a world where no cases of the virus went undetected and all of them were reported, the IFR and CFR would be equivalent. However, as we will discuss, this is difficult to achieve because not all infections are accounted for in reality.", "In order to measure fatality rates, we first need to understand the chronology of events during infection.", "The chronology of the process of catching the disease helps us understand the difficulty in measuring the true onset-to-death interval. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the timeline (Figure 1). From catching the disease to recovering/dying, the entire process may take 2\u20136 weeks.", "A. Infected \u2014 The virus proliferates in your body, you\u2019re infected. At this stage, you likely don\u2019t even know that you are infected.", "B. Showing/not showing symptoms \u2014 you may or may not exhibit symptoms. If asymptomatic you\u2019re less likely to go get yourself tested.", "C. Getting tested \u2014 you may/may not get tested. If you have the disease but don\u2019t get tested, the CFR is invalid. If you don\u2019t get tested, you are out of this process now.", "D. Results \u2014 You get your results. This lag differs widely across countries (in SK you get your results in a day, while it takes 3\u20135 days in the US). In rare cases, false negatives\u2014 e.g. the test returns negative results if you\u2019re positive\u2014 may arise, but those are negligibly uncommon.", "E. Hospitalized \u2014 Depending on the severity of your condition, you may or may not be hospitalized (roughly 5\u201320% of people will need to be)", "F. Outcome \u2014 From there, your symptoms either ease and you recover, or you die.", "During outbreaks like the COVID-19, it is unclear as to how many people are infected and this makes it very hard to measure the IFR accurately. This is because there are numerous people that are asymptomatic that do not realize that they have the virus. It may also occur because people may not have access to testing, test results are taking a long time to process, or they are simply not reporting their illness. For this reason, the IFR will always be less than the CFR as it has the same numerator with a greater denominator.", "In an ideal case, if everyone in the population were tested frequently, then we would know exactly how many people are infected. In this case, the IFR will be exactly the same as CFR. However, many people who have the disease (as in the case of COVID-19) are not being tested, and therefore are not added to the denominator of the CFR. Whatever the reason, this heavily skews the CFR. To further understand the disparity that exists between the IFR and the CFR let\u2019s examine how different countries have coordinated testing for the new Coronavirus.", "Testing rates widely vary among countries, and this heavily impacts their case fatality rates. Figure 2 plots the CFR with testing per capita\u2014 it clearly demonstrates that the CFR decreases as more tests are implemented. Germany, South Korea, and Norway implemented aggressive proactive testing. In contrast, Italy also tested heavily, but their response was reactive; they tested only once the situation got serious. While the CFR can vary due to health care, age-mix of the infected population, infrastructure etc., it very likely cannot explain this large deviance. i.e., Aside from other factors, the low CFR in many of these countries is almost certainly a function of its testing. In other words, Germany\u2019s CFR would be much closer to the IFR, whereas Indonesia and Spain have much higher CFR because they tested primarily those who were already sick. Moreover, the progression from the time of infection to death is much longer with proactive testing (when countries test before a large outbreak), compared to reactive testing (when testing is only done on already-sick individuals).", "In my recent work, we ran multiple simulations by modifying the onset-to-death intervals and the growth of the outbreak to determine the combinations of the onset-to-death and mortality that fit the actual number of deaths. We reproduce this for Switzerland (Figure 3,4). Figure 3 displays combinations of onset-to-death interval and case fatality rate under which the model and actual data are the closest. There is a wide range of values of the onset-to-death interval that are theoretically possible.", "In Figure 4, we show the distribution of onset to death as well as the Gaussian kernel density estimation which minimizes the difference between the modeled and actual number of deaths. We estimate that an onset-to-death interval of 22 days is the best estimate for Switzerland. Figure 5 reveals this number for numerous other countries, scattered with testing per capita (Bigger dots mean more cases).", "This demonstrates a strong correlation between onset to death and the prevalence of testing; widespread testing results in a longer onset-to-death duration. Almost certainly, the onset-to-death intervals should be close in each of the countries if the age-mix, healthcare, and infrastructure are similar. The vast difference in this measure definitely indicates that the onset-to-death where testing is less is almost certainly shorter than actual. i.e., people are tested only when they are already sick.", "Countries like Iceland, which randomly tested 5000+ people, and discovered about half of those who tested positive were asymptomatic. Most countries, including the US, are only testing those who exhibit a fever, cough, etc. This makes the onset-to-death interval shorter and thus inflating CFR. Therefore, it is difficult to obtain a standardized number due to the disparity of testing practices carried out in different countries, making the CFR difficult to estimate.", "We should not trust CFR\u2014 Variations in CFR should be indicative of differences in factors such as age, comorbidities, etc. The fact that CFR currently depends strongly on testing shows that we cannot rely on the CFR to determine our overall IFR or mortality rates.", "We should increase testing \u2014 Not only will this allow us to isolate infected people & trace contacts, but it will help determine the true onset-to-death interval. This will help us calculate CFR.", "We cannot trust our infection spreading models\u2014 Many models that forecast the number of infected cases depend on R0 (the basic reproduction number), which in turn depends on the duration of the infectious period. However, this time interval is unreliable, so we cannot fully trust the forecasted number of infections from these models.", "Note from the editors: Towards Data Science is a Medium publication primarily based on the study of data science and machine learning.
