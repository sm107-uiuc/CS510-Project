To read how it compares in the feature intent classification, read this post.", "We have created our own small test data set with 11 examples taken from Google\u2019s Taskmaster 2 data set, which was just released in February 2020. We see this data set as the benchmark data set for future research and products in NER solutions, hence we are very excited to explore how TextSpace compares already now to the aforementioned products.", "The phrases in this data set can vary in length and information contained, but we picked the ones which had a lot of entities in them, so we can separate the wheat from the chaff in terms of state-of-the-art NER solutions. The phrases in our test set come from diverse domains, because we wanted to see how flexible the solutions are we compare in this post. Note that Dialogflow\u2019s pre-defined agents were used on these examples, so we expect that Dialogflow performs nearly perfectly on them.", "We\u2019ll first go through two examples in detail, but have in the end a table which summarises all of our findings.", "Let\u2019s start with an example phrase from a user who wants to book a flight:", "\u201cSo, I would like to fly out sometime tonight and fly back in the evening in 4 days. From I\u2019m looking to go to Denver. I\u2019m flying out of San Francisco.\u201d", "IBM\u2019s MAX Named Entity Tagger does not perform well and merely returns which words belong to the categories time and location. Unfortunately, it even misclassifies the word \u201cI\u201d as an event at the beginning of the second sentence.", "Compared to this, the StanfordNLP NER model performs much better. All possible entities are found and even the correct date is returned. However, one slight mistake happens by not recognising that the \u201cevening in 4 days\u201d belongs together. It classifies \u201cevening\u201d as the evening today and not the evening in four days.", "The spaCy NER model performs equally to IBM\u2019s and only returns that words belong to the categories time, date or location. It does not show the exact dates how StanfordNLP does.", "Our solution TextSpace performs very well in this example and extracts all possible entities with the exact dates, similar to StanfordNLP. However, TextSpace also returns an interval for time periods which are not very specific, as for example \u201cevening\u201d or \u201ctonight\u201d. Here are first the locations:", "Unfortunately, TextSpace also does not recognise that \u201cevening\u201d and \u201cin 4 days\u201d belongs together and returns the evening of the day of writing, exactly as StanfordNLP does.", "Using Dialogflow\u2019s pre-built flight booking agent, we get the following mediocre results. It identifies the date and time correctly, the departure and arrival cities, but misses the \u201cin 4 days\u201d completely. Quite disappointing given we use a Google data set and Dialogflow\u2019s domain-specific agent for booking flight tickets.", "Next, we compare these four solutions on the following sentence:", "\u201cI would like to book a room in the Park Hyatt Aviara Resort and it costs $279 per night. It\u2019s rated 4.8 stars. It offers an 18-hole golf course, an outdoor pool & tennis courts plus a spa & fine dining.\u201d", "We start again with IBM\u2019s MAX Entity Tagger. The hotel we would like to stay at is recognised as a location and the \u201c&\u201d wrongly as an organisation. The price \u201c$279\u201d is completely missed, for example. As with our previous flight booking example, quite poor performance.", "StanfordNLP does a better job and finds the \u201c$279\u201d as money, the time of the stay and the number of stars. Unfortunately, our hotel is also categorised as a location rather than an organisation \u2014 which may do its job for some applications, but this may not work when the user would like to be automatically forwarded to the hotel\u2019s website. It also does not recognise that the price of $279 belongs to \u201cper night\u201d and it returns \u201cnight\u201d as the date.", "We use Dialogflow\u2019s pre-trained hotel booking agent, which makes us naturally expecting its results should be at least as good as the ones found by StanfordNLP. Unfortunately, this is not the case and not even the price of \u201c$279\u201d is found. It correctly classifies \u201cHyatt\u201d as the venue chain, but wrongly classifies its business name as \u201cResort and it costs $279\u201d. The date is also completely missed out.", "spaCy does an equally poor job as seen in the previous example. Our hotel \u201cPark Hyatt Aviara Resort\u201d is classified as a facility (FAC), which is not quite right, but the \u201c279\u201d were correctly categorised as a monetary value. Unfortunately, \u201cspa & fine\u201d is wrongly seen as an organisation.", "TextSpace does the best job amongst all five solutions here. It finds \u201cHyatt\u201d as an organisation, the monetary value \u201c$279\u201d, skips \u201cnight\u201d because it knows that the $279 are the price per night, and finds all numbers.", "As promised, we compare now how all of these five solutions compare across all 11 examples in our test set. The methodology to measure this is straightforward: we know which categories the solutions are pre-trained on and measure the percentage of how many of all possible categories are found in the example phrases. For example, in the sentence \u201cSo, I would like to fly out sometime tonight and fly back in the evening in 4 days. From I\u2019m looking to go to Denver. I\u2019m flying out of San Francisco.\u201d, which we used previously for the flight ticket booking, a solution would achieve 100% precision and recall if it classified \u201ctonight\u201d and \u201cevening in 4 days\u201d as the correct date with time frame, \u201cDenver\u201d and \u201cSan Francisco\u201d as locations or cities. In other words, all potential entities were found and all were correctly classified. As soon as one of them is missed, let\u2019s say \u201cevening in 4 days\u201d, only three out of four are correct, which gives a recall of 75%. If additionally a word is misclassified, let\u2019s say \u201cI\u201d as an organisation, the precision would drop to 4 out of 5, or 80%. If dates were found but only \u201ctime\u201d or \u201cdate\u201d returned without the precise date or time, we would subtract 0.5.", "TextSpace\u2019s NER performs the best in comparison to these four other solutions, closely followed by StanfordNLP. IBM\u2019s MAX Entity Tagger disappoints overall.", "And here the numbers to these bar charts:", "If you want to reproduce these results, here are the 11 phrases we used:- Flight booking 1: \u201cSo, I would like to fly out sometime tonight and fly back in the evening in 4 days. From I\u2019m looking to go to Denver.
