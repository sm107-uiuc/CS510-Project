Various techniques have been applied to land cover classification, including traditional statistical algorithms and recent machine learning approaches, such as random forest and support vector machines, e.t.c.", "This article covers a hands-on Python tutorial on the land cover classification of satellite imagery using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).", "Satellite imagery has a wide range of applications which is incorporated in every aspect of human life. Especially remote sensing has evolved over the years to solve a lot of problems in different areas. In Remote Sensing, hyperspectral remote sensors are widely used for monitoring the earth\u2019s surface with a high spectral resolution.", "Hyperspectral Imaging is an important technique in remote sensing, which collects the electromagnetic spectrum ranging from the visible to the near-infrared wavelength. Hyperspectral imaging sensors often provide hundreds of narrow spectral bands from the same area on the surface of the earth. In hyperspectral images (HSI), each pixel can be regarded as a high-dimensional vector whose entries correspond to the spectral reflectance in a specific wavelength.", "With the advantage of distinguishing subtle spectral differences, HSIs have been widely applied in diverse areas such as Crop Analysis, Geological Mapping, Mineral Exploration, Defence Research, Urban Investigation, Military Surveillance, Flood Tracking, etc.", "Use below Articles and Research Papers for a better understanding of Hyperspectral Images.", "Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that yields high-level abstractions by compositing multiple non-linear transformations. Among deep learning algorithms, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have gained popularity in computer vision and remote sensing fields, especially for image classification.", "Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) is a type of deep learning method that uses convolutional multiplication based on artificial neural networks. Recently, CNN has been widely used in land cover classification, showing remarkable performance. Typical CNNs are composed of convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.", "Given a pixel of the HSI (a vector for 1-D CNN), several filters with a specific window size sweep the image (or the vector) to create feature maps at convolutional layers. Filters are trained to extract significant features of the input data. Pooling layers reduce the spatial size of feature maps by extracting a representative value, such as a mean or maximum value, from a given window.", "This process is widely used to make the CNN model more robust by avoiding overfitting problems while considerably decreasing the computational cost. Fully connected layers produce the final result of classification or regression with the features from previous layers. Besides, Dropout is a widely used regularization method to alleviate the overfitting problem. Dropout randomly drops a few connections between layers by setting the weights of the connections to zero. Dropout can be applied to any of the aforementioned layers.", "The Salinas HSI was collected by the 224-band AVIRIS sensor over Salinas Valley, California. It is characterized by high spatial resolution (3.7-meter pixels). The area covered comprises 512 lines by 217 samples. As with the Indian Pines scene, we discarded the 20 water absorption bands. This image was available only as at-sensor radiance data. It includes vegetables, bare soils, and vineyard fields. The RGB composite image of the salinas HSI is shown below.", "The below figure shows 10 bands of the Salinas HSI data.", "The Salinas HSI contains 16 classes such as Broccoli Green Weeds, Fallow, Stubble, Celery, Grapes, Vine Yard, Corn, Lettuce, e.t.c. The below figure shows the information about the classes along with the number of samples.", "The ground truth of the salinas HSI data is shown below, the spectral samples of the HSI contain no information which is defined as Zero (0) and they have to be discarded before the analysis and they are depicted in black color.", "Let\u2019s build a one dimensional CNN with different layers such as Convolution, Maxpooling, Dropout, and Dense Layers.", "The architecture of the CNN model is shown below:", "Let\u2019s start by loading the data, the salinas data is available in the .mat format. The below coded serves the purpose of loading the data and converting the data into a pandas data frame for further processing.", "The below code normalizes the data and splits the data into train and test in the ratio of 70:30.", "A brief explanation of optimizer, loss, and callbacks used for training the DNN.", "Adam is an optimization algorithm that can be used instead of the classical stochastic gradient descent procedure to update network weights iterative based on training data. The advantages of using adam optimizer are:", "Cross-entropy is the default loss function to use for multi-class classification problems. In this case, it is intended for use with multi-class classification where the target values are in the set {0, 1, 3, \u2026, n}, where each class is assigned a unique integer value. Mathematically, it is the preferred loss function under the inference framework of maximum likelihood. It is the loss function to be evaluated first and only changed if you have a good reason.", "Cross-entropy will calculate a score that summarizes the average difference between the actual and predicted probability distributions for all classes in the problem. The score is minimized and a perfect cross-entropy value is 0.", "Cross-entropy can be specified as the loss function in Keras by specifying \u2018categorical_crossentropy\u2018 when compiling the model.", "Different callbacks are such as Model Check Point, Early Stopping, and TensorBoard.", "EarlyStopping: One technique to reduce overfitting in neural networks is to use early stopping. Early stopping prevents overtraining of your model by terminating the training process if it\u2019s not really learning anything. This is pretty flexible \u2014 you can control what metric to monitor, how much it needs to change to be considered \u201cstill learning\u201d, and how many epochs in a row it can falter before the model stops training.", "ModelCheckpoint: This callback will save your model as a checkpoint file (in hdf5 or h5format) to disk after each successful epoch. You can actually set the output file to be dynamically named based on the epoch. You can also write either the loss value or accuracy value as part of the log\u2019s file name.", "The below code is used to train the CNN model.", "The code for the Accuracy and Loss graph during the training is shown below and the X-Axis represents epochs and Y-Axis represents the Percentage.", "The CNN model after training has 92.40% accuracy, Let\u2019s see the confusion matrix \u2014 A tabular representation often used to describe the performance of a classification model (or \u201cclassifier\u201d) on a set of test data for which the true values are known.", "The classification report is shown below:", "This article formally introduces hyperspectral images and their applications, implementation of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for land cover classification of Salinas HSI, also interprets the results in the form of classification report, confusion matrix.", "The detailed hands-on tutorial can be accessed using the below GitHub link.", "Your home for data science.
