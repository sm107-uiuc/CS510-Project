She wants to gift him a car so that he can travel to job interviews in relative comfort instead of traveling by bus.", "Eleanor goes to XYZ Bank to request a $10,000 loan. She speaks with an Associate, Kirby. Kirby invites Eleanor to fill out the loan application. On completing the form, Eleanor submits her request for a new credit line. Kirby enters her details into the software, the information then gets sent to a black-box model. The model does its magic and instantly sends its decisions back to Kirby. Dismayed, he looks at Eleanor, and immediately, her heart plummets to the floor. She knows right away; her loan request did not go through. She asks Kirby the reason for the refusal. Kirby, unfortunately, has no idea. He tells her, \u201cA mathematical model makes decisions, and we listen to it.\u201d", "Heartbroken by what he witnessed, Kirby rushes to the Data Science team. He asks them to give him some insight into how the black-box model makes its decisions. The Data Science team looks at him and says, \u201cUmm\u2026 it\u2019s kind of hard to explain...\u201d. Kirby presses them further and they agree to analyze the model\u2019s decision, during this process, they learn of some shocking news \u2014 The black-box model is biased against people over the age of 65! They head back to the drawing board to rebuild, re-train, re-test and re-deploy a new black-box model free of biases against age.", "Kirby decides to re-enter Eleanor\u2019s loan application information to see if her loan request will get approved by the new and improved bias-free model. The model produces the same outcome \u2014 REJECTED.", "But this time, he also gets a ranked list of critical factors that influenced the model. The ranked list is an attempt by the Data Science team to address model interpretability. The top two factors listed are \u2014 \u201ccredit score (65%)\u201d, and \u201cnumber of existing credit lines (22%)\u201d. The percentage numbers are the relative importance of the factor to the model\u2019s outcome. Kirby calls Eleanor to let her know why her application was rejected. Eleanor is grateful for Kirby\u2019s call and decides to take proactive measures to enable her to get Tim a car. Eleanor has learned that her credit score is a huge factor in determining whether her loan request gets accepted or rejected. She manages her finances well for the next month. A month later Eleanor checks her new credit score and finds that it has miraculously jumped by 27 points. She heads over to XYZ Bank for another try. Kirby goes clack, clack, clack with his keyboard, hits enter, and his face falls.", "Both Kirby and Eleanor are shocked. In spite of the miraculous increase in her credit score, the decision on her loan request remained the same. Distressed, Eleanor asks Kirby, \u201cBy how much do I need to increase my credit score to be accepted?\u201d. Kirby confused says, \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Eleanor. I don\u2019t know\u2026\u201d", "The above story brings home a few points:", "There must be a strong collaborative effort between the Scientists and the Business teams.", "Three stakeholders of XAI have been clearly defined in the story. Let\u2019s understand why these stakeholders are essential for XAI:", "So far, we\u2019ve discussed the importance of XAI for the three key stakeholders. However, there is a crucial fourth stakeholder who has the power to bring about the necessary collaboration. The essential fourth stakeholder is the Policymaker. They have a critical role in pushing the development of XAI in the right direction:", "Majority of the current XAI research takes place within the four walls of research labs. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME)[1], SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)[2] and Model Agnostic Supervised Local Explanations (MAPLE)[3] are examples of open source libraries that help with model interpretability. I believe these libraries serve the technical audience. An example is shown in Figure 2. The explanations provided by these models may be a piece of the XAI puzzle. If a real-world application sits at the center of XAI research, then I firmly believe the research will get closer to help with real-world scenarios. Such research will foster collaborative work between the key stakeholders of XAI.", "In 2018, FICO co-sponsored the Explainable Machine Learning (xML) Challenge [4]. This challenge was great for the XAI community. It allowed research labs to work on a real-world application to test their theories. IBM Research won the competition [5]. They understood the importance of catering to different stakeholders (try out their demo!). XAI must be a tool geared towards diverse audiences.", "Additionally, I enjoyed the work submitted by the researchers at Cynthia Rudin\u2019s lab at Duke University [6, 10] (try out their demo!). They won the FICO Recognition Award acknowledging their submission for going above and beyond expectations with a fully transparent global model and a user-friendly dashboard to allow users to explore the global model and its explanations [5]. I have been following Cynthia Rudin\u2019s work on model interpretability for a while now. She has a unique approach to model interpretability. Her lab builds simple yet effective and interpretable models (comparable in accuracy with black-box models!). She believes you do not need to sacrifice model interpretability for accuracy [11]. However, with the world moving towards rapidly adopting deep learning, it\u2019ll be interesting to see where her research takes her in the future. I recommend taking a look at her work here and watching her Keynote at KDD 2019.", "With the adoption of Deep Learning across multiple industries, the demand and need for XAI increase day-by-day. For XAI research to move in the right direction its crucial that Data Scientists and AI Researchers step out of their labs to collaborate with business teams (incl. judges, lawyers, and doctors) and consumers, and to advise policymakers.", "Your home for data science.
