Some popular examples of AI applications in Fintech are fraud detection, risk assessment or virtual financial assistants.", "With regard to the Data Science Salon for Finance & Technology from December 8\u201310, we had the chance to talk to leading data scientists in the Fintech industry and ask them about their favorite AI use cases, the power of AI to fight COVID-19 challenges, AI trends for 2021 as well as the challenges of successfully implementing AI projects.", "Spoiler alert: includes recommendations for data scientists working in the finance and technology fields. Let\u2019s dive in!", "\u201cUncovering money laundering is an indispensable challenge for the financial services organizations and the risks associated with it are regulatory as well as reputational. Money laundering is the process by which someone injects illegal money into a legitimate system by moving large amounts of money to untraceable or counterfeit accounts. Governing such risks will now require more sophisticated algorithms as criminals can easily exploit the loopholes in rule-based guards and evolve their laundering techniques. Thus, keeping in pace with the evolving regulatory environment along with criminal typologies, the compliance teams will have to adopt new technologies to improve their detection and to optimize the analyst workloads. This is an interesting use-case where AI can enhance existing compliance processes by developing various graph-based algorithms where the focus shouldn\u2019t only be on dense subgraphs but also on the fact that laundering of money involves flow of money through chains of bank accounts; making high accuracy detection of money laundering highly challenging.\u201d \u2013Debasmita Das, Senior AI Specialist at Mastercard", "\u201cThough I\u2019m somewhat biased by having spent time working on the problem, I\u2019m still really interested in the use of AI to identify and combat financial fraud. Obviously, the most direct impact is for the institution, as quick responses and accurate identification results in very real, immediate savings in fraud loss. However, it also produces systems that can react to customer behavior quickly and intelligently to provide real-time feedback to customers regarding fraudulent activity. Being able to get alerts immediately, as the event is happening, helps build a sense of trust and respect with customers. Leveraging AI means that these decisions remain fast, while allowing for personalized decisions customized for each customer.\u201d \u2013Jeff Sharpe, Senior Manager / Tech Lead at CapitalOne", "\u201cThere are actually so many use cases that are pretty exciting when it comes to FinTech. Particularly with the blockchain technology knocking our doors, there are so many things automated and predictions being done at an exponential rate. Also with Augmented Reality into picture, use cases like Google Glass are very exciting.\u201d \u2013Vijay Pravin, Data Analytics Expert at Siemens Germany", "\u201cOrganizations that are struggling with COVID-19 concerns can benefit from automating more manual work, allowing them to do more with less. For example, AI models that automatically reply to support tickets, remove spam from their inbox, or identify high-value customers to focus on can save valuable time and expand their impact.\u201d \u2013Kristie Wirth, Data Scientist at Zapier", "\u201cCOVID-19 has created quite a bit of stress for many industries, and while many financial institutions have been able to adapt, many people have not been so lucky. Any event that puts stress on people, particularly financial stress, ends up putting stress on financial institutions as people reach out to their financial institutions for support or information. AI is being integrated into the customer service experience, driving automated chat services, assisting customer support personnel, and detecting and alerting users to problems before they notice them. Not only does this free up customer service personnel to focus on more difficult issues, but customers often get answers and resolutions to their problems faster.\u201d \u2013Jeff Sharpe, Senior Manager / Tech Lead at CapitalOne", "\u201cWith COVID-19 in place, most of the industries that do business in a traditional way take a massive hit. Going digital helps not only the organisation but also the clients and customers who are likely to attend most of the meetings or happenings virtually.\u201d \u2013Vijay Pravin, Data Analytics Expert at Siemens Germany", "\u201cThe finance industry faces a constant challenge in applying AI due to a variety of regulatory measures put in place regarding the usage of models and customer data. However, the challenge is not in finding ways of dealing with regulation, but in finding ways of managing our responsibility to use data and models in an ethical way. Regulations form a sort of agreement of a certain level of responsibility, and while there may be higher stakes for financial institutions, this is not unique to finance. Ultimately everyone using AI needs to understand the responsibility they have to use it in ways that are ethical and support benevolent ideals for the development of technology.\u201d \u2013Jeff Sharpe, Senior Manager / Tech Lead at CapitalOne", "\u201cMoney is one thing that people do care a lot. So to prevent the security breaches and the ease of use has always been a challenge in this particular sector. And the data privacy laws (for example, GDPR \u2014 General Data Protection Regulation that is in Europe) in place in various countries are also a checkpoint when it comes to deploying AI applications in real-time.\u201d \u2013Vijay Pravin, Data Analytics Expert at Siemens Germany", "\u201cOne of the biggest challenges is explainability of neural networks \u2014 to avoid legal complications any financial institute should be able to back their decision based on an AI model with rationale to auditors, regulators and stakeholders. Even though there exist approaches like SHAP which are built to decipher the rationale behind the decisions taken by complex neural networks, many financial institutes prefer tree-based algorithms or linear functions because they are easily interpretable. Second challenge is addressing bias in AI algorithms owing to historical prejudices. Handling bias and fairness backed by managerial and ethical considerations have become crucial for optimal implementation of AI. The third biggest challenge is scaling of the proof of concept (POC) before launch of the AI model. Scaling of the POCs are accompanied with a good number of hurdles like sanctity and data quality; support from stakeholders; adequate funding and fear of failure in case the model doesn\u2019t generate required results.\u201d \u2013Debasmita Das, Senior AI Specialist at Mastercard", "\u201cAI will play an important role in helping the financial institutes with smarter underwriting decisioning processes \u2014 developing solutions to assess the credit worthiness of borrowers (like SMEs) with no credit history. Risk can be managed better if AI algorithms can be developed to generate accurate predictions \u2014 using a combination of cloud-based and on-premise AI solutions, FIs will be focusing on combating different risks like fraud, detecting point of compromises and money laundering. Cybersecurity is a major pain-point for the financial institutes and with so much emphasis on digital transactions, special care needs to be taken to enable adequate checks to enable seamless risk-free transactions. AI will also have large scale implementations in Trading for ranking stocks, generating short and long-term forecasts and analyse unstructured textual data like transcripts, researches, filings and market news to identify patterns in market price-changes. Companies would also invest in Conversational AI as well as virtual financial assistants in the personal banking space.\u201d \u2013Debasmita Das, Senior AI Specialist at Mastercard", "\u201cAI has been transforming the finance sector for years. However, COVID-19 has forced us to become a more digital society. From buying groceries to interviewing for jobs, many of the things people used to do in person are being done digitally. I suspect that many of these patterns will be permanent. While digital banking isn\u2019t new, the use of AI and data science in interacting with customers will become a critical solution to the increasing number of people relying on it in the coming year.\u201d \u2013Jeff Sharpe, Senior Manager / Tech Lead at CapitalOne", "\u201cThe pandemic has created a more prominent sense of urgency and action around AI improving finance and technology than any business case ever could. From touchless transactions to businesses having to transform themselves in record time digitally, AI and technology are indispensable to protecting everyone\u2019s health and cybersecurity while keeping the economy alive. According to the MIT Technology Review Insights report The global AI agenda, the top use cases for AI in the finance and technology sectors in January and February 2020 were fraud detection and cybersecurity, respectively. AI\u2019s use for fraud detection and cybersecurity will flourish in 2021.\u201d \u2013Alyssa Columbus, Datanaut at NASA", "\u201cNot just in 2021, but in the coming years, it will push a lot of 2-tier / 3-tier companies to use a lot of AI products and applications in place. Digital workplace or working from home is going to become a new normal and that could throw in a lot of new business perspectives, and AI will push things further.\u201d \u2013Vijay Pravin, Data Analytics Expert at Siemens Germany", "\u201cMy advice for data scientists is to never stop learning. Conferences are great for this, as well as technical blogs and research publications. The field of data science is always changing, and keeping up to date with new packages and algorithms can greatly expand what you can accomplish and streamline your existing work.\u201d \u2013Kristie Wirth, Data Scientist at Zapier", "\u201cFinance and technology are both very active, exciting fields for the application of AI and data science. The complexity of the problems, the availability of data, and the business value that can be created are exceptional and provide a great environment for working with new techniques. I feel this is where the future of data science is being created. However, because of that, data scientists in these fields have a greater burden of acting with integrity, ethics and a sharp eye on the consequences of what they do. These fields offer so much potential for the improvement of people\u2019s lives, yet also the potential for harm. As a worker in this field, it\u2019s critical that you understand your impact and responsibility to society, and not just your employer.\u201d \u2013Jeff Sharpe, Senior Manager / Tech Lead at CapitalOne", "\u201cThe Finance Industry is highly data-driven and requires good domain knowledge. Hence, aspiring data scientists in the financial domain should have a good understanding of financial markets, investments, quantitative trading as well as risk management. Besides, it is recommended to have a good knowledge of statistical inference, hypothesis testing and linear algebra. They should also have an adeptness with handling time series data and developing simulation models using deep learning for valuations as well as risk estimation. Additionally, they should have a strong hold on machine learning and deep learning models and programming languages like SQL (query language) and Python/R. It\u2019s an added advantage to know about big data environments like Hadoop & Spark. It is also advisable to always keep an eye on the emerging technological trends like IOT, 5G etc and the ability to consummate their advantages in existing solutions.\u201d \u2013Debasmita Das, Senior AI Specialist at Mastercard", "AI and machine learning are helping financial institutions to improve risk management, automate manual work and provide better customer service. The trend of using algorithms for these and more tasks is here to stay and will keep transforming the industry in 2021.", "Main challenges of using AI in the Fintech industry include finding ways of managing responsibility to use data and models in an ethical way, handling bias in AI algorithms as well as explaining algorithms to back decisions based on AI and avoid legal complications.", "Good domain knowledge, awareness of the impact of AI to society as well as continuous learning are some of the key factors that help data scientists to overcome challenges and be successful in the industry.", "If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how AI is applied in Fintech join us for the Data Science Salon for Finance & Technology coming up virtually from December 8\u201310 to learn more about AI and machine learning applications in the Fintech industry. 20+ data scientists will share their expertise and experience and you\u2019ll have the chance to ask them questions in the live Q&A after each presentation.
