First, the very definition of data sculpting, then an introduction to the myFATHERintheCloud project, which I started in 2019, and finally, in the third part, an example of how I use data sculpting to generate sculptures.", "DATAsculpting exists in the field of visual arts, but also includes some parts of data science, and certainly machine learning. It uses tools that have were created with the development of data science: deep learning, databases (this is a very important element of data sculpting ) It visualizes data with the help of available tools \u2026 and this all adds up to the open concept of \u2018data sculpting\u2019.", "Data sculpting is a creative process where data is the material out of which the works that are created take shape", "Perhaps it would be best if I describe to you what data sculpting is based on examples.", "This is the first work, created in 1993. It is a slot machine, where the data set consists of three parts: nouns, verbs, adjectives. The person who plays at this one-armed bandit was shown randomly generated words which formed a desired sentence. If the sentence was deemed \u2018attractive,\u2019 then the player received a pay-out, or a win. Here as well, data was an important element of this solution. The process was fully automated \u2014 my work consisted mainly of the selection of those words, which could have formed sentences at random.", "Another work \u2014 also a game of chance in a way \u2014 called \u2018Risky Player\u2019, is an installation which was created at a Sopot casino. The game table, which you see here in the foreground,", "collects data from the surroundings and designates it a number in a row from 0 to 100. Depending on the number, the mirror visible in the image \u2014 a black mirror, which, depending on the amount of foot traffic and the intensity of what was happening around, bulges out. Thus, it interacts with its surroundings. It was a very interesting experiment to conduct. People in a casino react very much to what is happening around them. These things are very important to them; they think it all has a big impact on their performance, so their interaction with work was very interesting. This sense of interaction in my work is important because the data it gathers varies from one place to another. The same installation was set up in an art gallery and the data collected in the course was of completely different intensity and character than that from the casino. Thus, the work did not react so dynamically, the curved mirror did not bulge out as clearly as in the casino.", "This next work from 2004 was created in Pozna\u0144. It concerns the collection", "of data in the form of content generated by observers of this form. The form is homogenous, in one colour. The content was generated by the people who visited. People enter it one by one \u2014 this causes a degree of isolation and allows them to concentrate without additional stimuli. The single-coloured form eliminated any external stimuli, any additional noise \u2014 and so the room was fully isolated.", "I started the project in 2019, and it has since focused on my father\u2019s works.", "My father had been a sculptor for sixty years, so the aim of the project is to train a machine learning model that will sculpt in my father\u2019s style and thus continue his legacy.", "His sculptures were figurative, religious in style and subject. The main material he used was wood. As part of the project, I aim to have his work materialised with the help of an industrial robot, which will have the ability to sculpt in my father\u2019s style with the same tools.", "2020 I received a scholarship grant from the Minister of Culture. It concerns preparatory works for building a database. To this end, the website w-imie-ojca.gross.art.pl was created. Please do visit \u2014 on this page you are able see the components of this database, i.e. 3D scans, as well as spherical panoramas, all of which are available on this page. You can see where my father\u2019s works are displayed \u2014 which, due to the specificity of his work, is very important. It was also important for me to document the time and place it all began \u2014 it seemed to me that it may be important for training the model in the future.", "All scanned models are accessible through the browser. You can see in 3D what my father\u2019s works look like. Additionally, there is a newsletter on the website. If you are interested in the topic of data sculpting, you are welcome to subscribe. You can receive the latest news concerning not only data sculpting, but also GANs\u2019 and machine learning\u2019s use in art.", "The most important part of the project is the database. It consists of several thousand photos of sculptures. These photos are then further processed. Each element of the photo is very important during the model training. You will see it on the examples of sculptures being generated that the background is important, the lighting is important, and everything from whether the photo is coloured and how it is formatted plays a key part in the process. I prepare these photos in such a way that they do not lose their proportions \u2014 this is important for modelling. I normalise the lighting, I \u2018augment\u2019 the dataset by processing the photos, including symmetrical reflections, and as I mentioned earlier \u2014 the change of lighting, change of colour. I use different methods to make the final effect as close as possible to my father\u2019s style.", "I use various GANs to generate sculptures, including StyleGAN2(NVidia). I have prepared a database and the model, looking at the database consisting of photos of my father\u2019s figures, generates new figures which are similar in style to my father\u2019s figures. This video shows how the GAN learns from the database. This training process requires a lot of time and outputs pictures . The database also includes abstract sculptures made more recently, which expand this database and allow the works being created now to, although being in my father\u2019s style, evoke a new quality. This is what GAN training looks like, and this is a video example where all the generated images have been arranged into a film. They show the process of how generation takes place from abstraction to figurative representation.", "Everything that I produce is open source, and you can follow the process on my Substack feed.", "see the whole process (code + more experiments) in this video //english subtitles", "thank you for reading, you may also enjoy some other articles:", "All images created by the author.", "Your home for data science.
