We want to suggest similar products in our number of marketing and product activities, such as in promotional email marketing.", "Here is the super art, I build using autodraw, illustrating a marketing email having suggestions for similar products with the main product.", "In this guide, we will use a technique, used in recommender systems, to get the list of products similar to each other. Although recommender systems suggest products on the user level, meaning each user may have different suggestions, ours will be on the product level, so we get a list of similar items to recommend to every user who interacts with the main promotional product.", "But before we dive into how to get similar products we need to first understand how recommender systems find similar products to recommend to users.", "Recommendation systems, such as item-based collaborative filtering, suggests a product based on users previously consumed product history. The system looks for the products the user has positively interacted with and then it finds other products similar to consumed ones and recommends accordingly.", "So at its core recommender systems are all about finding products similar to the ones user has already liked.", "But how product similarity is calculated? and what if there are multiple similar products, which product to suggest in that case? Details on how such techniques work are beyond the scope of this write-up but you can refer to below article where I explain each and every step in greater detail using an excel sheet.", "Here is the equation to calculate the similarity of products:", "Where i is the product for which to calculate similarity, our promotional product, and j is the product with which i is being compared. r is the rating given to the product i by the user u.", "If you want to dive deeper into similarity calculation techniques I suggest starting with this course here.", "We will use RecommenderLab, an R package to build recommender systems, to help us get related products. It has a function namedsimilarity that helps calculate similarity among items. Here is the basic code:", "dataset: The dataset containing products and their ratings. The dataset should be in realRatingMatrix format.", "method: This is where we specify the technique to calculate similarity such as Cosine similarity discussed above. Other methods include Jaccard, Euclidean, Pearson similarities.", "which: This tells the similarity function on what level to calculate similarity. It could be either on the product level or on the user level. The Product level calculates similar products while the user-level calculates similar users.", "Let\u2019s now calculate the similar products using recommenderLab\u2019s similarity function. Here is how our main data set looks like.", "R code to calculate the similarity of our rating dataset.", "The above code gets us the matrix with a similarity score among products.", "Above output do get us the similarity score for each of the products but it is hard to know what are the top similar product for any given item. So, let\u2019s work to get the top 50 highly similar products in an ordered fashion.", "Here is how the output looks like:", "The productcolumn represents the main product for which we are extracting other similar products. The column 1 contains products that are most similar to our main product. So Product B000GIOPK2\u2019s most similar product is B000IJRK7O and so on.", "Few lines of code got us the list of similar products to be used in marketing and in-app suggestions.", "Apart from cosine similarity, there are Jaccard, Euclidean, Pearson etc., to calculate the similarity scores among products. Each has its own way to calculate how similar two products are. See Marvin L\u00fcthe article where he discussed all the different similarity calculation techniques.", "You only have to replace the word cosine with the method you want to use for similarity score calculation, e.g for Jaccard similarity our code would change to;", "Aside from different similarity calculation techniques, we can also work to normalize the rating values. Normalization helps to cater for the optimistic nature of people. Different people can rate the same item differently depending upon how optimistic they are. So for example, on a scale of 5, one could rate a product 5 star while another could rate 3, even though they both very much liked the product. RecommenderLab has a built-in function to help normalize the values.", "Keyword \u201cCenter\u201d tells the normalize function which method to use to normalize the ratings. Other than center we also have z-score to make values normalized.", "Suggesting the right products to the users can not only increase the interaction rate but also the business conversions and in-return results in more revenue. Finding similar products based on machine learning is an effective way to get relatable products to use in marketing and in-app. Doing so not only gives better user experiences but also increases product visibility.", "Your home for data science.
