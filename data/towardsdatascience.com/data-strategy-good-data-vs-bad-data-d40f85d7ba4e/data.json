They decided to turn the customer credit department into a large laboratory, \u201ctesting\u201d out different kinds of credit terms on different credit taker characteristics and thus collected data for years.", "This was a huge investment, and the department \u201clost money\u201d for quite some time. But what they were really doing was acquiring data, not just because they thought it\u2019s a good investment, what Fairbanks and Morris collected was Good Data. Data integrated into a good data strategy aligned with the company strategy.", "They collected data with the clear focus of improving the decision making capability of the credit department of Signet Bank.", "Good data is just that. Good data is what you have with a good data strategy. It is data you collect, clean/enrich/transform, make insightful, with the sole goal of improving decision making.", "The problem only is, out there is a lot of Bad Data! You will see bad data everywhere you go. It is data touched for any other reason, without having a larger goal in mind.", "I\u2019m not sure it's fair to judge data just on this scale, but in my experience, it seems to be the only good measure. The only value in data is to improve the decision making capability of a company and thus help it take better actions. I do think this is a lesson that\u2019s already been understood by many great thinkers. For instance, Provost & Facett make that point in \u201cData Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking\u201d.", "Fairbank & Morris understood this, applied it, and turned the little \u201cSignet Bank\u201d into Capital One, one of the largest banks in America. David Velez, co-founder of the billion-dollar Brazilian unicorn Nubank also intuitively understood this from the beginning. He is now translating his key insights into other markets around the world.", "Now let\u2019s see what Bad Data looks like and then walk through these two examples of Good Data.", "I\u2019ve written this article to help you see the dramatic differences between Good Data and Bad Data. To help you see through the forest of techniques that can be applied in both contexts. To give you the chance to reexamine your data strategy and turn Bad Data into Good Data before your competition does it.", "There are a great many examples of Bad Data. Bad Data happens when you try to let the data shape the data strategy, not the other way around. Fairbanks and Morris didn\u2019t hire a hundred data scientists to \u201ccome up with something great\u201d or collected lots of random data throughout the company. They collected data with the goal of establishing a profitable credit division and then hired upon data scientists to use & collect the right data and support this strategy.", "And albeit some evidence that some tech companies actually do simply \u201chire smart people to come up with something great\u201d and are successful with it, I do feel that usually, they do have a data strategy behind it to back that up.", "\u2026 when a company invests in building up a data lake to \u201cget insights from the data\u201d without understanding whether anyone in the company will actually use this data to make better or faster decisions than before.", "\u2026 when a company hires some data scientists to \u201ctake advantage of big data\u201d, without having actual outcomes in mind.", "\u2026when a company hires a bunch of machine learning engineers & data scientists to \u201ccome up with something great\u201d, without integrating them into their company vision.", "\u2026when a company decides to build a \u201cdata mesh\u201d because the central data collecting team is having problems, without understanding whether this will result in better actions takes by its employees.", "\u2026when an analytics department produces report upon report because people ask for them, without understanding what people do with these reports differently than what they did before.", "\u2026when a machine learning team spends a quarter building the latest recommendation engine for the website, without thinking about whether a simple compiled \u201cTop items\u201d list would do just as fine.", "\u2026when a marketing department installs the latest marketing automation tool, without already having lots of e-mail campaigns and data in place.", "\u2026when a company spends a quarter to upgrade to the latest version of \u201cAwesomeDataTool.X\u201d to \u201cfollow the pace of technology\u201d, without understanding how people use their AwesomeDataTool to decide.", "\u2026 it\u2019s not Good Data. Good Data is derived from a data strategy, integrated into the company strategy \u2026.", "All the techniques mentioned above resulting in Bad Data can be used to result in Good Data. And maybe in your case they are. But to get to see if that is true, you\u2019ve got to ask why, why, and why.", "To get Good Data, you have to start from the top. Start with the data strategy, the company strategy really. You have to start with the goal of taking better actions, making better decisions, and then work our way down the road. What does this road look like? Nowadays I tend to think about the road of data really like the flow used by ThoughtWorks:", "So the stages, if we start with our goal \u201cbetter actions\u201d are:", "If we start to analyze the Signet Bank case, we start with the data strategy. In this case, it\u2019s \u201ccollecting & experimenting with credit loans to get enough information to skim off the profitable credits larger banks won\u2019t offer\u201d.", "This was a pretty unique perspective at the time. In the 1980s the credit market was revolutionized by automatic default probability calculations. As such, credit offerings were kept at a standard rate for the people with low default probability. But in 1990 Fairbanks and Morris decided it was time to bet on both, price discrimination, or in other terms offering different credit terms to different people and a focus on profitability, not just default probability.", "So in essence they decided that in the mass of people with a higher default probability there were still profitable loans out there! And in the mass of people with low default probability, there were more profit options available as a lot of these people were actually a losing bet for the credit departments.", "So we can derive the action, the action Signet Bank was taking and wanted to improve as\u2026", "Action \u2014 \u201cOffer more profitable loans\u201d. Just as Fairbanks and Morris identified they need to focus on both profitability & default probability. The decision in question then becomes \u2026", "Decision \u2014 \u201cWhat kind of customer do I offer what kind of loan?\u201d. In the 1980s this decision was simply made based on the insight that some people have higher default probabilities and some lower. What Signet Bank now sought for was a different insight\u2026", "Insight \u2014 \u201cWhat specific customers should I provide with what specific kinds of loan conditions?\u201d. To derive these insights we need more information. Unfortunately, this information wasn\u2019t available at all in 1990. The only information provided was the default probability based on socio-demographic data\u2026.", "Information \u2014 \u201cHard data on how profitable different customer sets are, together with traditional defaulting probabilities and data on what kinds of customers are served by other banks, what conditions they offer!!\u201d. Because all of this information flows into the decision whom to serve with what product package. So finally it comes down to the question of data, raw data which simply wasn\u2019t available\u2026.", "Data \u2014 \u201cNew data, experimental data on different sets of conditions offered to people with different socio-demographic backgrounds and their respective profitability AND default probability\u201d. So for Signet Bank, it turned out, the Good Data strategy was to collect this kind of data, combine it with the other data sources to walk back up the cycle again, and in turn make better decisions.", "Of course, afterward, this wheel keeps on turning, adding more value to each stage. Capital One is reported to run thousands of variations of this kind each year. For a deeper dive into the case, look at \u201cData Science for Business: What you need to know about data mining and data-analytic thinking\u201d by Provost and Fawcett, 2013.", "This case is already quite old, and companies tend to not share this kind of data. But I\u2019ve recently stumbled across another related case from the finance industry, that of the Brazilian unicorn \u201cNubank\u201d.", "I knew Nubank for their machine learning framework fklearn. The company is creating lots of open source in the realm of machine learning problems. But as it turns out, Nubank ain\u2019t simply investing in machine learning because everyone else in the industry does it, the investment into machine learning and algorithms is deeply tied to the companies strategy and the resulting data strategy.", "Nubank is breaking into the \u201cunbanked market\u201d, which in Brazil is around 50% of the population. These people simply don\u2019t have access to the banking system. Nubank is changing that by offering products targeted at that specific group. The first product, a mobile-only managed credit card aims to provide bank access & small loans to the unbanked at a speed previously unknown in the Brazilian finance industry, and more products are following in that path.", "But serving the \u201cunbanked\u201d turns out to come with an obvious problem: How do you know if an unbanked will default, or be profitable for the company? After all, they have no banking history or financial information like credit scoring.", "This is where the data strategy becomes apparent. Nubank\u2019s founder David Velez describes to some extend how they realized exactly that problem and that they had to focus on unconventional ways of looking and collecting their data.", "Let\u2019s start from the top: Provide the unbanked, with access to a credit card with reasonable fees and still be profitable. That\u2019s the action we want to take. The data strategy thus turns into \u201cCollect & analyze data to derive which people to offer which kinds of products, the credit card, loan or a debit card\u201c\u2026", "Action \u2014 \u201cWhich customer should be offered which product? With what kinds of credit limits? To stay profitable.\u201d. After all, just like Signet Bank, Nubank is tackling a group of customers from which the traditional banking system in Brazilian shies away. The key decisions are decisions like\u2026.", "Decision \u2014 \u201cWhich specific customer can we offer the Mastercard credit card, to whom can we offer a loan and at which rates?\u201d. To make such decisions Nubank needs\u2026", "Insights & information \u2014 \u201cthe profitability of a customer as well as the default probability. But being a fast-growing start-up they also need the likelihood of people recommending the bank to others just as the possible usage of additional products like the loyalty program.\u201d.", "And that\u2019s exactly what Nubank builds and is continuing to develop, according to Velez in a CNN interview:", "\u201cNubank, however, has built its business on a wholly new foundation: unique data sets and algorithms that are based on \u201ca lot of nontraditional information,\u201d V\u00e9lez said.\u201d", "\u201dWe look at where you live\u2026how you move, who your friends are, who invited you to Nubank, the type of people that you\u2019re sending money to,\u201d he said. \u201cWe look at whether you read the contract of the credit card or whether you don\u2019t \u2014 it turns out that people [who \u201cread\u201d the contract] really fast tend to be fraudsters. We look at the type of transactions that you\u2019re doing, if you\u2019re buying groceries or if you are in a bar.\u201d", "Indeed, if you look closely Nubank is in a particularly great spot to exploiting these kinds of information because they also collect a lot of data traditional companies do not collect! They are already on your phone, have a recommendation program in place thus collecting key behavioral data.", "Indeed this is underpinned by a study by Martens & Provost in 2011 which basically says: for banks figuring & using the information where you live and how old you are, are a good starting point, but using behavioral data like the ones mentioned here provides a substantial lift in profitability and increases the more data is used, whereas the sociodemographic data hits a clear roof.", "You should also notice that Nubank is in the unique position to run experiments very similar to the one Signet Bank conducted! They currently provide 50% of the newly issued credit cards in Brazil, meaning they control a huge share of the unbanked market. By experimenting with the unbanked market they can derive very similar insights based on the data points they currently collect. And they can do that better than anyone else.", "Whether that\u2019s enough to stay profitable remains to be seen, but at least it is enough to turn Nubank into a billion-dollar start-up and let them expand around the world.", "If you want to make a difference in your company with the use of data, I hope this helps you discern Bad Data from Good Data and put you on the right path, focusing on data strategy and not on letting data dictate a \u201cstrategy\u201d. Stay tuned. There\u2019s more Good Data to come.", "DataOps @ Meltano | Data PM | co-author of \u201cData Mesh in Action\u201d | Join my free data newsletter \u201cThree Data Point Thursday\u201d at
