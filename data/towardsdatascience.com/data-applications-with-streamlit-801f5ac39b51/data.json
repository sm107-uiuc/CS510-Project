If your focus is majorly data science, machine learning, and deep learning then you might not want to spend time learning web frameworks so as to build and deploy data applications. Enter Streamlit.", "There are several other libraries that can be used for building data applications. That said, why should you consider Streamlit:", "If you were to build a data app with Flask and or Django, then knowledge in front-end tools such as HTML & CSS as well as Javascript is a must. However, in Streamlit, all this is done using Streamlit widgets. For example, a drop-down can easily be achieved using the selectbox widget. Other HTML tags such as input boxes and buttons are also achieved using simple Streamlit widgets.", "Check out the Complete Guide to Data Science Applications with Streamlit to learn more.", "When building data applications in Streamlit, you never leave your Python editor. This is because is scripted in Python. It is, therefore, very advantageous since you keep working in a language that you are already familiar with. If this was done in other Python frameworks, then writing HTML, CSS, and Javascript code would be unavoidable.", "Adding interaction to Streamlit applications is very simple. Streamlit provides widgets that one can use to weave interactivity to your application. For example, one can use the date input widget to filter their data. Select boxes and sliders can also be used to achieve the same.", "Sharing Streamlit applications is very easy. One can easily deploy to the likes of Heroku and AWS. However, one can also deploy their app on Streamlit Sharing by the click of just two buttons. All you have to do is to request access. Your Github email address will then be linked to Streamlit Sharing. Once this is done, you can deploy any Streamlit project available on your Github account.", "Streamlit is compatible with the most popular data science libraries. For example, you can perform visualizations in Streamlit with the tools that you are already used to. The visualizations libraries supported include:", "You definitely need to perform data cleaning and wrangling before visualizing your results. Pandas and NumPy are supported so that you can achieve this.", "When it comes to machine learning, you can deploy models built with the popular libraries that you are already used to. This is because Keras, TensorFlow, and PyTorch are supported out-of-the-box.", "In the event that you need a functionality that is not supported by Streamlit the first place to look is the Streanmlit Components page. Streamlit Components are third-party functionalities that have been built by the community. The components can be installed via pip and used immediately in your project.", "The beauty of it is that you can also write your own components and share them with the community.", "I hope I have convinced you to start looking into Streamlit for your next data applications. If you are looking for inspiration, the Streamlit Gallery page contains many examples.", "Learn how you can quickly and easily transform your data applications into web applications using Streamlit.", "Your home for data science.
