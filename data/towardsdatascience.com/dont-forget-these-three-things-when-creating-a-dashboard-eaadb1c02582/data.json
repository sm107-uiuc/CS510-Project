While it\u2019s great that more and more people can work\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["It\u2019s easier than ever to dive into dashboarding, but are you doing it right?", "Tableau, Power BI, and many other business intelligence tools allow you to visualize data without touching Excel or writing a single line of code.", "While it\u2019s great that more and more people can work with data, we should also remember that presenting it properly is as important as ever. Well-designed dashboards convey relevant information and allow users to make data-driven decisions. But how can you create a well-designed dashboard?", "Let\u2019s go through three overarching questions to bear in mind as you design, create, and deliver a dashboard.", "Asking this question can help you get started:", "How much time does the user have to look at this dashboard?", "So why should we care specifically about the time constraint?", "Understanding how much time someone has is important, because it can help you understand how people are going to use a dashboard. Even if someone has all the relevant knowledge to understand, filter, and modify a dashboard to answer a business question, it won\u2019t matter if they don\u2019t have the time to do so.", "This doesn\u2019t mean that you should sacrifice quality when creating a dashboard for someone with limited time. However, it could mean that you could, for example, customize the dashboard\u2019s date filters in advance, so that the user can get the answer they need right away. Tailor your dashboard to the time someone has to go through it, and you\u2019ll be well on your way to helping your organization make well-informed decisions.", "In most cases, you should build your dashboard to be as specific or general as what your user explicitly wants. However, there may be times when you understand the data more so than the user. Because of this, you may believe that to truly make a data-driven decision, you have to include more data, even if the user doesn\u2019t have the time to go through it. This may be when a conversation between you and the user is necessary, so that you can emphasize that they need to prioritize this problem a bit more.", "It would be too easy to say that you can generalize how much time someone has based on their position in the organization. For instance, a busy CEO may want to understand why a specific region is underperforming and what the potential solutions are. In this case, she could benefit from a detailed presentation-styled dashboard (like an interactive story on Tableau) to explore the situation, a more common high-level executive style report.", "This brings us to our second question:", "What will the dashboard be used for?", "Another way of putting this question is \u201cwhat decisions will this dashboard help an end-user make?\u201d When you\u2019re looking to help the finance team review quarterly expenses or give an executive an overview of the new product\u2019s digital marketing campaign performance, you\u2019ll want to create a dashboard that gives clear-cut answers. This means that you should include only the visualizations and KPIs that make it easy for the end-user to find the answer. If possible, you should also pre-set filters to show only the relevant data needed for each time they need to use the dashboard.", "In contrast, if you\u2019ve created a market research report and need to help your manager make a decision about which new region to expand to, you\u2019ll want to take a more exploratory design for your dashboard. Think as if you\u2019re creating a dashboard that\u2019s a condensed and interactive representation of all your Googling. You should allow the end-user to filter and see results for different scenarios in the dashboard, and have the different graphs and tables update dynamically with every filter.", "The next step is to make sure people actually use the dashboard you create. A final question to ask is this:", "What can I do to make sure this dashboard makes a good first impression?", "Especially when you\u2019re creating a dashboard to solve a problem that has already has a solution, you need to make sure your new solution is received well. It might not matter if you include new visualizations or a more complete set of data if the end-users perceive that the dashboard is difficult to use.", "This means that you need to consider how you interact with the end-users prior to delivering the finished dashboard. While you\u2019ll definitely have some form of communication to understand what they want, it may be worth showing your first draft of a dashboard to get some immediate feedback about what\u2019s working and what\u2019s not. You could keep doing this until delivering a final product, as long as you make sure that you\u2019re not unnecessarily bombarding the end-users with questions.", "Finally, when it comes to delivering the dashboard, it may be ok to just send an email with the link to the final version. However, depending on how much you spoke to the end-users beforehand, it might also be worth taking the time to give an overview-type presentation on the dashboard\u2019s functionality and scope. Even a one-page write-up of the data sources you used and some basics on how to filter and interact with the dashboard might be helpful, depending on who your end-user is.", "Remember that when you\u2019re creating a new solution for people that already have something to work with, it\u2019s not enough for your dashboard to deliver the same value as the old solution. If it does, what would be the point in the end-user switching over? Because of this, after you design and create a dynamic and easy-to-understand dashboard, make sure you communicate exactly why it\u2019s better than the current method being used.", "Again, here are the three things to remember:", "Be sure to keep these questions in mind, because nothing is worse than spending a week creating what you think is the perfect dashboard, only to have it ignored after you\u2019ve delivered it. Remember that all these questions are geared towards understanding the motives and attitudes of the end-user, because that is the most important person you need to account for when designing a dashboard.", "Your home for data science.
