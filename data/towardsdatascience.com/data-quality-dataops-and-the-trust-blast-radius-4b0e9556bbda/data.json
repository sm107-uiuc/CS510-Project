The difference in impact is the \u201cBlast Radius\u201d of the problem, and even the most mature data organizations can do a better job minimizing it.", "Despite the fact that nearly 98% of organizations are making major investments in their ability to become data driven, data quality still costs the average organization $15M per year in bad decisions according to Gartner, and impacts 90% of companies according to Experian . While I covered a few data quality horror stories in a prior article, it isn\u2019t common for a data quality problem to bring down a whole company. Additionally, there are now many modern tools (Soda, ToroData, Trifacta) and practices (primarily DataOps) that are making the application of data quality best practices much easier than they once were.", "However, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going out on a limb to state that Data Quality will never be a solved problem. I also think that the biggest impact, by far, of data quality issues is not the direct impact of decisions based on poor data, but the loss of trust across an organization in the data and the data platform that serves it up. Especially in organizations that have been impacted by bad data quality in the past, oftentimes repeatedly, it doesn\u2019t take a major event to start the \u201chere we go again\u201d messages from echoing across the organization.", "In fact, an IBM study showed that fully one-third of business executives don\u2019t trust their data, and they believe that on average 32% of their data is incorrect. It\u2019s nearly impossible to estimate the cost of a reversion to gut-feeling decision making, but it\u2019s likely quite significant. Another study, this time from Forrester, found that a third of Data Analysts spend over 40% of their time reviewing data field-by-field for quality issues due to a lack of trust. It\u2019s likely that these time costs are not factored into the $15M of hard costs mentioned above.", "Blast Radius (noun)\u2014 the distance from the source that will be affected when an explosion occurs.", "The difference between a bullet and a bomb is that of scope of impact. While a bullet can only realistically eliminate one target, an explosion from a single bomb can level an entire city of millions. The impact of a bomb is proportional to its blast radius. In recent years, the term Blast Radius has gained steam in the space of IT architecture, with teams working to minimize the number of additional systems that are taken offline by a failure in a single system.", "Returning to the topic of data quality, I find it hard to believe that a third of the data in an average organization is bad. A more reasonable number is probably somewhere around 10%*, although this likely varies significantly across data domains. The 22% gap between the 10% of actually bad data and the 32% of assumed bad data is what I\u2019ll define as the trust blast radius.", "Trust Blast Radius \u2014 the amount of additional trust that is destroyed by a single data quality problem", "So the TBR is a measurement of the gap between the amount of bad data in an organization and the amount of distrust in data across the organization. Once one person has experienced an event that shakes their trust, it is a simple fact that fear, uncertainty, and doubt spread quickly to others through communication.", "As we\u2019ve all learned over the past few months, a strategy that relies on containment alone is doomed to failure and will likely yield a large blast radius. Unfortunately, nearly everything that is written about data quality focuses on preventing, detecting, and quickly correcting data quality problems. If we instead accept that data quality issues will always arise, despite our best efforts to prevent them, and shift from an attitude of prevention to an attitude of prevention and blast radius minimization, we will be much more successful in driving a data-driven culture.", "Trust Blast Radius = Number of data quality problems * number of conversations about the problems without context * number of prior negative experiences with data quality", "A few years ago, I was responsible for developing a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis (FMEA for short) for a very complex system that was processing massive-scale IOT data. I found the systemic approach to be effective at improving the reliability of the system. For background, FMEA was first developed in the 1950s by the US military for use in Nuclear Weapons programs, then adopted heavily by other organizations responsible for complex systems (NASA, Aircraft & Auto manufacturing, Semiconductors, Healthcare, etc). It starts with detailing a system\u2019s components (or processes steps) and subcomponents, then lists the ways each subcomponent could fail, before examining the downstream effects of that failure and recommending a control mechanism to prevent or minimize the impact of each failure.", "Taking a simple example from the Automotive industry, one of the potential points of failure in an internal combustion engine is the timing belt, which can cause a catastrophic engine failure if broken. The timing belt itself is just a simple band of rubber with teeth that act like a gear. A replacement only costs about $50. If one of the teeth gets worn, it can fall off. This leads to a small ticking noise in the engine which may be annoying, but is certainly not catastrophic. However, it also has the secondary effect of increasing the wear on the belt at the point of the missing tooth. If the wear goes on for too long, more teeth will fail, leading to worse miscalibrated timing between the valves and pistons in the engine, misfires. After a while, the belt will snap, which causes the engine to fire the valves and pistons randomly, literally destroying itself from the inside. To avoid this problem, all vehicles should undergo scheduled maintenace around 60K miles to prevent the problem form occurring. Additionally, the check engine light goes on when sensors in the engine detect the potential signs of timing belt wear. The key is to detect and resolve the issue early to avoid the larger blast radius of a belt failure within the engine.", "While these techniques were designed for machinery where effects are somewhat deterministic, they provide a useful guide for analyzing the complex system that is an organization undergoing a transformation to become data driven.", "Starting with the primary function of the data & analytics organization: Enable the business to derive the maximum amount of value from its data assets, typically by aiding in data-driven decision making, we begin to enumerate failures.", "There are many more potential failures than we can cover in the span of one article. The key is that, in each of these scenarios, the impact at the initial fault point is not very large. However, left unchecked, they can start a cascade of issues that cause a dramatic impact. Let\u2019s take a look at each to see what can happen if left unchecked", "To stay on theme and make these easier to remember, I\u2019ll call them C4, which has the interesting property that it can be used to make shaped charges. The C4 techniques: Catch, Catalog, Correct, and Cure, similarly shape the blast of data quality issues to make it much more productive while minimizing the blast radius.", "Catch \u2014 This refers to the capture of the issue by someone with the knowledge and authority to take on the steps below. Ideally, these issues would be detected by monitoring within your data platform before any data consumer is made aware of them. However, it is impossible to catch every problem, and as the above examples showed, a few escaped problems that go undetected can lead to a dramatic expansion of the blast radius. Therefore, it is critical to give your data consumers a voice, and that they trust that why they use their voice to raise an issue, it will be addressed. This allows them to vent their frustration in a productive way, rather than starting an echo chamber with their peers who are equally powerless to make things better. To start, make sure every data consumer in the organization has access to a single place to raise data issues. Equally important, they must also know how to use this tool. Finally, they must see that their issue is being addressed, which leads to the rest of the steps.", "Catalog \u2014 Once an issue has been found, it is extremely important to let those who are going to be affected know. This is often counter-intuitive in a culture where admitting failure is feared. If the goal is to keep the default mode of thinking in data consumers to trust rather than distrust, it is best to tell people when there is something to worry about. Going back to the timing belt example, if it was unclear when timing belts failed and there was no check engine light to tell you when to worry, you would default to always worrying that your engine might fail at any point, and lose trust in the reliability of your car, and tell lots of people about it to vent your frustration.", "It is important that the documentation of data issues is made visible to people in their daily workflow. This is easiest if you provide a consistent location to find data quality notes on a given data product. For example, having your data consumers launch their BI reports through your data catalog provides you with the opportunity to surface any data quality warnings on the report page before they open the report. However, many people will likely bookmark their most important reports and launch them directly. This means that you will need to push an alert directly on to the reports (ideally in a consistent location) to get their attention and direct them back to the details in the catalog. Obviously, this technique only works if your data pipelines are mostly reliable. If the check engine light comes on every month, you also won\u2019t think your car is very reliable.", "Cataloging what should be trusted is equally as important as documenting what should not be trusted for now. This is actually one of the weak points of the check engine light. It could be that the gas cap isn\u2019t on tight, or that your engine is about to destroy itself in the next 10 minutes. Because you don\u2019t know, your reaction has to be driven from the worst-case scenario. If instead, you could pull open an app and see which engine checks were passing and which were causing warnings, then you would be able to make an informed decision as to what to do next. In the DataOps world, this involves putting listing surfacing the data tests that were run to prove out a given pipeline before it was deployed into production, as well as those that run ongoing to ensure the data meets key expectations. Using BDD style naming on your data tests and showing the test status alongside the data quality notes and warnings gives your data consumers the power to decide what to do based on a deep understanding of the current state of the data.", "Correct \u2014 Cataloging and raising the current state of data, both good and bad, helps shift the default mindset of data consumers from distrust to trust. The final piece of documentation that is needed is the documentation that actions are being taken to make things better. In this way, having a work ticket system to track the data issues works better than simply capturing the issue directly as a note in the catalog. Once you have convinced data consumers that you are transparent, they are far less likely to create a blast radius by asking all around the organization to figure out if that issue they found last week has been corrected.", "This brings us to the next stage in minimizing the trust blast radius, which is rapidly correcting issues. The key here is to go beyond simply correcting the issue to increase the trust that it has been corrected. Consider the following trust blast radius scenario: a marketing analyst finds an issue with customer addresses and asks 5 people about who to report it to, then fires off an email to the data engineer responsible for the customer address pipeline. The engineer realizes that his latest change caused a formatting issue, fixes the problem, and emails the marketing analyst that it is fixed. Now, even though the analyst believes the addresses are correct, the 4 other people she talked to don\u2019t know about the fix (or even the specifics of the issue) and are likely to trust address data less.", "If your data platform provides the capabilities covered by the first 2 Cs, and your data team practices test driven development, then these 4 people would be able to see that the new test that was added when the engineer fixed the problem is passing, and that there are no open tickets against the address data, restoring their trust without needing a direct conversation with the data engineer.", "Cure \u2014 The final step is to stop issues from coming back by curing the systemic problems that lead to the data issues in the first place. This is definitely the most complex undertaking, but it also has the highest reward.", "Perform trending and root cause analysis on tickets to uncover systemic issues", "Link issue tickets to \u201csystemic fix\u201d tickets, often the development of new data platform features, but also process improvements within your DataOps operating model that will catch issues earlier in the development lifecycle", "Examples of these types of improvements are in my other articles:", "Providing visibility into these types of improvements is not as simple as the correction of data issues or the capture of data tests, but it isn\u2019t impossible either. You can start by documenting your data processes in a way that can be linked to and from the data catalog and tickets. Using a flexible process diagramming tool that can be embedded directly into the catalog enables the process changes to be documented alongside the systemic data issues that they are meant to address. You can then run micro-learning sessions on the new way of working, record it, run it through AI transcription, and embed the recording and transcription in the catalog as well.", "You can use the same technique to capture and embed training on the proper ways to use the catalog to find the information above and put this in your catalog home page. To drive cultural change, you can show the overall trend of data issues raised directly within the data catalog that serves as the \u201cFront door to all things data\u201d. As this KPI trends downward, highlight the systemic fixes that are going into your organization\u2019s approach to data that are driving the improvement. From there you can start a data stewardship program that more directly incentivizes people to improve data documentation and quality.", "By now, nearly everyone on the planet has gotten a lesson in epidemiology. Far fewer have recognized that mistrust in the data assets that their organization is investing in spreads in a remarkably similar manner. Using that knowledge, we can apply a data strategy lens to the same techniques that are used in the medical community to determine how to respond.", "As always, I\u2019m open to discussing these thoughts with anyone else with a passion for improving organizations ability to extract value from their data.", "*I could not find a study that did rigorous reporting on the percentage of data in organizations that is actually bad. The closest thing was a Gartner study from 2007 that states that 27% of Fortune 1000 companies data is \u201cflawed\u201d, but their definition of flawed includes duplicated data. Let\u2019s assume that this trend has continued and that duplicate data is 17% of the 27%, leaving 10% truely bad data. This means that, on average, the trust gap is nearly double the amount of bad data.", "Your home for data science.
