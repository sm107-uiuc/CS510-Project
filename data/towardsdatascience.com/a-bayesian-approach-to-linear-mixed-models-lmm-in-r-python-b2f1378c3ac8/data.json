Again with some EDA we see that such a model captures group variability better and thus might be a better strategy. We can use the seaborn.lmplot or ggplot2's geom_smooth to quickly build some intuitive EDA plots. Here it seems that a varying-intercept, and a varying-intercept / varying-slope model might be good candidates to explore. (Our EDA also brings to light an example of Simpson\u2019s Paradox, where a global regression line doesn\u2019t match the individual county trends.)", "We\u2019ll proceed with three candidate models: a linear regression, a random intercept model, and a random intercept + slope model.

If you\u2019re not, stop, and go checkout the suggested readings above.", "Bayesian inference requires us to select prior distributions (\u201cpriors\u201d) for our parameters before we can fully define our model. Rather than be tempted to use uninformative priors \u2014 e.g. normal distributions with extremely large variance\u2014 to avoid prior assumptions damping down signals from the data or adding bias, you should aim to select weakly informative priors.", "But how can you define what a \u201cweak\u201d prior is?", "Good weakly informative priors take into account your data and the question being asked to generate plausible datasets.", "A common strategy to define weakly informative priors is to create a \u201cflip-book\u201d of simulated data from your likelihood and prior combination. (This procedure is referred to as a prior predictive check.) Instead of thinking of priors as standalone (marginal) entities, simulating data with them allows us to understand how they interact with the likelihood and whether this pair generates plausible data points.", "For example, let\u2019s try choosing weak priors for our random intercepts model parameters (\u03b20, \u03b21 ,b_0 ,\u03c4_0, and \u03c3\u00b2 ) and simulating some data.", "I chose the above priors via an iterative strategy that combined information from the EDA step on population and group trends with group-specific empirical mean and variance estimates (see below).

We see that most of our simulated data points are \u201creasonable,\u201d meaning we see most fake points fall within our current bounce rate range (\u2248160\u2013250). Others are outside the range of our data but still within a believable range (e.g. up to 500\u2013600 secs). If instead we had used generic weak priors [e.g. N(0, 100) and Inv-Gamma(1,100)] we\u2019d see a lot of simulated bounce rates <100 sec. or even < 0, which is obviously less probable (right).", "If you\u2019re interested in learning more about how to select priors checkout this resource page from the Stan Development Team.", "Having selected some reasonable weak priors on the previous step, we can now focus on building our candidate models from Step 1. As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, there are existing libraries in R and Python that can greatly simplify fitting Bayesian linear mixed models.", "If you\u2019re familiar with lme4 and the lmer function\u2019s formula builder you\u2019re 90% of the way there. Yes, that simple! Other than some additional options to specify Bayesian settings, brms offers straightforward functionalities. It is an outstanding library if you dive into all its capabilities \u2014 fitting GAMs, modeling Gaussian Processes, or even imputing data via mice. I won\u2019t cover these here but I encourage you to read more.", "Below is example implementing a varying-intercept model with brms using our bounce time data. First, the package makes it easy to define priors with a built-in function prior which assigns a distribution to a selected model parameter class, group, or coefficient (prior(distribution(...), class=..., group=..., coef=...)). For example, we can set a normal prior for our intercept as prior(normal(...), class=Intercept). You can use the built-in function get_prior() to understand how to set these flags. Similarly, you can choose priors from a wide array of available distributions.", "Next, you can fit the model with the brm function which offers a similar formula builder and options to those of lmer. You can further modify options specific to Bayesian methods such the number of MCMC chains to run and run length.", "Extracting basic information from the model is simple. The library provides functions to print out model summaries related to the model fit summary() and posterior estimates posterior_summary().", "NOTE: When using the bounce_time ~ 1 + std_age formulation, BRMS assumes the predictor(s) is mean-centered. If you\u2019re predictors are not mean-centered you should use bounce_time ~ 0 + intercept + std_age instead. You can read more here (pages 38\u201339)", "Although there are multiple libraries available to fit Bayesian models, PyMC3 without a doubt provides the most user-friendly syntax in Python. Although a new version is in the works (PyMC4 now running on Tensorflow), most of the functionalities in this library will continue to work in future versions.", "Compared to the brms package in R, PyMC3 requires you to explicitly state each individual component of the model \u2014 from priors to likelihood.", "Complete specification isn\u2019t as bad as it sounds. Once you specify the model (shown left) it can be straightforward to build using a context manager.", "Well, most of the time \ud83d\ude09.", "The only caveat to this package is that your model\u2019s parameterization can have a big impact on its sampling efficiency.", "For example, the model code below uses a slightly different parameterization to the model shown above (i.e. a centered parameterization).", "First, we initialize the model with a context manager and the pm.Model() method. This will basically encapsulate the variables and likelihood factors of a model. Next, we can start assigning distributions to each of our components (priors, hyperpriors, and likelihood) using a wide variety of built-in distributions.", "Setting up model distributions is simple. First define the distribution class you want to use viapm.your_distribution_class(), then assign it a label and modify its distributional parameters, and finally assign it to a context variable (e.g. beta1=pm.Normal('std_age', mu=mu0, sigma=tau0) defines beta1 as a normal with label std_age and parameters mu0 and tau0).", "Once your model components are set, you just need to setup the pm.trace() function which will store your posterior samples. Similar to brms, you can also further modify options specific to Bayesian methods such the number of MCMC chains to run and run length.", "Since PyMC3 relies on arviz for post-hoc visualizations, it is worthwhile to save the model output as a InferenceData type for later use in model diagnostics and posterior checks.", "Phew! That was a lot information. However, no modeling endeavor is complete without some good ol\u2019 diagnostics. (NOTE: Model checking, evaluation and comparison are also part of this process but I cover them in more detail in a separate article.)", "Traditionally, two diagnostic visualizations \u2014 MCMC trace plots and autocorrelation function (ACF) diagrams \u2014 help us understand whether there were problems with sampling. In other words, how reliable are our samples and thus our inference? These tools appeal to some theoretical properties of Markov Chains and are good sanity checks to understand the chains\u2019 performance. Yet, brms and pymc3 use advanced MCMC methods where additional diagnostics are available that provide more granular picture of their performance.", "Aside from conventional diagnostics, additional methods are available for advanced techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and can provide a more detailed picture of the Markov chain performance.", "Let\u2019s dive into an example implementing conventional and HMC-related diagnostics.", "The two common visualizations highlighted above help us understand whether", "In R you can easily generate these using the mcmc_trace and mcmc_acffunctions in bayesplot using the your fitted model.", "In Python pymc3 has a built-in integration to visualize these via arviz , you just need the trace object specified in the model.", "As mentioned, Hamiltonian Monte Carlo offers additional diagnostics we can use. Both pymc3 and brms run on a very efficient HMC sampler called No-U-Turn Sampling (NUTS).", "Here\u2019s a crude one sentence, high-level summary:", "HMC uses first-order gradients to direct sampling in useful directions which helps it converge faster to the posterior than traditional MCMC methods and NUTS dynamically updates parameters that can affect HMC\u2019s performance (i.e. step size \u03b5 and number of steps L).", "Nuts, right?! (I hope you can forgive the bad pun). Just to clarify that last point, think about what\u2019s happening in terms of gradient-like updates where, for example, if you choose a step size too small or the number of steps too high you might waste compute time. Although this is a useful analogy, the specifics on how this algorithm works are more complex and elegant.", "Back to \u201cSo what, dude?\u201d Well, in cases where the chains aren\u2019t mixing or the ACF is showing higher dependence of samples it can be hard to diagnose what\u2019s happening.", "However, if you\u2019re using HMC or NUTS, you can look at divergent transitions which can help you understand the geometry of your posterior (!!). These arise when the proposed next step(s) deviate from the most efficient path set by the sampler.", "Divergence is powerful diagnostic that allows you to understand the posterior geometry.", "Visualizing these can help in two ways:", "Below is an example of how divergence could help identify places where the chains get \u201cstuck\u201d or are incorrectly flagged as divergent (green). In both the left and right diagrams, regions where green points or lines are highly concentrated indicate convergence problems (i.e. you can see this funnel-like concentration for tau below). Here the sampler wasn\u2019t able to adequately explore the posterior region defined by tau and thus our inferences on tau are unreliable. Conversely, we can also gain confidence other parameter inferences (e.g. theta1,...,theta8 ) where trajectories were incorrectly flagged as divergent but behaved like non-divergent ones.", "To learn more about interpreting these powerful diagnostic plots, check out this write-up from Michael Betancourt. To run this diagnostic in R use the mcmc_scatter function from bayesplot.", "In Python you can use the plot_parallel PyMC3 built-in function.", "In this case, we can see there aren\u2019t any divergent trajectories like we saw above and thus our chains have explored the posterior geometry without trouble (i.e. converged).", "Fitting Bayesian models has been greatly simplified by packages such as pymc3 and brms. However, being simpler to implement doesn\u2019t mean we should forget about key steps in our modeling process that can help use build better models.", "I hope you\u2019ve learned some new approaches for selecting good prior distributions and how to troubleshoot Bayesian mixed models, and why EDA can be a powerful tool (not just in a Bayesian setting).", "Finally, my hope is to keep people from shying away from Bayesian approaches just because \u201cthey sound hard,\u201d and instead provide them with new methods they can add to their toolset.", "If you liked the article feel free to share!
