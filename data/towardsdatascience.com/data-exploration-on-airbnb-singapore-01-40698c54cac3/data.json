My name is Agra, I am an architect who is interested in the integration of architecture, urban design, real estate, and technology knowledge. This article is a write-up of my personal data science project while I am learning data science using python programming language for a few weeks.", "Nowadays, we live in an era where data are produced and circulated in an enormous amount. Those data can be collected and allow us to infer meaningful results and make well-informed decisions. However, as the number of data increases, we need to visualize the data to help us in conducting data analysis. By using visualization tools, we able to deliver a message to our audience and inform them about our findings.", "The purpose of this article is to explore a publicly open dataset from a technology company, map the result clearly through visualization tools, and give new insight to the public and other relevant parties. To make the topics on each article more focused, this article will be divided into a series of several articles.", "For the first article, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Airbnb in Singapore using basic exploratory data analysis techniques. We will be finding out the distribution of every Airbnb listing based on their location, including their price range, room type, listing name, and other related factors.", "I\u2019m referring to Terence S, a data scientist, on his explanation of exploratory data analysis. To simplify, exploratory data analysis(EDA), also known as Data Exploration is a step in the Data Analysis process, where several techniques are used to better understand the dataset being used.", "By conducting EDA, we can turn an almost useable or unusable dataset into a useable dataset.", "Main components of Exploratory Data Analysis:", "Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present a more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. Today, Airbnb became one of a kind service that is used and recognized by the whole world. Data analysis on millions of listings provided through Airbnb is a crucial factor for the company. These millions of listings generate a lot of data \u2014 data that can be analyzed.", "Airbnb has a long and fairly complex relationship in Singapore. Since five years ago, the Singapore government labeled the short-term rental offered by Airbnb as an illegal service. Although labeled as such, so far only 2 cases found where the hosts fined for violating the rental laws.", "Moreover, before the pandemic situation hit the global tourism industry. The Airbnb grow rapidly in Singapore and generated a highly comprehensive data within Southeast Asia.", "For this project, we are using jupyter notebook IDE with a python programming language to write our script. IDE or Integrated Development Environment is a software application used for software development.", "To get the data, we are using Airbnb data that publicly shared on the internet under the Creative Commons License. Before we are able to load the data into our IDE, first we need to import various external libraries/modules that needed for visualization and analysis.", "To load the dataset, we use pandas library and function to read the CSV file of Singapore Airbnb 2019\u20132020 dataset from http://insideairbnb.com/, convert it to the DataFrame and check the top 5 index data.", "After we load the dataset, we need to understand the dataset by using various techniques. First, we need to look for information on how big is our dataset. By using shape attributes, we get to know our data size from a number of rows which consist of listing index, and the number of columns with the content of every features related to the index.", "Then we check all the data type of every column if it already matches our requirement. For instance, we need a numerical data type (integer and float) on the longitude and latitude, for listing names we need to make sure the data is using string/object data type.", "We found out that our dataset has 7395 listings. The features include listing name, host id, location information, location coordinate, room type, the price per night, and so on.", "Next, we look up all the unique values of the \u2018neighbourhood_group\u2019 that is consists of a list of all the Singapore region", "From the list above, we see that Singapore has 5 region area.", "The region area is divided further by the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) into 55 areas called planning areas for urban planning purposes. We will use the \u2018neighbourhood\u2019 columns to look at which planning area that has the Airbnb listing.", "Now, we know that 43 planning areas have the Airbnb listing.", "We also look up the \u2018room_type\u2019 columns for each room type of the listing", "From the list above, we see that Airbnb have 4 room type. Based on the information on the Airbnb website, the definition of each room type are:", "Guests have exclusive access to the bedroom/sleeping area of the listing. Other parts area such as the living room, kitchen, and bathroom are likely open either to the host even to other guests.", "Guests have the whole place for themselves. It usually includes a bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen.", "Guest sleep in a bedroom or a common area that could be shared with others.", "A typical hotel room with its facilities. Since 2018, Airbnb allows some boutique hotels and high rated independent hotel to list their rooms on their site.", "The next step is cleaning up the data, oftentimes the data we load have various faults, such as typo, missing value, incomplete data, etc. By doing cleaning up, the data quality will have better quality to be used for further analysis.", "a. Checking column with missing values", "Let\u2019s check first if there are any missing values within our dataset", "In our case, the missing values that are observed do not need too much treatment. Looking into our dataset, we can state columns \u2018 name\u2019 and \u2018host_name\u2019, \u2018last_review\u2019 are irrelevant and unethical for further data exploration analysis. Therefore, we can get rid of those columns.", "c. Replacing all the missing values", "Next, we need to replace all the missing values in the \u2018review_per_month\u2019 column with 0 (zero) to make sure the missing values do not interfere with our analysis", "After we clean up the data, the next step is exploring the data by visualizing and analyzing the values of the features, explaining the process and the results.", "For our case, we will look up a various listing category consisting of each biggest value, visualize the listing distribution using a map, create a room type proportion for each area, looking for selling value from their listing name, and finding the average price of the most popular listing.", "First, we skip the first column of \u2018name\u2019 and begin from the \u2018host_id\u2019 column. Then we slice the top 10 hosts in terms of listing count", "Next, we set the figure size and setting it up for data visualizations plot using a bar chart", "From the chart above, we can see the total of top 10 hosts is almost 20%( 1416 listings) of the whole dataset (7395 listings). Even one of the hosts has more than 350 listings!", "Next, we visualize the proportion of the listing count on each region area using the \u2018neighbourhood_group\u2019 columns", "From the chart above, we see the Central Region has the most listings with almost 6000 listings number, covering more than 80% of the total listings.", "Next, we look up the top 10 planning areas that have the highest number of listings", "As we can see, Kallang has the highest number of listings. We also found that 9 out of the top 10 planning areas are located in the Central Region, with Bedok located in East Region as an exception.", "To create a map of the listing location, we will use the \u2018longitude\u2019 and \u2018latitude\u2019 column. But first, we need to check the values within the column", "From the data above, we can see the outer values of longitude and latitude from the min and max index.", "Next, we visualize the scatter plot map of every listing and group it by color on each different region", "Now we can see how the listings are plotted into a map. For a better understanding of the listings density, we can use the folium heat map", "From the map above, we can see clearly where the densest listing is located, shown by the red color in the southern area of the Central Region. The listing density increasingly declining the more it\u2019s farther away from the Central Region.", "Before we visualize the price map, we need to update the dataset by removing some of the outlier data as some data prices have value far from the IQR (interquartile range).", "Next, we visualize the scatter plot map of every listing and the difference in price range using longitude and latitude points with a price heat map.", "From the map above, we observe the price relatively going up towards the center part of the Central Region as this region is the CCR Area in Singapore.", "From the real estate point of view, URA divided Singapore into three main regions, which they call \u2018market segments\u2019. The Core Central Region(CCR), indicated by the yellow color is the prime area of Central Region where most high-end and luxury properties can be found. The red color of the Rest of Central Region(RCR) is regarded as the mid-tier market between the mass market condos in the Outside Central Region(OCR) and the high-value properties in the CCR. The last one is the OCR, indicated by the grey color that covers three-quarters of the size of Singapore and basically the area where mass-market condos at the lower range are located.", "By looking at two maps above, we could argue that the Airbnb listing price is related to the real estate market segments. But to conclude that, we need more data to do further analysis.", "Based on our price heat map observation, we need to visualize the price distribution using a box plot to understand more on the listing price range grouped by the \u2018neighbourhood_group\u2019 /region area.", "From the data above, we see the Central Region has the most expensive price per night with a median S$ 130.", "Next, we will explore deeper on the property detail by finding out what the most used word in the listing name. The most used word could represent the selling value of their property for the prospective guests. First, we will create a function to collect the words.", "We need to import counter library to count and generate raw data which contains the top 25 words used by the host", "Then, we convert the data into DataFrame and visualize our findings", "From the chart above, we see the top 25 words used in the listing name. We can use the word cloud visualization method to help us better understand the chart.", "As we can see, most of the listing selling values are related to the proximity or connection to public facilities such as MRT and center of activities, shown by \u2018mrt\u2019, \u2018near\u2019, \u2018to\u2019, \u2018city\u2019 , \u2018walk to\u2019 keyword. Interesting to see how the room condition falls behind those values, shown by the \u2018spacious\u2019, \u2018cosy\u2019, \u2019cozy\u2019 on the lower rank of the chart.", "Next, we will visualize all listing\u2019s room type proportions from each region area using Plotly API library for graph visualization", "We can see the Central Region is the only region that dominated by the entire home/apt type, with the rest of the region is dominated by private room type. Overall, the hotel type is the least listing on each region, since Airbnb has only been accepting hotel listing on 2018.", "i. Top 10 most reviewed listings", "We will find out the top 10 listings based on their number of reviews to know the most popular Airbnb listings in Singapore.", "Voila! Those are the 10 most popular listings. Again, we found out the majority of the most reviewed listing is located in the Central Region, with 7 out of 10 listings.", "Lastly, we will calculate the average price per night of the 10 most popular listings", "From this output, we can observe that the top 10 most popular listings on Airbnb Singapore have a price average of S$ 99.9 with most of the listings under S$ 90, and 6/10 of them are \u2018Private Room\u2019 type, top reviewed listings have a total 3111 reviews.", "Simply by performing EDA on the dataset, we\u2019ve identified various new insight on how the Airbnb listings distributed on Singapore, we know where are the listings located, found out the Central Region is dominating the listing number and have the highest price range, how the listing price might be related to the surrounding property price and found out the connectivity of the listing to its surrounding becomes one of the common selling value.", "In the next article, we will explore the dataset using the more detailed version. We will be focusing on the Central Region to understand more on the deeper context, on how the relationship between each listing in the region and their relation with external variables such as the connectivity to the public facility and the impact of property prices on the listing rental prices.", "Thank you for reading!
