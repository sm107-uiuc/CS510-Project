It is simple but very powerful algorithm which works well with large datasets and sparse matrices, like pre-processed text data which creates thousands of vectors depending on the number of words in a dictionary. It works really well with text data projects like sentiment data analysis, performs good with document categorization projects, and also it is great in predicting categorical data in projects such as email spam classification.", "It is used to solve many different problem statements, and it is quite fast in training a model since Naive Bayes classifier completely works on probability, so the conversion happens quickly.", "Bayes\u2019 theorem describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.", "First, let\u2019s take a formula of conditional probability, and try to derive Bayes Theorem:", "where probability of B given A, meaning what is the probability of event B when event A is already taken place, equals probability of A intersection B (meaning the probability of both A and B events taken place) divided by probability of B.", "where probability of A given B, meaning what is the probability of event A when event B is already taken place, equals probability of B intersection A (meaning the probability of both B and A events taken place) divided by probability of A.", "Let\u2019s take a closer look, we see that P(A\u2229B) and P(B\u2229A) are basically the same, so we can write them as P(A\u2229B) = P(B\u2229A).

The class with the highest posterior probability is the outcome of prediction.", "For my example I used two datasets:", "Since both datasets have continuous attributes, I chose a Gaussian distribution to estimate the parameters for the likelihood probabilities in Naive Bayes classifiers.
