I clearly remember how excited I was to spend the rest of the day with my family. My parents had traveled to Bangalore for the first time and I already had plans of showing them the city. I had completed my work for the day and given Friday evening\u2019s are usually less hectic in any organization. I was about to leave when I suddenly received an email from my stakeholder asking me for a very old report that we stopped delivering a year back. I was disappointed but I knew that standard codes usually don\u2019t take much effort to run. Alas! My hypothesis was wrong. Karma did bite me and I ended up spending the entire evening\u2026\u2026\u201d", "You must be wondering how this story relates to any kind of coding skills required for a data science job or a few of you might have guessed the correlation between my story and the rest of the article already. Let me start by making a statement \u201cOrganizations today are using data science as one of the key levers at every stage of the decision cycle to drive key business strategies\u201d. But what constitutes a Data Science problem? How does a Data Analyst, a Business Analyst or a Data Scientist work in any Organization?", "Any data Science problem is broken down into two parts, a set of \u201cactivities\u201d and a handful of \u201cbest practice processes\u201d. Data gathering, data cleaning, data wrangling, hypothesis testing, model development, validation and many more come under \u201cactivities\u201d. Most of us working with Analytics Organizations or aspire to become a data scientist are much familiar with such terminologies but when it comes to \u201cbest practice processes\u201d, a little is known and followed.", "From my 4 years of experience working in this industry, I can tell you that as a part of \u201cbest practice processes\u201d a lot of emphases is given to project management, repository building, documentation, communication and code maintenance. As a data scientist, you are expected to ensure that you adhere to the \u201c3 C\u2019s, Consistency, Communication, and Consumption\u201d. Your work should be consistent, you should communicate every business intricacies to your stakeholders and most importantly your work should be consumed.", "Coding in the data science industry is very different from software development. Your coding skills are not simply restricted to your technical know-how but require a good amount of data and business understanding. Today I am going to talk about \u201cConsistency\u201d and how to bring that in your coding practices. A lot of these best practices are based on my 3 years experience of working with Mu Sigma Business Solutions and the challenges I faced till date. The following 5 sniffs will give you a brief understanding of how \u201cMath + Business + Data + Technology = Data Science\u201d.", "\u201cOrganizations today are looking for Data Scientists who can create solutions scalable across multiple teams. Think of it like a product, which can be easily used by anyone and everyone. This not only saves the $ value they had to invest on a similar problem for a different business unit but it reduces the time and effort of an existing resource who is going to work on it for days to come\u201d", "A well-formatted and commented code is a code master\u2019s heaven. It helps you debug your code easily and ensure smoother quality checks. Any data science team follows the concept of Peer Quality Checks (QC) to ensure error-free output. It is considered as a best practice to get your code reviewed by your peer before you deliver the final output to your stakeholder. A readable code includes:", "Many times you will end up working on datasets with similar schema but uses different filters for different attributes (columns) depending on the business problem at stake. It might also be the other way round where you end up using the same table to summarize different scenarios for the same business problem.", "E.g. Say you have a Customer dataset that contains customer id, transaction id, purchase date, product type, and sales figures. You are asked to find out top customers contributing to 80% of your sales for each product type. In a normal scenario, you would create one set of code that does this for a specific product type, copy-paste the same and reuse subsequently with a different filter for the product type. A good coder would create a user-defined module which takes the product type and sales threshold as an input and generates the desired output. Reusable modules can be created across all platforms which save unnecessary lines and ensures easy QC.", "In any organization delivering correct figures are the key to a project\u2019s success. A lot of business decisions are taken based on the numbers we report and even a small inaccuracy might have a bigger impact on the organization\u2019s decision.", "Let\u2019s take the above example of the Customer dataset. You are asked to identify the top 100 Loyal Customers based on their transaction volume. Using your recommendation, the organization will provide such users with a 30% discount coupon for their upcoming Summer Sales.", "The whole idea of this analysis is to identify loyal customers and influence them to purchase more. The organization is taking a hit on its sales to ensure a higher volume of transactions. Now a lot of us are unaware of the fact that datasets used by most organizations don\u2019t come in the cleanest form and need to be manipulated before they can be consumed. E.g. a customer while paying his bills might experience a failed transaction which is recorded by the system. However, while calculating the transaction volume such transaction id\u2019s should be eliminated else we will end up with an incorrect estimation of every customer\u2019s transaction volume. The challenge is to identify such anomaly. Here are some of the checks you must do and capture while coding:", "Input resilience implies that code should be able to produce an output irrespective of the input type. The hardest part of any coding exercise is inducing input resilience which results in the re-usability of codes. An analyst might receive similar data requests from different stakeholders. Hence an ideal scenario would be to write codes that can work on different business requirements.", "E.g. the Sales Head of both Electronics and Cosmetics division wants to understand their respective product sales for different customer id. Since the Analyst has worked on laptops and tablets before, he/she is aware that all product names linked to electronic items are captured in lower case. However, to check cosmetic products, he/she might have to first filter out all products and see how transactions related to cosmetics are captured in the Customer Data. Instead, a simple use of UPPER() in the product columns can prevent unnecessary checks. In a real-world scenario, it is difficult to make every code input resilient but one needs to think of all possible exceptions that can be handled.", "Input resilience and exception handling might sound similar but works differently. Let me ask you a simple question? How many records do you think a Customer Data of any organization has? 20,252 records as shown in the example above? You got to be kidding me! Any Customer Data which has transaction information for different products will have millions of records. Querying such datasets in SQL, R, Python or even Alteryx takes hours to run. Now imagine a scenario where you need to query such tables for different products, how do you induce exception handling?", "\u201cMy phone started vibrating suddenly. I didn\u2019t realize it was 8 pm already. I had spent the last 5 hours figuring out some mismatch in numbers. Having worked on this a year back, I hardly recollect the business rules that were used back then. I wish I had documented it somewhere. A lack of process flow and QC figures for every step made it more difficult to catch the issue. Now I realize the importance of good coding practice and I hope this article will help you organize your coding thought process in days to come\u201d", "Your home for data science.
