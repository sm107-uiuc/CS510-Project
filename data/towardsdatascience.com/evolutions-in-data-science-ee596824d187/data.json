Back then, Obtain, Scrub, Explore, Model, and iNterpret was the name of the game. Yet, this is not the first view of data science as a process. Let's explore how the fundamentals have changed over time.", "I recently read an amazing textbook from Michael Sullivan that discusses the statistics process. In it, he proposes a six-step procedure. But how is this model different from the 2010 one? I\u2019ll explain with a Covid-19 example:", "Notice that Sullivan doesn\u2019t mention any software or APIs to serve results. The focus was on the value of the analysis.", "We can go back in time some more. I recently learned in an amazing talk by Ron Kohavi that the first controlled experiment dates back to the Old Testament. This means we have been doing data science for a while! However, new challenges have arisen in the past 2,000 years. Nowadays, data is the product and the value lies in the continuous inference of it.", "We\u2019re going to need a few more steps to bake the cake. Let\u2019s talk about those new steps and how teams are thinking about it.", "First of, let\u2019s discuss two data science process frameworks that are becoming increasingly popular in the data science community. Then we will talk about the steps that still need more development. Personally, I see two new areas that require further exploring: machine learning engineering and machine learning project planning.", "The most useful view of data science as a process I\u2019m seeing these days is proposed by the full stack deep learning course.", "The course has added several steps to what we had before with Michael Sullivan\u2019s statistics process. The main steps that Sullivan ignored are inside the planning & project setup and the deployment & testing rectangles.", "The planning & project setup steps belong to the intersection between project management (PM) and data science. These are the best resources about the challenges of PM and data science I have found: How to set up your project, how to define success and value assessment . However, in which discipline do we put deployment & testing?", "That is where machine learning engineering comes in.", "The term Machine Learning Engineering is gaining a lot of traction. I\u2019m not sure about its origin but in NIPS 2016 Martin Zinkevich gave a talk about reliable machine learning. He published a list of rules for machine learning engineering. Interestingly, they mention that \u201cReliability Engineering of ML Systems\u201d should be a new discipline. I would say Zinkevich\u2019s talk is the origin of the ML Engineering term but if I\u2019m wrong, do let me know in the comments. Another extremely influential paper on the topic is the hidden technical debt of data science.", "Machine learning engineering is about deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure, the last rectangle on the full stack framework. If you want to go into detail about the framework you can follow the full stack deep learning course. They discuss testing and labelling as well.", "So, we have learned that planning and deployment are key parts to any data science project. Now let\u2019s dive into a second data science process framework. The continuous delivery for machine learning framework(CD4ML) by Danilo Sato.", "The industry has realised that having a machine learning model in production is very different from having an if-else heuristic. We need specific types of testing, specific types of monitoring, and even deployment strategies. A lot of people and industries are chipping in the conversation. The CD4ML focuses on the data, model and code components of a data science project. A traditional software development project doesn\u2019t rely on data as much as a ML project. The model object is also a new piece that enters the puzzle. For more information on CD4ML please check Danilo Sato\u2019s post.", "The engineering push is accelerating with products like Mlflow, Metaflow, and Flyte. The goal of those platforms is to make deployment and testing easy. However, there are NOT a lot of resources on the planning & project setup side. We can get the engineering right but I argue that we need to invest more time on defining project goals.", "All these are questions we should start asking ourselves. Finance can also help with the conversation. After all, we just need to estimate future rewards and calculate the net present value of them.", "I have seen a few examples of how to do this. Assessing economic value is hard. It is the reason why we have financial markets and disciplines that are just dedicated to assessing value. Here is a good ML example that explains what I\u2019m saying:", "You need about $1.4 million in annual savings from your anti-fraud solution to survive on the market. Let\u2019s assume that your average revenue with 4,000 purchase orders per month \u2014 given the average order value $83 \u2014 is $332,000.", "So, you need a solution to detect 95 suspicious transactions out of 100 (accuracy). The tool that can reach this threshold gets a green light. [Source]", "Fraud is an area where assessing value is particularly easy to do. However, I would consider this an incomplete analysis. We need to assess the risk of the project and bring future payments into account.", "Besides that, what about the feedback loops of having that tool in production? Will accuracy decrease over time? How does that impact its value? Are there any ethical concerns or unintended consequences?", "In a classification type project(fraud/no fraud), assessing value can be straightforward. But what about regression, forecasting, and clustering? How about vision processing, natural language, and optimisation? How can we assess the present value of a project like Apple\u2019s Siri? A good resource is managing machine learning projects by Veronika Megler.", "Think about how and why Google decides to hire the best software engineers on the planet to work on Tensorflow vs Google Ads. How is the budget decided between both projects? My suspicion is that they are investing more in Tensorflow because they are expecting higher returns on investment on AI, more that any other company on the planet. Two resources I\u2019m exploring on this topic are: How to measure anything and Infonomics .", "In summary, the data science process is evolving and improving every week. The investment of big players like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Baidu, and Salesforce is accelerating the evolution. Further analysis is needed on the machine learning engineering side but probably more urgently on the machine learning planning side. After all, planning is truly AI-complete :)", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Making data useful since 1995.
