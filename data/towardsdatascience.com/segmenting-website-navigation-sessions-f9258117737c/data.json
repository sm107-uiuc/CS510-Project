It can also give you a sense of how people use your website, what types of content are often seen together, etc.", "You could also try the same approach to segment users instead of sessions, and target those segments differently in marketing campaigns, or cross this data with your existing transactional segments, to understand how each of those uses your website.", "Clustering means grouping objects by their similarities. There are many ways of doing it, also because there are many different definitions of what a cluster is. The common denominator is that a cluster is a group of data objects.", "Hard clustering methods classify each object as belonging to only one cluster; whereas soft clustering gives these objects a degree to which each object belongs to a cluster (using, for instance, the likelihood).", "Topic modelling, on the other hand, is used to infer topics from texts, based on words that appear together often. One algorithm that can be used for this is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). In the LDA, we give it a set of documents, we set the number of topics we think there are, and it returns us a list of topics, each one described by a list of the words that best identify them.", "Ok, so how can we use LDA to segment website sessions? It\u2019s actually quite straightforward: we treat each session as a document, where each page is a word (you can use URLs or page names, whatever helps you identify uniquely each page). If it helps, think of sessions as a text being written by a user, where he\u2019s trying to tell you what he wants from your website, using pages instead of words.", "It is not always evident what is the right number of topics, and just purely optimizing won\u2019t necessarily yield the best results. Try a few times with different numbers, look at the results, and see if they make sense.", "The LDA is a soft clustering algorithm, meaning that, in the end, it will not tell you which session belongs to which group. Instead, it will give you a vector with the probabilities of each session belonging to each of the groups. Then, you can attribute it to the group with the highest probability (if you want to have a hard clustering method in the end).", "We then extract our sessions from our original DataFrame and fit a CountVectorizer to it. CountVectorizer will transform text into a dense vector.", "Warning: pages must be separated by a space, and their names/URLs should not contain punctuation such as dots and commas. Replace all those by an underscore \u201c_\u201d.", "In the next step, we perform a GridSearch: we run through all possible combinations of parameters for the LDA function, to find which one will yield the best groups, and then apply this combination to our data. Warning: this step might take a while\u2026", "Finally, we print all topics, together with the list of words that best describe it and their importance.", "Once you are satisfied with your results, you can hard cluster your results in the end if needed:", "Once this work is adapted to your existing data and infrastructure, you can use it as it is in a few different ways, or try to expand this work. One possible way of doing it, is using the probability vector, instead of hard-coding the clusters, to measure distances between sessions or users. This could open doors to content recommendation (ex: once you have calculated distances between users, by calculating distances between the probability vectors, you could recommend content to new users based on other users whose vectors are close to theirs). Another possible extension to the method presented here is to take into account the order in which pages are visited (it can be quite relevant, depending on the context).", "This approach shows the importance of thinking outside the box sometimes, and applying algorithms to problems which are not necessarily their intended application, but that have an equivalent framework. In this specific case, it helped thinking of users as a authors, writing their thoughts using page names instead of words.", "I hope you have enjoyed this article, and please let me know if you have applied it or improved it somehow.", "Your home for data science.
