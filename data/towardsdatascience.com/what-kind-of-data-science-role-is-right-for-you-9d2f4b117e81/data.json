And more."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [{"url": "https://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century", "anchor_text": "pop culture", "paragraph_index": 0}], "all_paragraphs": ["The \u201cdata scientist\u201d has cemented its legacy in pop culture as the vague buzzword describing anyone who can access and make any sense of the data that power so many of our experiences today. Data scientists of all types are in, seemingly, hot demand. A search on LinkedIn for \u201cData Scientist\u201d job postings will return 28 thousand postings for the United States alone. But searches for \u201cData Analyst\u201d, \u201cMachine Learning Engineer\u201d, even \u201cData Engineer\u201d and \u201cData Visualization\u201d will return tens of thousands of postings each.", "How can you make sense of the differences between these positions, especially as you\u2019re entering the data science job market for the first time?", "In my three years at Spotify I had a change in title, from \u201cData Analyst\u201d to \u201cData Scientist\u201d, without my role changing. And from there, a change in my role, from product to finance, without my title changing. New hybrid positions have also been created spanning data science, data engineering, data visualization.", "Each of these roles has its own set of stakeholders and requirements of subject-matter expertise. In this post I\u2019m offering my thoughts and experience on some of the main types of data science jobs that I have come across in the market so you can identify positions best suited to you and interview prep accordingly.", "This is a common role in many companies (in technology and other fields) that usually focuses on a specific part of the business or the product. You will be working in close proximity with other disciplines such as product managers, designers and user researchers and you will be expected to inform their decisions with data and analysis. Those decisions can be about launching a specific feature or about high level strategy. In your daily work you will be defining key metrics, as well as sourcing the data, engineering and visualizations to track those metrics. Depending on the team and product, you might be also designing and evaluating AB tests and doing statistical modeling.", "Most of your stakeholders will be non-technical. It will be your responsibility to promote data literacy and emphasize the importance of your findings. The quality of the analysis is always paramount but you will be evaluated mostly on the impact you\u2019re driving. This means that you always have to ask \u201cSo what?\u201d to every insight your analysis reveals and, above all, make sure to communicate clearly what your analysis means to the end user and what are your recommended actions.", "This role can have a lot of freedom in the ways that you drive impact. Any trend or insight you identify and convince decision makers to take action upon, is a win. The potential downside of this freedom is that many times you will not have a single clearly defined question to pursue and that can cause lack of focus or frustration because you\u2019re not sure what to work on. Developing a sense of priorities and ability to identify high impact projects will be key skills.", "The word \u201cAnalyst\u201d tends to have a more junior connotation and hence many companies (especially in the technology sector) instead use \u201cData Scientist\u201d. My advise would be to not pay much attention on the word used and instead focus on the job description, team, company and, of course, the potential salary.", "Important Skills: Product sense, cross-discipline collaboration, AB testing, metric definition, data visualization, stakeholder communication.", "If you\u2019re a data scientist that is more interested in the analysis and modeling rather than the impact on the product, then the next two roles might be more appropriate for you.", "(Thanks to Romain Takeo for feedback with this role).", "This role is similar to the product data analyst role, it\u2019s focused on serving the analytic and reporting needs of a stakeholder, such as marketing or market strategy instead of a product team. In this role you will be working closely with key decision makers in your company and you will be creating the tools to visualize and report the health of important metrics. You might be tasked with setting some goals and do some light forecasting as a benchmark for the health metrics you\u2019re tracking, and then give regular updates on the performance of those metrics.", "You will be also the point person for various ad-hoc requests that your stakeholders might have, and you will have to learn to translate vague questions into specific data analysis. You will also have to learn to prioritize the requests coming your way, or create self-serving tools for your stakeholders to open up time for you and your analysis.", "Your key performance indicator in this role will be the decision making you\u2019re driving. As you get more senior, you will be expected to not only reactively answer the questions your stakeholder give you but proactively come up with your own directions.", "Important Skills: stakeholder communication, data visualization, setting and tracking metrics, spherical view of the product, data storytelling.", "This is a role that can be found often in financial teams, such as forecasting, and involves usually a clearly defined set of questions (and metrics) centered around predictions and causal inference. The role involves the development of mathematical models in order to evaluate or predict measurements such as retention or lifetime value of a customer.", "This role is frequently within a team of other data scientists and is evaluated on the volume and quality of analysis and model improvements rather than \u201cimpact\u201d on a product. The role can resemble an academic setting, frequently reading about advancements in various modeling and machine learning techniques and finding ways to apply them to your company\u2019s setting.", "The role doesn\u2019t normally involve a lot of backend or data engineering and hence it\u2019s mostly focused on \u201coffline\u201d analysis, i.e., analysis with static historical data instead of real-time analysis.", "Important Skills: Mathematical modeling, statistics, time series manipulation", "This is a highly desired role and can be behind some of the most user facing applications the internet has to offer today, such as recommendations systems or Spotify\u2019s Discover Weekly playlist. In this role you will sit between the data science and engineering realms: you need to have a great understanding of statistical and machine learning models and also be able to implement a scalable backend solution to ship your model into production.", "This role is much more technical compared to the product data analyst and can be more technical even from the modeling analyst. Similar to the modeling analyst, this role is usually situated within a team of other technical roles such other MLEs and data scientists. The main performance indicator will be the quality of your backend work and the ML models you ship.", "Important Skills: Machine learning models, statistics, back end engineering", "The above three job categories likely cover the majority of \u201ctraditional\u201d data science jobs, but I think there is a new category of a hybrid data scientist positions that are being created in response to the demand for data scientists that have data engineering and data visualization skills.", "Data is the fuel of all data analysis and data science. But the raw state of data is huge tables of logs in a myriad of formats and datasets. In order for any meaningful analysis to be done, one must load, combine, clean and reformat a lot of datasources into one or few tables that can then be queried for analysis or model training. Frequently, this process needs to be scheduled so it can be repeated in regular intervals (e.g., hourly or daily) so that the analysis tables reflect the latest data. Roughly speaking, this process is called \u201cdata pipeling\u201d and data engineers usually own these types of projects. Most companies (that have the headcount) have teams of professional data engineers that are tasked with creating and maintaining very high quality business critical datasets that the data scientists can query for their analysis. But for many analyses, the data scientist will have to create their own ad-hoc data pipelines. These pipelines and tables can start becoming cumbersome to maintain, especially if dashboards or self-serving tools have been built on top of them. That\u2019s where this hybrid role enters the picture. A team consisting of such hybrid data engineers/data scientists will be tasked with near-full-time creation and maintenance of analysis and dashboard friendly tables and hence provide data pipelining as a service to enable other data scientists and stakeholders in the company.", "Even if you don\u2019t aspire to this hybrid role, you should be advised that some fundamental data engineering skills are quickly becoming a great tool in your data science arsenal, and might be a skill that will give you an advantage in your job search.", "Along the same line as the data engineer/data scientist hybrid role mentioned above, this hybrid role is one that is primarily focused on data-visualization-as-a-service to data scientists and other stakeholders.", "Data visualization is one of the most important aspects of the work of many data scientists, helping elevate the analysis and maximize its impact. Carefully designed dashboards can empower your stakeholders to do their own exploration and free up precious data science time for other analysis.", "Careful and impactful dashboard design is time consuming and requires special skills, that\u2019s why this role was created. In this role, you will be working closely with product data analysts and data engineers on your team to understand the needs of your stakeholders and create the dashboards to fulfill them. These dashboards can be tracking key performance indicators of the team, business, product and more.", "This role falls under the data science umbrella because it requires a solid understanding of metrics and analytics. Your stakeholders will both be other data scientists on your team as well as non-technical product managers and executives that will be consuming your reports and dashboards to inform decisions.", "If you are a data viz expert with some data engineering skills as well, then can position yourself as a well rounded candidate for this type of positions.", "Important Skills: data visualization, tableau (or equivalent), story telling.", "Spotify is an example of a success story for these hybrid roles. A core team was created and tasked with defining, tracking, maintaining and visualizing the organization\u2019s key metrics. They were also tasked with creating high quality tables to serve as the source of truth for various fundamental data captured, and hence enabling data scientist to be more confident on their analysis, machine learning training and reporting.", "At Spotify, I have also seen a broader version of the above two hybrid roles: the data scientist that builds data science platforms and tools for other data scientist to use.", "This role is probably one that only companies with a higher headcount can create and it is focused on enabling other data science teams across the company by creating tools and platforms. Examples of such tools and platforms can include a unified and streamlined way that data scientists can start, develop and share a coding project as well as R and python packages that can be used to standardize methods (such as clustering and Bayesian statistics) and make it easy for all data scientists to use them.", "This role requires a lot of quantitative skills and probably individual contributor experience as well, in order to be able to understand various data science needs and execute on solutions. It also requires a good grasp of qualitative skills in order to collect timely feedback from your peers and understand their needs or how a potential solution you\u2019re developing can fulfill those needs.", "Important Skills: experience with individual data science work, technical skills to develop cloud solutions and/or python packages, user research skills", "The above roles can be distinguished by an impact vs methods vs platforms trichotomy. If you\u2019re a talented data scientist interested in driving insights and impact on a particular product or part of the business, with less focus on the methodology and techniques used, then you might be more suited for the product data analyst or business intelligence positions. If you are interested in always being near the nexus of the latest machine learning models and methods and are excited to apply them to your company\u2019s vast data sources then you might be better suited to the modeling analyst and machine learning engineer positions. Finally, if you\u2019re motivated by taking a more horizontal role in your organization, to educate and enable other teams to do their work better, then you might be interested in the data-services-as-a-platform roles, such as the platforms & tools developer.", "If there\u2019s a job listing that caught your eye and you aim to understand better what type of a data science role it is, read the job description and try to see if they have an emphasis on impact, methods or platforms. Additionally, ask the hiring manager who your stakeholders will be and how you will your performance be evaluated.", "If you\u2019re entering the data science job market for the first time, Welcome! I hope this guide can help give you some more clarity on the types of positions there are and help you identify the opportunities that are best suited to your talents and interests. Let me know in the comments if you\u2019re finding roles that don\u2019t fit into the impact vs methods vs platforms trichotomy.", "If you\u2019re someone with experience in the data science job market, how have you seen data science roles take shape in your companies?\u201d", "Data Scientist at Instagram NYC. Previously at Spotify.
