It usually comes with a number of rites of passage: buying your first lottery, having your first drink, entering into soul-crushing debt agreements.", "Another is joining Tinder. We may be physically distanced, but the need to connect with others is stronger than ever. Absence makes the heart grow fonder, I guess?", "That\u2019s a lie, your high school relationship won\u2019t last 2 weeks into university, JESSICA.", "Tinder recently announced plans to introduce a video chat feature to the platform, and they\u2019ve made it clear that some sort of artificial intelligence + object detection will be leveraged to prevent harassment and ensure safety during what I\u2019m calling \u2018sexy vertical Zoom meetings\u2019.", "In human terms, the \u2018brain\u2019 is kind of like the overall concept of AI, your \u2018eyes\u2019 perform computer vision, and when you\u2019re looking for something specific (your keys, a snack, true love) you\u2019re doing an object detection task.", "Each \u2018layer\u2019 of a CNN looks at parts of an image for certain features (via the pixel values) \u2014 starting with simple ones like edges and gradually getting more complex.", "Those features are mapped to give a probabilistic location of where each one is. The highest probabilities from each section are pooled into a smaller image, where negative pixel values are turned into 0.", "Then the process repeats. Eventually, all these connected layers can be compiled such that they match a certain label/outcome. Based on the probability of these outcomes, the CNN gives its best guess of what\u2019s in the image.", "It\u2019s pretty ingenious, but also time-consuming. If Chaddington Woodsworth starts getting too\u2026 comfy on Tinder video chat, 20 seconds for processing can feel like a lifetime.", "Luckily, some CNNs can operate in real-time. YOLO is an object detection algorithm that shows promise when it comes to autonomous vehicles, where real-time detection is a life-or-death matter.", "YOLO breaks the image up into a grid, where each grid square is responsible for predicting the size, class, and location of an object that is within its bounds.", "It also gives a confidence score \u2014 how sure is it that this an object? Then, it tries to figure the class of the object (under the condition that it actually is an object). This returns a conditional probability: P(Car | Object), for example.", "These confidence scores are associated with bounding boxes around the object in question, ultimately resulting in a lot of bounding boxes of varying weights. The algorithm then looks for boxes with lots of overlap \u2014 this signifies a high probability there\u2019s an object there.", "Those high-overlap predictions are output, and they\u2019re kept if they meet a certain threshold probability score. YOLO can do this for every frame/second during a video making this the perfect tool if Tinder wants to monitor video chats for safety.", "Tinder has stated that when it comes to the balance between safety and privacy, they learn towards safety. Using YOLO real-time object detection for their upcoming video chat feature could make many people feel safer using it + deter any creeps.", "The next wave of Tinder users is Gen Z \u2014 our whole lives are on the Internet, so I think we\u2019ll be fine with Tinder watching our video chats.", "How this feature might work is a different question. If Tinder sees an unwelcome/inappropriate object, would they end the call, report the user, or give you a warning?", "Technically, it\u2019s a whole other story. Classification of what counts as inappropriate changes from user to user, and throughout a relationship. Even if algorithms are customized to each user, this is going to be a computationally challenging problem.", "Luckily I\u2019m 18 3 miles awayAnd I love solving problems and long walks on the beach.", "Hi, I\u2019m Murto and I\u2019m an 18-year-old entrepreneur and student in Toronto, Canada.
