If we have data, or \u201cbig data\u201d in one or more of our data lake/storages, like AWS S3 or Azure blob storage, we can run SQL query on that data without the need to build a pipeline or inject the data into distributed databases such as Cassandra or MongoDB.", "This is a huge advantage, especially when we would like to interact with offline data without creating the pipelines or peek at completely fresh new data that was just sunk into the storage before replicating/transforming and saved into a dedicated Database.", "As with all cloud services, there is a need to understand the cost model. with serverless, we pay-per-use. That means that we pay for the amount of processed data.", "If we ran a select * query on 2TB, the prices would be calculated by the 2TB data processed. This can be more cost-efficient than having a dedicated pool of servers, depends on the company/group needs.", "We will look into the famous NYC Taxi dataset from the open datasets and will try to understand what is the state of taxis in the city, what is the time during the day that people take taxies, and more.

Starting with 165 M taxi rides in 2014 and decreasing to 44 M taxi rides in 2019.", "That can be because of better city transport in the city like metros, buses, or new ride-sharing companies that came into that market during that period of time like Uber and Lyft.", "Now, let\u2019s take a look at a single year:", "Running the query and looking at the results, under the chart, we can see a pattern where during the weekends there are fewer rides, we will achieve that by changing the views of the chart according to our needs:", "It might be related to the fact that during public holidays, people are less likely to take taxis, we will join the table of NYC Taxi data with United State Holiday data.", "All this data is under the open-source datasets and is available for you to query and use.", "This query can be divided into 3 queries", "Here we are pulling data from the data lake, selecting, casting date information and counting the rides for 2016, and grouping rides per day.", "Here we are pulling data from the data lake, but from a different table, selecting the holiday for the United-States during 2016.", "Using the withoperator the beginning of the query and the 3rd query referring to both new temp tables, we can run join on the table with the date column as a key.", "Running the query on our Serverless SQL engine will give us this chart, where we can tweak the columns to better explore and understand the data:", "As long as the data is available for use in a data lake, either public or by our company, we can easily do the exploration process using Serverless SQL.", "We can later save the view/output that we created and share it with our colleagues or download the image using the save as image button.", "Watch the free workshop on it here.", "Thank you for reading so far.
