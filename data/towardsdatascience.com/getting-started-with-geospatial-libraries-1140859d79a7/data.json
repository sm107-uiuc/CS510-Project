Other advatange, a Python script that you write on one machine will run on any other machine, providing the required modules installed. There are a large numbers of available libraries and packages build special to Geospatial and Geoprocesing, this allow the user to spend more time development a real software wich will help to reach their goals.", "Consist in using mathematic and computational processing to get and analyse the spatial data. In geoprocessing data need to be georeference, wich mean the date needs to be a real localization as an address, coordiante.", "When you realize a formal formulary as when you give your name or phone number, for example, for geoprocessing, is not enough to start analysing this kind of data. But when you give your address to this form, we can analyse it, for example, when you want to know how many of your users live in the North of the state.", "In this article, we will look at some opensource libraries that offer suport and work with maestry with Geoprocessing and Geospatial development. Make sure you use the right library to right purpose and where wich one of them fits in your project.", "Manipulation and analysis of geometric objects in the cartesian plane.", "Shapely works with Cartesian Coordinate mode just like AutoCAD, the library communicates very well with PostGIS and its main purpose is the manipulation of geometries. Imagine that you can manipulate your data to tell you exactly how to get from point \u201cA\u201d to point \u201cB\u201d, or even discover the perimeter of your home, city, or state.", "Shapely provides these and many other possibilities very simply using computational geometry.", "OGR\u2019s neat and nimble API for Python programmers.", "Fiona was made to be simple, its main function is to read / write files, as well as the Pyshp library, where in addition you can manipulate geometry properties, all in a very similar way as it is done in python using dictionaries, mappings and iterators .", "Python interface to PROJ (cartographic projections and coordinate transformations library).", "When we work with geometries in different projections, such as UTM, WGS84, and many other. PyProj provides a way to change our projection from, for example, UTM to WGS64, that way our information will always be in the projection we indicate and will always be placed correctly on the globe.", "A spatial analysis library with an emphasis on geospatial vector data written in Python.", "PySAL is a geospatial computing library that\u2019s used for spatial analysis. Beyond that, it groups many other libraries such as matplotlib, geopandas, rasterio, it turns into a complete resource.", "A package for scientific computing with Python.", "Geoprocessing is mathematics. Numpy is an extraordinary library to deal with this, when working with geospatial data you will do many sums, divisions and things like that so numb to make your life easier. The key to Numpy in the context of geoprocessing is supporting for large matrices, and mathematical functions.", "A translator library for raster and vector geospatial data format.", "GDAL brings a standardization approach to our geometric objects. In turn GDAL works with raster data and OGR covers working with vector data. GDAL in addition to its extreme processing speed which is guaranteed by its execution in C, it is also known for working with most types of spatial data formats.", "Support for geographic data to pandas objects.", "Pandas is a data analysis library that structures your data in a spreadsheet-like manner for further computations. Since our geospatial data comes from a broad set of sources and formats, such as CSV, pandas helps work with the data with minimal effort. In turn, GeoPandas instead of tabulating data, it adds a component that supports the geographic world. Behind the scenes, Geopandas uses Shapely and Fiona.", "Suport to mapvisualization and create maps for web.", "Mapnik was created with just one purpose, to create beautiful maps. In addition to this incredible ideology, it provides us with several possibilities to complement our map as marked, labels, colors.", "GeoAlchemy is an extension of SQLAlchemy and was created for PostGIS, where there was a need to store geometries in a relational database. In addition to supporting geometries, it also performs some spatial operations.", "This library provides support for finding addresses, cities, so you GeoPy can easily help you to find out the latitude and longitude of your city for example.", "Geospatial development is important in our lives, as at the end of a soccer game, we can know how many miles a player ran during the game thanks to geospatial data and geoprocessing. Every day geoprocessing grows, new libraries are created, new GIS are created, it is something real. Fortunately, these libraries can greatly facilitate our development, comparing it 10 years ago. In the future, working with geoprocessing will be wonderful, and the basis for creating that future are these libraries.", "Your home for data science.
