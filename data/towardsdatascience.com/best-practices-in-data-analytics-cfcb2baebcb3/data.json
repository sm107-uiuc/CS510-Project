It could be the Marketing Department that wants to design a new product given the clients\u2019 unspoken needs or it could be the financial controller that wants to better understand which initiative creates more value. In any case, data are needed, analytical skills are involved and the IT department is called to help.", "However, in a modern organisation, the weight of digital transformation could not be only on IT shoulders. Everyone should do her/his part.", "Some projects (usually a small part) will need high-level competencies which could not be still affordable for all the companies (such as deep learning experts with years of experience in different fields) but others could be handled in-house with the resources already available and making the most with the great knowledge of the problem to tackle.", "Moreover, the IT department is every day more involved in managing the demand coming from all the company departments. A new project (even a small one) should be planned in advance and a budget should be defined and approved. From my experience, an IT department could not afford any more the time-to-market needed by the business, apart from the rare cases of very high priority projects. Especially in periods like this one where budgets are everyday tighter.", "That is why every department should invest in analytical skills and carry on projects with their own resources (with IT support at a minimum). People with an operational role in the project should have a general knowledge of how databases are structured and how to query them with a data visualization tool (like Tableau, QlikView, or Power BI to name a few), if not with some basic SQL.", "A comprehensive data lake (and of course the means to interact with it) is the first enabler that comes into my mind when I think of something that changed the way I build informative tools (like analysis or dashboards).", "If you worked with different legacy databases, you know that building and maintaining analytics that need data from more than one legacy could be a massive pain in the neck.", "A data lake is a repository of all the company data and it should be the place where all the data are written out and read from the various legacy (with no-exception whatsoever).", "Investing in a modern data lake infrastructure is very important. Of course, that could become a long process and the effort depends on how many legacies you have and how much complex they are.", "With the growth of your data lake, it will become every day more difficult to keep track of all the tables in many different databases.", "A good and detailed (and up-to-date!) catalog or data dictionary will make analysts more autonomous and less reliant on specific know-how that now belongs to few.", "Sandboxes are places where users and analysts can play with data without the risk of corrupting production databases.", "Often, in data visualization or machine learning projects, you\u2019ll need to manipulate and transform (and put in relation) the available data and build a layer that would become the input for a dashboard or a predictive model.", "A good (and fast) way to proceed is to build your own data-model in a sandbox and then use it to prototype. In the final phase of the project, the data-model you built in the sandbox will be used as a baseline for production.", "A lot of reports shared across the company are still built on PowerPoint and Excel, downloading data from legacy systems. Working on reports in this way is very time consuming and prone to operative errors. For the reasons, often reports potentially available on a daily bases are made and shared monthly.", "Investing in a data visualization tool will assure your company to have more reliant and frequent reports.", "There are many good tools available on the market (and with different kinds of licenses). The right tool for you is based on many factors. I won\u2019t suggest a specific one but I\u2019d like to share some considerations.", "First of all, you have to keep in mind who will work on it. Most modern tools are easy to use but offer a small range of charts with limited customization options. Others (for example the library D3js, shiny or Plotly dash) offers a wide range of chart but some coding skills are needed.", "Then you have to consider how many people will access your dashboards and how (web page, desktop application, etc.). The chosen tool should be universally adopted in the company and must be available to all the resources that will need to interact with the database and all the resources that will need to access your reports. So, long term costs could become a driver.", "Integration with your databases. Usually, you\u2019ll find your database supported by most tools. However, best to check first.", "Community. When you\u2019ll work on advanced dashboards you\u2019ll probably reach the edge of your tool potentiality. Choosing a widespread tool with a large community will guarantee you to have most of the questions answered.", "My personal choice at the moment is Tableau, I\u2019ll find it the most complete. Of course, quality doesn\u2019t come cheap but you\u2019ll have a great community and a lot of advanced features.", "The issue of back-up and versioning is not solely related to Data Analytics but if your work implies writing code (and this is not only true for Data Scientists who develop predictive models in Python but also for Data Analysts who have to write complex SQL queries to build a layer of data model on top of the rough databases) is better to know the state-of-the-art methodologies that will prevent the loss of days of works!", "The most experienced of you (with serious coding experience) will laugh at this suggestion but I\u2019ve seen a lot of data analysts (and some data scientists) who are not properly versioning their work.", "My suggestion here is to invest some time to learn how to use Git, a version control system created by Linus Torvalds (most known for creating Linux). Git is designed to help teams of developers to work together on the same project. I also use it often when I work on my own because it helps me to keep track of all the versions of my code and let me experiment without the risk of compromising the \u201cgood\u201d working version. With the use of a cloud-repository (as Github or Gitlab) you can also back-up your work without relying on local copies.", "The learning curve for git is quite slow but I assure you it\u2019s worth it.", "Data are every day more at the center of how a modern company works. In this article I shared some personal thoughts about the most important enablers and accelerators that could change the way in which data are analyzed in your organization and could speed up data-analytics projects:", "Your home for data science.
