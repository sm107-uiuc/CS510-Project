And whoever thinks about the past of the computer, actually not \u2014 the dream of the thinking machine can already be found in the ancient Greeks.", "But the time of the legends seems to be over: Artificial intelligence is everywhere today. But what is it that we call AI today? And how does it work?", "One of the founding fathers of artificial intelligence, John McCarthy, described AI as \u201cthe science and technology of producing intelligent machines\u201d, ie as a field of activity for researchers and engineers.", "Today, the term mostly means these intelligent machines: Artificial intelligence stands for computer systems that behave intelligently .", "Intelligence means here: They solve tasks that normally require intelligence, such as understanding and expressing language, image recognition, decision-making or translations.", "Unlike humans, AI learn and do mostly only one task at a high level. Such an AI is therefore called weak or narrow AI . In their specialty, they are now often superior to humans. All current AI systems are weak AI.", "An AI with human-like intelligence that can apply its mind to many different tasks does not yet exist. But it is the major goal of AI research. Such an AI is called General Artificial Intelligence . Commonly, but less clear due to their philosophical origins, the terms strong or true AI.", "If general artificial intelligence develops to such an extent that it exceeds human beings in all respects, an artificial super intelligence arises . For many AI warners, the emergence of a KSI \u2014 called the singularity \u2014 marks the likely end of humanity . Some AI experts, on the other hand, hope that super AI will solve humanity\u2019s big problems like climate change, poverty and disease.", "There are different methods to create artificial intelligence. Basically, two different approaches can be distinguished:", "The so-called \u201cGood, Old-Fashioned AI\u201d (GOFAI) determined AI research until the late 1980s and strived for strong AI. The idea: Human thinking consists of the logical combination of individual terms that contain our knowledge of the world.", "SHRDLU was one of the first AI programs to try to understand natural language. The AI, created between 1968 and 1970, can move geometric objects and provide information about them when requested.", "From this idea, so-called expert systems emerged that pack simple information about the world into symbolic categories and operate with them in logical conclusions.", "GOFAI was unable to meet the high expectations of AI \u2014 the first AI winter broke out. Research funds were canceled and projects were canceled. Today, such AIs are used in process automation, for example.", "The current favorite of AI research is machine learning , especially deep learning .", "Machine learning creates computer systems that use data to learn how to perform tasks. Instead of a developer who specifies instructions line by line in the form of programming code, the software independently updates its code after the first trigger and optimizes it for a better result.", "The current favorite of the research discipline is so-called deep learning: machine learning with multi-layered neural networks that recognize patterns in data with increasing accuracy and thus learn human preferences, recognize objects or understand language.", "Machine learning drives a large number of current AI services. No matter whether Google, Netflix or Facebook: learning algorithms make recommendations , improve search engines and let voice assistants give answers.", "Artificial neural networks are inspired by a rudimentary picture of the human brain : an algorithm creates different layers of connected neurons or nodes that exchange information with each other. The neural networks had their mathematical beginnings in 1943.", "In the simplest case, the architecture consists of an input layer, a middle, hidden layer (hidden layer) and an output layer. The input signal is modified by the initially randomly generated values \u200b\u200bof the middle neurons and passed on to the output layer.", "The output can now be compared with the input \u2014 was the prediction correct or not? Based on the result, the values \u200b\u200bof the middle neurons are modified and the process is repeated with a new input. With many repetitions, the prediction becomes more and more precise.", "In short: Neural networks are algorithms that optimize themselves.", "If you want to get deeper, this excellent English-language video series is recommended.", "Deep learning or Deep Learning is machine learning with neural networks with more than one hidden layer (Hidden Layer).", "These complex neural networks began their triumphal march in 2012 at the latest when such a network won the ImageNet competition for image analysis.", "Deep learning has been responsible for the AI \u200b\u200bboom of recent years, especially in image recognition, autonomous driving or deepfakes.", "The breakthrough of deep learning is made possible by ever faster processors and dedicated AI chips such as Google\u2019s TPU and huge amounts of data that are used to train the machine.", "GANs consist of two neural networks (agents) that mutually improve each other. Both are trained with a common data set, such as photos.", "One agent then creates content similar to the data record, the other compares it with the original data record. If it recognizes it as a forgery, it forces the counterfeiter to improve its content \u2014 until it looks as if it belongs to the training data record like an original.", "In 4.5 years, the GAN-KIs have become better at generating human portraits.", "With enough repetitions, a master forger is created: GANs create deceptively real people , deep fakes, streets or fake models. They compose, play music and create expensive works of art , turn retro games into HD versions. Since their introduction in 2014, they have steadily improved.", "The training is part of artificial intelligence like placeholders in mathematical formulas. But how you learn and train depends entirely on the AI. I present some learning methods that are used in AI training.", "With supervised learning , the AI \u200b\u200bis monitored in the sense that its training data is prepared. An example: If an AI should recognize objects in photos , all cats, cars, trees etc. are marked on the training photos before the training.", "This labeling process (\u201c labeling \u201d) is time-consuming, but the basis for successful, supervised training \u2014 thanks to intensive human preparatory work , the AI \u200b\u200bknows which patterns it should look for.", "Supervised learning is behind the majority of currently widely used AIs, for example for autonomous driving , face recognition or online searches. The labels are often set by low-wage workers, and in recent years it has become a global industry.", "Unsupervised learning is the hope of AI research. In contrast to supervised learning, data is not prepared in a complex manner: AI receives large amounts of data without labels and independently searches for patterns in the data.", "The method has two advantages: First, well-prepared, extensive data sets are rare. Secondly, an AI can uncover correlations in data that remain hidden from people.", "In the words of AI researcher Yann LeCun, it sounds like this: \u201cIf intelligence is a cake, most of the cake is unsupervised learning, the icing on the cake is supervised learning and the cherry is reinforcing learning.\u201d", "In the meantime, the term self-supervised learning has also spread. Depending on the view, this is a special variant of unsupervised learning or a synonym. LeCun has already announced that from now on he will only speak of self-supervised instead of unsupervised learning .", "Self-supervised learning often retains part of the training data and the AI \u200b\u200bhas to predict it, such as the next word in a sentence. This forces them to learn important details about the data, such as semantic representations .", "Self-supervised learning, for example, is used for AI scaling and has enabled the great advancement of language AIs in the past 1.5 years. OpenAI uses the learning method for the powerful GPT-2 algorithm .", "Encouraging learning relies on carrot and stick : Whenever AI performs its task successfully, it is rewarded. If she misses her goal, she either gets nothing or is punished.", "With this trial and error method , the AI \u200b\u200bdevelops in many areas by trying it out from a beginner to a professional, for example in GO and Chess , Dota 2 , Starcraft 2 or poker . All recent successes rely on so-called deep reinforcement learning, a combination of reinforcing and deep learning.", "Transfer learning refers to training methods in which the skills learned from an AI are applied to a new but related problem. One example is Google\u2019s image recognition AI Inception, which is used by researchers to detect lung cancer.", "In the long run, transfer learning AI could move away from island talents to more flexibility. Research into transfer learning is therefore an important contribution to general artificial intelligence.", "Imitative learning uses demonstrations as training material for AIs. In video games, for example, this can be recordings of human players fighting their way through a game or a robot learning by observing human movements.", "One advantage of mimicking learning over empowering learning is greater flexibility: in some environments, rewards are difficult to define or achieve. A pure trial-and-error method will not advance the AI. This is where the human demonstration helps, from which the AI \u200b\u200bcan learn the way.", "Countless examples are often required before an AI successfully recognizes patterns in data. So-called one-shot and few-shot learning methods help AIs, similar to how people learn a new ability with just a few examples or even with just one example.", "In practice, AIs could learn new tasks without extensive training. For example, Samsung researchers succeeded in exchanging people\u2019s faces with just a few examples . An Israeli research group went one step further and developed a method for real-time deepfakes without face training.", "Your home for data science.
