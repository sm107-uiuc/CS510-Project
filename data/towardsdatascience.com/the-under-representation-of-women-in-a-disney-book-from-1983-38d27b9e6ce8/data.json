As we read it, I had gender and racial discrimination on my mind, particularly how systematic it was. Disney has generally been more progressive, and I thought this book could be an interesting time capsule because the people who read this book when they were young are Millennials.", "So I went through the pages, and I documented who was on each page. I coded by gender, ethnicity, and Disney character like Mickey.", "I did not code by job type, but it was certainly interesting to see the spread of people across the different professions. I don\u2019t think there was enough data to give a clear understanding of demographics by job hierarchy.", "Ultimately, the under-representation of women could be summed up by the title of the book: People at Work. Being a home-maker was not considered a job in the 1980\u2019s. In the 1980\u2019s, only 50% of women participated in the workforce. I looked at this infomation per page, but then condensed it to each two page spread as many single pages lacked a good enough sample of data.", "We can look at the graphs for male and female distributions, and females are only represented about a third of the time. For page 33, it was all animated characters.", "For diversity, there wasn\u2019t much. Of the non-white people, most were black. Even then, white people made 75% of who was on the page. However, one should note, white people made up 83% of the population of the US in 1980. So it isn\u2019t too unfair, and it is quite possible compared to other works at the time, it was progressive. It certainly wouldn\u2019t be now.", "The book was surprisingly representative of people of color considering the year and ethnic makeup of the US at the time. There was certainly an under representation of women, and I\u2019m not sure if it is fair or not considering only half of women were in the workforce at the time. I suppose I expected more racism and more gender bias, and I\u2019m curious how this book would be written now.", "Overall, the book was a fun adventure back into the past. I hope when my children look back at books they read when they were children, they\u2019ll be able to see the progress society has made as I have seen from looking back at this book.", "If you like, follow me on Twitter and YouTube where I post videos of espresso shots on different machines and espresso related stuff.
