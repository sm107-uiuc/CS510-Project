During one of my recent project as a data scientist, I had to start getting used to cloud computing, storage and deployment. Another good step in this direction might be to start experimenting with cloud services such as image recognition, character recognition and speech recognition, if not only to know the performance they offer.", "Testing cloud services offering Optical Character Recognition was the topic of a hackathon I attended a few weeks back, at the company I currently work in. It gave me the chance to test the Artificial Intelligence Services of AWS, focusing primarily on OCR (Textract, Rekognition), but also fun services such as celebrity recognition (Rekognition). Indeed, AWS Rekognition is supposed to be quite a complete service that can detect objects, recognize faces and detect text. The reality is slightly different.", "OCR represents the ability of a system to detect typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text, whether it is from a scanned document, a photo of a document, a sign or other type of text displayed in a photo. It is currently a hot topic as many \u201cold\u201d institutions such as governmental institutions, banks or insurances aim at digitizing all documents, such as printed contracts that might include both printed and hand-written characters. In general, OCR can be separated in two groups:", "HCR tends to be a lot more challenging than PCR for an obvious reason: most people have a horribly confusing handwriting. The difference is also noticeable in the results we experienced.", "The hackathon aimed at comparing AI services from AWS, Google Vision & Microsoft Azure regarding their performance at Optical Character Recognition. Having had a successful experience with AWS for a data engineering project, I chose to be in the team that would work with AWS AI services. I was excited, expecting Amazon to show off once again its world dominating performance. Here is what Amazon promises about this service:", "Amazon Textract is a service that automatically extracts text and data from scanned documents. Amazon Textract goes beyond simple optical character recognition (OCR) to also identify the contents of fields in forms and information stored in tables.", "As PCR seemed to be the focus of Textract (scanned documents), I tried it with an example invoice I could find online. Indeed, the results were quite accurate except for a few words misspelled here and there.", "Since Textract was supposed to go \u201cbeyond OCR\u201d, I expected it to work as well on hand-written text, such as the well-known MNIST dataset. Unfortunately, I was mistaken. Textract did terribly at hand-written character recognition.", "However, Textract seemed to be more of a PCR service rather than the complete OCR service we expected. Still, it was as disappointing as Amazon recommending you another coffee machine when you\u2019ve ordered one on the website 3 days ago.", "In my quest to figure out whether I had simply missed something or had chosen the wrong service in AWS, I looked further into OCR options from the cloud provider. This is when I found out that Rekognition was also supposed to detect text. What if Rekognition was the one created to deal with the hand-written job?", "Indeed, AWS Rekognition is also supposed to excel at detecting text on a picture. Here is what Amazon claims:", "Text detection is a capability of Amazon Rekognition that allows you to detect and recognize text within an image or a video, such as street names, captions, product names, overlaid graphics, video subtitles, and vehicular license plates. Text detection is specifically built to work with real-world images and videos, rather than document images.", "Again, no explicit mention of hand-written text, but I had to give it a shot.", "The results are much better than what Textract provided, even though we could expect better. A lot of numbers are mistaken for letters and no line was fully and accurately detected (the 5th line almost got it but somehow the number 2 was not detected at all). Surprisingly, while we expected Amazon to offer a great performance, my colleagues found that Google Vision & Microsoft Azure performed better than AWS on handwritten content such as the MNIST dataset (though I do not have their results to prove it).", "To get over the disappointment that OCR in AWS was and to make sure that we did not miss (again) a service that would perform better for this task, we had a look at other services offered by AWS. As I mentioned briefly above, AWS Rekognition service has been created with the primary purpose of object detection but it can also recognize thousands of celebrities, in sports, politics, and whatnot. In the hope to entertain myself a little and as we could not find anything other service for OCR, we tried out the celebrity recognition option available in Rekognition.", "As thousands of other people in the world, I recently became a big fan of Henry Cavill after binge watching The Witcher. Good story, good-looking actor, magic, dragons and, most important of all, horses (mainly Roach but crucial to the story). I was completely sold. Anyway, when we found out about the celebrity recognition software,my first idea was to see whether it would recognize Henry Cavill as being\u2026 well, Henry Cavill. No surprise there, it did! (Yay, an accurate detection!).", "In a second instance, I wanted to challenge the system by finding out if it could recognize the Witcher, as being Henry Cavill. In all honesty, I did not expect it to work. The hair is a radically different color and a complete different length, his eyes are a different color, his face even has additional make up to make it look thinner and whiter, which is unfair competition for an AI model, even powered by the giant Amazon. However, I was absolutely not prepared for this result\u2026", "Dusan Basta (see below) is an international serbian footballer that has nothing to do with Henry Cavill and The Witcher (except for being blond and having long hair). To be fair, I wanted to be entertained and I got a good laugh out of this one.", "I used the service with several other pictures of Henry Cavill in The Witcher with better lighting on the face and a better angle for the camera. In these cases, no celebrity faces were recognized and no serbian footballer was detected.", "In conclusion, I do not believe that AWS AI services are not usable but they are definitely lacking behind in terms of OCR compared to other cloud providers. The results are simply not accurate enough for hand written character recognition and could still be improved when detecting texts in scanned documents (PCR). However, I queried the API several times and the speed at which it detects text is amazing. The availability of the API is also a great advantage. The free tier allows to analyze 5000 images/month and after that, the price per image remains very affordable at $0.001 per image.", "On top of that, I have to admit that the celebrity recognition service is a fun tool. It\u2019s also quite interesting to see how easily it can get confused when it comes to long blond hair on a man. As I am convinced that we have only scratched the surface of possibilities, I would gladly receive recommendations regarding AWS services that can be interesting to play with whether it is for their performance, results, or the entertaining aspect of the task.", "If you enjoyed this article, follow me on Medium and Twitter to get notified when a new article is out.", "Your home for data science.
