Imagine if we could find patterns in purchase behaviour and use it to our advantage! The key to the future is in history!", "Market Basket Analysis helps retailers identify associations between various products in their catalogue based on a large set of transactions. This information can be leveraged for driving product pricing, bundling and placement.", "Imagine you have a supermarket and you would want to increase the sales of your products. You would like to give customers recommendations on what products to buy based on what is in their carts or what they had previously purchased. You might even want to recommend the most popular items that are bought along with the product.", "The first step towards analysis is collecting data. So you dig up a mountain of past transactions in your store for the last one year. The point of interest in each transaction is the items purchased.", "Some of the transactions can be very rare. For example, how many people would have bought bread and a pair of scissors in a single transaction? I\u2019d stick my neck out and say too few to bother. On the other hand, the number of transactions where bread and butter were bought together must be a very large number because there is a high chance people might buy butter to eat with bread. Hence, we can make an association between bread and butter like so:", "If one buys bread, then one might be likely to buy butter.", "There could be many such product combinations that might appear in the transaction history.", "However, for there to be a strong association between the products, those combinations must have been bought very frequently. In order not to waste time on the rare combinations, a cutoff frequency, f, can be set. Any combination of items that appears less than f times is not considered in the algorithm. This minimum frequency f is called Support.", "Support = number of times an item combination appears in all transactions / total number of transactions", "After filtering the transactions based on the frequency of item combinations, we are left with transactions that have a higher frequency. Among these transactions, if you want to establish an association rule between two items, say bread and butter, you would also want to make sure that among all the combinations with bread, butter also appears at least a certain number of times. This frequency is called Confidence.", "Confidence = number of times i1 and i2 appear in all transactions / number of transactions in which i1 appears", "Note: If the confidence of two items appearing together is low, then any combination having the two items would also have a low confidence.", "If bread and scissors are not bought together very frequently, then it is intuitive that scissors, bread and shoes will not be bought as frequently either. This is the basis for eliminating many combinations based on subset frequency.", "Now you have a set of transactions where only those item combinations which have a sufficiently large support and confidence appear.", "Let us see how this works in practice. Let\u2019s look at the following set of 12 transactions:", "From the above list, we see that vegetables and grapes, as well as spaghetti and meatballs are bought frequently (4 times out of 12, and 3 times out of 12 respectively).", "Let us figure out such product associations through the Apriori algorithm.The first thing to set is the support. Let us say that only those items are considered which appear at least 3 times in the transactions. Let us represent the support of an item by S(item).", "Let us try to establish an association between spaghetti and meatballs. For this we need to set a confidence. Let us set it as 0.35. This means that at least 35% of the transactions that have spaghetti in them must have meatballs. Let us define the confidence of two items C(item1, item2).", "Based on the Confidence we have chosen, spaghetti appears to have a strong association with vegetables, avocado and meatballs.", "Confidence can be a biased metric since it considers the support of only one of the component item. In order to account for inflated confidence, we use Lift. Lift is ratio of the Support of the combination of items to the product of supports of individual items in the combination.", "It is natural that higher the Lift of a combination of items, higher the association between the items.", "Now let us reconsider Spaghetti\u2019s association with the other items. Let us denote Lift of two items as Lift(item1, item2).", "Based on Lift, we see that the relation between spaghetti and vegetables is not as strong as Confidence had indicated. The strongest association is between spaghetti and avocado, and spaghetti and meatballs.Similarly, associations can be established between any number of items.", "Based on our calculations, how do we improve our marketing efforts?", "Apriori algorithm is used to determine the latent relationship between items purchased across multiple transactions. The three keys measures used in establishing item-item associations are:1. Support2. Confidence3. Lift", "For illustration, 2-item combinations have been used, but larger combinations (3 items and above) can also be established if they pass the minimum Support and Confidence levels.", "Your home for data science.
