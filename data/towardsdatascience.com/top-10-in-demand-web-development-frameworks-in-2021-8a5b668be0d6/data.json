To find the Job market demand, I have used the Job Search engine Indeed's data (for the USA only).", "In recent years, JavaScript-based client-side web frameworks are dominating web development. While React is not the first one, it is the most popular and disruptive among them. Facebook has developed React as a simple JavaScript library to implement the Web's view layer in a component-based way and released in 2013. It also differed from the existing JavaScript framework as it advocated the one-way data binding. Within a short time, React became overwhelmingly popular among Enterprises and developers.

Since then, Spring has grown with time and now the primary Web framework in Java-based application development. The best part of Spring is evolving with the changing landscape and playing a huge role in making Java relevant in the age of Cloud computing.", "Although Java and Spring are not getting hyped, they are still the number one choice in enterprise software development. As a result, Spring is still one of the top-ranked Web Framework during the age of React, Vue.js, Django.", "It is a popular framework in GitHub:", "The StackOverflow Developer survey 2020 ranked Spring as the 8th most popular Web Framework:", "It is also one of the most loved Web Framework.

As a result, Django has the edge over similar frameworks in other languages in terms of demand in the job market:", "In the early 2000s, the Web application development landscape differed greatly from today. Java-based J2EE was the de facto framework for Web development back then. It was quite heavyweight and needed lots of plumbing. Writing a simple hello world application needed significant effort. David Heinemeier Hansson created Ruby on Rails as a Server-Side Web development framework that supported MVC pattern and Ruby programming language. It introduced many novel ideas and concepts: Convention over Configuration (CoC), Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself (DRY), Active Record pattern. It also introduced Rapid Application Development via Database creation and migration, Scaffolding of Views.", "It is the most disruptive Web framework and influenced most of the frameworks in this list directly or indirectly.", "Today Ruby on Rails is not as popular as in the past. The principal reason is that other frameworks learned from it and offered similar functionality types in other popular languages (e.g., Laravel in PHP, Django in Python, Play in Scala, Grails in Groovy). It still has a footprint in many popular Web applications and remains a popular choice for Server-Side Web development.", "It is the 8th most popular Web framework in terms of GitHub stars:", "Ruby on Rails has significantly lowered the barrier to Web development. As a result, many companies already have significant Ruby on Rails codebase, which is reflected by the high number of Job openings for Ruby on Rails developers:", "In recent years, Microsoft is modernizing its Tech Stack with innovative, modern, futuristic design that would fulfill modern Software Development needs.

Nevertheless, it is becoming increasingly popular over time.", "Although the youngest framework in this list, it still has high GitHub stars:", "The StackOverflow Developer survey 2020 ranked ASP.NET Core as the 6th most popular Web Framework:", "As already mentioned, it is the best framework in terms of modern features and developer ergonomics. According to the StackOverflow developer survey, it is the most beloved Web framework surpassing event the React.js:", "As the youngest framework in this list, the demand for ASP.NET Core developers is relatively high. It will only increase in the coming days once the companies finally move from classic ASP.NET to ASP.NET Core:", "Armin Ronacher created Flask as a minimalistic, Python-based Micro Web framework in 2010. Flask is called Micro-framework as it is unopinionated and does not need any particular tools or Libraries. It is comparable to Express.js and does not offer out of the box support for ORM, Form Validation, or Securities. However, Flask is highly modular and supports pluggable Extensions.

For them, I have listed three Batteries included framework: Django, Ruby on Rails, and PHP Laravel.", "Sometimes, developers look for a minimalistic framework to try something quick or to develop a POC. For them, the Python-based minimalistic framework Flask is an excellent choice.", "Please note that list list is not all-inclusive and there are many excellent frameworks that could not make a cut in the list. Also, if you work in a programming language like Go, Rust or Scala, then you should better find a framework in that language.", "Your home for data science.
