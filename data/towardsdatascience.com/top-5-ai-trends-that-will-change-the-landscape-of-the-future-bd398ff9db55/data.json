AI will change the perception of how the world twenty years from now will shape up to be.", "It is undeniable that AI will change the landscape of the future. There is a frequent increase in the demand for AI-related jobs, especially in data science and machine learning positions. It is believed that artificial intelligence will change the world, just like how electricity changed the world about 100 years ago. As Professor Andrew NG has famously stated multiple times \u2014", "\u201cArtificial Intelligence is the new electricity.\u201d", "We have advanced immensely in the field of artificial intelligence. With the increase in the processing and computational power, thanks to graphical processing units (GPUs), and also due to the abundance of data, we have reached a position of supremacy in Deep Learning and modern algorithms.", "We went from computers that occupy the entire room to palm-sized smartphones and artificial intelligence, which can now perform tasks like face recognition, objection detection, and a ton more, which was once deemed impossible.", "The other spectacular fields, such as robotics, electronics, etc., are also catching up with time and are branching out into their own superior groups. In this article, we will study the top five Artificial Intelligence or AI combined technologies and trends that will transpire the entire world beyond imagination.", "Let us dive in and start exploring and analyzing these five biggest trends with AI!", "Robotics is a fantastic field for the upcoming decades, with a wide range of choices available for its implementations in the real-world.", "It has a wide array of applications varying from industrial robots and robotic arms in factories and industries, space rovers to explore outer-worldly planets like Mars or the moon, military applications, medical uses, and so much more.", "However, the future artificial intelligence integrated into robots will be a revolutionary approach to change the landscape of the future for the succeeding years to come. Robots with AI integrations will be able to process, compute, evaluate, and perform the desired human action.", "Robotics and artificial intelligence have a humungous scope in the future. The integration of data science projects along with robots has tremendous potential for enforcing top-notch product manufacturing in industries with very little human effort.", "The ability of robotics and AI is infinite. They have tremendous potential to reach a level of high-quality superiority in engaging with the tasks at hand. AI and robots are a powerful combination for automating tasks for industrial applications and limitless potential for a variety of real-life use cases.", "However, for those of you worried that AI-based robots will take away your jobs or will conquer the world, as shown in sci-fi movies, then don\u2019t worry. Robots will always require some kind of human intervention for the former, and for the latter, we are still a long way from achieving artificial general intelligence.", "Hence, both of these two worries are out of the question, at least for the next two decades. To understand more about AI, check out my article on Demystifying Artificial Intelligence.", "Deep learning and Artificial Intelligence in natural language processing have come a long way. From simple LSTMs, we have progressed to using BERT, transformers, sequence to sequence models with attention, and so much more.", "Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 is an autoregressive language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text. It is the third-generation language prediction model in the GPT-n series created by OpenAI, a San Francisco-based artificial intelligence research laboratory.", "The GPT-3 model developed is an evolution in the field of natural language processing. OpenAI trained the weights of this model on almost 175 billion training parameters. The model is capable of writing entire news articles and magazines without any human intervention.", "There are continuous developments and advancements in these fields with continuous funding, support, and progress. From AI in industrial works all the way to AI in gaming, there is massive productivity and a wide range of success to be established with the exponential growth of these fields.", "Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet.", "The combination of cloud computing and Artificial Intelligence is a real game-changer. These two awesome practices, when combined together, are capable of achieving great feats. The main advantage of cloud computing integrated with Artificial Intelligence is the wide range of resources available.", "The availability of GPUs for performing complex deep learning computations and deployment of these AI models in the cloud to reach a larger audience is a massive accomplishment.", "Google Collaboratory is one such brilliant platform where you can build a Jupyter Notebook for evaluating, computing, and sharing your AI projects. Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and IBM Watson are some of the most fabulous resources and options that are available to us for utilizing them to achieve maximum profits.", "After the discussion of cloud platforms and AI, it would be impossible to skip the prevalence of what the internet of things combined with artificial intelligence can achieve.", "The Internet of things (IoT) describes the network of physical objects \u2014 \u201cthings\u201d \u2014 that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the Internet.", "The combination of artificial intelligence combined with the internet of things forms a new, interesting, and unique branch of study called the Artificial Internet of Things or the AIOT in short. IoT enabled with AI is capable of creating intelligent machines that can simulate smart behavior while supporting decision-making ability with little or no human interference.", "With the integration of artificial intelligence in embedded IoT devices like raspberry pi and Nvidia Jetson Nano (Among many others) are capable of developing some masterpieces, which will be highly profitable and beneficial to society as a whole. Some examples of virtual assistants like Alexa, Siri, or Google AI show the high-level intellect and future possibilities.", "Last but not the least, we have the Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). GANs developed and originated in 2014 by Ian Goodfellow, and his colleagues have gained immense popularity recently.", "GANs are perceived to be the future of deep learning with their amazing ability to create visuals and images that have never even existed. Generative Adversarial Networks are the current peak of deep learning with an exceedingly improving curve.", "GANs are an undeniable future trend that will revolutionize artificial intelligence forever. GANs is a slightly complicated topic, and I will be covering it extensively in the upcoming article\u2019s part by part. However, for the purpose of this post, it is essential to note that two networks, a generator, and a discriminator go to war against each other and have a small dispute.", "The generator tries to create realistic fake images to bypass the elemental checking of the discriminator, while the role of the discriminator is to catch the fake copies. This cat and mouse chases leads to the development of unique samples that have never existed, and it is realistic, far beyond human imagination.", "To conclude this article, I would like to state that there limitless optimizations and developments that can be accomplished in the field of Artificial Intelligence. These top emerging trends are only an indication of what the future awaits for AI and its contemporaries.", "We are surrounded by Artificial Intelligence all around us, and I find the fast pace of progress in this field extremely fascinating. I am excited about the newer technologies in the future, as well as the ultimate rise of AI. Let me know what trends are you guys most excited about in the upcoming future!", "Check out some of my other articles that you might enjoy reading!", "Thank you all for sticking on till the end. I hope all of you enjoyed reading the article. Wish you all a wonderful day!", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Love to explore and learn new concepts. Extremely interested in AI, deep learning, robots, and the universe.
