This is because, on average, these are the lowest complexity but highest leverage tasks we work on in a given week.", "Before we had Data Clinics, our work was all over the place: one day would be entirely focussed on ad-hoc, and the next entirely on longer-term projects. We had no system in place for managing small requests, and personally, I was frustrated when many a day did not go to plan \u2014 even if the work I did complete was valuable!", "We needed a way to prioritize both sides: ad-hoc and planned.", "Over the past two and a half years \u2014 as we\u2019ve scaled from 1 to 4 Data team members, 50 to 150 non-medical team members, and 5K to 2M covered Canadians \u2014 Data Clinics are how we\u2019ve handled the growing demand for ad-hoc work.", "A Data Clinic \u2014 or Office Hours, for all the non-medical companies out there \u2014 is a time of day when you set aside the week\u2019s plan and welcome walk-ins with any and all types of data requests.", "Data Clinics are not a new idea, the idea has been employed by many companies \u2014 like Ro!* At Dialogue, we\u2019ve spent some time perfecting the way we run these clinics \u2014 this article is not the definitive guide to Data Clinics, but rather, a collection of what we\u2019ve learned along the way.", "Back when Dialogue started running Data Clinics, the Data Team was only one person and Matt ran an as-needed clinic for 30 minutes everyday. Now that the data team is four people, each team member runs 2 one-hour Data Clinics per week \u2014 for a total of 8 hours of data clinic \u2014 spreading them out so each day has at least one.", "Some examples of common data clinic requests include:", "The goal isn\u2019t always to fully answer these questions, but more often than not, the goal is to get the ball rolling. In less than 15 minutes, how can I get them closer to their goal? Or if that\u2019s not possible, how can I get them a plan for getting there?", "At Dialogue, we\u2019re firm believers in applying Scrum software development principles to what we do, and by extension, we believe the 80/20 rule is all around us: the first bit of work, the first 20%, will be the highest value on a project, accounting for 80% of the benefit. While not everything of course is so simple \u2014 some projects only bring benefit once fully complete, for example \u2014 many projects we work on follow this principle. In all of the above example questions, there is a lot of benefit to be had just from taking 15 minutes to analyze, train, or brainstorm.", "While most of the data team\u2019s time is dedicated to large projects \u2014 with greater uncertainty and complexity and greater strategic value \u2014 this is a refreshing opportunity to focus on the small things that can help move the needle, today.", "Now with the introduction out of the way, these are the more concrete reasons why we run Data Clinics and why we think you should too.", "As mentioned above, Data Clinics are great for getting big returns on small amounts of time. Even if the task can\u2019t be fully completed, or even if it\u2019s just time for planning the task, you\u2019ve already gone from zero to a plan. This is the top reason we run our Data Clinics.", "Interruptions are terrible for productivity, and Data Clinics are a convenient way for us to timebox those interruptions. Rather than handling a pile of direct messages, we route them all to a single channel on Slack for handling asynchronously as data clinic requests.", "For me, I know I\u2019m most productive on analytical tasks in the morning, so the Data Clinic is a great way of preserving that time, and giving me a more interpersonal task to break up the remainder of the day in the afternoon.", "Task backlogs can easily feel out of touch when they\u2019re filled with large projects. Data Clinics in contrast let you know what the data needs are today. Do we need more documentation somewhere? Do we need more training? Are certain pieces of reporting out of date?", "In some cases, data requests even help us understand how we should change the long term plan. Are there ways that the Data Team can help automate a workflow to minimize these ad hoc requests? Do we need to overhaul our reporting to cover new client needs?", "A less obvious benefit of the Data Clinic is that it has pushed our Data team to make our work more easily maintained by non-authors. In Data Clinics, requesters can ask a question about any part of the business, so depending on the day you may be answering questions about subjects you have worked on, or subjects you have barely touched.", "Now more than ever we keep this in mind when reviewing code. Is this change helping facilitate self-serve? If you\u2019re on vacation when this breaks, are we screwed?", "By extension, this is also a great way to onboard new team members. Pairing on a Data Clinic is a great way to go broad but not too deep into the data pipeline, helping explain the general approach without getting too caught up in the details.", "Sometimes our priorities for a given sprint, or even quarter, skew to one or a handful of teams. If we\u2019re onboarding a lot of new clients, for example, we will need more support on Medical Operations and Customer Success. Even in these times, a smaller department like Talent can still make requests during a Data Clinic.", "Now that we\u2019ve been running these Data Clinics for over two years, we have a few pointers about what has worked best for us, and why.", "Data Clinics should happen often. Requests can be timely, so it\u2019s important to not load up all the Data Clinic time into one day. Also, it\u2019s a good tool for breaking up larger tasks, so they can be used to help manage personal productivity this way.", "The calendar, and if possible the space, should be public and easily accessible and known to all. We have a Google Calendar for our Data Clinics that you can find that will let you know who\u2019s doing Data Clinic, when, and where. We also try to keep them at roughly the same time (often this is at the end of day) to help minimize miscommunications and help set expectations around how long a question will take to be answered.", "Our data clinics work best when every team member does their fair share. This helps with cross-maintainability of our work, with keeping various parts of the pipeline familiar, but also with keeping expectations around ad-hoc time and interruptions.", "Unfortunately, some team members will always be pulled into ad-hoc projects more frequently, but structuring Data Clinics these ways can at least help minimize the total effect of those distractions. Ideally, for planning and for peace of mind, interruptions and distractions should be shared across the team.", "We\u2019ve tried doing only in-person and it just doesn\u2019t work. If you want to be able to handle all requests, your Data Clinics need to be flexible enough to handle synchronous \u2014 that is to say, in-person \u2014 and asynchronous requests.", "For this, we maintain a Slack channel where anyone can leave us a question and we\u2019ll respond during our Data Clinics. If we can, we will sometimes schedule a time slot during the data clinic to run through the problem live, but sometimes that\u2019s not possible and we\u2019ll handle the request in a thread. This helps ensure that everyone, regardless of their schedule, can get the help they need.", "By using a public space, this also helps with visibility for other team members. You can tag someone who might also be interested, or you can tag an older thread that might be relevant for a new question.", "Another tip is that to ensure something has been fully resolved, we leave a \u2705 once the request is closed. When scanning the channel this helps you to identify which questions are still open. Sometimes we will also leave a \ud83d\udc40 on a request to let our other data team members know that, while not yet resolved, someone is looking into it.", "This is the toughest one. We do our best to respect the time limit of 15 minutes per request, but sometimes we will go as far as 30 minutes. We do this to be able to serve as many people as possible, and in the same vein, to be fair to our other requesters.", "If we spend too much time on one request it takes time from other people. In these situations, the focus should be on making a plan, not on making the deliverable itself.", "Data Clinics are going really well at Dialogue, but there\u2019s always room for improvement! A couple improvements that we\u2019re thinking about are how to:", "We want to automatically track who is making requests, what type of requests, and how long it takes us to resolve them. Ideally, we would use this to improve documentation and solve simple requests before they need to be brought to the Data Clinic.", "We\u2019ll use that data to then identify the best opportunities for improving self-serve. Simple opportunities for this include better documenting key tables and better training for common self-serve subjects, we just need to know where to start for the biggest impact.", "We will also use that data to determine who is using Data Clinics the least. We want to encourage the underrepresented departments to ask more questions, and as a result get more benefit from the Data Team.", "Before we had monthly requests from 3 departments \u2014 Product, Customer Success, and Medical Operations. Now, with our new scale and improved Data Clinic process, we have monthly requests coming in from 12 departments \u2014 Product, Customer Success, Medical Operations, Design, Tech, Finance, Marketing, Sales, Partnerships, New Services, Machine Learning, and Talent \u2014 and everyone of those departments knows they can get an answer from Data within 24 hours!", "The biggest benefit by far, however, is that Data Clinics have increased Data Literacy, both in terms of depth and breadth. People are more likely to use data in their day-to-day, more likely to understand the data, and more likely to help their team members understand it too.**", "If you end up adopting Data Clinics, I hope that they help you as much as they\u2019ve helped us. And of course, let us know if you have any improvements to add!", "* My colleague Matt had come up with the idea to call our office hours \u201cData Clinics\u201d back in the fall of 2017. They\u2019ve changed a lot since then, and we\u2019ve learned lots from examples like Ro\u2019s, but once again this is our way of doing it: take what works for you, and change what doesn\u2019t!", "** Based on anecdotal evidence, but we\u2019ve implemented a Data Survey to help us track some of these subjects moving forward!", "Your home for data science.
