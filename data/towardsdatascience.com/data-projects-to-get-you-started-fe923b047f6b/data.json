Project selection can be overwhelming and almost always the initial challenge is finding the appropriate data to use. Even though other Chief Data Officers from around the country are always willing to help and share examples of their own work (great examples from Data Smart City Solutions, Penn MUSA program, and Data Science for Social Good), often times the specific datasets used are not exactly the same as the data your city collects, or the datasets cannot be shared publicly for reference.", "For this post, I\u2019ll detail a few different places to find data that can be easily replicated across almost any other city in the county (or for one example in your state). These data sources are robust and generally pretty clean and easy to use.", "The newly launched data.census.gov is an excellent and easy to use resource for downloading data. The Census Bureau has also built APIs that make it easy to programmatically download data. The data is formatted exactly the same way across the country, and in many cases can be as granular as a few blocks in your city.", "A couple of years ago, we authored a report called Below the Line, an analysis of Census data and indicators that correlated with poverty in Syracuse. Gathering and cleaning the data was simple, and we were able to compare Syracuse to other Upstate New York cities. Anyone could find the same exact data tables for their city and compare their numbers to Syracuse\u2019s to expand the report. Data from the Census is incredibly important and is used regularly for analyses in cities. An interesting analysis in one place can easily be replicated for another place with a simple switch of the county or city or census tract number.", "We worked with the Center for Government Excellence at Johns Hopkins University, part of our partnership with What Works Cities, to analyze property assessment data and try to better understand where property assessments were out of whack relative to likely property sales value. We got inspiration for this project from the Cook County Assessor\u2019s Office in Illinois. The great thing was that Cook County\u2019s assessment data is very similar to assessment data in Syracuse.", "Even better, within New York State, almost every municipality uses a database called the Real Property System (or RPS) which maintains a consistent data schema for properties across the state. This means that using our code, another municipality in New York could very easily replicate our work in Syracuse to attempt the same project in their respective area.", "Maybe you really want to get into the \u201csmart city\u201d realm and start using data from sensors. This can be expensive, difficult to implement, and sometimes the value is questionable. Instead, in order to test out analyzing sensor data that comes in real time, federal level agencies like the United States Geological Survey place sensors in many different places, especially water ways. So, you could create a project looking at lake or river levels that then could easily be replicated by just changing the specific water body in the API call.", "Similarly, the National Weather Service places weather sensors across the country and pulling data is easy through the API they provide. Companies like ESRI make using this data even easier, and it is highly likely that you have an ArcGIS license at work.", "The US Federal Government\u2019s Open Data Portal, data.gov, is a treasure trove of available data. Many US states also have Open Data Portals (New York\u2019s is data.ny.gov). These open data portals contain data about your city. You might find where all of the businesses with alcohol licenses are or the quality of bridges in your city. Once again, even though your city may not be collecting this data, it is usable and can then be compared with other cities or areas across the state or country through very easy filtering of specific locations.", "Even before dealing with the challenges of making data collected by your municipality more usable, there are a ton of resources to find data from the State or Federal Government. Many times this data is better maintained and it can easily be compared to other areas of the country, or someone may have done a project using the same dataset that you want to replicate. You can also use these datasets as additional data points in a larger analysis combining your municipality\u2019s data with data from other levels of government.", "Where have you replicated analyses using data from these sources?", "Your home for data science.
