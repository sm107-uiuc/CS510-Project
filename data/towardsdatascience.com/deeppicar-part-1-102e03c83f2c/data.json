Many analysts predict that within the next 5 years, we will start to have fully autonomous cars running in our cities, and within 30 years, nearly ALL cars will be fully autonomous. Wouldn\u2019t it be cool to build your very own self-driving car using some of the same techniques the big guys use? In this and next few articles, I will guide you through how to build your own physical, deep-learning, self-driving robotic car from scratch. You will be able to make your car detect and follow lanes, recognize and respond to traffic signs and people on the road in under a week. Here is a sneak peek at your final product.", "Part 2: I will list what hardware to buy and how to set them up. In short, you will need a Raspberry Pi board($50), SunFounder PiCar kit ($115), Google\u2019s Edge TPU ($75) plus a few accessories, and how each part is important in later articles. The total cost of the materials is around $250\u2013300. We will also install all the software drivers needed by Raspberry Pi and PiCar.", "Part 3: We will set up all the Computer Vision and Deep Learning software needed. The main software tools we use are Python (the de-facto programming language for Machine Learning/AI tasks), OpenCV (a powerful computer vision package) and Tensorflow (Google\u2019s popular deep learning framework). Note all the software we use here are FREE and open source!", "Part 4: With the (tedious) hardware and software setup out of the way, we will dive right into the FUN parts! Our first project is to use python and OpenCV to teach DeepPiCar to navigate autonomously on a winding single lane road by detecting lane lines and steer accordingly.", "Part 5: we will train DeepPiCar to navigate the lane autonomously without having to explicitly write logic to control it, as was done in our first project. This is achieved by using \u201cbehavior cloning\u201d, where we use just the videos of the road and the correct steering angles for each video frame to train DeepPiCar to drive itself. The implementation is inspired by NVIDIA\u2019s DAVE-2 full-sized autonomous car, which uses a deep Convolutional Neural Network to detect road features and make the correct steering decisions.", "Lastly, in Part 6: We will use deep learning techniques such as single shot multi-box object detection and transfer learning to teach DeepPiCar to detect various (miniature) traffic signs and pedestrians on the road. And then we will teach it to stop at red lights and stop signs, go on green lights, stop to wait for a pedestrian to cross, and change its speed limit according to the posted speed signs, etc.", "Here are the prerequisites of these articles:", "This is optional reading, as I try to cover everything you need to know in my articles. However, if you want to dive deeper into deep learning, (pun intended), in additional to the links I provided throughout the article, here are some more resources to check out.", "Andrew Ng\u2019s Machine Learning and Deep Learning courses on Coursera. It was these courses that ignited my passion for Machine Learning and AI, and gave me the inspiration to create DeepPiCar.", "That\u2019s all for the first article.
