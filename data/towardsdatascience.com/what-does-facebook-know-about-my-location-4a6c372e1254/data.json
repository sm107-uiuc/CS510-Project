See Part 1 for analysis of my own Facebook activity, Part 3 to find out what Facebook thinks I like, Part 4 to find out what Facebook knows about my activity on other websites and Part 5 to see what 4.5 years of my relationship looks like in Facebook data.", "If you own a smart phone, your location can be tracked by any app you use. Thankfully it has become easier in recent years to restrict this and to identify which apps are using your location data, although many people either forget to check this or do not realise the setting is on in the first place.", "In this article I\u2019m going to address the question of just how much location data Facebook collects and I\u2019ll visualise it to show how it can be used to make deductions about your life.", "The first, most obvious way in which Facebook may access data on our location is when we willingly give it to them in the form of our profile. Most people will enter their hometown, current city and/or work locations and make this visible to their friends.", "I have also done this over my time using Facebook, below you can see (roughly) where in the UK these locations are. Hopefully this gives some context that will make the following maps of locations easier to comprehend. Note that in all of these maps I\u2019m using the exact coordinates that Facebook has, but for better visualisation I\u2019ve shown them here as circles.", "You can see here that Facebook knows where I grew up, went to school and that I then moved to Nottingham for university (2014) and stayed after graduating, when I started a new job (2017). Although this is all public information it is worth pointing out that people often don\u2019t think about how these \u2018Life Events\u2019 enable a picture to be built of your physical whereabouts over time.", "It also shows my \u2018last location\u2019, which is where I live now. A friendly reminder that Facebook knows where you live!", "Explicit profile locations are not the only way in which Facebook stores your location data, however\u2026", "One other way of Facebook tracking your location is identifying where you are when you log in to your account. I\u2019ll admit I don\u2019t fully understand the criteria for inclusion in this data set, as it doesn\u2019t include every time I\u2019ve opened the app but seems to be mostly locations from the past 18 months, with one from 2017. It consists of 192 locations. The darker the area, the more times I logged in from that location.", "You can immediately see some patterns here which can be used to make deductions - my living in Nottingham being the most obvious. Both my parents\u2019 house and my girlfriends\u2019 parents\u2019 house are hotspots, as is Sheffield where I often travel for work and university (pre-Covid, anyway).", "Some new information included in this data is the evidence of trips. In the last year and a half I have been to Liverpool twice, and to Dumfries & Galloway in Scotland (top left of the map). In both cases you can see I logged in at the end point, but also the route I took to get there: through Carlisle on my way to/from Scotland and through Stoke-on-Trent on my way to/from Liverpool.", "You can see how this information could be used to track my location and even predict it. If you knew I was travelling from home to Liverpool you could perhaps assume I would be travelling through or near Stoke-on-Trent.", "The third way in which Facebook could detect my location is by using my account activity. This is the largest set of location information I could find in the data I downloaded.", "Dating back to October 2017 there are over 1500 instances where I took an action such as: log in, end a session, change a password or add information (i.e. payment info) to my account. The locations of these are plotted below.", "A point to note first - there are two instances of account activity not shown here. One from Washington, Seattle (US) and one from an unknown location in Germany. Both of these actions were \u2018Login checks failed\u2019 - presumably hackers attempting to access my account.", "I should also mention that this doesn\u2019t seem to be 100% accurate. This could be because locations are adjusted to the nearest urban centre/cell tower or because the location is calculated from the IP address rather than my actual location. Having said that, the vast majority seems to have roughly the correct location and you can see the same patterns here as previously.", "The hotspots show where I spend most of my time - my house and families\u2019 houses. The isolated circles I can only assume are times when I have been travelling, either logging on to Facebook as a passenger or having stopped on the way to my destination. By comparing the hotspots to the individual locations, you can see how it would be easy to track my location in real-time and make educated guesses about my final destination.", "That concludes this second part of my series \u201cWhat does Facebook actually know about me?\u201d. I hope it has been illuminating and you\u2019re enjoying getting an insight into the thrilling story of my life. Next up I\u2019ll be delving into my own psyche by looking at what Facebook thinks I like and dislike- and giving my own opinion on how accurate they are. I\u2019ll also be explaining why it sometimes feels like Facebook are listening to your conversations\u2026and why they\u2019re not.", "If you\u2019ve enjoyed this article and the series then please give me and my publication Data Slice a follow to stay up to date.
