This book examines various aspects of the evaluation process with an emphasis on classification algorithms. \u2014 Book description", "In this article we will discuss some of the main ideas about performance assessment in Machine Learning, taking the book as our guide.", "The first (comforting) finding was that I was not alone: simply using repeated cross-validation for most of the practical situations is something common in the machine learning community. The authors talk about the de facto culture of evaluation in the first chapter:", "Although cross-validation has indeed appeared to be a strong candidate among resampling methods in limited data situations, generalizing its use to most practical situations is pushing our luck a bit too far. Most of the practical data situations warrant looking into broader and deeper issues before zeroing in on an evaluation strategy (or even an error-estimation method such as cross-validation). \u2014 Japkowicz, N. and Shah, M., 2011", "Maybe simply using cross-validation might be enough for a Kaggle competition. But in real life we need to consider the full context of evaluation, which evolves many criteria, as the class distribution of the data and the choice of a performance metric for example. The truth is that evaluating models is hard and unfortunately \u201cno single evaluation strategy consisting of a combination of evaluation methods can be prescribed that is appropriate in all scenarios\u201d.", "To answer this we need to take a step back and talk about Machine Learning itself. If we have a classification task and we train a machine learning model to predict unseen data instances we are making use of a generalization inductive argument:", "A generalization (more accurately, an inductive generalization) proceeds from a premise about a sample to a conclusion about the population. \u2014 Wikipedia", "So we take a dataset and generalize based on it. This dataset is the training set. There are two main concepts behind the evaluation: empirical risk and generalization error.", "Given we want to predict a label y, risk is the degree of disagreement between the true label of y and the one assigned by the classifier. A loss function is \u201ca quantitative measure of the loss when the label y of the vector x is different from the label assigned by the classifier\u201d. To estimate this we need to know the labels beforehand, so empirical risk \u201cis the risk of the classifier with respect to the training data\u201d.", "On the other hand the generalization error measures the deviation of risk for unseen data (which is our end goal). The data used to train the classifier can have an impact on the generalization error:", "[\u2026] it is understood that the data on which the classifier is trained, although representative of the true distribution, may not lead the algorithm to learn the classifier f\u2032 with minimum possible risk. \u2014 Japkowicz, N. and Shah, M., 2011", "The source of generalization error can be explained by two things: not enough training data to make an inference on the full underlying distribution or noise in the training data.", "The goal of a model is to minimize both the empirical risk and the generalization error. In other words we want to \u201cto minimize the probability of the misclassification error over the of training examples while making a promising case of good generalization\u201d. And here we have the bias-variance tradeoff because optimizing for one error measure usually means compromising the other.", "To make the situation even worse, measuring the bias and variance decomposition behavior of a learning algorithm is difficult. The authors point to two main limitations:", "To know if the model will generalize well we would need to know the data distribution beforehand, and if we knew it we wouldn\u2019t need to train a classifier in the first place.", "As a result, it is impossible in practice to know the true values of the bias and the variance in the absence of the knowledge of the data distribution. Hence we would need to approximate these values by using some empirical estimates that can be obtained from the data at hand rather than having them depend explicitly on the true underlying data distribution. \u2014 Japkowicz, N. and Shah, M., 2011", "To handle the limited availability of data the data resampling techniques come in to help us:", "Limited data availability plays a very significant role both in the case of model selection and in assessing the performance of the learning algorithm on test data. However, this issue can, to some extent, be ameliorated by use of what are known as data resampling techniques. \u2014 Japkowicz, N. and Shah, M., 2011", "So when we evaluate a model we need to check if it \u201coverfits\u201d or \u201cunderfits\u201d a training set and also evaluate how this affects the generalization error. But how do we do this? First we decide upon a performance measure (there are two chapters of the book dedicated to that) and then we find a good method for testing the model in order to obtain an estimation as unbiased as possible.", "Ok, but how do you choose a method for evaluating the model? It depends on how much data do you have:", "Ideally we would have access to the entire population and test our classifiers on it. Even if the entire population were not available, if a lot of representative data from that population could be obtained, error estimation would be quite simple. It would consist of testing the algorithms on the data they were trained on. \u2014 Japkowicz, N. and Shah, M., 2011", "In real life we have two main options:", "The authors discuss those methods in Chapter 5 and also present an Ontology of Error Estimation Methods.", "As you can see there are a lot of error estimation methods. We will not talk about them here, but I think you got the idea: cross-validation is not the answer to everything.", "And finally, after choosing the appropriate error estimation method the next step is to evaluate if the differences between models are statistically significant or merely coincidental (the book has a chapter dedicated to that too).", "Performance assessment in machine learning is hard. We need to decide on the metrics, the error estimation method, the best dataset to evaluate a learning algorithm and so on. Learning about the evaluation process is important because with this knowledge we can make informed decisions about the strategies to be employed (instead of always using cross-validation).", "That\u2019s the goal of the book. It was a great read and now I feel more confident to decide on the strategies to evaluate a model. You can check more details about the book here.", "Your home for data science.
