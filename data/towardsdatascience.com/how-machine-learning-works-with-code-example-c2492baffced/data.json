The model will learn patterns by itself, just by looking at data.", "To build the machine learning model yourself, open the companion notebook. You\u2019ll run real machine learning code without needing any set-up \u2014 it just works.", "There are lots of options when it comes to machine learning tooling. In this guide, we use some of the most popular and powerful machine learning libraries, namely:", "These are good tools to start with, since they\u2019re used by both beginners and huge companies (like J.P. Morgan).", "We\u2019ll use the famous \u201cTitanic\u201d dataset \u2014 a slightly morbid but fascinating dataset containing details of the passengers on the Titanic. We have a bunch of data for each passenger, including:", "Our data takes a standard form of rows and columns, where each row represents a passenger and each column an attribute of that passenger. Here\u2019s a sample:", "A few of the passengers that are in the titanic dataset", "Machine learning models are smart, but they can only be as smart as the data we feed them. Therefore an important first step is gaining a high-level understanding of our dataset.", "When it comes to analyzing the data, a good starting point is testing a hypothesis. People with first-class tickets were probably more likely to survive, so let\u2019s see if the data supports that.", "You can see and run the code to produce this visualization in the companion notebook.", "3rd class passangers had the worst survival rate, and 1st class passengers the best.", "Over 60% of the people in first class survived, while less than 30% of those in third class did.", "You might also have heard the phrase \u201cwomen and children first.\u201d Let\u2019s take a look at how gender and survival rate interact.", "Women were much more likely to survive than men.", "Again, we see that our hypothesis was right. Over 70% of women survived, while only around 20% of men did.", "Just like that, we\u2019ve created two basic visualizations of our dataset. We could do a lot more here (and for production machine learning projects, we certainly would). For example, multivariate analysis would show what happens when we look at more than a single variable at a time.", "Before we feed our data into a machine learning algorithm to train our model, we need to make it more meaningful to our algorithm. We can do this by ignoring some columns and reformatting others.", "We already know there will be no correlation between a passenger\u2019s ticket number and their chance of survival, so we can explicitly ignore that column. We delete it before feeding the data into the model.", "Some features are useful, but not in their raw form. For example, the labels \u201cmale\u201d and \u201cfemale\u201d are meaningful to a human but not to a machine, which prefers numbers. Therefore we can encode these markers as \u201c0\u201d and \u201c1\u201d respectively.", "Once we\u2019re done preparing our dataset, the format is more machine friendly. We\u2019ve provided a sample below: we\u2019ve eliminated many useless columns, and the columns that are left all use numbers.", "After preparing the dataset it\u2019s simpler and now ready for machine learning.", "Now we need to train our model and then test it. Just like school children are given examples of test questions as homework but then unseen questions under exam conditions, we\u2019ll train the machine learning algorithm on some of the data and then see how well it performs on the remainder.", "We split our dataset: One part for training the model, and one part for testing it.", "And now for the fun part!

In this step, we give the model both the data and the desired answers (whether or not the passenger survived.)", "The model learns patterns from this data.", "Our machine learning model is trained on the Training set.", "Now we can test our model by giving it only the details of the passengers in the other half of our dataset, without the answer. The algorithm doesn\u2019t know whether these passengers survived or not, but it will try to guess based on what it learned from the training set.", "Testing how well our machine learning model works by asking it to predict the results on the test data.", "To better understand how our model works, we can:", "The first helps us understand our data better, and the second helps us understand whether it\u2019s worth trying to source a larger dataset.", "Machine learning knows that not all data is equally interesting. By weighting particular details differently, it can make better predictions. The weights below show that gender is by far the most important factor in predicting survival rate.", "Our model relies mostly on gender, a bit on whether the passenger was in 3rd class or not and on the size of their family.", "We can also look at which aspects of the data the algorithm paid attention to when predicting the survival of a specific passenger. Below we see a passenger who the algorithm thought was very likely to survive. It paid special attention to the fact that:", "It lowered the chance of survival slightly because the passenger was also not in first class, resulting in a final survival prediction of 93%.", "How the model made a prediction for one particular passenger. She had a high survival rate because she was a women and not in 3rd class.", "Let\u2019s train the model multiple times, seeing how much it improves with more data. Here we plot both the training score and the test score. The latter is much more interesting, as it tells us how well the model performs on unseen data.", "The training score can be thought of as an \u201copen-book\u201d test: the model has already seen the answers, so it looks higher than the \u201cTest score\u201d but it\u2019s much easier for the model to perform well on data it saw during the training phase.", "More data makes our model better (test score). But after ~500 data points the improvement is minimal.", "Here we see that the more data the model has, the better it performs. This is much more noticeable at the start and thereafter adding more data results in only small improvements.", "Machine learning models don\u2019t have to be \u201cblack box\u201d algorithms.
