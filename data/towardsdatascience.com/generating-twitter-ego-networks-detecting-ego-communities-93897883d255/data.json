I\u2019m not sure what it says about a platform when it\u2019s used to complain about itself, but what I do know is it pulls you back in. Twitter is like Plato\u2019s cave where we see the shadows dancing except we are consciously facing it and are technically \u2018free\u2019 to turn away, but often don\u2019t. It\u2019s not all so dread and gloomy, we must admit Twitter allows us to house a micro-internet of sorts with some freedom to define our own custom rules as we act as a hub for incoming and outgoing connections. And as this hub grows \u2014 as we follow and are followed by more and more users \u2014 , it molds and mends into something personal, containing a mix of latent properties that explain our interests and even some parts of our personality. As a hub, we entertain and are entertained by a network that we have created over time: an Ego-Network (a term coming from sociology) with us as the focal point, extending our virtual limbs to touch and feel other egos and the elements of their own ego-networks.", "Regardless of your opinion on Twitter, it can be a rich dataset and this project aims to use that data to model and analyze a Twitter Ego-Network. To be able to perform more in-depth analysis we will have to complete some preliminary steps.

Unfortunately, it is not quick to mine given Twitter\u2019s rate limits which only allow a certain amount of calls for a given time window. To generate our network we need the following:", "Using a python library called Tweepy, which automatically waits to take into account rate-limits, we can get Twitter\u2019s API responses and store them into JSON files. The files can then be read and put into a data structure (Dictionaries or Pandas DataFrame) for the rest of our process.", "One of the most important steps with any data-science analysis is to give time and thought to how you will quantify the problem. Often, we tend to jump to models and algorithms when the underlying data and means we\u2019ve used to quantify our reality are weak.", "We are going to be making a 1-step Neighbourhood as it\u2019s called in sociology\u2014 in the sense that we will go only as deep as 2 layers of friends but with the condition that we will remove any friends of friends that are not the rootUser\u2019s friends. So, we will look at the rootUser\u2019s [my] friends and any connections between them. (A \u2018friend\u2019 of a user is twitter\u2019s official term to describe a person that the user \u2018follows\u2019). Since to build our network, we are more interested in what the rootUser \u2018sees\u2019 rather than how they are \u2018seen\u2019, we will look at their friends rather than their followers. The network will be a directed graph-based network (Figure 1), meaning we are dealing with nodes and directed edges primarily. The basic setup:", "While this comprises the basics of the network, we can intuitively see that each \u2018I\u2019m following you\u2019 relationship can\u2019t possibly have the same \u2018weight\u2019 \u2014 that uncle of yours who lives miles away that followed you 4 years ago as a means to be \u2018hip\u2019 has a very different role in your network than your mutual who retweets everything you ever do, ever, all the time. So we introduce some complexity in our network by modelling weights (for both edges and nodes). The assumption made in this project is weights are quantified by \u2018activity\u2019 (this will also play into the type of community detection we choose later as well).", "The terms w1, w2, w3, w4 were chosen intuitively to order the significance of each term (according to the way I interact with Twitter) \u2014 following was worth more than replying was worth more than quoting was worth more than retweeting\u2026", "The graph can be modelled using the python library i-graph or networkx. Networkx is good because it allows straight imports from Pandas Dataframe but there are more options for community detections algorithms on i-graph.

The followersCount distribution doesn\u2019t seem to peak, so there\u2019s a more uniform spread. Finally, most of our nodes have small weights with some users almost 10x more active than the average user in this network.", "In terms of edges, as expected, most users don\u2019t connect a lot and those that connect have a wide range in terms of the level (5\u2013100 # of retweets, replies) of their recent activity between each other.", "Final Network: Bringing it all together", "Now we have our network comprised of ~400 weighted nodes and ~10,000 edges (small but with complex relations).

But really, it will not take us long to realize we can\u2019t get a whole bunch of information out of this. At the moment, this is quite bland (literally, it\u2019s just black and white) and that\u2019s actually one of the challenges we face when dealing with complex networks \u2014 that you can\u2019t just \u2018eyeball\u2019 insights from them. Which is why before we can really do any significant analysis as a human analyst, we need to see the information \u2018clustered\u2019. Algorithmically, clustering the data will also help us for linguistic analysis down the road and is also often used to reduce computation time. A technique to help with this challenge is Community Detection \u2014 a powerful process (Figure 3) in which we segment a complex network into communities that categorize the graph structurally as well as depict some higher-order properties latent in the web-like mess you see in Figure 2.", "Now comes the colourful part (again, literally), how do we find the hidden communities within our network? I only have about 400-ish friends so if someone is suggesting taking a day and going through them, they\u2019re not \u2018wrong\u2019 per say\u2026 however, what if we wanted to step away from our human \u2018prejudice\u2019 and find communities more \u2018scientifically\u2019. If we begin manually categorizing users into communities, we\u2019d know exactly what to do, but in a much more real sense, we have no idea what to do. Difficult questions like \u2018how many communities are there in the first place?\u2019 and \u2018what\u2019s the criteria for community assignment?\u2019 come up. Therefore, though understandably we may lose some nuance if we use a computer for this categorization process but counter-intuitively, we may actually gain some nuance that our bias would not allow for.", "With data science, we are not always dealing with Data because \u2018humans can\u2019t possibly do it, it would take too long\u2019. Sometimes, data science is an art consisting of computable aerobic maneuvers that help us see data in a way we never quite could before. (Though often, data science is doing stuff that a person really shouldn\u2019t be doing with Excel. Though they try\u2026 they always try\u2026humans.) In this spirit we look towards an interesting algorithm to find communities based on \u2018information flow\u2019 \u2014 Infomap.", "Firstly, what is a community? The reason this has not been specifically defined is because part of the definition of \u2018community\u2019 will come from the community detection algorithm. Generically, categorization of information plays a big role in any philosophical or scientific investigations and communities are just that: categorization of nodes that organize knowledge.", "What we are essentially trying to capture with communities is to group similar Users together based on the phenomenon of homophily.", "\u201cIndividuals within interconnected clusters tend to share similar characteristics. This phenomenon is known as homophily and defined as \u201ca basic organizing principle\u201d that \u201ca contact between similar people occurs at a higher rate than among dissimilar people\u201d (McPherson, Smith-Lovin, & Cook, 2001, p. 416). Homophily, known broadly by the phrase \u201cbirds of a feather flock together,\u201d captures a key characteristic of naturally occurring social networks and depicts a mechanism through which \u201cdistance in terms of social characteristics translates into network distance\u201d (McPherson et al., 2001, p. 416). Put simply, homophily indicates that individuals are more likely to form new social network connections with others who are often very similar to them.\u201d", "\u2014 Classifying Twitter Topic-Networks Using Social Network Analysis", "More specifically, twitter ego-networks contain naturally occurring flow-based communities \u2014 naturally occurring as the \u2018flow of information\u2019 is not predetermined but is altered by the changes in the topological structure of the network. The nodes (users) establish themselves as carriers of information between nodes through the edges (retweets, replies, etc.). In this sense, when we are looking for communities, we are looking at flow-based methods of community detection so that \u201ccommunities consist of nodes among which \u001eflow [of information] persists for a long time once entered\u201d (Map Equation Framework Tutorial). This is different than cutting up a graph into blobs based on the structural composition of our network model. We will see more later on how a flow-based community detection algorithm may not always separate networks structurally.", "Infomap is a flow-based community search algorithm based on optimizing the \u2018map equation\u2019. I do not want to get overly technical here so will leave readers to explore on their own if interested, especially since the authors have made some phenomenal demos depicting the mechanisms of the map equation and have a written tutorial to guide you along.", "After some trials with Infomap, I found that though it categorized a lot of communities well, there was generally one large blob of nodes that it categorized together as a community that felt like \u2018left overs\u2019 nodes\u2014 users that quite possibly belong in multiple communities and contribute to a more complicated flow of information. To segment this large leftover community further, Walktrap, another community detection algorithm but one based more so on node-similarity and the structure of the network \u2014 nodes A and B are classified in the same community if the probability to get to all the other nodes from A and B separately are similar. Probability to get from one node to another is calculated using \u2018random walks\u2019 which also has a neat intuition behind it.", "Fundamentally, after applying these algorithms, our community detection takes the following organizing principle: Users are grouped together if tweets and follows (information and impressions) seems to persist within them \u2014 such that their activity among each other is high. As for the larger leftover group of Users (who have a regular activity among each other and flow of information does not persist among any specific smaller group of users), they are further segmented into mini-communities based on how similar their behaviour is within that larger group. Figure 4 displays a histogram of the community sizes in our network.", "An intuitive reason for why those two community definitions differ is we can have myself and my friend Qasim who do not retweet each other\u2019s takes (because that would be to admit defeat) constantly retweeting the takes of a third-party political analyst. A similarity-based detection would lump my friend and I in the same community (i.e. we have similar behaviour), a flow-based detection would not (i.e. information does not flow through our connection).", "The distribution highlights what seems to be intuitive (at least in the way I use Twitter): we have many small communities \u2014 usually structured around a specific taste/event/interest/topic \u2014 and then some major big players which in this case contain anywhere from 10\u201350 users.", "Note: Of course, some users have \u2018membership\u2019 in multiple (conceptual) communities in any given social network, but for this project, we will not deal with overlaps and multiple memberships. Partially, this is because I would like to see a User to be assigned to its most dominant community out of all those it belongs within, and partially, because it would make the computation unnecessarily complicated and I could not find convenient enough libraries to do said computation.", "And finally, we get out marvellous ego-network that looks like a buzzing 3-star hotel (If you get this reference, please also connect with me on Twitter immediately). Once again, node sizes depict node weights (how \u2018active\u2019 the user is) and edge thickness depicts the edge weights (how strongly connected 2 users are based on their activity with each other).", "FYI, the white dot to the right of the centre is me (as Nietzsche prophesied, I know nothing of myself\u2026 I am not even the centre of my own community\u2026). Speaking of egos, I think a part of us always wants to be analyzed and that kind of attention is not always easy to come by \u2014 so this is like a DIY version of getting attention. Having done this analysis on my personal network allows for me to compare the algorithmic output with my own human intuition and \u2014 following the example of some of my earlier projects \u2014 that\u2019s exactly what I intend to do. The rest of this post will highlight some methods of extracting insights from our network graph.", "Reminder that this is a community analysis of an \u201cego-network\u201d and therefore, not an objective classification of any given user on Twitter but a classification of the role they serve in my network from my perspective.", "Inter-related Position \u2014 When we are analyzing the communities, it is important to remember that the exact position of a node (south, north, east, west) does not really matter but it\u2019s relative position to other nodes is no accidental. Although these is some randomness involved in the visualization, it is actually modelled through a mixture of attraction, repulsion, and gravity forces. Therefore, strongly connected nodes will attract each other and non-connected nodes will repel.", "Intra-related Position \u2014 The position of nodes within the territory also matters. Nodes further from the central position and deeper into the community reflect more niche behaviour and information-flow properties.", "Density \u2014 More dense collection of nodes implies stronger interconnectivity. Sparsity implies weaker interconnectivity.", "Modularity \u2014 A measure of clustering quality, how disconnected communities are with each other. \u201cHighly modular networks are characterized by a few highly intraconnected clusters that are loosely interconnected.

Sometimes these are mis-categorizations, sometimes far off bridge nodes.", "These two communities generally contain my personal connections or friends (\u2018followings\u2019) of them that I followed, separated between my dominantly high school connections and ones outside high school. Therefore, it is understandable that they are dense (i.e. strong intraconnections). I see an interesting spatial representation with my high-school connections put away from the centre and thus away from the rest of my generic network (i.e. in the twitter world, we\u2019ve grown apart, understandably, some of them are not even active). The ones I interact with more often among this community are closer to my node. Furthermore, stronger friends (or those I know to be at least) also appear more closer to each other, relatively compared to others in the community. Overall, these are strong, well-defined community and agree with the real system \u2014 this segment of the Network has strong modularity.", "Another strong community, strategically centred a little further from my personal connections. This community contains mostly Toronto/Canadian users of varying topics.

While as we go north, we get more activist/journalist/political-commentary folks like \u2018@DesmondCold\u2019 and \u2018@stevenzhou\u2019. Nodes like \u2018@IRCanada\u2019, \u2018@NaseehaHelpline\u2019, and \u2018@IngridMattson\u2019 are good examples of users that are structurally closer to this community (and Canadian) but in terms of flow are more involved with another community. Overall, the cluster is loosely connected to the rest of the network with loose intra-connections other than some mini groups. This implies the community is not too closed off and contains varying connections with my more central network.", "This is the largest spanning community (area wise) and it\u2019s immediately obvious why \u2014 we have many users that float out into the territories of other communities. I call this community the \u2018main act\u2019 \u2014 and I feel every twitter User has a community akin to this in some regard \u2014 because many of my other communities \u2018watch\u2019 this community, sort of like a play.", "The community in pink \u2014 the misfits, which I do not mean in any derogatory way \u2014 is a weak community. These Users are not deep enough actors in the information flow with the communities structurally close to them and so seem to be classified together haphazardly.

Similar to how we\u2019ve talked about Bridge Nodes that act as links between various communities, there are nodes that act as Exposure Nodes that expose us to a new community. If we see the network as it grows through time, we can take note of some of these specific nodes. We can also some patterns of how this specific ego-network grows.", "Theres a nice pattern that can be observed in this manner of growth: we see modular areas of the network (highly intraconnected) have a high growth rate in a given time period and then reduce to a low while non-modular areas steadily accumulate once they begin. We also see that \u2018exposure nodes\u2019 (those that introduce us to a community) are not necessarily \u2018central\u2019 nodes of that community but bridge nodes.
