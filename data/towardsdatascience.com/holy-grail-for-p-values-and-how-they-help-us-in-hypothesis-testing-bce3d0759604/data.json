The scientists have developed two vaccine strains- A and B and\u2026"}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["This post will decode the following concepts, using examples all along the way:", "Let\u2019s suppose that there are multiple vaccines being developed in a medical lab in order to be able to treat coronavirus successfully. The scientists have developed two vaccine strains- A and B and now they have to determine their effectiveness.", "So, in the first trial, they tested both the vaccines on one infected person each. The result came out as the person who was given vaccine A got cured but the one who was given vaccine B was not cured from the infection.", "Now, can we say that vaccine A is better than B? No, we cannot. Because this is just one person trial which leaves a lot of things to chance. Maybe a person who was given vaccine A had a strong placebo effect or the person who was given vaccine B was already a cardiovascular patient and allergic to one of the components of the vaccine B. Myriad number of things can happen. So, the inference in total is that we CANNOT say vaccine A is better than vaccine B based on a sample size of one.", "Now, let\u2019s suppose the scientists proceeded with another trial. This time they performed the test on two persons each for both the vaccines.", "Result- Both the people given vaccine A got cured and one person given vaccine B was cured. Now, can we say with confidence that vaccine A is better than vaccine B?", "No, we still cannot say this as the chance elements that we talked about in the one person experiment apply here also. The sample size is still too small to infer anything conclusive.", "Moving on, the trial was performed on a whole lot of bunch of people.", "Now, let\u2019s look at multiple result scenarios.", "In the first scenario shown in the image, notice that the cure rate is 99.7% for vaccine A but only 0.001% for that of the vaccine B. Now, let\u2019s assume that by chance a lot of positive attitude centrist people got clubbed in the trial group for vaccine A leading to placebo effect and a lot of allergic people got clubbed in the trial for vaccine B, which might have caused reactions in their bodies leading to non-abatement of their symptoms or any other random event could\u2019ve occurred that might have worked in favor of vaccine A and against the vaccine B. But, since we can see here that the trial group size was sufficiently large, thus, leaving aside a few random chance events, there are just too many success events corresponding to vaccine A and too many failure events corresponding to vaccine B. This result does give us the confidence to infer that the vaccine A is significantly different from vaccine B and it can be proclaimed as the better one out of the two.", "Now, look at the second result scenario where the cure rates of the vaccine A and B are 37% and 29% respectively. Now, looking at just these percentages, can you confidently claim about one vaccine being definitely better than the other one?", "No, we cannot because over here it not a ~0% and ~100% rates like the first scenario.", "All the real-life situations that we encounter in analytics world are more on the line of the second scenario where mere human judgement is not enough! And here we turn towards statistics for help!", "What do we say to the god of confusion? Not Today :D (Haha! for the uninitiated fellows, this was a lame, small GoT reference).", "Instead the intelligent god of statistics hands us over the P-Value as an important tool in our arsenal which can be employed in situations like these.", "It\u2019s a number between 0 and 1 that quantifies how confident we should be that vaccine A is different from vaccine B. The closer the value is to 0, the more confident we are that the two vaccines are significantly different from one another.", "Now, the question arises, how small the P-value should be to make us confident enough? The standard alpha value is generally taken to be as 0.05", "Statistically significant difference is proved if:", "In scenario 2 above, we see that we have a p-value=0.24, which is obviously not less than 0.05, thus we conclude that the two vaccines are not significantly different from each other.", "Remember that a small p-value does NOT tell us how much difference is there in A and B. For example, p value=0.04 just tells us that A and B are significantly different but doesn\u2019t tell us how much difference is there (difference might be tiny, it might be huge)", "If we take a scenario where we are testing two vaccines which are actually the two same samples from a single vaccine, thus they are NOT different from one another. Still, we proceed on to testing these samples with an alpha value of 5% then that implies that 95% of the times we\u2019ll get p-value>0.05 which will confirm that these two vaccines are not different but for the rest of the 5% times due to a bunch of random reasons, we might get a p-value<0.05 which will indicate an erroneous result of course, and this is what a FALSE POSITIVE is. (Example- A pregnancy test turns out to be positive but the lady was not pregnant actually, a patient gets a biopsy report as malignant whereas the tumor was benign - cases of false positives)", "So, an alpha value of 5% dictates that out of 100 times, 5 times we\u2019ll get a False positive.", "Now, if we are working with aeronautical sciences or biological sciences, where precision matters a lot, you cannot let a lot of false positives occur, then in these scenarios, we have to use an alpha value of let\u2019s say 0.00001 which implies that out of 100,000 times only 1 time we\u2019ll get a false positive. This kind of precision comes at very high cost and that\u2019s the reason very few industries/use cases demand an alpha value less than 0.05.", "Similarly, if you encounter a liberal use case like the arrival of a garbage truck within 30 minutes past 8 AM every morning, we can allow an alpha value upto 0.2 or 20% also.", "Thus, the general accepted value of 0.05 has been generalized for the fact that it fits a lot of use cases but it can and should be tweaked in cases that do not adhere to this level of confidence requirement.", "Let\u2019s touch base upon hypothesis testing now as we have covered its premise already. I have encountered many complex articles on this topic but now that you have read the vaccine example, it\u2019ll a piece of cake for you, read on!", "See, easy-peasy explanations do exist for these intimidating and daunting statistical terms!!", "With this, we have come to the end of this post and if you are interested you can also check out my other posts on statistics and machine learning, all of them have my hand-drawn illustrations, easy examples and lots of learning :)", "Take care!
