With the rise of data downtime and the increasing complexity of the data stack, observability has emerged as a critical concern for data teams, too.", "Developer Operations (lovingly referred to as DevOps) teams have become an integral component of most engineering organizations. DevOps teams remove silos between software developers and IT, facilitating the seamless and reliable release of software to production.", "As organizations grow and the underlying tech stacks powering them become more complicated (think: moving from a monolith to a microservice architecture), it\u2019s important for DevOps teams to maintain a constant pulse on the health of their systems. Observability, a more recent addition to the engineering lexicon, speaks to this need, and refers to the monitoring, tracking, and triaging of incidents to prevent downtime.", "As a result of this industry-wide shift to distributed systems, observability engineering has emerged as a fast-growing engineering discipline. At its core, observability engineering is broken into three major pillars:", "(For a more detailed description of these, I highly recommend reading Cindy Sridharan\u2019s landmark post, Monitoring and Observability).", "Taken together, these three pillars give DevOps teams valuable insights to predict future behavior, and in turn, trust their system to meet SLAs. Abstracted to your bottom line, reliable software means reliable products, which leads to happy users.", "Even with the best-in-class observability solutions on tap, however, no amount of fancy tooling or engineering jargon can make customers happy if your data isn\u2019t reliable.", "As a VP of Customer Success Operations at Gainsight, I was responsible for leading a team that compiled a weekly report to our CEO outlining customer data and analytics. Time and again, we\u2019d deliver a report, only to be notified minutes later about issues with our data. It didn\u2019t matter how strong our pipelines were or how many times we reviewed our SQL: our data just wasn\u2019t reliable.", "Unfortunately, this problem wasn\u2019t unique to Gainsight. After speaking with over 100s of data leaders about their biggest pain points, I learned that data downtime tops the list. Data downtime \u2014 periods of time when data is partial, erroneous, missing, or otherwise inaccurate \u2014 only multiplies as data systems become increasingly complex, supporting an endless ecosystem of sources and consumers.", "For data engineers and developers, data downtime means wasted time and resources; for data consumers, it erodes confidence in your decision making. Like me, the leaders I talked to couldn\u2019t trust their data, and that was a serious problem.", "Instead of putting together a holistic approach to address data downtime, teams often tackle data quality and lineage problems on an ad hoc basis. Much in the same way DevOps applies observability to software, I think it\u2019s about time we leveraged this same blanket of diligence for data.", "Data Observability, an organization\u2019s ability to fully understand the health of the data in their system, eliminates data downtime by applying best practices of DevOps Observability to data pipelines. Like its DevOps counterpart, Data Observability uses automated monitoring, alerting, and triaging to identify and evaluate data quality and discoverability issues, leading to healthier pipelines, more productive teams, and happier customers.", "To make it easy, I\u2019ve broken down Data Observability into its own five pillars: freshness, distribution, volume, schema, and lineage. Together, these components provide valuable insight into the quality and reliability of your data.", "Thanks to DevOps, we have an easy lens with which to view the importance of observability as applied data. By surfacing data downtime incidents as soon as they arise, the five pillars of Data Observability provide the holistic framework necessary for true end-to-end reliability.", "As with traditional DevOps Observability tools, the best Data Observability solutions will not just monitor these pillars, but prevent bad data from entering them in the first place.", "We believe that a great Data Observability solution has the following characteristics:", "Moreover, when issues do arise, these tools will alert your team before anyone else. Yes, even your CEO.", "If you want to learn more, reach out to Barr Moses or visit montecarlodata.com", "Interested in joining the Data Reliability movement?
