Not for me, anyway. If I don\u2019t keep using it, I lose it. I need to keep the little grey cells active before they forget the important R functions or syntax they spent time learning.", "I find this particularly hard as my R work is spread so widely. I might build a quick ML model every three or four weeks, basic data wrangling, EDA, data visualisation and some regressions a few times a week, some unsupervised learning every fortnight and maybe a sentiment analysis or geo-mapping project every couple of months. I don\u2019t mind admitting that I do forget a few things.", "For news from the space where marketing meets data science, follow Chris on Twitter", "There are also plenty of days when I don\u2019t spend any time using R or doing anything that might be called data science at all. As a digital marketer, my job description covers a lot of ground, and most of it isn\u2019t data science. When you add in a couple of R-free days a week, keeping on top of knowing a language can get a bit tricky.", "To try and fend of the brain drain \u2014 as well as force myself out of my comfort zone \u2014 every so often I like to set myself a little challenge: something that just gets me thinking a little bit about how to go about accomplishing a few little things in R. The sort of techniques that come in useful now and again.", "This weekend, I had been thinking about writing a quick article about animating plots in R using the gganimate package. Thinking about what I might want to plot, I started thinking about a simple line plot that showed the finishing positions of my Heriot\u2019s team against their nemesis Watsonians in the Scottish Rugby league over time.", "The more I thought about that though, the more I thought that it might be too easy. All that would happen is that I\u2019d end up hand-creating a couple of vectors of finishing positions from some manual data-mining, and copying and pasting the code from something else and altering it to fit my data. Where\u2019s the fun in that?", "So, the challenge became to animate a bar plot \u2014 by year, not interpolated between zero and end values \u2014 that showed the number of times the top flight had been won by the sides that had won it. That was a slightly different challenge, but ended up being good practice!", "While this might seem simplistic for all y\u2019all regular userRs, a quick hour or two with an exercise like this can be just the thing for us coding part-timers. Interestingly, this exercise ended up not being challenging in terms of the code, it was the process. Once I had how I wanted to accomplish things straight in my head, the coding bit probably only took 15 minutes or so. I guess it all comes back to PPPPPP\u2026", "The first step was to get the data. This was gathered from the Wikipedia page on the Scottish Premiership. While I could have manually typed in a vector of winners, that\u2019s not really a scalable solution, and wouldn\u2019t have reinforced my previous rvest learnings, so let\u2019s scrape it instead. Huge thanks to the handy SelectorGadget for help here.", "That just gave us an annoying single character string of winning clubs, so the next step is to break that up:", "With a vector of winning teams created, it\u2019s time to turn that into the dataframe we need to work with.", "We\u2019ve got a vector of winners, we now need a vector of years to match them to:", "Now we can start to build the dataframe with our years, winners, and we\u2019ll rename our winners column as it\u2019s become a bit ugly:", "The way I had planned to go about this was to create a dataframe with a column corresponding to each club that had won the title, that I could use to build a cumulative sum of wins. First, we needed a vector of title-winning clubs:", "We could then use that vector to add the the columns to our dataframe. Let\u2019s also take the opportunity to turn that into a new dataframe so we\u2019ve got the chance to wipe the slate clean at this point if we make a mess of it all:", "The new columns created, I wanted to convert that to a tidy format so I could take advantage of the handy functions of the tidyverse. To do that, I wanted to use the gather() function from tidyr to turn my multiple \u2018club\u2019 columns into one column for club, featuring each club for each year:", "That built, I could use a mutate call to add a 1 in the win column when the club in the club column matched the club in the winner column, then I could group by the club and use another mutate call to build a column for cumulative wins:", "Dataframe complete, it was time to build the plots and the animation.Huge thanks go to Fronkonstin for this blog post that helped me with the animating bit of the process.", "I began by creating a test plot using a single year\u2019s data and ggplot2 to build the type of plot I was looking for. With that done, I was ready to build a plot for each year in the dataset and save it to my project folder. If you\u2019re not a fan of for loops, look away now:", "A folder full of plots later, we can use the image_animate() function from the magick package to assemble the individual images into our animated .gif:", "Is this the type of dataviz I would have chosen for this dataset? Probably not. I mean, it would depend on the audience. For an attention span-limited social media settting it might work, but a standard barplot would show the final win numbers more clearly, and a GitHub commits-style heatmap combined with end-of-line totals might have made it easier to see the final numbers as well as when titles were won, but that wasn\u2019t the point.", "The point of this exercise was to set myself the sort of challenge that wouldn\u2019t come up in my day-to-day work and try and solve it. And, while there are still some tweaks I might make (colour coding the bars to the club colours perhaps?), I don\u2019t think it\u2019s too bad for a lazy Sunday.
