As the country with the fastest-growing middle class in Southeast Asia, this phenomenal growth rate in its retail sector is expected to continue at least for the next five years. The following key statistic was reported by Deloitte Vietnam in its report on Vietnam Retail 2019:", "According to this report, although Vietnam\u2019s retail sector holds immense potential for growth, the level of competition is intense. With different store formats: commercial centers, supermarkets, grocery stores, and convenience stores, domestic and foreign retail giants in Vietnam are engaging in a battle for dominance as they embark on aggressive expansion strategies. At the same time, despite the rise of digital channels, physical channels continue to dominate the retail scene.", "Therefore, an interesting question to ask is (1) how is the current retail footprint of these retail giants in Vietnam, and (2) which province/city/district should be the next target for new stores. Who would be interested in answering these questions? The answer is the retail giants in Vietnam, as well as any new players who plan to enter the Vietnam retail market.", "For the analysis, the following data was obtained to perform the analysis:", "Regarding the major retail chains, the following Supermarket, Convenience stores (CVS) and Grocery store chains, which are reported by Deloitte report on Vietnam retail landscape, are included in this analysis:", "Note: Shop&Go and Auchan chain were included in Deloitte report, however:", "Therefore, they were not included in the analysis with the assumption that after the acquisition, these stores are rebranded and included in the acquirer store chain.", "Among all the data for this analysis, Administrative Division and Census data are in a structured format, requiring no further data cleaning and formatting. In contrast, the store data scraped from websites of major retailers are not structured, having grammar mistakes, duplicate records and poor quality. For this store list, the following steps were taken before the data is ready for further analysis:", "Using the folium library, the following map of Vietnam was built using the data above to reflect the distribution of stores:", "Explanatory data analysis (EDA) was conducted to gain further understanding of the dataset and to select data features for the clustering model.", "For this project, the K-Means Clustering method will be used to profile provinces/districts based on the retail footprint and statistical census. From Toward Data Science, K-Means Clustering is an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, attempting to classify data without having first been trained with labeled data. Since the purpose of this project is to understand the retail footprint across different Administrative Division in Vietnam, this method is selected.", "To identify the optimum number of clusters in this analysis, we will evaluate the relationship between the number of clusters and Within Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS) to select the number of clusters where the change in WCSS begins to level off (elbow method).", "From the EDA conducted in section 2, I select the variables that have a low correlation (-0.5,0.5) to others as the input for the clustering model. The following variables were selected: population density, urbanization level, human development index (HDI), income per capita, and the number of stores in each category located in each province (supermarket, CVS, etc.). Using the elbow method, three is the best number of clusters for this analysis:", "Using three as the number of clusters, I obtained the three clusters as follow:", "An overview of the three clusters on the input variables used in the clustering process is presented below.", "In this graph, we can see the separation between three clusters: cluster #0 \u2014 blue, cluster #1 \u2014 brown, and cluster #2 \u2014 purple. Within cluster #2, we can identify provinces with great population density and income per person but have a low number of stores compared to other provinces in the same cluster.", "The most interesting cluster in the analysis is cluster 2, where multiple cities/provinces with similar status (area, population, density, etc.) but have very different numbers of retail stores available. Reviewing the list of provinces classified as cluster 2, some interesting observation can be drawn, for example:", "With this result, the question now is \u201cSo what? How can this information help anyone?\u201d. As described in the beginning of this post, this analysis is originally aimed to target the major retail chains, or any companies interested in entering this market in Vietnam. Conducting a clustering analysis similar to this one and identify clusters similar to cluster 2 in this analysis can help these companies to find potential markets, where demand and growth are not fully captured.", "Of course, this analysis is extremely simple and naive, not accounting for several different factors of the retail market in each province. Some of the following limitations in this analysis are great opportunities for me to further expand this analysis and gain more insights:", "More detail and interactive maps of this analysis can be access using this link: myGithub", "Of course, please feel free to share your valuable comments on this analysis. I would love to see your thought and opinion on this project and its results.", "Your home for data science.
