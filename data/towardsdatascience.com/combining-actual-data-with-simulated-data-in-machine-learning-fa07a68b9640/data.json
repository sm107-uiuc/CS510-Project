By generating replicated copies of the sample dataset, we can estimate the sample mean across different populations to ensure that the mean value is stable. We can also estimate the variance (uncertainty) in the prediction of the mean value.", "In order to simulate data from a given sample data, we need to be able to identify patterns in the sample data and also have some knowledge about the features and how they are distributed. For example, if I have a small sample of male heights, and I know that heights follow a normal distribution, I could generate a dataset of male heights using the following:", "This article will discuss how Monte-Carlo (MC) simulation can be used for generating approximate replicated copies of the sample dataset. Each of these blocks of datasets is then trained. Then the overall performance of the model is then calculated by performing an ensemble average over the data blocks including actual and simulated data.", "Introduction: Predicting the status of a loan is an important problem in risk assessment. A bank or financial organization has to be able to estimate the risk involved before granting a loan to a customer. Data Science and predictive analytics play an important role in building models that can be used for predicting the probability of loan default. In this project, we are provided with the loan_timing.csv dataset containing 50000 data points. Each data point represents a loan, and two features are provided as follows:", "Project Objective: The goal of this project is to use techniques of data science to estimate what fraction of these loans (50,000 customer records in the loan_timing.csv dataset) will have charged off during the 3-year loan term.", "The dataset and R code for this article can be downloaded from this repository: https://github.com/bot13956/Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Loan_Status.", "Because there is randomness associated with the charge-off of a loan, we see that MC simulation provides a good approximation for the distribution of defaulted loans.", "Predictions: Since we have demonstrated that the relationship between days to charge-off and days since origination in the first 2 years (i.e. 0 to 730 days) can be approximated using an MC simulation, we can predict the fraction of loans that will be charged off by the time all of their 3-year terms are finished using MC simulation.", "The total number of charged-off loans in our dataset is 3,305. This means that there are 46,695 loans that are currently active. Of these active loans, a certain proportion will default over the 3-year period. To estimate the total fraction of defaulted loans, we simulated defaulted loans with charge-off and days since origination covering the entire duration of the loan (i.e. 0 to 1095 days), then by appropriate scaling, we computed the fraction of loans that will have charged off after the 3-year term i.e., 1095 days.", "By creating N = 1000 random trials, we obtained the following distribution for the fraction of defaulted loans 3-year term:", "Figure 6: Histogram for fraction of charged-off loans after 3-year term using N = 1000 samples.", "Based on our calculations, the 95% confidence interval for the fraction of loans that will have charged off after the 3-year loan duration is accordingly 14.8% +/- 0.2%. So if 50,000 loans were given out with a loan term of 3 years, approximately 15% of these loans will default.", "Conclusions: We have presented a simple model based on the MC simulation for predicting the fraction of loans that will default at the end of the 3-year loan duration period. Monte Carlo simulation is an important method that can be used in prescriptive analytics for the prescribing course of action to be taken in cases where the dataset is very stochastic in nature.", "The dataset and R code for this article can be downloaded from this repository: https://github.com/bot13956/Monte_Carlo_Simulation_Loan_Status.", "Your home for data science.
