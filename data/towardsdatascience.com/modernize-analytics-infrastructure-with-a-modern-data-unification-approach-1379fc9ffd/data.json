ETL which became increasingly popular in the 1970s has been a core concept for building data warehouses ever since. Extracting data from sources to transform it into a format or structure that fits nicely in a data warehouse for analysis. However the ever-growing volume of data started to impact the performance of data warehouses and ETL processes, that is why we now know \u201cthe data lake use case\u201d. When data volumes increased, the process of transforming the data became a bottleneck for building a proper data warehouse. Instead of transforming the data with an ETL, a lot of enterprises started efforts to store and process unstructured or raw data. What if we combined the strengths of the traditional ETL with the lessons learned from \u201cthe data lake use case\u201d? What would this mean to the Data Unification approach?", "Structured and processed data is the biggest benefit ETL provides. Although the costs of development and maintenance are high, in most cases the output of a well thought out ETL process is perceived as a reliable and \u201chigh-quality\u201d when used as a source for reporting. Most ETL procedures are tailormade for business professionals, based on business requirements, the ETL is build to get the right data, to the right user. Security can be noted as mature, you will only get access to what you need and Schema-on-write processing creates a structure that is SQL-based and easy to interpret by business professionals for reporting purposes.", "Schema-on-write is the standard for ETL, However, when you want to store and process unstructured data, this will become a problem. Schema-on-read is reversing the process by applying the data to a schema when pulling the data from the \u201cData Lake\u201d, and use cases with this method are becoming increasingly popular. When using Schema-on-read you load data as-is into the \u201cData Lake\u201d. By doing so you can centralize the data and start building parts of your business logic on top of all data, while ETL requires creating an \u201c\u00fcber-schema\u201d or building pre-defined subject-areas to get the data in, which on its turn requires a heavy upfront modeling exercise.", "With the modernization of SQL-based data warehouse technology, most of the Data Lake use cases are covered. The storage costs for data warehouse compute power and storage went down and the new-generation MPP (Massively Parallel Processing) databases, make full use of cloud scalability. Therefore storing and processing large datasets does not require large upfront investments anymore, you can start small and scale as you grow. When it comes to functionality, in for example a Snowflake data warehouse you can now, store semi-structured or raw data in a Variant type, and apply the schema in a later stage. This used to be the main reason to store data in a Data Lake, Snowflake now manages to handle most types of unstructured data and enables to query them with SQL, together with all available structured SQL-based data. Physically making the switch to a full-blown Data Lake solution requires complex mapping, transformation, and integration between the infrastructure components of the structured and the semi-structured data, therefore many of these costly Data Lake migration projects have failed in recent years. We have now come to a point where a Modern Cloud Analytics Infrastructure can facilitate the whole \u201cAnalytics Workload\u201d and serve most Data Lake use cases.", "Setting up a Modern Analytics Instructure starts with collecting all data sources and loading the data into the central data warehouse. When we use a modern cloud data warehouse, we can now harness on-demand compute power for on-the-fly-transformation. When you run a report, a SQL-query with the transformation logic will be executed on the data warehouse. Instead of running heavy ETL procedures, that are scheduled after office hours because of the performance impact (does bring a nice surprise element to work every morning, to see if data is actually loaded), we can now start to define our views on top of all available data.", "This is where collaboration in a Modern Data Unification process starts. Together with the business professional, the business needs and logic can now be determined, from a basic set of views. By enabling the business professionals to see the actual data in an early stage, you can harness their implicit knowledge of the data model and business logic. Their involvement will not only help them to get through \u201cthe evolution of the data-driven company\u201d, but it will also eventually make them understand how their self-service efforts can enhance reporting. This is completely different from the traditional data unification process, which required the business to communicate their data needs through functional design specifications. A business intelligence consultant in this process will always have to translate and build a pipeline based on a topic, which filters out, aggregates and cleans the data while knowing that at the same time, this will probably create a silo within the data warehouse, with a pre-determined inflexible subset of reports on top of it.", "Modernizing Analytics Infrastructure does not only require cloud technology expertise, but it also requires a change of approach. Involving the advanced business professional with SQL-based technology is a straightforward way to enhance data culture, get precious input for model development, and can eventually help to create a collaborative data unification environment. The tools to do so are already there, but we need to build trust in \u201cSchema last\u201d. When the business professional is served with data from a centralized, single source of truth, developing and expanding the business logic can finally be done at the same pace as the amounts of data are growing.", "Your home for data science.
