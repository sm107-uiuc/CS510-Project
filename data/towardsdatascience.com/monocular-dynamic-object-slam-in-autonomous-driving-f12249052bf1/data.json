Even for practical SLAM systems that are able to run in dynamic environments, they usually treat dynamic objects as outliers and try to filter them out to get a static environment before applying the conventional SLAM pipeline. This severely limits its online application in autonomous driving where explicit handling of dynamic objects is critical.", "Monocular dynamic object SLAM (MonoDOS) extends conventional SLAM methods in two ways. It is object-aware in that it detects and tracks not only keypoints but also objects with higher-level semantic meaning. It is also dynamic in that it can handle scenes with dynamic objects and tracks the motion of these objects.", "It may be good to keep in mind that not all object SLAM systems are dynamic, and not all dynamic SLAM systems are object-aware. The seminal work of object SLAM is SLAM++ (CVPR 2013) but it still requires a static scene with static objects. Some dynamic SLAM systems improve pose estimation based on the rigid body and constant velocity constraint, but without the explicit notion of objects.", "This post reviews several state-of-the-art papers in the field of dynamic object SLAM. It mainly focuses on monocular methods, and some stereo ones which can be modified to a monocular setup. This is by no means an exhaustive review, and let me know if you recommend other relevant studies.", "The dynamic object SLAM system introduces the notion of an object, and this has several implications. First, it needs to have an object proposal stage from a single frame, just as the keypoint proposal stage in conventional SLAM systems (such as ORB in ORB-SLAM). This stage will give 2D or 3D object detection results. Recent advances in monocular 3D object detection will shine here. Second, it has a more complicated data association. Static SLAM only cares about keypoints and data association just means keypoint matching across frames with feature vectors. Now we introduced the notion of objects, we have to also perform data association between keypoints and object in each frame, and objects across frames. Third, as a natural extension to the bundle adjustment in conventional SLAM, now we have to add tracked objects (tracklets) and dynamic keypoints on these objects, optionally with a velocity constraint from an assumed motion model.", "I made the following chart to capture the three fundamental elements of dynamic object SLAM. The green block captures the Data Association process, the blue block captures the Bundle Adjustment process, and red squares are the factors to be optimized in the factor graph representation of Bundle Adjustment.", "With the three fundamental elements in mind, we can ask the question: why does the introduction of dynamic objects in SLAM work? First of all, the objects are assumed to be rigid bodies with fixed shapes and sizes over time. The objects are also assumed to have a simple and physically plausible motion model that encourages smooth pose changes over time. Thus both the object size and pose changes can be described by a small number of parameters. On the other hand, the introduction of objects can formulate a larger number of constraints in the bundle adjustment stage. The introduction of M objects in N frames largely adds O(M) unknowns and O(MN) constraints.This makes the SLAM problem more robust.", "In the following review session of each paper, I will go through the above three fundamental elements in each work.", "This is perhaps the most well-rounded work in dynamic object SLAM. One main contribution of cubeSLAM is the elegant way it integrated the size and location of the cuboid into the factor graph optimization. It also uses a motion model to constrain possible movement of cuboids and thus optimizes the velocity of objects as well. Under this formulation, 3D object detection and SLAM can benefit each other. Object provide geometry and scale constraints for BA, and depth initialization. It can also add to generalization capability to let orb slam work in low-texture environments. The mono3D results are optimized with BA and constraint by a motion model.", "The paper uses 2D object detection and low-level image features for 3D cuboid proposal generation and scoring. The seemingly naive method works surprisingly well for both chairs and cars. But I am sure deep learning-based methods will produce much better results in this field.", "As mentioned in the overview, data association has to be performed throughout multiple levels, including point-point, point-object and object-object.", "Static keypoints are jointly optimized with camera pose, with camera-point error or reprojection error in the same way as ORB-SLAM. After getting the best 3D proposal from each frame, we can treat it as a 9DoF 3D \u201cmeasurement\u201d and formulate the bundle adjustment problem. For static objects, we have the following error terms.", "Note that this 2D-3D consistently assumption is not always right, but is close enough most of the time for the typical viewpoint (horizontal or slightly looking down) of onboard cameras in autonomous driving.", "For dynamic objects, cube SLAM assumes that dynamic objects are rigid bodies following a physically feasible motion model. This introduces two additional error terms.", "CubeSLAM can generate some quite impressive demo, detecting and tracking 3D objects in dynamic scenes with temporally consistent cuboids in KITTI. Yet SLAM results may not always outperform monocular proposals. It can also estimate a dynamic object\u2019s speed profile roughly within 1 m/s, even with a piecewise constant motion assumption. Note that object constraints are considered when calculating odometry (camera pose).", "This study is based on a stereo video stream, but the framework can be extended to monocular SLAM. The main contribution of the paper is to demonstrate the ability to detect and track truncated 3D objects with a video that would be otherwise hard to detect on a single image.", "The pipeline is inspired by Deep3DBox (CVPR 2017, see my review post on its detailed formulation). It uses 2D bounding box from object detection and 8 viewpoint classification. It uses a shape dimension prior to infer object distance. This makes the pipeline general enough to be used in a monocular setting.", "Keypoints outside the object contour are counted as the static keypoints. Static keypoints and camera pose are jointly optimized with camera-point error in the same way as ORB-SLAM. After the camera pose (or ego-motion) is solved, the object poses are solved. The dynamic object BA has four error terms.", "S3DOT demonstrates quite impressive results which detects and tracks 3D object on dynamic scenes in KITTI. Note that object constraints are not considered when calculating odometry (camera pose).", "The authors of S3DOT released another work in CVPR 2020, ST3D: Joint Spatial-Temporal Optimization for Stereo 3D Object Tracking. This work heavily leverages deep learning for 3D detection proposal with deep learning and then performs joint spatial-temporal optimization.", "ClusterVO proposed a more general way for dynamic SLAM, by representing objects as clusters of tracked keypoints (or point landmarks in the paper).", "ClusterVO uses YOLOv3 as the 2D object detector to propose semantic 2D bounding boxes for objects in each frame. It does not assume that objects can be described by cuboids such as cubeSLAM or S3DOT. Therefore there is no cuboid generation stage.", "ClusterVO performs a quite complex scheme of data association. It can be viewed as a two-step process, a Multi-level Probabilistic Association to associate observed keypoints with tracked landmarks and associate bounding boxes with tracked clusters, followed by a heterogeneous CRF which associate the tracked landmarks to tracked clusters.", "After the probabilistic data association, we can formulate the BA for static scenes and dynamic clusters. It uses a sliding window with a specially designed double-track frame management to manage keyframes.", "ClusterVO is a more general approach to dynamic object SLAM. From the results on KITTI dynamic scenes, the cuboid quality is not as good as this is estimated in the postprocess step of the landmark cluster. For autonomous driving, CubeSLAM and S3DOT seem more practical. Note that object constraints are considered when optimizing odometry (camera pose).", "The notion of \u201cmultibody mono SLAM\u201d seems to come from \u201cmultibody SfM\u201d, but it essentially has the same meaning as dynamic object SLAM.", "MoMoSLAM uses a quite heavy but accurate 3D object proposal pipeline. It uses shape prior and keypoint to lift 2D detection to 3D shapes. It first detects k=36 ordered keypoints on distinguishable features of a vehicle, and also deformation coefficients for a list of basis shapes. Then the 2D detections are lifted to 3D by minimizing reprojection error to get 6 DoF pose and shape parameter. This is used by the authors in a previous publication The Earth ain\u2019t Flat (IROS 2018), and very similar to RoI-10D (CVPR 2019).", "MoMoSLAM uses a different formulation of optimization. Instead of specifying each error term and minimize them, MoMoSLAM enforces consistency for each cycle created in the pose graph, as shown above. But in essence, this should be equivalent to the minimization of least square errors.", "I feel the cycle consistency is a bit contrived, especially the vehicle-vehile edge. It would be much more straighforward to add an error item enouraging the consistency between the distance estimation between IPM and 2D-to-3D lifting.", "The method used by MoMoSLAM to fix the metric scale for the monocular setup is quite useful. Note that object constraints are not considered when calculating odometry (camera pose).", "Your home for data science.
