Handwritten character classification in general is a challenging task because there are innumerable ways in which any character can be written.", "Neural networks have although redefined this task and also play a huge role in developing such classifiers, provided they are fed with a huge amount of data for it to be trained.", "In this particular blog, we will explore the Russian alphabets and classify them in their handwritten form.", "In the data set, we have got 14190 colored images distributed among 3 image folders, consisting of all 33 categories of Russian alphabets.", "The first folder has striped backgrounds (with few horizontal and/or vertical lines), the second folder has white backgrounds and the third one has graph type backgrounds (with many ordered horizontal and vertical lines).", "Here are some images from the dataset:", "Here are the Russian letters and their corresponding numerics used for prediction purpose:", "So don\u2019t worry, even if we don\u2019t get the article, we are going to leave with some Russian alphabets impression atleast!The complete dataset is prepared and uploaded by Olga Belitskaya and can be found right here:", "Now let\u2019s get going by setting up the monk and some prerequisites.", "We start by installing the monk library.", "1.)We have used colab here, so here is the installation process for the same.", "Although we can explore other ways of the installation at the monk library.", "2.)Add this to system path (Required for every terminal or kernel run)", "Next, we will get the dataset from Kaggle directly to colab. For that, we have to first create an API token from Kaggle.", "Go to your Kaggle profile>> My Account >> Scroll down to API section >> Click on Create new API Token( remember to expire all other tokens if used previously)", "After clicking on this, the kaggle.json file will be installed in your system.Next, go the dataset page again and on the right of the new notebook option, we can find an icon to copy the API command. This command will be used to download the dataset.For now, upload the kaggle.json file in google colab as shown here.", "Further, use the API command to download the dataset.", "Now, unzip this file and create a new file to store all the datasets in one place.", "After this is done, we import these libraries and the appropriate backend.", "I have used MXNet Gluon API as Backend here, with just one line of code we can choose our desired backend and not worry about encountering different syntax later. This is possible with the monk library, by using just one syntax we can work across different frameworks like PyTorch, MXNet, Keras, TensorFlow.", "To create the project name and the experiment name we use the prototype function. We can now create multiple experiments under a project and make comparisons among them on various aspects.", "We have not concatenated the three image folders, which would have allowed us to train the entire dataset together.Our approach to building a robust model is training the model first by using images that are least affected by the background i.e. second image folder.Also, this folder is reasonably big (with a large number of images), so it can train the model effectively at first and we can understand how the model is performing with simpler data.", "This would somewhat ensure if the model learns to extract desired features and we can verify this by analyzing plots for the same.If it is observed that the model has learned to extract features properly, then we can continue training the model with the next folder containing graphic type background images, even this folder is big enough so hopefully, it makes the model learn to ignore the background.", "Finally, we update and train the model with images containing stripped background.", "This approach allows us to figure out which part of the dataset is not being classified properly and in case of unsatisfactory results, we can analyze all plots and identify where the model is performing poorly and focus on that part.", "Approach for developing models :1.)First, the backend is chosen (MXNet Gluon), some basic models are selected which can be appropriate for this particular task.2.)Less dense variants are chosen and their performances are compared.", "3.)Parameters are tuned for the models. This is the most crucial part of developing a good model.", "This analysis is very important while tuning parameters.", "4.)With the same tuned parameters, more dense variants for the same models are tried.", "If we would have directly gone for dense networks, maybe due to exploding/diminishing gradients it wouldn\u2019t perform well and we may end up not considering that option at all.", "After all these efforts it is quite easy to figure out which model can give you the best results when exposed to unseen data. For this case it turns out to be Densenets, the appropriate depth of the Densenet chosen is 121, it is enough to give desirable results.Resnets architecture ranks second, in terms of overall performance after being tuned. Mobilenets can potentially perform very well, although it took a lot of training time and space for this particular task.", "Three plots here are of the same model but with updated data. Densenet_121_3 is trained on the complete dataThe plot indicates that the model is learning fairly well on all three kinds of datasets.We got a hard to beat validation performance from our model.", "The model doesn\u2019t look like it is over-fitting and performs well on classifying new images, ensuring that the model is good to go.If there are any improvements that we could do in the present model, it would be focusing on improving/increasing the images with graphic type backgrounds. If we carefully observe, after those images are updated and the model is trained, the model\u2019s performance has dipped a bit.This is another area of work that can be explored.", "we have performed Transfer learning using various architectures, used a well-defined approach to build a solid classifier. Although there is one thing to be noted here, creating projects and experiments made it very easy for us to manage and compare experiments/models.", "Also, we could perform so many complex operations using very few lines of code. If we would have gone for the conventional approach, making such comparisons across models would cost us undesirable stretched out code, which can be very hard to debug. Also updating the data set and re-training models was made an elementary task when we used the monk library.", "There are also certain areas mentioned where more work can be done which could further increase the performance and reliability of the model.", "We have also made inferences using some test images, visit the code link below to view them.", "or you can view code at image classification zoo.", "Please share this article if it helped you learn something new!", "Your home for data science.
