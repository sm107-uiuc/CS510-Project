Not a single row more.", "This limitation was blamed by Public Health England for the loss of 15,841 positive COVID test results, as reported by The Guardian\u00b9. In turn, following the estimate that each non-complex case has 3 close contacts, it leads to at least 47,000 potentially infectious people not being informed and required to self-isolate, and potentially be traced. This figure can rise beyond 50,000 as it was reported\u00b2 that a minority of the 15,841 missing positive cases were complex, i.e. from environments such as hospitals, prisons, homeless shelters, which have 7 close contacts on average.", "The Public Health England (PHE) organization collects public and private lab results. As reported by The Guardian, one lab had sent its daily test report to PHE as a CSV document. PHE is then consolidating the results in Excel for the lab, alongside the results received from other labs. The organization would then be reporting the official figures and doing the follow-up on tracing and informing individual positive cases.", "Yet, it seems the lab at hand was already within the 1 million+ rows within PHE\u2019s datasheet. The addition of yet another daily batch led to some results being truncated, and hence not reported and acted upon.", "Excel is a much-beloved tool. It can be used for a multitude of tasks which aren\u2019t remotely what it originally was meant to be: a spreadsheet. Its ease of use also means it is accessible, and hence many users are far from being power users, and do not know nor follow good practices. A few suggestions would come to mind:", "In 2012, an Excel error led JPMorgan to lose $6bn trading loss\u00b3. The error was described in their report:", "During the review process, additional operational issues became apparent. For example, the model operated through a series of Excel spreadsheets, which had to be completed manually, by a process of copying and pasting data from one spreadsheet to another.", "Additionally, as reported by Business Insider\u00b3 back then:", "There is some evidence the Model Review Group accelerated its review as a result of this pressure, and in so doing it may have been more willing to overlook the operational flaws apparent during the approval process.", "In each case, manual manipulations were the cause of errors.", "Excel is a great tool, but also has flaws which are hard to ignore. The first to come to mind is naturally its limit of 1M rows, although its main purpose is not to act as a near Big Data tool.", "That is only to list a few.", "Excel first took the blame, the PHE organization citing an IT issue. The software itself is straightforward about its capabilities, the number of columns and rows is displayed for whoever would wonder. It later was revealed human error was also part of the equation. The PHE organization will be disbanded in March next year, the announcement has taken place before the loss of cases\u2075.", "If this story reminds us of one important factor, is the need to use the right tool for the job at hand, to maintain a high level of attention to detail, and for managers or leaders to ensure key users are properly equipped to do their job.", "Hopefully, every case involved will turn out fine.", "Thanks for reading!
