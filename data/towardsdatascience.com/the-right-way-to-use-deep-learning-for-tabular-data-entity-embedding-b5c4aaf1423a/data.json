Immediately, the thought of using deep learning or neural networks for tabular data struck my mind as I had worked on structured data for the first 6 months of my career.", "The use of deep learning in tabular data was not a new idea. People have been using fully-connected neural networks for these data for the longest time but it came with a few disadvantages;", "As such, using deep learning for tabular data never really took off. This is true until practitioners transfer the idea of embedding networks used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) to tabular data.", "Traditionally, categorical variables such as \u2018Gender\u2019 or \u2018Race\u2019 were processed using One-hot encoding, where each entity in the variable was given a unique column to track the presence of the entity.", "This method, although convert the data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms, it assumes independence among entity and results in sparse matrices.", "Entity embedding on the other hands uses a vector to represent each entity instead of a binary value. This has a few advantages;", "Hence, I decided to do a project using tabular to demonstrate the use of entity embeddings. The dataset I use is the IEEE-CIS Fraud Detection data from Kaggle which you can find here.", "Here are the step-by-step codes (including Google Colab specific code as I worked on colab).", "Firstly, to check the GPU allocated to you in colab you can run the following code.", "Next to mount to my google drive,", "Download the dataset from Kaggle, you would need your Kaggle API token for this. If you need any help downloading dataset from Kaggle, this might help.", "Then, read the csv files into pandas dataframe", "As this is a fraud detection dataset, having an imbalance data shouldn\u2019t be surprising.", "As data exploration and feature engineering is not the purpose of this post, I will use minimum features to predict the fraud label. To make sure you can replicate my code, here are my processing steps.", "After the processing steps have been done, now we can convert the categorical variables into integers.", "Due to the higly imbalanced dataset, I have to artificially generate more fraud data using a technique called Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE). The documentation can be found here.", "Finally, we can work on modelling the data. This implementation of the entity embedding took the idea and best practices from Jeremy Howard\u2019s \u2018Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders\u2019 course. Hence, many of the technical specifics such as embedding sizes and hidden layers were selected by Jeremy through his research and experiences. Anyway, if you have not seen the course, I highly recommend you take the course and listen to Jeremy approach to machine learning. It is completely free too.", "Now to define the neural networks. The architecture of the networks is simply the concatenation of continuous variables with embedding layers for each categorical variables.", "Process the input for the neural networks.", "Lastly, the competition ranks leaderboard using ROC-AUC. Hence we compute our ROC-AUC to see how we fare against others.", "Not that bad for a model using only some of the features.", "This is it. Using entity embedding for Kaggle tabular data competition. Hope you enjoy it.", "Your home for data science.
