We will pass the ticker of any company of our interest and the outcome will be an amazing short summary of the earnings call.", "Company earning calls is one of the main sources of information to understand how businesses are doing and what are expectations for next quarters.", "Company earning calls are publicly available. Normally, we can visit the website of the company and dial in to the call to hear what management has to say. Earnings call are normally scheduled the same day that company earnings are publicly released. The structure of the call is simple, management gives an overview of the last quarter operations and future guidance. In addition, journalists are able to ask questions about the business to the top management.", "They are quite insightful to listen to. However, it may be time consuming to go through the whole call, especially, if we are interested in multiple companies.", "Therefore, what we will do in this post is to automate the analysis of company earning calls using Python.", "With Python, we are not only able to perform quantitative analysis as we learnt in my previous posts. Among other things, we can, for example, use natural language processing in order to analyse linguistic structure or perform sentiment analysis.", "In this post, we are going to focus on passing a full transcript from company earning calls as an input. Then, we will extract key points that will help us to understand where a company is heading to and how was the recent performance. Below are some of the questions that we will answer:", "We start our code by making a get request to financialmodelingprep in order to retrieve the transcript of the latest earnings.", "In this post, we will analyse Apple, but feel free to change the name of the company to analyse any other company. Also, uncomment the variable demo and pass your API key (you can get one for free in financialmodelingprep upon registration) in order for the request to the API to work.", "Then, we store the full string that we get back from the API in the variable transcript. Next, we can use the Python split method. That method will create a Python list containing the script split by each of the new lines (i.e. /n character) as shown in below outcome.", "Now that we have a Python list with each of the sentences of the latest Apple earning calls, we will pass it to a Pandas DataFrame. We will use Pandas to analyse the earnings transcript. We will search for the word \u201cexpect\u201d to keep all sentences where the word expect is included.", "Then, within the analysis variable, we filter out all sentences where we have the expect word using the str.contains method. Feel free to change the word to analyse any other aspect of the company such as revenue or profits.", "Then, we extract the values from the pandas series in order to get our sentences as shown below. Only sentences with the word expect are kept.", "If you have a further look into the text_earnings variable, you will see that some of the sentences are still too long. We will loop through them in order to split them every time that we have a \u201c.\u201d. And then, we will print only the sentences where the word expect is found:", "Finally, we have summarised the earnings call to extract key information for our analysis. From the example above, we can quickly and easily see that:", "The cool thing about this script is that you can replace expect by the word to analyse (e.g. profits) and you will get a short summary for any company of your interest.", "In future posts, we will continue analysing earning calls transcript performing a Python NLTK sentiment analysis.", "In the meantime, you can keep reading any of my other posts on Python for Finance.", "Your home for data science.
