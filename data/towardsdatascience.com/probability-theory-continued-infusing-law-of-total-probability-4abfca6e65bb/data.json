Or to visualize:", "Note that in the above image A only occurs at B\u2082, B\u2083, B\u2084, and B\u2085, so P(A\u2229B\u2081) and P(A\u2229B\u2086) both are 0, so in this example we have:", "When thinking of it like that, the equation can seem confusing because it sounds too easy or obvious; it sounds like it should be a trivial point. The most useful extension of this law is probably when we apply the Kolmogorov definition of joint probability, which states that", "When we apply this to the Law of Total Probability, we see that", "The best way to understand why we would need to have this formula (and how it would be used) is to look at an example (which I have taken directly from a lab assignment from the DSI program hosted by General Assembly):", "Suppose you and your friend are playing a game. Your friend has laid four coins out in front of you. If you flip heads, you win a dollar from your friend. If you flip tails, you owe a dollar to your friend. However, the coins in front of you are not fair.", "Suppose you select one coin at random. That is, you don\u2019t know whether you selected coin A, B, C, or D. You flip heads. Given this data, what are the probabilities that you selected coin A, coin B, coin C, and coin D?", "So first off, let\u2019s try to put what we have just been told in to a format that could be read into a probability formula: we are told that, given coin A, there is an 80% chance of flipping heads, which can be interpreted as", "we are told that, given coin B, there is an 60% chance of flipping heads, which can be interpreted", "we are told that, given coin C, there is an 40% chance of flipping heads, which can be interpreted as", "and we are told that, given coin D, there is an 80% chance of flipping heads, which can be interpreted as", "Since there are 4 coins, and no reason why there wouldn\u2019t be any difference in probability between picking up one coin from another, we can deduce that there is an equal probability in picking up each coin, which would be a one-in-four (1/4) probability. Thus:", "To solve the probability of flipping a heads, you can plug all of this into the formula for the Law of Total Probability:", "From here we can use Bayes\u2019 Theorem to solve the rest of the problem:", "Thus, if you flipped a heads there is a 42.1% chance that you selected coin A, a 31.6% chance that you selected coin B, a 21.1% chance that you selected coin C, and a 5.3% chance that you selected coin D.", "Through this example, you can see how (once Kolmogorov\u2019s definition of joint probability is applied) that the Law of Total Probability is far from trivial, and when interpreted step by step is not so hard to understand. It is also neat (at least I think) to see these three different rules (Law of Total Probability, Kolmogorov\u2019s definition, and Bayes\u2019 Theorem) all used together to find more relations and correlations, and you can begin to see the potential for creative thought within the field of mathematics.", "Your home for data science.
