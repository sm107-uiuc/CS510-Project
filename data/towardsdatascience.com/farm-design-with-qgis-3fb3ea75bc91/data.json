It is a dream I have always wanted to pursue, given my love of oak trees and edible plants. It is a yearning gleaned from my entrepreneurial attempt at creating food from acorns.", "Our family is following the planning principles outlined by The Savanna Institute, a non-profit organization dedicated to multifunctional agriculture to foster \u201cecological resilience, climate stability, economic prosperity, and vibrant communities.\u201d The group\u2019s new book, Perennial Pathways: Planting Tree Crops, outlines the necessary steps for planning and planting a successful agroforestry plot.", "The hard work of farming begins with learning about the land. Maps are the perfect place to start for a site assessment. As J. Russell Smith says in Tree Crops:", "Agriculture must be \u201cadapted\u2026to physical conditions\u201d; \u201cfarming should fit the land.\u201d", "Before picking plants or preparing the field, we must construct the site plan. Given my interest in data science, I offered to help make the maps for our orchard. Below are the steps I took to create the map in the open-source platform, QGIS 3. I also used Google Earth Pro for parcel data and Gaia GPS mobile app for in-field mapping.", "First, let\u2019s add a satellite raster to QGIS so you can get your bearings. I followed instructions from hatari labs.", "Then, there are several ways to mark off your parcel. You can:", "a.) create a custom polygon in QGIS (If so, you can skip on to step 2) or\u2026", "The parcel we are evaluating runs along a creek, so we wanted the exact coordinates of the plot. Thus, I downloaded the appropriate shapefile parcel data from the county appraisal district.", "Many appraisal districts post the shapefile data publicly. However, our land overlapped with a county that did not post such information on its website. With a quick letter and a small fee, we were able to obtain the proper data through an open records request. I then saved this .shp file on my computer.", "Next is the tricky part\u2026taking all of the county appraisal district data and narrowing it down to the few parcels you need. We found this winnowing process is more straightforward in Google Earth Pro:", "Open Google Earth Pro on your desktop. Go to file>Import>(Select county parcel file here)>Open>Import All. Most appraisal districts store the data as an ESRI shp file. Thus, remember to select the file-type as an ESRI Shapefile when importing.", "Once imported, find your particular farm parcel on the map. Right-click and go to \u201csave place as\u2026\u201d Then you can save it on your computer as a kmz file. Repeat this step if you have more than one parcel in the county.", "Now, to import the specific parcel(s) into QGIS, open the QGIS software and go to layer>add layer>add vector layer. Choose the source and vector database from where you saved the kmz files in Google Earth Pro, and click ADD. Voila!", "Once you have the parcel layer in QGIS, right-click and select export>save features as, and save it as an ESRI shapefile. These files are your area of interest, and the four file extensions (.shp, .shx, .prj, .dbf) it creates will be necessary for the following steps.", "Launch the USDA Web Soil Survey by pressing the green button. Select Import AOI, then Create AOI from Shapefile. Select and open the four files you saved in step 1, and click the SET AOI button.", "Your area of interest should now be selected. Look at the yellow tabs across the top and select the download soils data tab. Scroll down and select create a download link. Then click on the zip file that was created under the heading: download link. Congratulations \u2014 you now have more soil data than you might want or need!", "My goal was to visualize the soil map for planting purposes. To do this, I went back to my QGIS map, and then I added the new vector layer of the soil map.", "Go to layer>add layer>add vector layer. Then select your downloaded soil map zip file. Click the add button. Several files will appear. Select the one that ends with spatial/soilmu_a_aoi.shp, which is a vector file type. That selection will add the vector lines you seek.", "To add the soil type labels, right-click on the new layer, and go to properties. Then go to labels. Select single labels. For the value, select MUSYMBOL.", "This action will show the symbol for the corresponding soil type. To explore this key more specifically, I would do so on the WSS website or through the tabular data in Microsoft Access.", "Texas has a distinctive data hub for LIDAR and elevation. I use this data as it is very current with limited data gaps.", "You can download the TNRIS elevation data for your particular plot area. Just click on the region, then click on the polygon on the map you would like to download. Then click on hypsography. Once downloaded, you can go to layer>add layer>add vector layer to import the elevation contours. I prefer the 2ft. layer, but there are also 5ft. layers.", "b.) For the rest of y\u2019all in the USA:", "Alternatively, if you do not live in Texas or would like to use a different approach. USGS -The National Map is a great resource. Simply, go to the TNM Download site and select Elevation Source Data (3DEP)\u200a\u2014\u200aLIDAR, IfSAR. Then select DEM Source. You can find products for your selected rectangle or address from the map.", "Download all of the product zip files and unzip the files and save them. Within these zip files will be a tiff file. Go back to QGIS, and go to layer>add layer>add raster layer. Select the tiff files and press ADD.", "You will now see a black and white image overlayed on your map. Go to Raster>Extraction, Contour. The input layer should be the tiff file you added. The interval between contour lines is the amount in meters. It defaults to 10, but I like more detail, so I changed it to 1-meter intervals.", "Add existing or planned infrastructure to the map (waterlines, fences, barns, etc.). You can go to layer>Create layer> New shapefile layer. You can select the geometry type you need. For example, you can add a point for trees, a line for fences, and a polygon for barns.", "An essential step in planning a site is to do a site visit to scout weeds, trees, and other points of interest in your plot. We installed the Gaia GPS app on our phones to capture trees and pathways we desired to include on our plot map.", "You can click the plus sign and add tracks, waypoints, and areas. You can even take pictures of the tree (or another item) and catalog it along with your waypoint. These are all saved to the Saved folder along the bottom of the screen. You can click on any of these saved items and then export them in either a GPX, KML, or CSV file. I saved it as a KML into a dropbox folder so I could access it in the cloud on my computer.", "Then to import this data back into QGIS, I simply went to layer>add layer>add vector layer and selected the file saved in my dropbox folder.", "In conclusion, you should now have a map that includes the majority of the information you need to make decisions on planting layout, species selection, and other essential establishment factors.
