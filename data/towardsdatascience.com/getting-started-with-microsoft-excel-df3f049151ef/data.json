It can help save countless hours of manual work, and can even automate certain aspects of it. Depending on the industry and office makeup, it can even help establish you as the office\u2019s computer guru!", "Excel is very powerful, and there are very few things that it cannot do. Working in investment banking, I have to use Excel daily, and I am surprised by how little of Excel new graduates know. I am not talking about VBA either; I\u2019m talking about good old in-built formulas. Worry not, however, as it is straightforward to catch up quickly.", "In this blog post, we are going to cover the top 10 things I wish everybody would know about Excel!", "The very first thing you need to know is that Excel expects all formulas to start with the equal sign. Click in any empty cell and type \u201d=\u201d and you will notice some of the inbuilt functions ready to be used.", "By the time you are done reading this blog, you will feel comfortable trying them all out!", "The first thing we are going to learn about today is the \u201d&\u201d sign. It is used to concatenate cells together. Why would we ever want to do that you ask? The most common usage I have found is to create unique data keys. If a data set has more than one field in its primary key, you might want to have a single attribute that represents it, to make joins and lookups easier between data sets.", "Sooner or later, the need will certainly arise where you need to retrieve information from one set of data, based on a value from another. Take, for example, the situation where you want to be able to return a person\u2019s height based on their name, assuming you hold all relevant information.", "The simplest way to achieve that is to use VLOOKUP. We first need to choose the value we would like to use in the lookup, then the range we\u2019re interested in (keeping in mind the look will happen in the first column), then the column we would like to return data from, and then whether we want an exact or approximate match.", "Here is an example where you can clearly see what is happening:", "You may have noticed that VLOOKUP only supports vertical lookups. If you are ever after a horizontal lookup, you can use HLOOKUP.", "Another inbuilt function that may come in handy more often than you may think is one that allows you to conditionally sum values. That is, based on certain criteria, we can specify whether we would like to include the values into the total.", "This is easiest understood through an example:", "SUBTOTAL is a nifty little function that enables you to perform arithmetic operations to a number of fields. Average, count, max, min, sum, stdev and more are functions that SUBTOTAL can support.", "The other secret power of this function is that it only considers visible values. In other words, when you filter your result set (ctrl + shift + L, and filter), SUBTOTALS will only consider the values that are visible within the defined range.", "Although not a built-in function as such, a functionality that can be most useful. Sometimes you merely want to know where your data has duplicates, or you simply want to remove them. The process to do so is not only simple but also very functional. The UI control for it enables you to quickly and easily define a composite key.", "You can quickly invoke this functionality by hitting alt, A, M. Or if you want to use your mouse, you can invoke this functionality through the typical Excel controls.", "As the name suggests, this functionality enables you to break text into columns. This could be useful when you are working with comma delimited files (CSV) or other delimiters.", "Depending on the type of data you are working with, however, you can get creative using this control. I often find myself using this control when I\u2019ve copy-pasted something in Excel and numbers are represented as text (you can visually tell because the values in the cells are left-aligned). This would create a problem with any lookups etc. so quickly using this control with a bogus delimiter reformats everything (shortcut: alt, a, e).", "If there is one thing you take away and remember, let it be this one. Hands down Pivot tables are probably the most important and useful thing you can learn about Excel. It enables you to slice and dice data in myriad ways so you can get summarised and insightful views on your data.", "You get to choose how to present your data in terms of columns, rows, which data to include, and what operation to perform in the aggregations. The following example will certainly help you see better what you can do with (shortcut: alt, n, v) Pivot tables, but I encourage you to dig in and try it out yourself. There is no better way of learning than trying things out yourself.", "When it comes to analysing data, sometimes you want to check whether certain conditions are true or not. To do so, we can use the inbuilt \u201dif\u201d function. The function takes in three inputs. The condition, the result if the condition is true and the result if it is not.", "Depending on the complexity of the statement, you can combine multiple if statements together. Let us explore both possibilities further.", "Finally, the last Excel function we are going to learn (well actually the last three) are to do with trying manipulation. Len returns the number of characters a string is, and it is most useful when combined with left and right.", "Left and right take in two inputs. A string and the number of characters to return, counting from left or right. Sometimes however you merely want to exclude a trailing or starting set of characters which is where len comes in.", "Empowered with this knowledge, you are now equipped with all you require to fearlessly continue expanding and building your knowledge of Excel. It is a worthwhile investment in yourself that I highly recommend. It is a must-have skill in most jobs, whether the job ad asks for it or not.", "I hope you find this useful and that it inspires you to continue learning!", "Your home for data science.
