It is a subject that is often difficult to relate to. One can easily relate to poetry or literature or music or law or history. But math, for the most part, is considered to be arcane and devoid of soul. The above photo captures this feeling: \u201cArt is more important than Maths\u201d. But I tend to disagree because I believe Mathematics is also an art.", "This article is an attempt to view mathematics from a new perspective.", "Let's start with the very basics.", "Some would say Mathematics is the study of numbers. Others may describe it as a set of techniques/functions/equations to count and measure. Maths is taught as a subject where you have to find solutions to problems. You are asked to solve algebraic equations and work out the value of x. You learn to deal with differentiation, integration, limits, probability, trigonometric functions, vector calculus and the list goes on. We may learn how to do it and many of us even secure good grades in exams. However, there are a lot of people who feel detached with this whole exercise. What is the point of doing it? What does it all actually mean? What does a math equation or a math formula represent?", "These are important questions. To answer, we have to go a little deeper. Let's close our eyes and think about \u201cLearning\u201d, in general.", "Learning happens when you observe a phenomena and recognize a pattern. You try to understand this pattern by finding out if there is any relationship between the entities involved in that phenomena.", "Take a moment. You will realize that any kind of understanding or knowledge about anything is nothing but identification and explanation of patterns. Think about agriculture, change of seasons, motion of planets, evolution of life, chemical reactions, stock market analysis, psychological studies, clinical trials, development of medicines\u2026.almost every pursuit of knowledge involves identification of some kind of pattern. (Check this article )", "Once a pattern has been recognized, it has to be expressed. Human beings use \u201clanguages\u201d, \u201dsymbols\u201d and \u201cdrawings\u201d to express, describe and communicate ideas and understanding.", "For example, if we have to describe the idea of \u201cDemocracy\u201d, we can use English language to explain it. On Wikipedia you can find the description as follows:", "Democracy (Greek: \u03b4\u03b7\u03bc\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, d\u0113mokrati\u0101, from d\u0113mos \u2018people\u2019 and kratos \u2018rule\u2019) is a form of government in which the people have the authority to choose their governing legislation.", "If you have to describe how to reach from one city to another, you can draw a map to express it. Using only text will be less appropriate to express this idea.", "Now, there are many patterns or ideas in nature which are abstract. e.g let's say you have 2 Oranges in 1 basket and 3 Bananas in another basket. What is the total number of fruits you have? You can add 2 to 3 and get 5 or you can add 3 to 2 and get 5. The order doesn\u2019t matter. Actually this is commutative law of addition and it can be expressed in the English language as:", "When two numbers are added, the order of numbers does not play any role.", "However, a more efficient way of expressing the above idea is:", "Here comes the big idea about Mathematics", "For what kind of patterns, mathematics should be used?", "Patterns which are more formal or abstract, can be efficiently expressed in the language of mathematics.", "For example, if a person is driving a car at some constant speed, is there a relationship or pattern between Distance covered, his speed and total time of driving.", "Yes, there is a pattern which can be expressed in the English language as follows:", "\u201cThe distance covered by a driver is always equal his speed times the duration of his travel\u201d.", "This explanation is correct but it will be more useful if we express it in terms of mathematical symbols and operations as follows:", "Mathematically, we can say that there is a linear relationship between Distance and Time, if speed is constant. Compare it with the equation of line that was taught in school.", "In our example, the line passes through the origin, hence b=0. At time 0, no distance is covered. And speed is the \u2018slope\u2019 i.e m of our line)", "Now, why the mathematical expression is more useful? This is because it captures the \u2018generalized\u2019 idea behind the phenomena. Any phenomena in nature, where the entities have a linear relationship can be expressed in the form of a line and we can predict the values in future by traversing this line.", "[This is what Linear Regression is, on a very high level]", "Stop thinking Mathematics as a subject to solve a problem. Begin to think it as a Language \u2014 a language to express patterns in nature.", "Different types of patterns result in different branches of Mathematics:", "Once you start thinking of Math as a language of patterns, you can start looking at equations from a different mind-set. Think of an equation as an expression of that pattern. Try to imagine about the pattern which the equation is trying to express. Think of it as a story plot, where the characters have a relationship between them.", "Lets talk about a fundamental shape : circle", "The mathematical equation for a circle with center at origin(0,0) is:", "Now think of the pattern which this equation is expressing.", "\u201cEvery point on the circle is at the same distance from the center\u201d.", "Actually, this pattern is what makes it a circle. A shape whose every point is at the same distance from a fixed point, is a circle. It can not be a rectangle or a triangle or any other shape. Only the circle follows this pattern. This is the knowledge or the learning, that above equation is trying to say! Is there any other way, this pattern can be expressed?", "Divide the circumference with diameter of any circle in the world! You will always get a constant number \u2018\ud835\udf0b\u2019 (approx 3.14159)", "This is another way to describe the pattern behind a circle. Where ever there is a circle involved in any math formula, there will be \ud835\udf0b.", "Area of circle,Volume of a sphere, Volume of Cylinder:", "You can, of course, derive the proofs of these formulas, but the fundamental idea I am trying to convey is that there is a common pattern behind them \u2014 \u2018circular\u2019 shape \u2014 and hence \ud835\udf0b", "Lets take it one step further. Previously, I called circle( or sphere) as a fundamental shape. If you think, this is a shape most abundantly present in nature (may not be a perfect circle or sphere but still close enough) like Shapes of planets and other heavenly bodies, bubbles, rain drops, atoms, rotations and revolutions of planets, shapes of galaxies etc", "Is there a fundamental pattern present in nature? I propose that there is. And this fundamental pattern is \u201cREPETITION\u201d. There are lot of natural phenomena that repeats. e.g Rotation of earth (planets) on their axis, revolution of planets around a star, revolution of whole galaxies, motion of electrons around nucleus, change of seasons, rise and fall of waves, biochemical cycles like photosynthesis and so on. (People say that history also repeats itself. \ud83d\ude0e)", "So now, whenever you see a math formula or equation with a \ud835\udf0b, think of a circle and then think if there is any kind of repetition in the phenomena that this equation is trying to express. You will see a connection.", "Time Period of a simple Pendulum:", "Kepler\u2019s 3rd Law of Planetary Motion:", "which captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods. (The orbits are \u2018loosely\u2019 circular. The planets move around sun \u201crepeatedly\u201d)", "The electric field around a charge follows a circular trajectory.", "\u2026\u2026.and you can find many more. Of course, the actual maths and physics behind all these processes is more complex than what is defined here. But what I am proposing is to look at these equations or formulae from a different mindset. Wherever there is a \ud835\udf0b, there will be a presence of circle (repetition)", "Just as \ud835\udf0b for cyclic patterns, there are others patterns in nature which can be generalized. For example, any phenomena which involves an exponential growth or decline can almost always be expressed in terms of \u2018e\u2019. Think about Radioactive decay or growth of population or increase in the umber of COVID-19 infections or compound interest of your bank. (I will leave it here for you, dear reader, to reflect upon such patterns)", "Data Science and Machine Learning are the fields which are being used to mimic human learning. The goal is to automatically find \u201cpatterns\u201d in data and establish a relationship between output variable and input variables. What is the best way to express this relationship? As argued earlier, Mathematics is the best language to express such formal relationships.", "Machine learning algorithms like Linear/Logistic Regression or Neural Networks use Linear Algebra and probability theorems. Cost optimization of ML models employ calculus. Word and Sentence embedding use Vector Calculus. So, next time you implement any machine learning algorithm, give a thought why a particular mathematical approach or function is being used and what pattern are you trying to find out?", "And as with all natural cycles, I will repeat (PUN intended):", "Mathematics is the language to express patterns. A mathematical equation or formula is simply a model or explanation of that pattern.", "Your home for data science.
