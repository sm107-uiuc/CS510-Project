Why does it show up in all these contexts?", "The table below shows the symptoms of COVID and the ICU admission and their p-values (COVID-19).", "In this paper, the only thing the author said about this table was \u201cProportions for categorical variables were compared using the \u03c72 test. P values indicate differences between ICU (Intensive Care Unit) and non-ICU patients.\u201d", "Let\u2019s say that all the doctors in the hospital got sick from the coronavirus, and YOU(!) are in charge of deciding which patients need to go to ICU. Because there are only a limited number of beds in the ICU, you cannot admit everyone. You were also provided with this table to use as a reference.", "How will you use the p-values in the table? Based on the p-value, can you predict the relvant symptoms that someone needs to be admitted to the ICU? In school, we learned that a small p-value (usually less than 0.05) means the evidence is strong. But why is that?", "\u201cP\u201d in P-value means the \u201cProbability\u201d- how likely it is that your sample data was *ONLY* BECAUSE OF RANDOM SAMPLING, not because of the actual difference.", "So, if the p-value is small, that\u2019s good because it tells you that the result of your experiment is not just due to chance.", "The total number of COVID-19 patients admitted at Wuhan hospital in this paper is N=138. Let\u2019s say we are sampling three more groups of 138 patients from hospitals in NYC, Italy, and South Korea.", "Will we get a very different number of \u201canorexia\u201d patients in the ICU and non-ICU, every single time we sample?", "Every time we sample a group of patients from different hospitals, it\u2019s a *random* sampling. Even if anorexia has nothing to do with ICU admission, the two could appear related due to random sampling error. Just by coincidence, they could look like they are related.", "If we want to claim that the difference is not just because of a random sampling error, but because of the actual difference, what do we need to prove?", "We need to show that the difference is too big to be random. We need to show a \u201cstriking difference\u201d.", "When we assume a normal distribution for a statistic, we can measure any point in terms of standard deviations from the mean. In the same way, we can assume some distribution for the difference (or the normalized difference \u2014 test statistics). If we show the difference falls further in the tail, either right or left, we can say that the probability of that event happening is low.", "The p-value is the area under the distribution curve where the test statistics falls, to the right or to the left.", "To calculate the p-value, you need 3 things \u2014 data, a null hypothesis, and a test statistic.", "The null hypothesis says that there is no relationship between the two groups. The null hypothesis is presumed to be true until the data shows enough evidence that it is not.", "The U.S. criminal justice system uses the same idea; \u201cInnocent until proven guilty\u201d. The null hypothesis will never be proven true; you just fail to reject it.", "Test statistics is the weapon we are going to use to reject the null hypothesis. And in this case, in order to see if the two variables are related, we are going to use chi-square test.", "The H0 \u201cThe anorexia and ICU are not related.\u201d means that the percentage of patients with anorexia will be the same whether they are in the ICU or not.", "Then, what do we need to show in order to reject H0?", "We need to show that the percentage of patients with anorexia is strikingly different between ICU patients and non-ICU patients.", "The above test statistics is based on this idea. If anorexia and ICU are independent, each of (Observation - Expected)\u00b2 will be small. If it\u2019s not clear to you yet, keep reading the derivation below.", "According to Table 1, out of a total 138 patients, 36 patients went to the ICU and 102 didn\u2019t go to the ICU. Out of a total 55 patients who have anorexia, 24 went to the ICU and 31 didn\u2019t go to the ICU.", "3. Compute the expected value for each cell. (This is the key!)", "If you look at the cell [ICU, Anorexia], it calculates: out of a total of 36 ICU patients, 36 * (55/138) patients are expected to have anorexia.", "Because, if the actual observation 24 is a whole lot different than 36 * (55/138), then something is going on between anorexia and ICU. Conversely, if 36 * (55/138) is not too different from 24, then ICU/non-ICU doesn\u2019t have too much effect on anorexia.", "If you calculate the expected value of the \u201cDry Cough\u201d in Table 1, you won\u2019t see a big difference between the expected value and the observation.

It calculates how much it deviates from what is expected.", "The chi-square distribution is a sum of squares of independent standard normal random variables (like the chi-square test statistic).", "Let\u2019s say you have a random sample taken from a normal distribution. This is not an unrealistic assumption, given the central limit tendency (if there are more than 30 samples, the mean tends to be normal). Then, the (Observation \u2014 Expectation) value will also follow the normal distribution, because E is deterministic.", "This normal distribution assumption is often omitted during the p-value teaching, but this assumption is what makes the chi-squared p-value paradigm possible.", "This is a single number that tells you how much difference exists between your observed counts and the expected counts.", "For a table with r rows and c columns, the formula for calculating degrees of freedom for the chi-square test is", "In our data, we have 2 rows and 2 columns in the contingency table so the df is 1.", "Why are the degrees of freedom of the chi-square test defined this way?", "First of all, degrees of freedom are the number of elements that can vary in order for the statistic to remain unchanged.", "For example, in an equation `a + b + c = 10`, you can change a and b to any number but you cannot change c, once a & b are set, because the sum should remain as 10. So, in this case, df is 2.", "The df for a chi-square test is the number of cells in the contingency table that can vary. In our example, the contingency table was 2 by 2. If you set the cell [ICU & Anorexia] as 24, the rest of the cells are determined. We multiply (row-1) and (column-1) because we want every possible combination of categorical variables.", "Why do we need to take into account degrees of freedom?", "Because the degrees of freedom affect the shape of the distribution.", "If you look at the chi-square table, the different degrees of freedom have different test statistic values for the same alpha (significance level).", "As the sample size becomes bigger, the degrees of freedom get larger. So the bigger the degrees of freedom is, the more closely the distribution resembles the normal distribution.", "This also means, as the degrees of freedom get larger, the area in the tails becomes smaller. It congests more towards the mean (smaller standard deviation). And this means that 0.05 p-value cut-off will be further out. Because when your sample size is smaller, more uncertainties are there.", "6. Look up the chi-square table, or do it with python or a calculator.", "If you look at the chi-square table, as the bigger the test statistic is, the smaller the p-value is.", "Or, using Python, it\u2019s just a few lines.", "The more extreme the test statistic is, the less likely it is that the result happened by chance.", "How likely is your data, given that your null hypothesis is true?", "66.7% of ICU patients have anorexia, but 30.4% of Non-ICU patients have it too. Its p-value is less than 0.001. The p-value 0.001 means if you sample 1000 different groups, you\u2019d see the same statistics (or more extreme cases) only 1 time, given anorexia and ICU are indeed independent.", "Sometimes Wikipedia doesn\u2019t have the best explanation\u2026", "3. Setting alpha (the significance level) is arbitrary. Different people use different significance levels. Therefore, we can arrive at different conclusions from the same data depending on what we choose as our significance level. By convention, \u03b1 is set to 0.05, or 0.01.", "We set our significance level before we see any data. Alpha should not be derived from data nor depend on the underlying hypothesis.", "4. Chi-square distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution.
