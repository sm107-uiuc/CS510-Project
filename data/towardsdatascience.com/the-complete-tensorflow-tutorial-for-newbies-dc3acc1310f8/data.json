It makes it easier to build models and deploy them for production.", "It is the most popular framework among developers. This comes with no surprise, as the framework is also available for web-based machine learning (TensorFlow.js) and for on-device inference (TensorFlow Lite). Furthermore, with the recent announcement of TensorFlow 2.0, the framework will soon be easier to use, as the syntax will be simplified with fewer APIs, and it will support the Julia programming language.", "It is a great time to get started with TensorFlow, and mastering it is an important asset data scientists.", "This tutorial will get you up and running with TensorFlow. Note that TensorFlow 2.0 is not stable, so we will focus on the previous stable version.", "We will first install the framework in the easiest way possible, then we will write a few functions to learn the syntax and to use a few APIs. Finally, we will write a model that will recognize hand signs.", "For hands-on video tutorials on machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, checkout my YouTube channel.", "Let\u2019s install TensorFlow! We will go through the installation process on a Windows machine.", "Feel free to post a comment if you are experiencing difficulties on other operating systems.", "The first step is to download and install Anaconda. Anaconda is a platform that makes it easier to perform data science; it gives access to the most popular tools and libraries and it also acts as a package manager.", "Download the Anaconda distribution for your operating system and follow the installation steps. It is safe to accept the default settings. Installation might take a few minutes, because a lot of things are bundled with Anaconda.", "Once installation is done, search for anaconda prompt in your Windows search bar. Open the application and you should see something like this:", "Now, to install Tensorflow, simply type:", "Wait for the installation to complete and voil\u00e0! You are now set to write code using TensorFlow!", "The rest of the tutorial will follow this notebook. You can also grab any utilities needed throughout the tutorial. Refer to it whenever you feel stuck!", "Let\u2019s compute the sigmoid function using TensorFlow. Here is the full code block. We will then walk through what the code is doing.", "A TensorFlow program is usually split into two parts: a construction phase and a computation phase.", "During the construction phase, we use a placeholder to create a variable. We need to define the type of variable and give it a name. Then, we simply use the built-in sigmoid function. Note that during the construction phase, there are no values being computed. In fact, the code does not run at all. That is why we need a computation phase.", "During the computation phase, we create a session and assign the result of our computation to another variable. Notice that the function takes z as input, but use x inside the function, hence the need of feed_dict.", "And the entire block cell is called a TensorFlow graph. This is how all TensorFlow programs are structured:", "Understanding this structure is key to mastering TensorFlow. Once you are comfortable with this, you will be able to write more advanced programs.", "Now, let\u2019s compute the cost function for a classification problem. We are used to compute the cross-entropy function and writing it from scratch. Now, let\u2019s see how TensorFlow makes it easy for us to achieve the same result:", "That\u2019s it! Only one line to define the loss function!", "Notice again how we used the placeholders, and recognize the construction and computation phases of the code cell above.", "One-hot encoding is a technique to transform mutliclass labels to vectors of 0s and 1s.", "Let\u2019s see how we can do it in TensorFlow:", "Again, TensorFlow makes it very easy to manipulate our data.", "Now that you are more comfortable to the general structure, let\u2019s move on to building an actual neural network to classify hand signs!", "In this little project, we will build a hand signs recognition system. Specifically, our neural network will recognize if a hand is expressing a number from 0 to 5.", "Let\u2019s load the dataset and take a look at a sample image:", "Before building our model, we will first flatten the images, normalize their features, and one-hot encode the labels:", "First, we write a function to create placeholders for the feature matrix and label matrix:", "Then, we write a function to initialize the weight matrix and bias matrix:", "Awesome! Now, we must define forward propagation:", "Note that in the code cell above, the comments show the equivalent syntax in numpy.", "Finally, we define a function to compute the cost:", "Now, we are ready to combine everything into a model!", "What about backpropagation? Unlike previous posts where we wrote backpropagation from scratch, deep learning frameworks take care of it automatically with a few lines of code!", "Now, we combine all our functions into a model, and we will use mini-batch gradient descent to train the neural network:", "Now, we run the model with the following line of code:", "Great! The test accuracy is not that good, because we only used a small part of the entire dataset, and we did not train for very long. The main objective of this tutorial was to get used to TensorFlow and to get an overview to its API.", "Good job! You are now ready to use TensorFlow for more advanced neural networks and applications. In following posts, we will explore different neural network structures and use TensorFlow or Keras (another deep learning framework) to build them.", "Your home for data science.
