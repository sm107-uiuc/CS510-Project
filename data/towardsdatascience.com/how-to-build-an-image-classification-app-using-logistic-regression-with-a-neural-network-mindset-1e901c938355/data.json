So after some time, I think a bunch of neurons in my brain did some computation and fired a signal, that led me towards a thought of \ud83d\udc47", "How about making a project using Neural Networks Algorithm?", "So now the key question was:", "As a project-based learner, I was looking for a hands-on course/tutorial with some basic theoretical knowledge about Neural Networks. So I chose to enroll in the Neural Networks and Deep Learning Course.", "Just to let you know that this is the first course of deeplearning.ai Specialization offered through Coursera and is taught by Prof Andrew Ng. The Co-founder of Coursera, and an Adjunct Professor of Computer Science at Stanford University.", "Recently I completed that course and wrote an article as well in which I\u2019m sharing comprehensive insights about this course. So if you are interested in learning about Neural Networks then check this out \ud83d\udc47", "So I completed the course, learned about solving the image classification problem, Now it\u2019s time to write a beginner-friendly tutorial!", "Firstly, we\u2019ll try to understand the problem of image classification by asking questions such as \ud83d\udc47", "Secondly, in this main part, we\u2019ll learn about the Logistic Regression algorithm with a Neural Network mindset. At this point, we\u2019ll start coding and implement the basic building blocks of the learning algorithm.", "After this step, you will be able to use your own image to classify whether it contains Cat or Not.", "Some of the functions that we\u2019ll implement are:", "In the end, we\u2019ll merge all the functions into our main model.", "We\u2019ll use Python Programming Language throughout this tutorial. And yes all the code include\u2019s comprehensive explanation as well!", "Lastly, after finalizing the model we will learn:", "This is not the final step but there\u2019s one more interesting stuff \ud83d\udc47", "This is my favorite part because we\u2019ll gonna play with our model parameters like learning rate, number of iterations by trying different values of it. And will analyze the performance of our model.", "In this part, I will also share some extra steps by which you can play, discover, and analyze the results of your learning algorithm.", "Our goal is to solve the image classification problem. To be specific, in input we have an image, and we need to figure out some way by which we can classify whether it\u2019s a Cat image or Non-Cat image.", "To achieve our goal, first, let\u2019s understand what is an image?", "The image is nothing but a 2D array of numbers and those numbers represent the intensity value of the color. If it\u2019s a grayscale image then there\u2019s only a 1-dimensional channel of a 2D array that contains values representing shades of black and white.", "If it\u2019s a color image, like the one you see above, then there are a total of 3-dimensional channels of a 2D array that contain values representing shades of Red, Green, Blue color.", "In this tutorial, we\u2019ll be using a color image!", "You can learn more about images and how do computers store images? in the tutorial uploaded on Youtube.", "You must have heard about applications of artificial intelligence in Robotics, Computer Vision, Medical Diagnosis, Business, and many other domains.", "Here, I would like to share 2 examples where image classification plays a vital role.", "Our objective is to build a model/algorithm/function that can classify Cat vs Non-Cat images. To be specific this is a binary classification problem.", "Given an image, if the model predicted \u201cIt\u2019s a Cat image\u201d then the output should be 1 and if the model predicted \u201cIt\u2019s not a Cat image\u201d then the output should be 0.", "So is there any function that can give us our desired output?", "Yes, and that function is known as Logistic/Sigmoid function.", "Properties of sigmoid function as you can see in the above figure are:", "The Logistic regression algorithm will evaluate the probability of a catbeing in a given image as input. And just to get started we can set a threshold in our algorithm to predict cat image if the output from the sigmoid function is > 0.5 or vice versa.", "By the way, choosing a good threshold is one of many stuff to play with machine learning algorithms!", "Hey but wait a minute!. Isn\u2019t the title of this tutorial was:", "\u201c How to Build an Image Classification app using Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset? \u201d", "Yup, we\u2019ll build our image classification model using Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset. Don\u2019t worry about it! (Prof Andrew\u2019s dialogue)", "First, let\u2019s talk about Neural Networks!", "Neural Network is another learning algorithm but it is very much different from other machine learning algorithms. Inspired by the structure of the brain, an artificial neural network is an attempt to simulate the network of neurons in the human brain. ANN is a layer-based architecture consisting of an input layer, hidden layers, output layer.", "In the above neural network, there is a total of 4 hidden layers and 20 hidden units/artificial neurons and each of the units is connected with the next layer of units. So to get started and have a better understanding of the neural network process, we\u2019ll build our cat classifier using logistic regression with a neural network mindset.", "Neural Networks are used in applications of Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing, Recommender Systems, \u2026", "Maybe this tutorial that you are reading is recommended to you by some neural network working behind the medium articles recommender system!", "There are 2 benefits of using this approach:", "Now before getting started into coding, let me share with you the overview of the process, and then we\u2019ll tackle each building block of the learning algorithm step by step.", "FeaturesIf we need to recognize a cat in any photo, we would be able to quickly identify it and I think that\u2019s because we learned to differentiate between the features of a cat and other animals.", "But to let computers recognize a cat in any photo is very difficult to do. Because in the image all we have are a bunch of numbers that represent different shades of Red, Blue, Green color. Those numbers are known as features of the image and that\u2019s the cat classifier input.", "So we need to build a system that can recognize the diverse possibilities of how a cat may look in a picture and that\u2019s where the learning algorithm comes \ud83d\udc47", "Learning AlgorithmAs the name suggests, the job of a learning algorithm is to learn the features of Cat in an image but we don\u2019t want our model to just predict cat in a single/specific kind of photo instead we want our model to be generalized in such a way that our model considers diverse possibilities of how a cat may look in different pictures.", "For our model to be generalized, we need to give many different types of cat and non-cat images as input to the learning algorithm. So that our learning algorithm can learn the features between Cat image vs Non-Cat image!", "But what does a learning algorithm learns?", "Good question. In my understanding learning algorithm is just doing some computations using mathematical equations and gives parameters values. Our model needs these parameter values to correctly classify the cat with a minimum amount of error.", "The algorithm we will use for this process is known as Gradient descent.You will learn more about it in the latter part of this tutorial under the heading of the Optimization algorithm!", "The following figure explains the process and mathematical expressions that we will gonna implement!", "I know that there is a lot of things happening in the above process. So first let\u2019s understand the process by single training example!", "let\u2019s represent a training example by m. So now m=1.", "Consider we gave input of Cat image in the algorithm.", "Now observe that model prediction is dependant on the value of parameters w and b, Right?", "So the above process is repeated with all the other images in the training set and then the optimization algorithm tries to adjust the correct parameter values so that our model predicts with the minimum amount of error!", "Note: You can find all the necessary files and code in my Github Repository", "First, let\u2019s import all the packages that will be very helpful in implementing the building blocks of our learning algorithm.", "These packages are like different ingredients that you need during the process of making some kind of food!", "If you are using Jupyter Notebook then import the above packages, if you are facing any issue then make sure that the packages are installed properly.", "Now press Shift + Enter Key to Run the cell in Jupyter notebook.", "Let\u2019s get more familiar with the dataset!", "In the following code, we have loaded our dataset that consists of cat and non-cat images.", "Training setOur Cat classifier model will use this training set to learn the difference between Cat vs Non-Cat features.", "train_set_x_orig: This is a matrix storing feature values of a cat and non-cat images. These values are between 0\u2013255 representing different shades of Red, Blue, Green color.", "train_set_y: This is a vector that is storing the corresponding output value of image features in train_set_x_orig.1 means it\u2019s a Cat image.0 means it\u2019s a Non-Cat image.", "After our model is trained on the training set, then we will check our model performance using the test set, this is the data our model hasn\u2019t seen!", "So we have 209 training examples and 50 testing examples of Cat vs Non-Cat images. Each color image size is 64 X 64.", "Each line of train_set_x_orig and test_set_x_orig is an array representing an image. Feel free to change the index value and re-run to see other images.", "For convenience, now we need to reshape images of shape (num_px, num_px, 3) in a numpy-array of shape (num_px*num_px*3, 1). After this, our training (and test) dataset is a numpy-array where each column represents a flattened image.", "Now our training and testing set is in the right dimension for computation purposes. Each column in train_set_x_flatten and test_set_x_flatten is representing features of Images.", "For example:train_set_x_flatten[:, 209] will output the feature vector storing 12288 values of the last image in the training dataset.", "One common step in machine learning is to preprocess/standardize the dataset.", "\u201c Having features on a similar scale can help the gradient descent converge more quickly towards the minima. \u201d", "In simple terms, it means that it will be easier for the optimization algorithm to learn those efficient parameter w and b values when features in the dataset are on a similar scale. There are many different kinds of techniques useful for this purpose.", "But for picture datasets, it is simpler and more convenient and works almost as well to just divide every row of the dataset by 255 (the maximum value of a pixel channel).", "Before Preprocessing, feature values in the training and testing set are between 0 and 255.", "After Preprocessing, now feature values in the training and testing set are between 0.0 and 1.0.", "Now it\u2019s time to design a simple algorithm to distinguish cat images from non-cat images.", "First, we\u2019ll implement the helper functions like sigmoid, initialize the parameters, \u2026 and then we\u2019ll merge those functions into our main cat classifier model.", "As you\u2019ve seen in the figure above, first we need to compute \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51(z) to make predictions.", "Just to get started we are initializing the parameters w and b by zeros. You can also initialize these parameters with random values to check the difference between zeros vs random initialization!", "Now that we have our sigmoid and initialization functions ready, the next task is to compute forward and backward propagation steps for learning the parameters.", "We\u2019ll implement the following equations in a function named propagate() that computes the cost function and its gradient.", "The cost function will give us the value representing the amount of error between our model prediction and the actual value.", "Our objective is to minimize the cost function and that\u2019s why we need to compute gradients or change of cost with respect to parameters w and b.", "It\u2019s time to implement a function that will give us the efficient parameters for our model to make predictions with a minimum amount of error.", "The goal here is to learn \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udc4f by minimizing the cost function \ud835\udc3d. , using a gradient descent algorithm update rule is:", "where \ud835\udefc is the learning rate, and dw, db is the gradients we computed in propagate() function.", "Gradient descent gives us two hyperparameters to play with, learning rate and the number of iterations. We\u2019ll be using these 2 hyperparameters to do some further analysis and improve the performance of our model.", "The previous optimization function will give us the w and b parameters. Then we can use those parameters to predict whether the image X contains a cat or not.", "Finally, we will now see how the overall model is structured by putting together all the building blocks (functions implemented in the previous parts) together, in the right order.", "Let\u2019s observe the performance of our cat_classifier model using random values in num_iterations and learning_rate:", "So our model was able to correctly classify approx 96% of images in the training dataset and 72% of images in the testing dataset. I hope you know that our model was trained on the training dataset and that\u2019s why training set accuracy is much higher than testing accuracy.", "But still, 72% of testing accuracy is not bad. Let\u2019s plot the learning curve graph to get a better understanding of the training process!", "You can see the cost decreasing. It shows that the parameters are being learned. Try to increase the number of iterations in the cell above and rerun the cells. You might see that the training set accuracy goes up, but the test set accuracy goes down. This is called overfitting.", "Following are the results of our model by changing the num_iterations value:", "The above performance results show that when we are increasing the num_iterations value, our model training accuracy is increasing but testing accuracy is slightly decreasing!", "Here, we see that the model is overfitting the training data, it means that model will only be able to predict correctly on the data it is being trained on. A technique known as regularization is used to reduce overfitting.", "There are many possibilities to improve the model\u2019s performance, So to get started in this tutorial I am going to use the cat classifier model with the training accuracy of approx 100% and testing accuracy of 70% which is not bad for this small dataset we are using!", "In past, I also wrote an in-depth tutorial on the analysis of learning rate in the Gradient Descent algorithm \ud83d\udc47", "Let\u2019s analyze our cat classifier model further, and examine possible choices for the learning rate \ud835\udefc.", "For Gradient Descent to work, you must choose the learning rate wisely.
