For a one-liner introduction, let\u2019s just say that Spark native integration with Kubernetes (instead of Hadoop YARN) generates a lot of interest from the community and is about to be declared Generally Available and Production-Ready with Spark 3.1.", "I\u2019m an ex-Databricks engineer, now co-founder of Data Mechanics, a managed Spark platform deployed on a Kubernetes cluster inside our customers cloud account (AWS, Azure, or GCP). Our mission is to make Spark more developer friendly and more cost-effecvtive for data engineering teams.", "In this story, I\u2019m answering a legitimate question we get asked all the time \u2014 what\u2019s the point of buying your startup offering versus running Spark on Kubernetes the open-source way. The short answer is:", "But let\u2019s support these points with facts and illustrations! What do we add on top of Spark-on-Kubernetes open-source?", "Data Mechanics users get a dashboard where they can view the logs and metrics for each of their Spark applications. They can also access the Spark UI, soon-to-be replaced with our homegrown monitoring tool called Data Mechanics Delight. The goal of this project is to make it easy for Spark developers to troubleshoot their application when there\u2019s a failure, and to give them high-level recommendations to increase its performance when necessary (for example around data partitioning and memory management).", "They also have access to a \u201cJobs UI\u201d which gives a historical graph of your pipelines main metrics like the volume of data processed, the duration, and the costs. So that your team can easily make sure that your production pipelines are running as expected, as well as to track your costs when necessary.", "The Data Mechanics platform automatically and dynamically optimises your pipelines infrastructure parameters and Spark configurations to make them fast and stable.", "Here are the settings that we tune:", "We do this by analysing the logs and metrics of your applications, and using the history of the past runs of your applications to find out its bottleneck and optimise it.", "In addition to automated tuning, our platform also implements automated scaling at the level of your Spark application (aka dynamic allocation) and at the level of the Kubernetes cluster. This means we manage the Kubernetes node pools to scale up the cluster when you need more resources, and scale them down to zero when they\u2019re unnecessary. We also make it easy to use spot nodes for your Spark executors to reduce your cloud costs further.\u200d", "Finally we offer a list of Spark images (Spark 2.4, Spark 3.0, \u2026) which contain optimised connectors to common data sources and sinks. You can either use these images directly, or use them as a base to build your own Docker Images with your custom dependencies.", "The goal of these optimizations is to give our customers the maximum performance Spark can provide and hence reduce their cloud costs. The management fee that we charge for our services is more than compensated by the savings we enable on their cloud provider bill. In fact we\u2019ve helped some of our customers reduce their total costs by 50 to 75% as they migrated from competing platforms.", "Data Mechanics has integrations with notebooks services (like Jupyter, JupyterLab, JupyterHub) and scheduler/workflows services (like Airflow).", "Since our platform is deployed on a Kubernetes cluster that you have control over, the full ecosystem of Docker/Kubernetes compatible tools is also available to you. And since we\u2019re deployed inside your cloud account, inside your VPC, you can also easily build your own integrations with your home-grown tools inside your company\u2019s network.", "As a managed service, we take care of the setup and the maintenance of your infrastructure. When you sign up for Data Mechanics, you give us scoped permission on your cloud account, and we use these permissions to create the Kubernetes cluster, keep it up-to-date with the latest security fixes, and push releases with new features every two weeks.", "It\u2019s also our responsibility to keep your deployment secure. We can deploy within your company\u2019s VPC and make your cluster private, so that it can only be accessed through your company\u2019s VPN. We give you the tools to apply the security best practices with multiple options for data access and for user authentication (Single Sign On).", "We\u2019re trying to build the data platform you would build for yourself \u2014 in an open and transparent way. We\u2019re proud to build on top of open-source projects and contribute to many of them:", "This being said, there are still many reasons why some companies don\u2019t want to use our services \u2014 e.g. compliance/security rules that forbid the use of third-party services, or the fact that we\u2019re not available in on-premise environments. If you are in this scenario, the following article may be interesting to you \u2014 it\u2019s an in-depth guide that explains how to achieve a lot of the functionality we\u2019ve built internally, the open-source way: How to Setup, Manage & Monitor Spark on Kubernetes.
