It is most known for being able to generate random human faces that look very realistic. They also provide pre-trained models for generating cars, which is what I have used in this project.", "A typical Generator network of any GAN method uses an image of random noise pixels drawn from a Gaussian Distribution as a starting point. It then learns to convert this noisy image to the target distribution, which is the image of a car in our case.", "The Generator uses several Convolutional layers to learn this target distribution using thousands of image samples for its training process. However, StyleGAN works a little bit different. It introduces an additional mapping network in between the input noise and the Convolutional layers. The mapping network consists of only Fully Connected layers that take in this noise image and convert it to some meaningful latent space representations.", "This intermediate latent space contains multiple layers where each layer indicates a specific styling element that needs to be used by the Generator when trying to generate the image of a car. So, one layer may contain the information about the color of the car, the other may contain information about the position and angle, like front view or rear view. One layer may contain the information of the design of the headlights and so on and so forth.", "Now comes the generator of the StyeGAN model. This model uses a constant image of a small scale as a starting point which is learned during the training process. Several Upsampling and Convolutional layers process this input. The intermediate latent representations from the mapping network are used here at different levels to control the design of the output car image. This is how StyleGAN is able to generate random car images.", "While we can use StyleGAN to convert random noise inputs to look like cars, we cannot control the design elements of the car. In other words, we cannot control what the output of the mapping network will be for any given input. So, if we want to generate car with specific styling traits for the Tesla CyberTruck, we will somehow need to modify this style latent to fit the CyberTruck\u2019s description. Only then we can use the synthesis network to visualise the final output image of the car.", "Thankfully, someone found a clever work around for this problem. The github repo called StyleGAN-Encoder will help us out here.", "Using this encoder, we can train another neural network which acts as a \u201cReverse Generator\u201d. It can take the image of any car, like a Tesla Model X, as its input and produce the corresponding latent space as its output. Once the latent space is available, we can make modifications to that and alter the design of the input car as per our wish. Pretty clever, right?", "So, here\u2019s how this Reverse Generator works. First, we use a pretrained ResNet model to convert an image of the car whose design we want to alter and convert it to the style latent as its output. Generating the training data for this is very easy, we can simply use the StyleGAN Generator to produce practically infinite input-output sample pairs. Using this, we can get a fairly decent estimate of the latent space produced by the Mapping Network of StyleGAN.", "But, there\u2019s still some more optimisation that needs to be done. Once we get this rough estimate of the style latent from ResNet, we can use it to generate the corresponding image of the car. Loss function can now be defined by the VGG perceptual loss metric that measures how different the two output images look visually. This is a more robust metric than something like mean squared error for comparing visual similarity between images.", "Now, in order to optimise the style latent, all we need to do is backpropagate through this combined network while keeping all network weights fixed. The only parameter that is allowed to be trained here is the input style latent. Hence, after a few iterations of training, you can quickly converge to the best possible estimate of the style latent.", "We are now ready to play around with this style latent by combining these latents of different cars and picking and choosing which design elements we want to choose from which car. Then, we can simply use the StyleGAN Generator to produce results that mix the designs of multiple cars.", "I must admit, playing with this latent space is the most fun you can have when working with GANs!", "I played around with this AI and got some interesting predictions about the design of upcoming Tesla CyberTruck. I mixed different design styles into the latent space of an old school pickup truck and obtained the StyleGAN output, as shown below.", "I vote for option 2 to be closest to the real thing. But, what do you guys think? Do you think the CyberTruck will look like any of these predicitons or do you think it wil look completely different, something that we have never seen before? Let me know in the comments down below!", "Thank you for reading.
