Do consulting companies predominantly hire extroverts. Sentiment analysis of LinkedIn summary."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Walkthrough of a project my team worked on to use text written by a person to try and unwrap their personality. This could be huge for the HR industry where they could do away with online tests and use a more informal approach to identify the appropriate candidate. The idea is to break down the project, communicate our thought process and the motivation behind it.", "Think about the last time you applied to a job. If you have a half-decent resume and meet the firm\u2019s minimum criteria for the role you get a standardised email from HR to complete an online assessment. If the role is technical, you will have specific questions in relation to your education. In most of the cases, however, it is a formal test used by the company to assess your personality type. This information is used to determine a candidate\u2019s fit for the position and organisation.", "I remember after during the final year of my undergraduate degree, I pretty much applied to any company that was offering a Graduate Program. I used to fill in the required application, answer those generic questions and attach my resume. Then the very next day, either one of two things used to happen. Either I\u2019d get a flat out rejection email where the company would thank me for my interest and talk about how after careful consideration they were not able to proceed with my application. Or the other outcome would be they were pleased to invite me to complete an interactive graduate assessment. By interactive, they usually referred to an online form with a checkbox in which you can tick if you strongly agreed or disagreed with a standard statement.", "One of the Big 4 firms had invited me to a similar assessment. The statement on the psychometric test being \u201cI find it difficult to approach others\u201d to which I was meant to tick:", "Well, the truth is that I do in fact find it difficult to approach others. So ideally, I should have selected \u2018Agree\u2019 with that statement, but when you are completing an assessment for one of the largest professional services companies in the world, you check \u2018Strongly Disagree\u2019 without even batting an eye!", "Accurate personality estimation is difficult and can be falsified to some extent by a candidate, as I did. Given that employment is often associated with significant financial and social benefits, job seekers are incentivised to portray themselves in a way that best reflects the characteristics of an \u2018ideal\u2019 candidate. This can lead candidates to mask their true personality and results in inaccurate test assessments, particularly when carried out under formal environments. In contrast, the assessment of personality in relaxed or informal environments may lead to more representative estimations of an individual\u2019s personality.", "To this end, we created a personality trait estimator that takes informal written text as input and gives personality estimates based on the sixteen Myers-Briggs personality type indicator dimensions. Basically trying to predict your personality based on what you have written.", "The Myers-Briggs Personality Type Indicator (MBTI) is a personality type system that assesses an individual\u2019s character trait along four dimensions:", "The original test consists of a self-reported questionnaire that seeks to categorise respondents into 16 personality type profiles (the possible combinations of the above dimensions) and is commonly used to gauge a person\u2019s preference towards self-expression, information processing, planning, and decision making.", "We have treated personality trait detection as a supervised learning problem. Our process was to train four classifiers to predict a binary outcome for each of the four MBTI types. So essentially for an excerpt of text, each classifier would predict one of the four dimensions for the MBTI personality types.", "Two training corpora were used in the development of our classifiers, whilst a third dataset was used for the company profile mapping portion of this work.", "The process above summarizes the steps taken to generate a final list of tokens that were used to create the term-document matrix. This matrix contains the frequency of words that occur in corpora, it is used extensively in the field of text analytics to perform tasks such as document similarity or sentiment analysis.", "Whilst many of the steps follow standard convention, the nature of the source text meant that we also removed URLs and emails, as well as references to MBTI types and Reddit subreddit URLs. To reduce feature sparsity, a lemmatisation process was adopted to reduce words to their base form, and lemmatisation was selected over stemming to retain as much meaning in the base words as possible. Punctuation and capitalisation were also initially considered, however, we could not find any meaningful predictive power in them after a preliminary investigation, and thus punctuation removal and case lowering were also carried out during the tokenisation process.", "We followed a method consistent with that found in the literature and represented the text as a weighted term-document matrix using word-unigrams. Preliminary experimentation found that (word) bi-grams and tri-grams representations degraded predictive performance and introduced sparsity in the term-document matrix. Similarly, character n-grams produced unfavourable results, and so were not used in the term weighting process. Finally, a tf-idf (term frequency-inverse document frequency) weighting process was used to convert the term-document matrix into a normalised feature representation of the text used by the classifiers. We used a combination of regular expression, SpaCy and scikit-learn methods to achieve these transformations. Preliminary experimentation identified that only the top 2,000 most frequently occurring unigrams was needed for adequate classification performance. In addition to the tf-idf matrix, several other features were added to try and capture the nuance of emotional expression and personality in text, which is described below.", "Linguistic FeaturesStudies by (Mairesse et al., 2006; Mehl et al., 2006) note that extroversion is marked by greater use of verbs, adverbs and pronouns. Sentences of extroverted types also tend to be simpler with fewer words, lower lexical diversity, and fewer negations. Conversely, introverts generally use more negating words and use a wider vocabulary. To identify these differences, a formality score (Heylighen and Dewaele, 1999) was calculated for each user post:", "where the frequency is a part of speech measured as a fraction of the total number of words written in a sentence. Higher formality values indicate a less expressive tone in the text. Formality scores were calculated for each user post and recorded as an average formality score. The SpaCy POS (Parts of Speech)tagger was used to identify the parts of speech required in the equation.", "Additionally, several other features were also computed for each post to capture lexical diversity and word usage:", "Psycholinguistic featuresThe NRC (National Research Council) emotion lexicon (Mohammad and Turney, 2013) was used to identify words along eight basic poles:", "This lexicon was also used to determine the intensity of words along valence, arousal and dominance dimensions as well as two additional sentiment scores (positive and negative) for approximately 20,000 words. This gave a total of 13 scores per word. Each of the 13 NRC dimensions were converted to features by weighting the value of the individual NRC word values by their frequency in each user post and representing each feature as a fraction of the total words written in each post. This produced 13 NRC feature vectors for each post that were concatenated onto the tf-idf matrix for classifier training.", "Personality trait estimation in this work consists of predicting the four MBTI dimensions as four separate binary outcomes. So basically given a text, we would try to predict 4 different outcomes from it, i.e.", "Five classifiers were constructed and used to determine each of the four personality dimensions:", "A random forest classifier had been chosen because the tree structure permits an understanding of the decision logic used to arrive at predictions. SVM and LR classifiers are frequently reported in the literature as popular choices for personality prediction from text. A (Bernoulli) Nai\u0308ve Bayes classifier is used as a control to test the independence assumption between features (or tokens). Since emotion is often derived from not just words but also their relation to other words in a sentence, one would expect a Nai\u0308ve Bayes classifier to perform poorly at text classification. Finally, a majority class classifier is used as a baseline classifier to compare performance against the other four classifiers.", "The final features we used in constructing our personality classifier were: word unigrams, fraction of URLs shared, fraction of emoticons used; average formality score; type-to-token ratio; average words per sentence; average word length; as well as NRC emotion, valence, arousal, dominance and sentiment. We consider that each of these features, which are also used in literature, to reflect individual personality patterns to some degree.", "The figure above summarises classifier performance using ROC curves and associated AUC scores using a 30% hold out for testing. The LR classifier achieves the highest accuracy over the MBTI types. All classifiers achieve lower accuracy on the Judging/Perceiving and Intuiting/Sensing dimensions, whereas Thinking/Feeling is generally associated with the highest accuracy excluding the SVM classifier.", "All classifiers generally perform well on the in-sample testing portion of this work, and the accuracies achieved are comparable to similar work on personality prediction from text found in literature (Gjurkovic\u0301 and S\u030cnajder, 2018; Mairesse et al., 2007; Tchokni et al., 2014).", "Whilst the RF classifier achieves lower predictive accuracy compared to the other classifiers, it can be inspected to understand the decision process of text classification. To gain insight into what words might be significant in signalling certain MBTI types, the 20 most relevant features for each dimension from the trained RF classifier are shown in the figure above.", "The number-letter-number tokens (7w8, 7w6, 8w7) in the I-E dimension correspond to personality descriptions from the enneagram system that was unknown during the tokenisation process. The I-E dimension is also marked by the use of internet culture elements such as emoticons (:D), and slang (lol). Features of the T- F dimension respond strongly to words of positive affection and emotion (such as feel, love, beautiful), whereas the judging and perceiving dimension appears to be signalled by terms associated with rationalisation and analysis (work, time, think, need, plan). The intuiting and sensing features generally do not correspond to any concrete theme \u2014 whereas other types are triggered by at least one strong feature, there is no such feature for the N-S dimension. This lack of distinction may be the reason for the general difficulty in accurately predicting the N-S dimension by the RF classifier.", "A 16-way confusion matrix for the LR classifier is shown in the figure above. The classifier tends to achieve the greatest accuracy predicting introvert-intuition types, and lower accuracy for extrovert-sensing types. This may reflect the class imbalance in the training data as there are relatively few of these type combinations in the training set. Given that these types are naturally rare in everyday life, and that the N-S and J-P dimensions are generally more difficult to express through text, the classifier\u2019s inclination towards more concrete types is expected.", "Nevertheless, notice that the density of correct predictions tends to be grouped around similar personality types with similar dimensions, such as INTP and INTJ. This reflects the innate similarity observed between these types, which humans might also struggle to distinguish. Thus, the classifier has managed to identify this nuance.", "In previous sections, we describe the development of several personality classifiers and their accuracy with respect to in-sample testing. In this section, we document our analysis of our best classifier (LR) by analysing its performance out-of-sample on peers.", "A two-part questionnaire was developed to identify a respondent\u2019s personality using the LR classifier. Users were first asked to complete the Myers-Briggs questionnaire and then provide written responses to the following questions:", "These responses were then used to estimate their personality with the classifier.", "Assessment of a sample responseThe following excerpt was written by one of the respondents:", "\u201cA very passionate and enthusiastic individual who believes in living life to its fullest. Absolutely love the performing arts and fashion. I\u2019m good at being able to empathise with those around me and also very persistent in achieving my goals. Love being able to influence such a variety of individuals about decisions that directly impact their lives. Being able to be the balance between a company\u2019s vision and its biggest asset, the people and their needs.\u201d", "Their MBTI personality type (as determined by the questionnaire) is given as ENFJ.", "Whereas the classifier predicted the person\u2019s personality type as ENFP (figure above), and thus successfully classified three out of the four MBTI dimensions. The misclassified dimension (J-P) estimated the respondent as 48% J and 52% P, suggesting low confidence of the J-P dimension by the classifier. We argue the classifier has managed to identify the expressive tone of the sample response, predicting 75% extroversion and 64% feeling.", "The proximity of the results reinforces the notion that personality is fluid and depends on many factors. In this sense, it may be more appropriate to report personality in terms of likelihoods manifested on a scale rather than in absolute terms. The additional detail from such a representation may be helpful for recruiters.", "Overall Accuracy of the Peer Testing experimentAs part of the experiment, we were able to collect data on 15 different individuals. The results from the MBTI questionnaire responses were compared against those from the classifier and the results summarised in the table below.", "The sample size of the experiment is relatively small, so these results only serve as a baseline to understand the utility of the classifier. The predictions are different from that of the MBTI score and noticeably worse than the in-sample accuracies. This result highlights the fact that personality prediction is challenging, particularly when only written text is used to form the predictions.", "Personality is a mosaic of many factors, and the personality of two individuals sharing the MBTI type are still likely to differ from each other. We investigated this idea by comparing the classifier results of two respondents with the same questionnaire-based MBTI type, ISFJ.", "The classifier predictions are shown in the figure above, with respondents A and B predicted as ISFP and ISTJ, respectively. Even though both the candidates are self-identified introverted sensing types, free text reveals that Respondent A is more introverted (78%) than Respondent B (58%) and similarly, Respondent B is more inclined to sensing (73%) than Respondent A (52%).", "Being able to estimate personality in terms of affinity to a dimension reveals a more detailed personality landscape. Hence, by assessing natural language, organisations might be better equipped to quickly identify differences in personality, even if they are of the same base type.", "Now we come to the intriguing part of the project, the reason you have kept reading on until now. The objective was simple, it was to determine if our classifier can be used to derive insights about different companies and their culture through employee profile summaries.", "We decided to try out a very common hypothesis:\u201cConsulting firms tend to favour Extroverts over Introverts\u201d", "Profile summaries of employees of the \u201cBig 4\u201d consultancies (Deloitte, Ernst & Young, KPMG and PwC) were collected and then passed through the personality classifier. Several conditions were imposed during the collection process:", "Approximately 2,500 profiles were collected satisfying these conditions, which were then processed. The figure below shows the mean percentage of extroverts in the Big 4 from the sample. All four companies are estimated to contain more than 50% extroverts, which lends itself to our initial hypothesis.", "However, the difference between the four companies is small (57.8% Deloitte to 60.7% Ernst and Young) based on the 2,500 sample size.", "To gain a sense of the distribution of extroverts within each company, all extroverted profiles were then ranked from highest extroversion score to lowest. The 100 highest ranked extroverted profiles (with a score of 85% and above) within each company was then collected, and this is shown in the figure below.", "From this perspective, Ernst & Young contains a greater number of extremely extroverted employees (nearly 40%) compared to the other three consultancies. This might suggest that Ernst & Young is more traditional in terms of the work they do and their employee composition, whilst KPMG appears to be more balanced.", "One conjecture might be that as consultancies undertake more technology orientated work, these firms need to expand their capability with divisions with technology specialisation (for instance Deloitte Digital in Deloitte and Solution 49x in KPMG). These divisions tend to hire more technically oriented (introverted) workers, which balances out the introversion-extroversion distribution at these firms.", "Whilst the above results are contingent on many factors (with classifier accuracy being possibly the most important), this analysis highlights the potential benefit using personality estimation from free text as means to help understand abstract themes such as company culture and fit.", "The final features we constructed reflect what is used in literature; and what we consider to be a by-product of individual personality patterns. Using the RF classifier, we found that words of positive affection and emotion (such as feel, love, and beautiful) are strongly reflective of the T-F dimension. In comparison, the judging and perceiving dimension appears to be associated with terms of rationalisation and analysis (such as work, time, think, need and plan).", "We also found that Logistic Regression achieves the highest in-sample accuracy over the MBTI types; being able to successfully identify the nuances between similar dimensions. This performance is comparable to that found in literature. Nine features in addition to word n-grams were considered, however they did not offer much predictive power for this task.", "In assessing the preference of the Big 4 consultancy firms for extroverted individuals, we found that Ernst & Young has a significantly higher preference, based on \u2018extreme extrovert\u2019 employees as classified from their LinkedIn profiles.", "On reflection, the classifier appears to identify some of the nuance associated with a personality from text, however, its performance could also be improved, and we note that the majority of the predictive power has come from word unigrams alone. Better estimates might be achieved if information other than text were also used. For the application of company profile mapping, a dataset aligned closer to the language and features used on LinkedIn could have been used. Hence, profile meta-features, such as the number of connections, frequency of posts, education, and gender might be better discriminators of personality (in a professional context) in general.", "An interactive Jupyter notebook, using the LR classifier mentioned in the article was created for your reference.
