The ease of using the programming language, its efficiency in real-time as well as non-real-time systems, and its wide collection of life-saving packages are just some of the reasons why developers love Python.", "Programming languages like Python give you the freedom to turn your dream project into reality and showcase your talent to the world. This is why we are going to explore a handful of top Python projects available on GitHub to not only inspire you but to also give you a taste of what you can do with an innovative mind and Python.", "GitHub is clearly home to a wide majority of code online. Python being an amazing and versatile programming language that it is has been used by thousands of developers to build all sorts of fun and useful projects. In the following section, we will try to cover some of the best projects on GitHub that are built using Python.", "But before diving into this you can also check out some cool Python Project Ideas for Python Developers here \u2014", "Manim stands for Mathematical Animation Engine. The idea behind this project is to make it easier for people to integrate fun and intuitive animations with graphs and charts in Math teaching material, breaking away from the stereotype that learning Math has to be boring.", "Grant runs a YouTube channel called 3Brown1Blue, where he uses the manim library to create and control these animations as required, to teach higher Mathematics to its audience. Using manim, you can also create animated videos with precise control over the animations used for your charts and illustrations. If this seems like a fun idea to you, you should check out his channel to see the library in action.", "DeepFaceLab is one of the most fun GitHub projects on Python on this list. DeepFaceLab is a tool that can create deep fakes images and videos, allowing you to do a lot of fun stuff such as change, de-age, and swap faces. To make things more compelling, you can even change their speech, although this requires proficiency in video editing software.", "The developer claims that more than 95% of deep fake videos on the internet have been created with this tool. You can find the set-up guide and a bunch of facesets to get yourself started on the project\u2019s GitHub page.", "Airflow is an open-source workflow management tool from the Apache Software Foundation that is powered by Python. Airflow lets you perform a range of activities on your workflows, such as authoring, scheduling, and monitoring them. Workflows, when defined as code, become much easier to manage, test, and collaborate.", "It offers scalability, dynamic pipeline generation, and extensibility. The simple user interface makes working with Airflow smooth, and its robust integration capabilities with other tools and services help in getting the most out of it by saving time. Airflow is actively being used by some of the big names in the industry, such as Adobe, Lyft, Slack, Expedia, and more.", "GPT-2 is a huge transformer-based language model that is trained on an equally massive dataset, text from over 8 billion web pages, to be exact. The goal? Predict the next word/s when given a set or all of the previous words from a context.", "In simpler terms, you give GPT-2 some text, and the language model will predict and generate a lengthy continuation of the text of extraordinary quality.", "The GitHub repo has the code and the models for OpenAI\u2019s paper \u201cLanguage Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners\u201d, while the page mentions the description and a few of caveats of GPT-2.", "Cross-Site Scripting, aka XSS, is a vulnerability that can be extremely annoying and harmful for websites. By injecting malicious code from the client\u2019s side, the attacker can cause damage to the website and the data beyond control. s0md3v\u2019s XSStrike is essentially an XSS detection suite that is unique in itself.", "The developer claims that instead of simply testing random payloads, his tool analyzes the websites and generates specially engineered payloads that work. Some of the various features of this tool include:", "Hardik Vasa\u2019s script lets you download hundreds of images off Google to your computer at once. The way this tool works is you install the library, use the command, mention your desired keywords as arguments, and let the tool work its magic. rebound essentially searches for the images with the specified keywords in Google Images\u2019 index, and once found downloads them.", "You can also use the library from another Python file, and it would still work as usual. A fun and useful project indeed, if you ever need to download images from Google in bulk in one go.", "Photon is a powerful and easy to use web-crawler that is built using Python. s0md3v\u2019s lightweight and fast crawler follow the guidelines and methodologies from the Open-Source Intelligence framework, which allows the collection and analysis of information acquired from open or public sources.", "Some of the many sources Photon can crawl information from include:", "Photon saves all the extracted information in an organized manner, which can even be exported as a JSON file. The tool also offers various options to customize its working, such as controlling the timeout, excluding some URLs, and so much more that we recommend you give it a deep dive.", "At its core, NeuralTalk is an image captioning project in Python and NumPy that used Multimodal Recurrent Neural Networks. Thanks to the improvements in the technology and better hardware support, the developer released NeuralTalk2, which is leagues better and faster than the original NeuralTalk.", "Using a batched implementation, NeuralTalk2 still makes use of RNNs and is based on Torch, and can run on a GPU while supporting CNN finetuning. Although the developer has deprecated the original NeuralTalk, it is still available on GitHub for anyone to take a look.", "Pronounced as conch, you can think of Xonsh as a cross-platform shell language that is powered by Python. Xonsh makes working with Python, even the most basic of its tasks, miles better as it is integrated deeply within Xonsh.", "With Xonsh, instead of typing \u201c$ echo 2+2\u201d, you could get away with using just $ 2+2, and it would still give you the correct result. How simple is that!", "Getting started with Xonsh shell is super easy too, just install it with the right command for your environment and you\u2019re all set. Xonsh is available for many package managers, including pip, Conda, Apt, Brew, and more. As for its features, Xonsh is easily scriptable, has a large standard library with typed variables, and much more.", "Compiler errors can often be extremely frustrating and confusing. The only solution there is then is to head over to Stack Overflow or read the documentation. Jonathan Shobrook and his famous tool rebound, has found a way to make your life easier while dealing with those pesky compiler errors.", "The way rebound works is that you run your file with the tool, and it will check for any compiler errors present in the file and fetch you any related Stack Overflow threads it can find.", "Rebound\u2019s ability to load threads within the terminal as well as in the browser can be a life-saver for not just rookies but also veteran coders, saving their time in endlessly searching for answers. At the moment, rebound only supports Python, Node.js, Ruby, Golang, and Java.", "Creativity also has no limits. GitHub projects like these that are the perfect showcase of people\u2019s creativity and talent. But this is just the tip of the iceberg as Python can be used to carry out a broad range of activities, granted you have the know-how and a clear picture of what you want to achieve. As Python continues to evolve, more and more developers will start to use it to build amazing and resourceful projects like the ones we mentioned above. Let this article be a source of inspiration for you to wake up that sleeping idea in your mind and set things into motion.", "Note: To eliminate problems of different kinds, I want to alert you to the fact this article represent just my personal opinion I want to share, and you possess every right to disagree with it.", "If you have more suggestions or ideas, I\u2019d love to hear about them.", "I hope you\u2019ve found this article useful!
