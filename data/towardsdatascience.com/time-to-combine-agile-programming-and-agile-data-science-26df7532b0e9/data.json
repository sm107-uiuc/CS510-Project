Now, in our final part of the series, we address how the model lifecycle and the agile software development methodology should come together.", "Based on our previous discussions, we are primarily concerned with how the model lifecycle process \u2014 with its iterative value discovery, value delivery and value stewardship \u2014 can be combined with the traditional agile software development methodology. The emphasis of this article is on the combination of the two methodologies; it is not about making data science or model lifecycle agile. The model lifecycle process itself is both iterative and agile.", "The roots of agile can be traced back to agile manufacturing in the 1930s. In their article on \u201cThe Secret History of Agile Innovation,\u201d the authors \u2014 Darrell Rigby, Jeff Sutherland and Hirotaka Takeuchi \u2014 note this historical context.", "Some trace agile methodologies all the way back to Francis Bacon\u2019s articulation of the scientific method in 1620. A more reasonable starting point might be the 1930s when the physicist and statistician Walter Shewhart of Bell Labs began applying Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA) cycles to the improvement of products and processes. Shewhart taught this iterative and incremental-development methodology to his mentee, W. Edwards Deming, who used it extensively in Japan in the years following World War II.", "One of the early uses of the concept of agility in software (e.g., its continuous and iterative nature) goes back to the 1950s. According to experts Craig Larman and Victor Basili, Gerald Weinberg and Bernie Dimsdale at IBM\u2019s Service Bureau Corporation were doing incremental software development in Los Angeles as early as 1957. However, the birth of agile is usually credited to a 2001 conference in Snowbird, Utah. The following quote from an article in The Atlantic captures the spirit of this birth:", "But it was here, nestled in the white-capped mountains at a ski resort, that a group of software rebels gathered in 2001 to frame and sign one of the most important documents in its industry\u2019s history, a sort of Declaration of Independence for the coding set. This small, three-day retreat would help shape the way that much of software is imagined, created, and delivered \u2014 and, just maybe, how the world works.", "It was at this venue that the Agile Manifesto and the twelve principles of agile were born. It is worth going into the agile manifesto in detail so that we can develop an alternative manifesto for agile data science.", "The manifesto for agile software development consists of four key statements:", "The document goes on to state that while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more. So the agile mindset is additive to the existing best practices of its time rather than a replacement. Sometimes agile is used as an excuse for not providing comprehensive documentation or having an architectural design or plan for development. Ironically, agile itself has become more of a process and methodology, as opposed to focusing on individuals and their interactions.", "In his first book on Agile Data Science in 2013 and a revised version called Agile Data Science 2.0 in 2017, Russell Jurney demonstrates how to compose a data platform for building, deploying, and refining analytics applications. He defines the goal of agile data science as follows:", "The goal of the Agile Data Science process is to document, facilitate, and guide exploratory data analysis to discover and follow the critical path to a compelling analytics product.", "He then organizes his Agile Data Science Manifesto along the following seven principles.", "1. Iterate, iterate, iterate: tables, charts, reports, predictions.", "2. Ship intermediate output. Even failed experiments have output.", "3. Prototype experiments over implementing tasks.", "4. Integrate the tyrannical opinion of data in product management.", "5. Climb up and down the data-value pyramid as we work.", "6. Discover and pursue the critical path to a killer product.", "7. Get meta. Describe the process, not just the end state.", "These principles target a couple of the key differences between software and models that we outlined in our earlier article \u2014 primarily the development process that is centered around experiments and the inferencing mechanism based on induction that uses data.", "In our view this agile data science manifesto misses out on some key developments:", "Now we look at how we combine the agile software development and data science manifestos into what we call the Agile Software 2.0 Manifesto.", "Andrej Karpathy, the senior director of artificial intelligence at Tesla, introduced the term Software 2.0 and contrasted it with traditional programming, which he called Software 1.0. Specifically, he said:", "The \u201cclassical stack\u201d of Software 1.0 is what we\u2019re all familiar with \u2014 it is written in languages such as Python, C++, etc. It consists of explicit instructions to the computer written by a programmer. By writing each line of code, the programmer identifies a specific point in program space with some desirable behavior.", "In contrast, Software 2.0 can be written in much more abstract, human unfriendly language, such as the weights of a neural network. No human is involved in writing this code because there are a lot of weights (typical networks might have millions), and coding directly in weights is kind of hard (I tried).", "While Karpathy uses the word Software 2.0 only for systems developed using machine learning and deep learning, it is clear that we will need both 1.0 and 2.0 versions of software development to co-exist for the foreseeable future. As a result, we should be combining the key values of agile software development with agile model development. We view the objective of this combined manifesto as follows:", "We are uncovering better ways of developing software powered by (AI/ML) models by facilitating continuous integration (of data, software, and models), delivery, and (machine) learning.", "Extending the Agile Software Development Manifesto into the Agile Software 2.0 Manifesto, we have these four basic values:", "Having discussed the Agile Software 2.0 Manifesto I will go into the details of how to combine the agile software development lifecycle with the model development lifecycle that we discussed in my previous article.", "Given the fundamental differences between software and models \u2014 and the reasons mentioned above in the Agile Software 2.0 Manifesto \u2014 we need to separate the traditional agile software sprints from the model lifecycle in terms of the timing. At the same time, we do not want to run them as two separate and distinct agile cycles, as that would prevent us from realizing the full benefits of traditional software and models. So, what is the solution?", "One solution involves interleaving the sprint cycles and having a separate clock for software sprints and model sprints. There are a few key interaction points that are worth elaborating on in this interleaved process:", "In conclusion, Agile Software 2.0 needs to incorporate the leading agile methods from agile software development and agile data science to help generate ROI for clients that want to deploy software with AI/ML models embedded in them.", "The convergence of data, software, and AI/ML models is just beginning. Extensive software engineering, software development and maintenance methodologies don\u2019t exist for AI/ML models. Best practices are just emerging and the next decade will see more academic and industry advances in this area. We started this series with a claim that data scientists are from Mars and software developers are from Venus. These disciplines are coming together over the past couple of years. This five part series is just the beginning of what is likely to be a major area of focus for software developers and AI/ML modelers.", "Your home for data science.
