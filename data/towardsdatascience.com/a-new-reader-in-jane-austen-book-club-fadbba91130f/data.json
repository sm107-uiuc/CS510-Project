When computers claim to be capable of reading a Jane Austen novel in seconds, I am curious to find out what the computer actually understands, and what insight it can offer to the reader communities.", "spaCy is such a program: an amazing tool for Natural Language Processing (NLP). The research into NLP started as early as the 1950s, the first automatic machine translation developed by Georgetown University and IBM was running on mainframe computers. Since then, NLP has come such a long way that it works well on laptops now, and it can conveniently serve us as a reading companion.", "Let\u2019s read Jane Austen\u2019s Pride and Prejudice together with spaCy. I hope spaCy can meet our expectation of being knowledgeable and insightful. At least I already know that spaCy is very quiet, patient, and always ready to answer our questions.", "The digital version of this book is freely available at Gutenberg.org, which includes ePub and kindle versions for download, HTML for online reading; for our purpose to work with spaCy, plain text is the best.", "Like any Jane Austen fan must know, Austen only completed 6 novels before she died at age of 41. As of today, all 6 novels have been adapted as feature films or TV series multiple times, and the Jane Austen reader communities can be found all around the world. Why has Jane Austen become a household name two hundred years after her death?", "According to BBC, Prof John Mullan, Lord Northcliffe Professor of Modern English Literature at University College London, said Austen\u2019s enduring appeal boils down to one thing \u2014 her writing.", "\u2026 it\u2019s her stylistic brilliance, not what she\u2019s actually writing about that makes her unique. Technically, she was a revolutionary writer, even though we think of her as modest and conservative person. \u2014 John Mullan", "Let\u2019s analyze a classic of Jane Austen\u2019s novel. The story is always compelling, but let\u2019s focus on the actual words used by Austen this time.", "Chances are that you have read the book, perhaps more than once. I invite you to explore this book again and see what a computer can tell us. Do not be bothered by the details of coding if you are not a programmer. I will explain and visualize the findings.", "spaCy is open source, developed and maintained by explosion.ai. It runs on most computers. Let\u2019s read the book with spaCy. If you know Python and would like to follow along, install spaCy is easy. A quick start guide can be found on its official site, though, the following 2 lines should suffice.", "We need to clean up a little bit of the text file, to get rid of the publisher\u2019s notice and index, as those are not Austen\u2019s actual writing. After that, let\u2019s run Python and load spaCy. Reading the entire novel only takes a few seconds.", "Now spaCy has loaded the entire book in memory. Let\u2019s ask our first question to test what spaCy knows.", "spaCy can run a quick enquire on proper nouns, which will lead to an answer on this. As we already know that all Jane Austen\u2019s books are about people, so the results will have these familiar names of her characters, just as we expected.", "Let\u2019s clean this up a little bit, as we do not really want to count words like Mr. or Mrs..", "Rebecca Xu from Syracuse University created all the visualizations in this story. Here\u2019s a treemap from the top 50 proper nouns.", "Not with surprise, the name of Elizabeth appears most frequently; Bennet is her last name, but it could be associated with her sisters or parents; we should at least add Lizzy to the counts, the result is 730. The leading female character is mentioned 76% more than the leading male character, Mr. Darcy.", "Study shows that a sentence needs to be in a good range so it can be easily understood, in other words, the length of sentences is important for readability.", "A common plain English guideline says an average of 15\u201320 words (Cutts, 2009; Plain English Campaign, 2015; Plain Language Association InterNational, 2015).", "With spaCy, it is very easy to find out how Jane Austen did here. When spaCy reads the book, it already keeps track of the sentences and total word counts.", "The book of Pride and Prejudice has 156,644 words, written in 7,523 sentences. The average number of words in a sentence is 21.6. Jane Austen seemed to know this ahead of her time, as her sentences were well kept at the ideal length.", "Let\u2019s find the top 100 nouns used by Jane Austen.", "Notice that we are using token.lemma_ instead of token.text, as we should use the words in their base forms. For instance, the words sister and sisters are the same.", "Lemmatisation (or lemmatization) in linguistics is the process of grouping together the inflected forms of a word so they can be analysed as a single item, identified by the word\u2019s lemma, or dictionary form. \u2014 Wikipedia", "On the list of top 100 nouns by Austen, sister ranked highest, which is expected for this particular novel depicting sisterhood. Man(#3) is listed before friend(#5), family(#6), mother(#9), daughter(#10), father(#12), this is a story about finding the proper man.", "Let\u2019s analyze adjectives next as they are closely related to nouns.", "Here\u2019s what we get when we pull the list of most common verbs.", "As we can see, in the result, came and coming, think and thought are listed as different words. Not exactly ideal. Again, we can easily remedy this by lemmatization. Notice in the code block below, we change token.text to token.lemma_, as a result, the base form of the verbs are collected.", "Let\u2019s visualize this on a treemap.", "After analyzing verbs, let\u2019s take a look at adverbs.", "Let\u2019s put top-ranked nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs together to get an overall sense of Jane Austen\u2019s vocabulary.", "I put the source code on Github, for easy reference. The code below writes the results in CSV files, which can be used for further analysis and visualization.", "After using spaCy for a while, I genuinely felt like it had become a friend of mine; on a leisurely afternoon, I would like to take spaCy for a random walk and see what it can do for me.", "If you like Jane Austen\u2019s books and have a question, please respond to this story.
