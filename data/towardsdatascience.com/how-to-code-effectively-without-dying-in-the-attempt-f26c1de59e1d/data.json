But coding effectively might not. Nowadays many programmers encounter multiple situations that have significant impacts on their work\u2019s productiveness; some help them achieve their objectives in a faster and more efficient way while some others just contribute to stress them and stuck them on their tasks. Everyone has a different strategy to deal with those situations, either because they have been through them or because someone else has told them how to deal with them. Based on my colleagues\u2019 and personal experiences, and looking forward in helping new and experienced programmers on their careers, I would like to share the following 5 advices I have compiled for coding effectively that have worked for me so far in my professional career. Hope you find them useful.", "Most programming and coding jobs are flexible enough that allow to work from home, a common space, a library or even a coffee shop, without having to be at an office 8 hours per day 5 days per week. However, the working environment will always have a highly significant impact on your work productiveness. Find a place where you feel comfortable working at, away from distractions, noises and situations that can potentially slow your working pace. Identify the factors that make you more productive (e.g. a cup of coffee or tea, background music, illumination, amenities) and use them in your advantage. Think about it: there is a reason behind why Google and other companies\u2019 working spaces are getting away from the traditional working cubicles. Since they are very aware of how stressful spending 8 hours per day coding in front of a computer can be, they are constantly looking for ways of making their employees feel comfortable at their facilities. There is no surprise on why they are considered as the best companies to work at.", "It is impossible to know the syntax of all the libraries and functions that exist out there. For that reason, there are plenty of documentation and help resources that you can use whenever you have a question about a particular function or algorithm. Just type in the Google search bar \u201cHow to (your question) in (programming language)\u201d; chances are someone else has already had the same question and had posted it in stack overflow. You can also go directly to the libraries and packages\u2019 websites for reference (e.g. scikit-learn library for Python, ggplot2 package for R) or look at the available help documentation on the programming software itself (e.g. in R you can type help(\u201cfunction name\u201d) and you will see displayed the R documentation for that specific function). In the same way, if you have taken any online programming courses (e.g. Udemy, Coursera, DataCamp) that provided you code templates or notes, have them available on your computer for a quick reference. Finally, you can buy/download multiple programming \u201ccookbooks\u201d (e.g. R Cookbook by Paul Teetor) and textbooks related with statistical learning and machine learning (e.g. Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani). Remember that these resources are meant to be used for learning and for reference, but still it is up to you to master the concepts behind the algorithms and their coding syntax.", "I know what you are thinking of: the imposter syndrome. You might be afraid that asking others for help could make you \u2014 and/or them \u2014 feel that you do not have the skills or expertise to hold your current job as a programmer or software developer. But don\u2019t worry. Asking for help to someone who knows more and has more expertise than you represents a great opportunity for learning something new, improving your skills, and getting advice, all while being able to solve your coding errors. In the same way, it represents a sign of humility; you are implicitly telling others that you are open for feedback and constant learning. Data science and data analytic companies should encourage teamwork and collaboration between their employees rather than competition and rivalry; this could potentially lead to higher productivity levels and higher employee motivation. Knowledge is meant to be shared, not to be kept for oneself.", "Staring for too long at a laptop\u2019s monitor can produce headaches, blurry vision and dizziness, especially on people who wear glasses. Giving your eyes some rest by stopping staring at it for some minutes can recharge your energies to continue working productively. Whenever you need to develop a code that will take you long to be completed, give yourself a 5\u201310 minutes break every hour to stop staring at your laptop\u2019s monitor. Take a walk around your office, grab some healthy snacks, stretch out, go to a common area, or simply rest. It is good for your vision and for your health. Even though coding might sometimes be frustrating and time consuming, you are not a coding machine; remember that your health is strongly correlated with your working productiveness.", "Your code doesn\u2019t run. You tried to debug it. Still doesn\u2019t run. You think you might have found the error. Still doesn\u2019t run. You either want to throw your laptop against a wall or continue debugging it until it runs. If this situation sounds familiar to you: relax and don\u2019t stress out. There comes a time when we all get so cycled in our codes that we just can\u2019t simply find the error, no matter how insignificant it is (e.g. semicolon, typo). Pause your task for the rest of the day, work in a different task, or if it\u2019s too late, rest. There is nothing better than a pair of fresh eyes to resume your task. Programmers are commonly known for spending long working shifts coding and developing programs either at work, home or both. Social media are full of memes about programmers\u2019 social lives and daily routines. And even though I want to say they are funny and false, sometimes they are sad and true. Enjoy being a programmer and balance your life to make the best out of this amazing profession. Let machines do their work and let yourself be you.", "If you found this article useful, feel welcome to download my personal codes on GitHub.
