Greg goes in-depth into the data science workflow at IBM, what kinds of specific projects he takes on, and the TwitterBot piece he wrote on TDS that gave him a reputation as an NLP expert, which played a small part in landing his position at IBM.", "Interviewer: Haebichan Jung, Data Scientist at Recurly and Editorial Associate at TowardsDataScience.com", "Interviewee: Greg Rafferty, Lead Data Scientist at IBM", "Greg: I was mostly working with the US Government doing aid work. I was living in Armenia for several years and Russia for several years. It was not data science initially. I was mostly doing project management. I was working in clean energy projects. I have a background in mechanical engineering so I did a little bit of mechanical engineering on these projects. But it was mostly management. And after several years in Armenia, then I went to Russia, continued that work. Then I worked at a start up as a business analyst. That\u2019s when I got into tech. After that, I came to San Francisco and got into data science.", "It was both mix of personal and professional. I mentioned I was a mechanical engineer before. I was working in the mining industry and we had several clients in Russia and so I was working with them I started learning the language in order to better communicate. And while I was getting my MBA we had a sister school with St. Petersburg state university. So I had this really great opportunity to take a class there. I spent several months in St. Petersburg I loved it and so my career started building up this momentum with Russia and with former Soviet states. When the economy crashed in 2008, I had this opportunity to go to Armenia and work with the government on these aid projects. I\u2019d really wanted to try that out and it was good timing and I did.", "It was actually very smooth. I started as a mechanical engineer and I\u2019ve been moving towards project roles in managing people and my idea at the time was that I would continue with this company and I would lead some joint ventures abroad. In this company they had their respective MBAs, so I got my MBA through the company.", "They actually supported me on it so I continue to work while I was getting my MBA, which was rewarding but really intense. Having a full time job while being in school full time. It was a two year problem, and doing great, had a great time. And right when I finished the economy was crashing and the opportunities to be a manager in this company were really drying up at least for the next couple of years and so that\u2019s why I chose that time to try something new.", "As an engineer I use a lot of data and analytics. I would build simple regression models but nothing beyond excel. I started coding while I was in Moscow working with a start up. And that\u2019s when I built my deep models, not deep learning, but models that could be handled in excel. I really enjoyed it a lot. So when I got back to the U.S., my job was very tableau heavy and that was my first introduction to SQL.", "At that point, I started looking into more machine learning models, and I was really enjoying it. I then went to the bootcamp Galvanize in order to push myself up over the edge and really learn data science.", "Galvanize is a bootcamp. 3 month immersive program, full time, about 8\u201312 hours a day, 5\u20136 days a week. Only 3 months so you can really get it out of the way good and push yourself over the edge and get into data science. It really helps if you do have the foundational base, because it\u2019s not nearly as intense as a Masters program, for instance. So you do need to know what you\u2019re getting in to be able to fill in the gaps on your own.", "So I\u2019ve been working a lot with the Coursera platform to study data science on my own, and doing couple projects in Galvanize did another really big project, looking at Trump\u2019s Twitter stream. That sort of gave me a bit of a reputation with NLP (Natural Language Processing). IBM was looking for NLP Data Scientists. Through some connections, I was introduced to the hiring manager and it seems like a really great fit right off the bat. I moved to IBM directly from Galvanize and I spent about eighteen months into my time at IBM here.", "I\u2019ve been doing a lot of the A.I. work, a lot of NLP work, and some basic client-based analytics work. I\u2019m on a consulting team so I do travel a lot and I work with clients exclusively. A bunch of work I do is with a client with one of their use cases.", "One of the coolest projects I did, we called it \u201cunsupervised annotation\u201d and I actually applied a patent on that. I\u2019m hoping that comes through. What that does is it takes a corpus of tens of thousands of documents and it identifies what those documents are about. It clusters them and it applies annotation to those annotations so you can build a knowledge graph around them.", "IBM has a tool called Knowledge Studio and that is it\u2019s a manual annotation process and it takes roughly three weeks to build a model of manually annotation. That\u2019s very labor intensive, it\u2019s not interesting work, and it takes a a domain expert in order to do it. So you have to have a lawyer to annotate these documents for three weeks which is really not a good use of time.", "So what this tool does is, I use Word2Vec, and I use clustering, and then I use some feature extraction tools from IBM Watson API. Through this pipeline, it creates these annotations. It takes these documents and it creates this knowledge graph in the Knowledge Studio. That was the biggest project I worked on.", "Correct. This project is an internal one. We\u2019re fishing around for clients that may want to use it and if we can find one, then we will of course implement into one of our broader Watson products and then make that available to anyone. But for the time being it\u2019s still in the proof of concept stage.", "That\u2019s actually a very rare workflow. Only few teams take things to market using that method. Most places, the client comes up with the use case and IBM determines a solution to that and then builds a solution directly for that client. If that use case can be broadened to other clients, every contract is different. Sometimes the client owns the IP, sometimes IBM does, sometimes there\u2019s some sharing. But if IBM maintains control of the IP, then we\u2019ll build it for one client but then we\u2019ll sell it around other clients if it\u2019s applicable to other use cases.", "Some projects I\u2019ve been on are just one week and some can be several years. The longest project I\u2019ve done has been about six months. The project I\u2019m on right now is one where we have two year contract on this. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll be on the project that full time, because there\u2019s a lot of different work streams and depending on your skill set, different consultants hop in and hop off to fill in the gaps. But I know some consultants have done the same project for 12 years. There\u2019s all sorts of different types of projects, different arrangements. It just depends on your skill set.", "My team, the Applied AI team, we do get to work together a lot, but sometimes we will work completely independently on different projects. The project I\u2019m working on right now, I\u2019m actually leading the team. It was up to me to hire out. I have three offshore Data Scientists in India and then two onshore that are based locally. For the offshore ones, I wanted to hire people who I knew. I already knew the reputation of their skillset, so I took two people for my team.", "As a Data Scientist, there\u2019s a broad range of skills and the specific data science skills really depend on the project. That can be anything from NLP to deep learning to just basic analytics. But one thing that everyone at IBM has in common is that they\u2019re consultants. They need to be able to work with the client. They need to be in meetings with executives and be able to talk intelligently about solutions. And they need to sell products. That\u2019s not pushing solutions on to the client. That understanding the client\u2019s needs and understanding how we can help the client better. So when I say sell that\u2019s not where we are coming to them saying you need to buy this. But we\u2019re deeply understanding what they need and how we can improve them. It\u2019s not really aggressively selling. It\u2019s more passively selling, in that we show them the value and they say they want that. That\u2019s a skill that is very valuable to a consultant.", "It\u2019s interesting you brought that up. Last night I was having a conversation with one of our partners about this. He was saying that if you are in the top one percent in the technical skillset you\u2019ll be a rockstar IBM. If you\u2019re in the top one percent of the the soft skills of the client-focusing skills, you also will be a rockstar. But if you\u2019re below the top one percent then you really need to have both of those skillsets. So most people do need to have a client-based and a technical skillset.", "The idea for that came, it was when Trump just fired James Comey. He had fired him he tweeted out that it was a pity that he had to fire Mike Flynn because Flynn had lied to the FBI. Everyone had sort of come out and said well that would be an obstruction of justice. If you knew he lied to the FBI and you asked Comey not to investigate. Trump\u2019s rebuttal to that was that, well I didn\u2019t write the tweet, my lawyer did and he sent it.", "So what I said I was going to do was analyze his Twitter stream and try to determine who is writing these tweets, was it Trump or was it one of his aides. The way I could do that was that prior to his presidency, Trump always tweeted from an android device while his staff had always tweeted from iPhones. I had data of the tweets, and you can see the source. I used that source as a label and I built a model to determine who was tweeting. Then after that I built a TwitterBot with which it listened to Trump\u2019s Twitter stream, and whenever he tweeted, it would capture that tweet and would sent it to the model. It would then send another tweet saying Trump just tweeted this and I have ninety percent confidence that it was Trump that actually wrote it. After that, I wrote a long post on TowardsDataScience about the features I had built, about the results, and how I built the TwitterBot and took it live.", "For more on the TwitterBot, check out Greg\u2019s original post:", "I would say that the most important thing, especially if you are looking for your first job, is to get a Github page and populate it with really interesting projects. Projects that may not be directly relevant to a company, but you are so excited about you can\u2019t wait to tell people about. That enthusiasm really comes through in interviews. That\u2019s one of the key things I look for when I\u2019m interviewing people. Networking and then blogging about it is also really helpful because it really shows that enthusiasm. Make sure that really comes through in everything you do.", "Thanks again to Greg Rafferty for the interview.
