A roadmap and process overview | by Shirish Joshi | Towards Data Science", "h1": "Choosing a Database Technology", "description": "Helping Data architects choose the right Database technology - storage engine and processing engine. Relational, right tool for right application, NoSQL, Cloud Platform, all choices are to be considered. This is a process and roadmap to follow for selection."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["Choosing a database is a recent luxury that data architects are enjoying. In the past most often, it has been a decision that was taken previously, and something to be lived with. What with the huge baggage of incumbency, stored procedure code, and the all-too-fragile data pipeline that everyone was too afraid to re-engineer for fear of breaking. The database was often shared across applications or in many cases, functionalities were modules of a single application.", "It is different now in the world of multiple application and multiple databases, in what some authors call the world of Polyglot persistence.", "Majority of the cloud providers have their own technologies, and they try to steer users to the right database, based on the use case.", "Here is my roadmap of how to make the choices of technology in the database world. In some cases, you could also extend the methodology to cover general technology selection too.", "Based on my experience, the rough percentage of how such decisions are made in real life, are as follows :", "Technical capabilities, features and NFRs (non-functional requirements)", "Remaining list after discarding those that don\u2019t meet the qualifying criteria form the shortlist.", "Next, a very detailed list of requirements (across technical, cost, use case and suitability) and scoring criteria is drawn up. Usually this is done in a spreadsheet in the following format.", "It always helps to document why a particular score was assigned, or why a weight was assigned or adjusted. I can assure you that such an annotated document will be referenced multiple times in the organization, as the notes are as valuable as the scores assigned.", "The final discussion with the client is always on the basis of the spreadsheet, where the clients and their technical, business and IT teams can weigh in on the weights and adjust them.", "At the end of this process, usually 1\u20132 candidates bubble to the top.", "It is also my experience that during this process of shortlisting, or after the selection of the top 2\u20133, a structured PoC is needed, to make sure that the claims in documentation are real, and the limitations mentioned can be worked around.", "Each database has some core features, and some features added for purposes of \u201cticking a few boxes\u201d. The danger here is that these \u201cother\u201d features get abandoned over time as they don\u2019t get the attention they deserve.", "Databases are also not to be considered in isolation, but in the overall context of the ability to service the requests, the application architecture, and the business use case of the overall data flow.", "For the reasons above, and for optimal performance, sometimes it makes sense to have specialized data processing components, rather than a single database servicing all requests.", "Here you see technologies like SAS Grid, specialized data processing platforms like SciDB, or Intersystems Cache shine.", "In some ways, the Hadoop stack (File storage, Hive metadata store, HBase, Impala) or the various Spark components (GraphX, Spark SQL, Spark streaming, Mlib) are also a Hybrid DB architecture.", "General purpose databases still serve most needs. What is changing though is the shared model of database usage.", "Earlier, the sales and marketing, transaction, finance and accounting and servicing applications would all store the data within the same datastore (maybe same schema or different schema). Given the small sizes of data, large licensing costs, limited DBA budgets, this made sense. It did give advantages of a single storage location, less schema divergence, and less complexity.", "Now, there are separate datastores and databases per application. Data chasms have increased. The integration needs have increased with this uncoupling. Maintenance of common and master data has also increased. The analytics layer consumes data from all these disparate data sources now. APIs provide integration between applications. The duality of enterprise application integration (EAI) and extract-transform-load or extract-load-transform (ETL/ELT), and the overlapping roles of the two have increased, with a hybrid mix of both, leading to more complexity, and sometimes more cost and overheads.", "As data architects, making the right technology choices is important. Balancing the need for suitability, with the need to reduce the complexity and cost of the operations and integrations, and the need to keep the stack from expanding out of control, and proliferate. The case for using the right databases and data stores should be made for the right applications and use cases only.", "Your home for data science.
