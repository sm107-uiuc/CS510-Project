This work benefits the American public by identifying those factors conducive to various types of traffic incidents, predicting accident severity, and using this information to minimize this risk.", "The full code is found at my GitHub repo", "Predict the severity of accident as \u20181\u2019 or \u20182\u2019 using features including the number of cars and people, traffic, weather conditions, etc. This is a classification problem that \u2014 once modeled \u2014 gives Seattle City authorities previously unavailable insight into accident risk factors, and also gives this author the necessary completion to gain a Coursera Professional Certification.", "The raw data used is provided by the Seattle DOT with the following steps applied:", "Step 1: data loading and preliminary insights", "Step 2: detailed analysis of feature visualization. The goal is to understand potentially leveraging input variables", "Step 3: feature engineering and selection", "Step 4: model fitting and training", "Step 5: model evaluation, with sensitivity check using auto-machine learning (also referred to as AutoML)", "Step 6: concluding takeaways for the client", "Steps 1 and 2: taken together here. The traffic data is loaded and analyzed using Seaborn visualization tools \u2014 our goal is to understand data distributions, attributes, and implications for predicting vehicle accident severity.", "The Seaborn visualizations were uninformative and can be found at the repo \u2014 they are not published here, given the absence of value addition to this post. Therefore, I analyzed the data and some explanatory Seattle DOT literature to decipher features.", "Many of the features were unique identifiers used by the Department of Transportation and provide in predicting accidents. These include incident key, intersection key, collision detail key, seg lane key, and crosswalk key.", "ObjectID is unique in that while it is also a classifier courtesy of the DOT, it does not duplicate information explicitly available in another feature.", "There are many features that are binary and non-numerical i.e. answerable via a simple yes or no. These include a check of whether: speeding was a factor, the pedestrian had right of way, inattention or DUI were contributing factors or a parked car was hit.", "Finally, there were other non-numerical features, which had more than two possible entries. These covered factors like lighting and road conditions, the type of junction that saw the accident, and the date/time of the incident. I\u2019m classifying time as non-numerical for purposes of this article since it\u2019s a datetime object per Python.", "Step 3: the list specified above compels a methodical approach when considering what to include/exclude and what type of feature engineering might be needed. We want to ensure the inclusion of influential factors without increasing unnecessary complexity that leads to overfitting", "What approach preserves the most useful information and removes unnecessary features that add complexity?", "Let\u2019s first remove features that are administrative tools for the Seattle DOT. These include report number, incident key, and intersection key, and status. Let\u2019s also delete the columns \u2018EXCEPTRSNCODE\u2019 and \u2018EXCEPTRSNDESC\u2019 after removing the rows that had entries in these columns \u2014 these existed simply to inform the reader that an incident lacked enough information.", "Let\u2019s also remove the coordinates x and y since they are centered around one to two specific areas and are assumed to hold no predictive insight.", "Any non-numeric feature will require encoding to convert to numbers that can be processed by a machine learning algorithm. Encoding can be either ordinal or one-hot: I pursued the latter since none of these variables held any inherent order that I wanted to preserve. Features impacted with this approach include address type, road and lighting conditions, whether a parked car was hit, collision key, weather, and junction type.", "Finally, I used the incident date and time to extract the month and time. The time was translated to morning, noon, or evening and subsequently, this detail was one-hot encoded. I saw this as relevant, given driving accidents can increase at late nights / early mornings or when seasons render roads trickier to navigate", "Before we move on to model evaluation, let\u2019s take a look at how the steps above changed some key features in our dataset. Here\u2019s a snapshot of the before:", "Here\u2019s a snapshot of the dataset after \u2014 in this excerpt, we see that address type is encoded as is speeding and whether pedestrian had right of way. This is on the training data, having earlier completed a train-test-split:", "With the requisite Feature Engineering and Selection completed, I then selected a list of classifiers \u2014 including Dummy for baseline, trained them, and evaluated their performance on the test set using a number of metrics. The code snippet follows.", "Step 5: I\u2019ve summarized model performance in the following Excel table. Best practices suggest using multiple metrics to evaluate performance:", "The table above demonstrates F1 scores in the mid-80s and log-loss scores below 0.5, which is an improvement over the Dummy Classifier\u2019s baseline performance. We\u2019ll talk about the implications for the metrics above for our client in the conclusion, but I wanted to touch on two other topics first:", "The exported model is then reintroduced for training in the dataset and evaluation on the test-set. As observed in the code snippet below, TPOT chose to use a DecisionTree classifier on the top 49% performing features, with resulting F1 score of 0.84 and logloss of 0.5. AutoML is quicker , but didn\u2019t return results that were any more promising than traditional methods.", "Step 6: we can give our client \u2014 the Seattle DOT \u2014 a model that demonstrates performance in identifying what does and equally important, what doesn\u2019t lead to accidents of particular severities.", "Our model is better than blind-guessing since the log_loss score of 0.47 is better than a \u201cdumb score\u201d of 0.59 based on class distributions. It\u2019s not only predicting severities accurately but able to distinguish between the different classes \u2014 as measured by the high F1-score that exceeds that of the baseline performer, the Dummy Classifier.", "Insights for the Seattle Department of Transportation:", "As always, I welcome ideas, suggestions, and feedback.", "Your home for data science.
