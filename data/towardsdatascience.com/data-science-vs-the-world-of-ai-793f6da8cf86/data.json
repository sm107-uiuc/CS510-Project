But what do they mean? I know that there is some confusion around these terms. Some people say Data Science and Artificial Intelligence are synonyms, some say that one is a subset of the another and some say that these terms are completely unrelated.", "Confusion arises due to the vague and non-technical usage of these terms.", "Let\u2019s get into details by expanding the above-mentioned terms and understanding how Data Science intersects the world of Artificial Intelligence.", "Data science is the field of study that uses various skills to extract meaningful insights from data. I am pretty sure everyone knows this well. But how is data science helping companies around the world to make key decisions? Let us look at that then.", "Heavy traffic or road diversion at place XYZ may not be a concern for us but Uber Eats, Uber\u2019s food-delivery app, it is highly important. Getting hot food delivered quickly is their primary goal. Making that happen across the country, though, takes advanced statistical modeling and much more. To optimize the full delivery process, the team has to predict how every possible variable \u2014 from storms to holiday rushes \u2014 will impact traffic and cooking time.", "To know more about Data Science you can read my previous blog here.", "AI is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. The tasks that constitute AI are:", "Machine Learning is the learning in which machines can learn on their own without being explicitly programmed. It is an application of AI that provides a system with the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience.", "It could be said that now the major driving force of AI is Machine Learning.", "When we say something is capable of \u201cmachine learning\u201d, it means it\u2019s something that performs a function with the data given to it and gets progressively better over time. It\u2019s like if you had a flashlight that turned on whenever you said \u201cit\u2019s dark,\u201d so it would recognize different phrases containing the word \u201cdark.\u201d", "Deep learning is just a subset of machine learning. Deep learning technically similarly is machine learning and functions (hence why the terms are sometimes loosely interchanged). However, its capabilities are different.", "While basic machine learning models do become progressively better at whatever their function is, they still need some guidance. If an AI algorithm returns an inaccurate prediction, then an engineer has to step in and make adjustments. With a deep learning model, an algorithm can determine on its own if a prediction is accurate or not through its neural network.", "Getting back to the flashlight example: it could be programmed to turn on when it recognizes someone saying the word \u201cdark\u201d. As it continues learning, it might eventually turn on with any phrase containing that word. Now if the flashlight had a deep learning model, it could figure out that it should turn on with when it hears \u201cI can\u2019t see\u201d or \u201cthe light switch won\u2019t work,\u201d perhaps in tandem with a light sensor. A deep learning model can learn through its method of computing \u2014 a technique that makes it seem like it has its brain.", "I guess you\u2019ve got an idea of what each term means. But how do they intersect in the real world? Let\u2019s take another example to understand this.", "Assume that I am a strategist of a cricket team. I am given the task of creating a plan to dismiss the opposition team\u2019s best batsman. There may be thousands of videos that capture the batsman play. But it is important to focus on the videos in which the batsman is dismissed ie. glean insights on what kind of deliveries the performance of the batsman deteriorates. This indirectly means I need to clean the data first(remove irrelevant videos) and infer useful insights from it, to create a strategy. Now I need to build an AI model that can be trained for different conditions and visualizations that can help to find out which areas the bowlers need to bowl to dismiss the batsman. (Machine learning and deep learning is involved here because we are dealing with real-time data that needs to be fed continuously to the model).", "Do you now understand how data science meets the world of AI?", "Your home for data science.
