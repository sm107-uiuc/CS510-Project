A Data Scientist\u2019s blindness to the data lifecycle can cause their machine learning project to fail.", "The data lifecycle spans the full journey from planning to archiving. In large organizations, there may be a separate team that\u2019s responsible for the DataOps work required to wrangle data into a workable shape for advanced analytics. There may be another team, DevSecOps, that conducts the work of putting models into production. In small organizations, the Data Scientists may be responsible for managing the end-to-end data pipeline.", "Wherever your organization falls on this spectrum, it\u2019s beneficial for Data Scientists to possess a clear-eyed view of the data lifecycle during the project planning process. In this article, I share five recommendations to support advanced analytics, machine learning, and model deployment across all the stages of project planning.", "To start off, it\u2019s helpful if data owners, consumers, and stakeholders share a basic level of data literacy. The Data Management Body of Knowledge is good reference material.", "This 600+ pager continues to be exceedingly useful in my Data Science consulting work, and also useful in case anyone tries to fight me about the importance of data management.", "Read more about how to gain data management skills:", "Agile methodology refers to a set of values and practices that enhance flexibility and accountability in software development. The four values of The Agile Manifesto:", "What does a project planning discipline invented by 17 white men have to do with advancing diversity? Agile encourages frequent interaction with stakeholders that represent a diversity of functional roles across the organization.", "Just as diversity from a business perspective leads to the production of better software \u2014 diversity in gender, race, ethnicity, and other personal characteristics can enhance creative problem solving.", "Agile methodology values responsiveness to change. It requires fast iteration cycles that rely on trust and openness within a team. Meeting structures such as reviews and retrospectives can help teams to pause and reflect on whether they are promoting effective ways of working for all team members. In summary, Agile teams should leverage these practices and values with the aim of fully embracing the benefits of diversity.", "In the words of Sian Lewis, a Lead Data Scientist at Booz Allen Hamilton and chair of the Professional Development Committee of the organization\u2019s African American Network:", "Countless studies have shown the more diverse your team, the more successful they\u2019re going to be.

While these capabilities are important, Data Scientists also need to practice the crucial skill of project scoping. Struggle #2 refers to thinking that a Data Science initiative can succeed without a thorough investigation of end users\u2019 needs at the outset.", "The Data Scientist should take the approach of Human Centered Design to learn directly from the end users via interviews, then iteratively test and design a solution that takes their feedback into account.

This container management tool represents the dominant force in cloud deployment. Containerization allows for app components to run in a variety of environments \u2014 e.g. other computers, servers, the cloud \u2014 and offers a lightweight alternative to virtual machines given that containers share resources with the host operating system rather than requiring a guest operating system.", "In development, containers help overcome the challenges posed by multiple environments used by Data Scientists, Software Engineers, and DevOps practitioners. In production, containers deliver microservices to customers in response to network requests.", "Of companies surveyed by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, 84% used containers in production in 2019 and 78% employ Kubernetes to manage their deployments. Kubernetes provides provisioning, networking, load-balancing, security, and scaling \u2014 all the elements necessary to make container deployment simple, consistent, and scalable.", "As containerization becomes increasingly mainstream, the approach opens new frontiers for data science model deployment. Scaling resources allows a model to better serve spikes in demand. Moreover, Kubernetes enables deployment on the edge \u2014 reducing latency, conserving bandwidth, improving privacy, and generally empowering smarter machine learning. Plus, it can manage deployment strategies such as A/B testing, blue-green deployments, and canary releases.", "Read more from Caleb Kaiser on how to optimize your models for production:", "If you discover data quality issues while conducting EDA and then silently proceed with your Data Science project, you are perpetuating your organization\u2019s data debt.

To quote John Ladley again:", "Like all debts, data quality issues must be paid for eventually \u2014 either slowly over time (and with interest) or in a big chunk that pays off the debt.", "Far better to resolve issues at their source than to apply a temporary fix at the analytics stage. An effective Data Quality Reporting Process could take the form of an intranet portal where issues can be sent to a specified Data Quality team (or at the very least, to the data source owner).", "Insufficient action to remedy data debt represents Struggle #4 because Data Science practitioners typically don\u2019t receive sufficient training in effective data management. In contrast to more established fields like Software Development and Data Engineering, there are few certification programs that are considered standard for data scientists.
