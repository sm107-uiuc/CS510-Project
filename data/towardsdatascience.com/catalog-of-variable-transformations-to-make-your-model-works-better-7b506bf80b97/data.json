General Attention about Variable Transformation", "This is another post to pick up tips introduced in a new book \u201cData Analysis Techniques to Win Kaggle\u201d, authored by three high-rank Kagglers (not including myself thus this is not a personal promotion! :) )", "For the full table of contents of the book itself, see my other post.", "There are many transformation techniques for the use of modeling and many are implemented in scikit-learn and categorical_encoders .", "Among them, there are many using parameters, such as the mean and standard deviation of standardization or conversion table in label encoding. A common mistake in the use of variable transformation is transforming the training set and test set separately using different parameters. Transformation of training data and test data should be done using the same parameters, and they are typically obtained from training set alone; otherwise, we can not compare the results apple-to-apple basis. scikit-learn transformer classes can handle this by using fit and transform functions.", "Some will more strictly claim that when working with cross-validation, the transformation parameters would be derived only from training fold, then validation fold data will be transformed by those parameters, instead of transforming the entire training data before cross-validation. That approach could be necessary when you anticipate there are huge differences in data distribution among the folds. The presence of outliers is one possible reason to give different parameters, particularly in the transformation techniques sensitive to outliers such as min-max scaling.", "Or some others may claim that as long as the data distribution is not different a lot, transforming the entire training data before cross-validation is fine enough and it can avoid the confusion of data pipelining. Also, our final model will be based on entire training data, therefore it may make sense to use entire training data to transform the data.", "Either way, analysts always have to ask themselves what is the most reasonable approach to the data they face. scikit-learn supports within-cross-validation transformation by assigning scaler function in Pipeline. Compare Approach 1 and Approach 2 in the sample code below.", "The most typical numeric variable transformation is transforming the column values to another set of values with mean=0 and standard deviation=1 using subtraction and division such that:", "Standardization is widely used in many ML techniques, e.g. linear regression, SVM, neural net, etc. and some ML models a kind of mandate it. Many analytic tools even do this automatically by default. If that is the case, you even do not have to write the code to transform. We need to take care of what is default transformation and if it is relevant to the approach you choose.", "Min-max scaling is another usual suspect of the simple numeric variable transformations. With min-max scaling, values are to be converted to the values within 0 to 1.", "This transformation is highly dependent on the maximum number and the minimum number and therefore particularly sensitive to outliers. If the values can be extremely large while many are not, standardization is more common. Min-max scaling is more common in the case that the values range in the fixed interval and the data are less likely to flock in a specific subrange in the interval; most commonly in image data where one element tends to have the value between 0 to 255 for its RGB color.", "scikit-learn preprocessing module\u2019s MinMaxScaler can handle min-max scaling.", "When the value distribution has long-tailed distribution (e.g. individual incomes, individual medical costs, etc.), logarithmic transformations may adjust data distribution to less skewed \u2014 hopefully, Gaussian-like distribution.", "numpy has a native function to calculate log(x+1) asnp.log1p(x) .", "Generalized log transformation is supposed to tune the parameter lambda for the distribution of the data to get closer to normal distribution.

Therefore, if a column has categorical variable, models will only work when it is encoded to numeric variable. How to encode is one of the key performance drivers in modeling.", "One-hot encoding is an approach to convert one categorical column to multiple binary (0 or 1) columns as many as the number of distinct levels in the original column. If there are four levels on the categorical variable, one-hot encoding will create four new columns, each of which has 0 or 1 and represents if the original column has the level.", "An apparent drawback of one-hot encoding is that the number of columns easily inflates with a lot of distinct levels. One possible solution is to group some levels based on domain knowledge or to group infrequent levels in \u201cother\u201d level.", "You can do one-hot encoding with pandas get_dummies function or scikit-learn preprocessing module\u2019s OneHotEncoder. The latter one can return sparse matrix with sparse=True parameter, which can save memory consumption when the original column has a lot of levels.", "One-hot encoding can look similar to dummy variables in conventional statistical modeling. The difference between one-hot encoding and dummy variable is that in use of dummy variable it is common to eliminate one column out of produced new columns to avoid linear dependency and it may stabilize estimation. The reason for this difference is in ML context,", "This approach is not appropriate in most machine learning algorithms because the amount of transformed value actually has nothing to do with the target variable, except decision-tree based models that may be able to split the transformed numeric column multiple times with layering the tree node split. Also, in case the categorical variable has \u2018ordinal\u2019 nature e.g. Cold<Warm<Hot<Very Hot, label encoding can potentially work better than other encoding techniques.", "You can implement label encoding with scikit-learn preprocessing module\u2019s LabelEncoder.", "Feature hashing is an approach to convert one categorical column to multiple columns using hashing tricks. You can define the number of new columns you convert to, which can be fewer than the number of levels in categorical columns. Instead of assigning 0 or 1 like one-hot encoding, feature hashing uses more than two values (-1, 0, or 1 in the case below).", "This labeling can cover up the shortcoming of one-hot encoding that there generates too many columns after the transformation. However, having too many columns is no longer a fatal issue in the recent advanced modeling techniques, therefore feature hashing is not widely used.", "Also, having more than two possible values in a new column may not be good for some models.", "Binary encoding is an approach to turn the categorical column to multiple binary columns while minimizing the number of new columns.", "First, turn the categorical value to integers by some orders (e.g. alphabetical order or order of appearance for the top row). Next, turn it to binary digit such that 1 to 1, 2 to 10, 5 to 101, etc. Finally, split the binary digit into separate columns each of which has a single digit.", "Binary encoding can reduce the number of new columns to log_2(number of levels) order. As you can see in the example above, one of the new columns has 1 in different original level, which is not a good thing because the levels having 1 in the same column will be treated to share some property by the model while actually they have 1 in the same column just for a technical reason.", "category_encoder module\u2019s BinaryEncoder can handle these encoding.", "BaseN encoding is the generalization of binary encoding in a sense that, instead of using base 2, BaseN uses an arbitrary number as the base.", "As N goes up the number of new columns gets fewer, but it also means there gets more overlapped information within the new columns than we saw in binary encoding case, which potentially makes the final model worse. If N is infinite, BaseN encoding is exactly the same as label encoding. As I discussed above, label encoding is inappropriate for most of the models.", "category_encoder module\u2019s BaseNEncoder can handle these encoding.", "Frequency encoding is an approach to transform the categorical column to a new column with integers representing the frequencies of the levels in the original column. This may work well when the frequency of the levels is influential to the target variable.", "You can also turn the frequencies to rank, just like serializing the frequency encoding and ranking transformation. Be careful that the frequencies of levels are more likely to cause ties than ranking the original data.", "There\u2019s no library to support this encoding in python but this can be easily implemented by pandas.Series native function value_counts().", "Target encoding is an approach to transform the categorical column to a new numeric columns based on values of target variable.", "Most typically, it takes the average of target values per level to make a new column, but it can be anything you think reasonable like median when there are outliers, or mean of log values when the evaluation metric is RMSLE.", "Target encoding potentially makes powerful predictors but as the author of the book repeatedly warns, it easily causes data leakage unless carefully handled.", "Because target encoding uses the information from the target variable, we have to avoid including the same row to encode. To do so, we should k-folding (with k=4~10) of the data: the average of the target values in training folds to be assigned as encoded values in out-of-fold data. Repeat this for every folds to make encoded values for entire training data. Test data is typically encoded using entire training data.", "category_encoders module has target encoding handler TargetEncoder but even with this, you have to do K-fold by yourself.", "The author also claims you should NOT use leave-one-out (LOO) for target encoding because it is too likely to cause data leakage.", "When some levels are included only in test data, the model can return an error or even if no error is returned the prediction can be bad.", "These are how to handle that case:", "This post by Baijayanta Roy \u201cAll about Categorical Variable Encoding\u201d covers more encoding techniques.", "Also, categorical_encoders module covers most of the implementation of the techniques introduced in Baijayanta\u2019s post.
