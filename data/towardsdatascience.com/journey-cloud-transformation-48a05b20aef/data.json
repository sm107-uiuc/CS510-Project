What we have seen in the last years was upsetting. Cloud coming out as a concept and in a decade changes our lives. Just think about your photos that are stored nowhere in the cloud and accessible by all places. Nowadays everybody, from developers to CEOs, knows that there is an opportunity called the cloud. This article, after a brief introduction to the cloud advantages, show how to move your on-prem application.", "At the beginning of the cloud age, the keyword for convincing people to go cloud was \u201cit\u2019s cheap\u201d. Well, after ten years of cloud we understood that is not a question of costs. In some cases, we experienced that the cloud cost more than an on-prem solution. The keywords for the cloud are flexibility, efficiency, and strategy.", "The most common requirement in IT projects is time to marked. Nowadays everybody needs solutions soon and before the competitor. This continuous hurry conflict with usual timing to implement on-prem solutions. Moreover, you need to experiment with a lot of solutions to be competitive. This means that not all the projects you will finish will see the end or long and prolific life. But hardware cannot be simply resold at the end, and times of sysadmin never come back. In this scenario, the Cloud helps us. It is flexible, so you can scale and shrink based on your needs. Moreover, you are sure that, if you have enough money to buy it, there will be enough resources for you.", "The on-prem solution is hard to maintain a need a lot of effort to keep it efficient. You need to monitor the physical data center, monitor the infrastructure, get the best contracts whit ISP and pay for unuseful resources like redundancy hardware. You also have to pay for security aspects like intrusion tests, insurance and so on. Basically, the cloud provider is more efficient than a single company, that because this is their job. They capitalize on costs and can afford better security checks. Moreover thinks to the most valuable services like AI API. How many companies can hire a machine learning engineer to ask him to solve an image classification problem? Maybe is quicker and cheaper at the end pay for an expensive ready to use service.", "For all non-IT companies spend time on IT is a mess of a time. Technology is the element that enables companies to make (more) business, but\u2026 who really sees strategic pay for it? Cloud offers many opportunities to reduce operatives costs and allow the company management to focus on the main business streamline or on the processes. Silly things like update your WordPress website or your CRM is no more an issue. Such things have to happen automatically.", "The cloud is easy for those who start from scratch, like startups. When you start from whitepaper you have no limits and your first constraint is to be quick. You don\u2019t need to keep alive something that already exists. Basically, the matter is:", "How to move an existing application to the cloud?", "There are many options and many approaches but we can reduce the question to three different solutions:", "The basic of shift and lift is to put the application to the cloud with less effort possible. This translates in short times to complete the migration and few efforts on the software layer. The support for this is usually PaaS (Platform As A Service) and resolves issues related to physical infrastructure. By the way, nothing is changed on software so the application may keep some limits on scaling and performance.", "To get more advantages than simply shift the application to the cloud we can refactor some pats and gets some best benefits. The driver of this choice is to find the most impacting changes and apply selectively.", "For example, you can move the database to a cloud database but keeping the same interface. This can be done using cloud database service that can be seen like regular SQL databases but cloud bases. This is quite transparent to the application on most of applications and bring easily lot of performances improvement. Good solution for this are Aurora DB or Azure MySQL", "There isn\u2019t any conceptual difference between refactoring and reengineering, both works on the existing code get more benefits from the cloud opportunities. The practical difference is the scope of this change. Refactoring includes changes in many software parts and details. This practice is useful to get benefits with small changes. But in the wild world not always small changes are enough. In some cases, you need to make changes to the infrastructure also, this is called re-engineering.", "For example, following the previous example, you can find that simply switching from on-prem mysql to the cloud version is not enough for you, scaling and availability need and you what to move to a NoSQL solution. You can use solution like Cosmos DB on Azure, Firebase on Google Cloud, or DashDB on IBM Cloud.", "This is, actually, the most used solution. It seems strange that simply putting your app that costs thousands of dollars and throws away is the most common solution. By the way, Forbes gives us an interesting statistic. The enterprise SaaS market is now generating $20B in quarterly revenues for software vendors. This is growing by 32% per year. Even if we don\u2019t know the percentage between the new software and the move ones, we can suppose that a lot of these numbers are done by on-prem software that is replaced by SaaS alternatives.", "The cloud was a bet ten years ago but now is a concrete opportunity. Each company should have already introduced and start moving on it. The move hadn't to be instant. You may need time to go to the cloud fully and for many companies that maybe not possible at all.", "The first step is to admit that the move cannot be in one shot but is a long journey.", "This journey pass to a state that is called \u201cHybrid Cloud\u201d, where on-prem structures cooperate whit the cloud ones. Most of the applications can be moved quickly using shift&lift technique, but this may bring not so much value if you will keep the datacenter online for other needs. In many cases, you can get a lot of benefits with small changes to the software (refactor and reengineering), but most companies just adopt SaaS solutions when their software goes end-of-life.", "Your home for data science.
