Data science is also a very hot trending topic in the media. You can see or hear many data science-related terms appear more and more on newspapers, radio and TV shows, such as big data, data mining, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. However, do they (or we) really know what data science it?", "Even for those who have keen interest in becoming a data scientist, they can wonder at certain time points how they can pursue data science as their careers. It\u2019s definitely a valid question, because if they don\u2019t know exactly the field that they\u2019re going to work in, how can one expect them to develop the necessary skill sets to make them qualify for the jobs.", "So the fundamental question here is what on earth data science is.", "Presumably, there are no official definitions, because nobody knows who can represent the official entity if any. Nevertheless, there have been various attempts to define the concept of data science.", "Let\u2019s first begin by looking at the following diagram, which or a variation of which has been widely used.", "This diagram nicely highlights the multi-disciplinary nature of data science as a study field. Specifically, data science mainly involves the following disciplines.", "This diagram certainly helps us understand the overall relevance of various disciplines to data science at the 30,000-foot level, but it doesn\u2019t really tell us what data science does exactly.", "For the purpose of a general discussion, let\u2019s next refer to the Wikipedia for its definition to see if it gives us any extra insights.", "Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.", "This definition has a very good correspondence to the above diagram in the sense that it also emphasizes the multi-disciplinary nature of data science. However, some terms used in this definition are too broad to be meaningful, such as scientific methods and processes.", "I\u2019m here not trying to be picky (maybe I am:]), but data science is not a religion or fiction, it is science, evidently shown by its name. Are there any science subjects that don\u2019t use scientific methods? I can\u2019t think of any. In addition, most of us can understand what the term algorithms means, but what about processes and systems? What on earth are they?", "I assumed that definitions found in Wikipedia should be relatively comprehensive in general. Apparently, this one is an exception, as far as based on what we\u2019ve read. So let\u2019s continue to read the Wikipedia page on data science. In the following paragraph, a further descriptive statement is provided, as cited below.", "Data science is a \u201cconcept to unify statistics, data analysis, machine learning and their related methods\u201d in order to \u201cunderstand and analyze actual phenomena\u201d with data.", "I definitely love this statement more. It gives specific examples of what so-called scientific methods that data science uses, like statistics and machine learning. Moreover, it clearly states that data science is to understand and analyze tangible phenomena through its interaction with data.", "Overall, these statements, together with the above diagram, shed light on the comprehensive definition of data science. We may have developed a broad idea about data science, as these definitions successfully list important pieces albeit in slightly different ways regarding what data science is all about, such as algorithms, knowledge from data, math and statistics, data analysis, machine learning, and understand and analyze actual phenomena.", "Undoubtedly, these terms pretty much cover almost all the aspects involved in data science that one can think of. However, such comprehensiveness has a cost \u2014 it\u2019s too complicated! Imagine that you, as a data scientist or just a data science enthusiast, are asked to explain to a layperson what data science is. Do you think these comprehensive definitions can help the layperson have a clear idea about data science? He may not even have any clues about statistics, not to mention machine learning.", "I don\u2019t know what your thought is, and you may do a good job to get this complicated concept well explained, but to me, it\u2019s so hard with these definitions!", "In an insightful Medium article which I strongly recommend you read if you\u2019re serious in learning more about data science, Cassie Kozyrkov, the Chief Decision Scientist at Google, gave her so-called pithiest definition.", "Data science is the discipline of making data useful.", "From a personal perspective as a minimalist, I think that it\u2019s absolutely a drastic improvement over previous definitions. First of all, it clearly states the subject of concern for data science \u2014 D, A, T, A \u2014 data. That\u2019s right. Data science should be about data!", "No matter what your role is in data science, you\u2019ll inevitably have to deal with data in certain ways. Some may argue that I\u2019m just a programmer that develops software for data science, and I don\u2019t touch data at all.", "Well, it may sound true. But a few questions can be asked. Does your software use data for any of its functionalities? When you develop your software, do you need to consider the format of the data? Will your software output data? Probably, all answers will be positive.", "Some others may argue that I\u2019m just a biomedical researcher that runs a clinical trial to examine the effectiveness of drug A on treating Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and what\u2019s my relevance to data and data science if any?", "Well, as a scientist myself, I\u2019ve seen too many basic researchers hold a similar view. They\u2019re somewhat disconnected with the evolution of data science in this era and its applications in virtually all biomedical fields. To me, they\u2019re content experts who actually generate the data to be used in data science. Even if they don\u2019t realize that, they are directly connected to the field of data science.", "For example, research data generated from that trial can be integrated to a larger data set. Eventually, through conducting data science, as said by Cassie Kozyrkov, these clinical data can be \u201cmade useful\u201d to address several important questions, such as the etiology of Alzheimer\u2019s disease at the system level (e.g., neural network, disease progression).", "The hidden information in this pithiest definition (i.e., to make data useful) is that it also alludes to the objective of data science \u2014 to make sense of the data. Data themselves are just numbers, texts, images, or videos, and thus they can\u2019t tell us anything meaningful on the given topic on their own.", "How can we make use of the data? The whole purpose of conducting data science research is to understand the data and to leverage various methods to analyze them critically and creatively, such that data will gain life and they can help us explain phenomena, show us the correct ways to do certain things, and predict what will happen.", "Collectively, I refer to these various outcomes associated with data science as Implications. Thus, in other words, the objective of data science is to generate implications. What do I mean exactly by saying implications?", "The implications are in the temporal dimension. Through data science, we can obtain implications of different depths for what happened and why, what\u2019s happening and why, and what will happen and why. The past \u2014 for example, data science has been used in evolutionary biology and ecology to study the evolution of life and the complicated ecosystem. The present \u2014 for example, many financial institutes heavily relies on data source for risk evaluation, investment assessment, fraud detection, and many other purposes. The future \u2014 for example, data science has been widely used to determine the winning odds for many tournaments.", "The implications are also in the spatial dimension. Data science has penetrated to almost all research fields, such as biomedicine, manufacturing, and space science, as well as our daily life, such as self-driving cars, weather forecast, and news feeds in social media, just to name a few.", "In the above two sections, we talked about the positive sides of this \u201cpithiest\u201d definition of data science. However, one important thing is missing. If you compare this definition with the \u201cofficial\u201d ones, it won\u2019t be hard for you to find out what\u2019s missing \u2014 the \u201cpithiest\u201d definition doesn\u2019t mention the use of adequate methodologies in conducting data science.", "Arguably, nobody can build an object detection model just using paper and pencil. It\u2019s also virtually impossible for someone to build a useful investment risk assessment model without any sophisticated software equipped with pertinent statistical packages.", "Identification of this missing component is leading us to the definition of data science \u2014 using a minimalism approach.", "Presumably, everyone must have done something similar when he/she was a kid. Can you shorten this sentence as much as possible?", "In a beautiful cold day in the winter before Christmas, I spent all of personal savings \u2014 25 dollars in buying some charming silver ornaments at the flea market that was 2 miles away from my house in the city of New York.", "Many of us have arrived at the same sentence in the second paragraph, because it uses the fewest words without losing the important information contained in the first paragraph.", "We can apply the same approach to shortening the \u201cofficial\u201d definitions that were mentioned at the beginning of this article with some extra minor abstraction.", "Data science is a multi-disciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructured data.", "-> Data science is a field that uses tools to extract information from data.", "Certainly, this shorter definition doesn\u2019t provide too many details about data science, but it does have a special advantage. Give yourself a few seconds to think about it before scrolling down.", "I bet that you\u2019ve probably figured it out. With this simple definition, three keywords easily stand out: Tools, Information, and Data. These are exactly all the vital components in data science.", "I tweaked these words a little bit, and came up with my own minimalism definition for data science as below.", "On the right side of this formula, you\u2019ll notice the change from Information to Implications. This change makes these three words all countable and they are now all in the plural form. Thus, they look more uniform and more beautiful. Does it also read better?", "Joking aside, the reason that I use Implications is that this plural form explicitly refer to the multitude of information that we can obtain through conducting data science. As discussed previously, the objective of data science is to generate implications, and the implication is multidimensional both temporally and spatially.", "On the left side of this formula, you\u2019ll find the two crucial components of data science \u2014 Data and Tools. No matter what definition we use, everyone should agree that the core of data science is all about data: data collection, data processing, data reduction, data analysis, data mining, and so on. Given its critical importance of data in conducting data science, Data has the absolute privilege to go before Tools in this formula.", "Certainly, tools can never be overlooked in data science. The tools are the collection of all tangible and virtual instruments and gadgets used in data science, including but not limited to, hardware, software, methods, statistical models, machine learning techniques, and algorithms.", "Taken together, this formula or definition means that conducting data science is to have Data and Tools react organically, which will lead to the generation of meaningful Implications that will benefit all human well-being both in the temporal and spatial domains.", "Data science is still growing, and its scope is expanding too. Thus, its definition will keep evolving. Until it becomes fully mature, there will be ongoing debate on how we should define it precisely. This article doesn\u2019t aim to offer a definite answer to this question, but rather, just aims to generate some inspirational thoughts inside as well as outside the data science field by throwing in some opinions from a minimalism perspective.", "Next time, when you need to explain data science to someone else, you can try using the simple definition or formula, Data + Tools -> Implications, as your starting point. You can then expand upon each term if further clarification is needed. With this easy-to-hard strategy, I bet that your audience will be more receptive to your explanation.", "Work at the nexus of biomedicine, data science & mobile dev.
