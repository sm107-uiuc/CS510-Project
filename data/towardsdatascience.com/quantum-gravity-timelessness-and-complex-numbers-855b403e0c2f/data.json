Macroscopic objects appear to us to be fundamentally localized in space and time. This is in stark contrast with their quantum nature, where properties such as entanglement, non-locality, and interference are consistently shown to occur. There are only very few instances where quantum phenomena can be observed macroscopically, such as, for example, in superconductors and superfluids. But quantum properties are indeed predominant mostly at microscopic scales of energy and matter.", "In quantum mechanics, as will be described at length, matter has wave properties. More specifically, a particle with mass m and momentum p = mv (where v is the velocity) has a wavelength \u03bb = h/p where h is the so-called Planck constant. To show how quantum properties are undetectable for macroscopic objects, consider the following example given in the book by Cohen-Tannoudji, Diu, and Laloe.

According to this principle, the form of the laws of physics (in the present case, the equations of general relativity) should be invariant under arbitrary coordinate transformations. This makes sense since, as noted above, coordinates are only artificial labels. Hence they are not fundamental, and the laws of physics should be invariant under such relabeling.", "Tensors are key in writing the equations of general relativity because a tensor equation has the property that if it is true in one coordinate system, it is true in all coordinate systems.

There are now certain rules according to which the components can be calculated in a new system of co-ordinates, when these are known for the original system, and when the transformation connecting the two systems is known. The things herefrom designated as Tensors have further the property that the transformation equation of their components are linear and homogeneous; so that all the components in the new system vanish if they are all zero in the original system. Thus a law of Nature can be formulated by putting all the components of a tensor equal to zero so that it is a general covariant equation; thus while we seek the laws of formation of the tensors, we also reach the means of establishing general Covariant laws. \u201c", "The Einstein field equations, including the cosmological constant, read:", "The tensor G is known as Einstein\u2019s tensor and it is related to the Ricci curvature tensor R.
