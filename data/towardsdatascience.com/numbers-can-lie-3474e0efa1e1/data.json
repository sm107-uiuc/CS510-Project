Which is great for Data Scientists & Analysts but can also create some very real problems.", "The main issue is caused by the pace in which analytics are integrated into business processes, due to the fact that most people don\u2019t have much if any statistics education and those that do often haven\u2019t revisited the topics since their school days. This creates a very real problem for organisations.", "Blind conviction in decision making that is based on metrics and figures that don\u2019t actually hold up are running rampant.", "If you are a Data Scientists or Analysts, it\u2019s vital to remember our work does not occur in a void. Our analysis are shared and will impact how decisions are made so it\u2019s important to keep this in mind when building reports, dashboards etc. to ensure they don\u2019t unintentionally mislead the end users.", "Simply put, if you can\u2019t substantiate your numbers, why would anyone believe your analysis? Or worse, if your analysis is unintentionally misleading, it can cause serious harm.", "In this article I will explore some of the different factors that can cause decision makers to be misled and how to avoid this in your work.", "The first thing to think about is: what is meant by the term \u201caverage\u201d.", "There are three: Mean, Median and Mode.", "When you see the term \u2018average\u2019 you could be referring to any one of them. Most commonly, the average being referred to is Mean but not always, in my work I opt for calling it a \u2018Mean Average\u2019 unless specifically requested otherwise by a client.", "I\u2019ll go more in-depth into Means as they can be very misleading due to the fact there are multiple ways different datasets could yield the same Mean. For example, three values \u20181,2,3\u2019 can have the same mean as \u20182,2,2\u2019.", "The main way Mean can mislead is due to the outlying data where comparatively very large or very small values have a large impact on the Mean.", "A real life example: a company could have average sales of \u00a325,000 a month. The executives see this and are satisfied with the company\u2019s position. In reality, the average sales is skewed due to a \u00a350,000 a month customer that is due to be acquired by a competitor. The imminent loss of this customer actually drops the Mean to say \u00a315,000, a very risky cash position for the company. In this scenario seeing the distribution or another type of average could help the executives foresee these events and prepare for them.", "I tend towards a \u2018more is better\u2019 approach and include other descriptives in any scenario where I am not presenting the results myself, this leaves little room for error. Alway remember to think of the end users needs, not yours, and I can guarantee they haven\u2019t spend hours scanning the raw data like you, so don\u2019t make an assumption they have the knowledge of the dataset.", "The above analysis show three completely different datasets that all have the same Mean Average, Count and Sum however, they all have very different distributions (I have kept the scales similar to emphasise this point). This situation happens frequently in analytics and is often completely swept under the rug.", "Descriptive Statistics are a must when it comes to analysis. Simply making nice metrics and graphs without proper context can cause more harm than good. If you\u2019re planning on using averages as a part of reports and dashboards, then I recommend at least showing distributions with them, so the context behind the average is understandable and please, remember to label it \u201cMean, Mode, Medium\u201d. If you\u2019re unsure of the most appropriate average for your dataset I would recommend researching each in detail beforehand.", "Statistics are often quoted without any reference to the original data, as well as missing certain figures that could act against the creator\u2019s hypothesis.", "An important question to ask yourself when being presented findings on their own is \u2018whose interest is it in this figure be correct\u2019? This isn\u2019t to say that the figures are incorrect. Just there is no way of knowing definitely. Therefore, the figures should not be solely relied upon.", "If you\u2019re presenting data always cite sources, methods and anything else relevant. If you\u2019re leaving something out, ask yourself why and if the answer is defensive in nature, don\u2019t leave it out. There so many fake facts out there we don\u2019t need anymore.", "A common examples of misrepresentation is survey data where the information on method or sample size is left out. This often include things totals such as total downloads figures, which marketers love, that conveniently leave out other metrics like active users.", "This is shown clearly in the following two statements, both of which are accurate.", "China\u2019s GDP is higher than Luxembourg\u2019s.Luxembourg\u2019s GDP is higher than China\u2019s.", "They are both true as China\u2019s total GDP is much bigger. However, per capita, Luxembourg is much higher. In this case, you\u2019re able to make an argument that both economies performed better than the other.", "Statistics are often used to prove a point or solidify an opinion. Though in reality they often don\u2019t succeed at either.", "It\u2019s easy enough to come up with a poignant statement and back it up quasi sophisticated statistics, but they will fall over when you dig a little beneath the surface.", "One such statement would be \u2018CEOs earn more than they have ever have before\u2019. This statement comes backed up with figures such as \u2018on average CEOs now earn \u00a3250,000. Compared to 1950, they only earned \u00a350,000\u2019. This on its own seems like resounding proof but in actual fact, \u00a350,000 in 1950 gave the equivalent buying power as \u00a3480,000 today. So despite first appearances, this statement is ridiculous. I know this may seem obvious but there are many less obvious one out there.", "Another common example I\u2019ve personally seen is a large HR analytics software company stating on their website: \u2018our clients achieve up to 80% ROI.\u2019", "There are two major issues with such statements.", "Firstly, from a mathematics perspective, the phrase \u2018Up to\u2019 could effectively mean anything in this scenario, i.e most of the company\u2019s clients may receive zero percent return on investment, and a single client may achieve 80%. Therefore, the statement is true but misleading.", "The other issue with such statements is the assumptions made in the methodology. Let\u2019s say in this scenario, the product the company sell is sales software. They calculate that the increase in sales in the first year of use versus the previous year leads to the ROI of 80%. They conveniently leave out the fact that sales were growing by 50% a year before the software was introduced. Therefore claiming that the increase was caused by the software is baseless, as the increase was within the normal operating trend of the client already.", "An easy tip to avoid this is simply avoid generalisation, they leave too much room for error. Remember you\u2019re trying to tell a story with your data, that story needs to include the details.", "This is probably the most common mistake that is made when looking at statistics and the consequences of doing so can be huge.", "Let\u2019s say you want to understand the relationship between workplace engagement and employee length of service, so you conduct a survey and gain the results.", "You see that there is a positive correlation between length of time and engagement level. From this you conclude that the longer someone works at the organisation, the more engaged they will be. How can we be sure that is really the case though? Firstly, you need to access the distribution of the length of service. Is this close to normally distributed levels, or is there a large skew to the distributions? Remember there is very little value in comparing apples to oranges.", "Thankfully, there is a helpful method to understand how important the correlation is, which is P Values. This calculation is used to show the probability of having the same results if the correlation coefficient was zero. If a P Value is less than 5%, (0.05), then the correlation is deemed to be statistically significant.", "This does not mean that the correlation is a causation, just that it is worth looking into further to determine whether the correlation is in fact due to a cause and effect relationship.", "Due to naivety around the meaning of P values or simply relying on correlation coefficients alone, things that appear to be related are often stated as proven to be a cause and effect relationship. If you find that two things are correlated, and wish to understand the relationship further, then Bayesian statistics would be a helpful tool to understanding the data in more depth.", "Some simple things to consider regarding correlations:Usual correlations fall under four categorise (these can be positive or negative relationships):", "Uncorrelated: Pretty self explanatory.Correlated, but not really: Sometimes thing are statistically correlated but in reality don\u2019t have a relationship and occur by chance. Two ways to avoid this, is to get more data or conduct experiments to put this relationship to the test under controlled conditions.Actually correlated: These inputs have a relationship, but if influencing conditions change they could alter or break this relationship. Remember data doesn\u2019t exist in a void, things change, don\u2019t assume ceteris paribus.Causal: The input directly dictates the output, consider the order of the relationship eg does X cause Y to change, or the opposite, or is the relationship bidirectional? This of course depends on the nature of your data.", "Correlations are a vital part of data science but it is all too easy to get carried away when you get the result you were looking for. Really dig until you fully understand what's going on you\u2019ll be surprised what you find.", "Most of these may seem quite obvious, but in a fast paced business environment, it\u2019s easy for them to creep into your analysis without anyone noticing, especially you\u2019re using off the shelf analytics tools that don\u2019t allow you to inspect the raw data or run custom queries and formulas.", "As a general rule, for better practice, if you don\u2019t understand or know what is happening behind a pretty graph or cutting edge machine learning model then you shouldn\u2019t be relying on their outputs when it comes to decision making, always provide context.", "Thankfully there are lots of great places online to read about statistics, data science and machine learning, enabling everyone to improve their data-literacy.", "Your home for data science.
