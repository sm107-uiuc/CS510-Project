13000 participants, 1428 accepted papers (out of 6743 submissions), 58 workshops, and 16K pages of proceedings, was the most overwhelming yet one of the most fruitful conferences I ever attended. A fantastic data analysis of the conference is presented by the chairs at \u201cWhat we learned from NeurIPS 2019 data\u201d.", "Considering the size of the conference, it was practically impossible to cover all the tracks, talks, and posters. In this post (and the follow-ups), I will provide some featured highlights of the conference from my personal point of view.", "Yoshua Bengio | From System 1 Deep Learning to System 2 Deep LearningVivienne Sze | Efficient Processing of Deep Neural Network: from Algorithms to Hardware ArchitecturesCeleste Kidd | How to KnowMohammad Emtiyaz Khan | Deep Learning with Bayesian PrinciplesBlaise Aguera y Arcas | Social Intelligence", "From System 1 Deep Learning to System 2 Deep Learning (Slides): Yoshua Bengio\u2019s talk was the most popular keynote of the conference. Yoshua provided a fantastic insight into the current state of deep learning and its future. Inspired by the book Thinking, Fast and Slow, he presented a path from System 1 (Intuitive, fast unconscious non-linguistic, and habitual decision making/inference), where deep learning is good at, to its future of System 2 (Slow, logical, sequential, conscious, linguistic, algorithmic, decision making). He discussed Consciousness (and Attention as its key ingredient) as the basics of System 2, with sparse factor graphs as consciousness prior, and meta-learning as a theoretical framework to expand deep learning from System 1 to System 2.", "Deep Learning with Bayesian Principles (Slides): Deep learning and Bayesian learning are considered two entirely different fields often used in complementary settings. Emtiyaz Khan in his talk introduces modern Bayesian principles to bridge this gap to solve challenging real-world problems by combining their strengths.", "We can use Bayesian principles as general principles to design, improve, and generalize a range of learning algorithms by computing posterior approximations. We can derive existing algorithms (e.g. Adam optimizer) as special cases, or design new deep learning algorithms for uncertainty estimation, generalization on small datasets, and life-long learning. Training Bayesian neural networks in particular posterior approximation is still a challenging and computationally expensive problem. Hence approximation methods such as Variational Inference (VI) can be used.", "For further reading, you can refer to the papers \u201cPractical Deep Learning with Bayesian Principles\u201d, \u201cNatural-Gradient Descent for Variational Inference\u201d, and \u201cProbabilistic Methods \u2014 Variational Inference\u201d.

The code to obtain the titles and token frequencies can be found on the Github.", "The 10 most frequent words are as follows: Optimization, Reinforcement, Adversarial, Graph, Efficient, Stochastic, Optimal, Generative, and Bayesian. I ran some further analysis on the following keywords: Optimization, Reinforcement Learning, Adversarial, Graph, Generative, and Bayesian Neural Network (code can be found here), and found some interesting results:", "From my point of view (based on the number of attendees to the sessions and the above data), the following topics were trending in the conference:", "To get to know more about GNNs, take a look at the post A Gentle Introduction to Graph Neural Networks or the following survey papers:\u2022 A Comprehensive Survey on Graph Neural Networks, \u2022 Stanford SNAP\u2019s Graph Neural Networks Tutorial, and \u2022 Graph Neural Networks: A Review of Methods and Applications. A good list of GNN papers is also collected in this repo. Graphs not only can be used as a data structure, but also can represent outputs of NNs, e.g. any joint distribution can be represented as a factor graph as noted by Yoshua Bengio in his invited talk.", "The outstanding new directions paper award went to Uniform convergence may be unable to explain generalization in deep learning by Vaishnavh Nagarajan and J. Zico Kolter (slides, blog, code).", "One of the biggest open challenges in deep learning theory is the generalization puzzle, as deep network models (in contrary to classical learning theory) generalize very well in spite of heavy overparameterization. In order to explain this counter-intuitive behavior, theoretical works have tried to derive upper bounds on the generalization gap (the gap between a model\u2019s performance on training data and unseen data from the same distribution) of deep networks. This work takes a step back and argues that pursuing uniform convergence-based bounds may not actually lead us to the complete solution of this puzzle. In particular, it shows 1) Theoretical generalization bounds grow with training set size (while the empirical gap decreases), and 2) any kind of uniform convergence bounds will provably fail to explain generalization in certain situations in deep learning.", "Amongst 54 workshops during 3 days, these were the most popular ones among participants:", "\u2022 Deep reinforcement learning\u2022 Graph representation learning \u2022 Meta-learning (David Abel\u2019s notes, section 4, has an awesome summary of this workshop)\u2022 Bayesian deep learning\u2022 Biological and artificial reinforcement learning\u2022 Tackling climate change with MLAnd for those who are interested in conversational AI, this was my favorite (about which I will write a post shortly): \u2022 Conversational AI workshop", "Among 28 demos during the conference, here are my personal favorites (with some bias towards NLP): \u2022 exBERT: A Visual Analysis Tool to Explain BERT\u2019s Learned Representations\u2022 Streamlit, a new app framework for machine learning tools\u2022 AllenNLP Interpret: Explaining Predictions of NLP Models\u2022 Passcode: A cooperative word guessing game between a human and AI agent\u2022 Fun demos: Robot-Assisted Hair-Brushing, the Melody Slot Machine interactive music system, and one-on-one fitness training with an AI avatar.", "NeurIPS 2019 had an emphasis on diversity and inclusion.
