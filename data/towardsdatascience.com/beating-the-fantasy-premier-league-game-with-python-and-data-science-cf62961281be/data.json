So, we finally decided to apply Data Science and a \u201cMoneyball\u201d approach to team/player analysis in order to figure out if we were actually picking the best possible combination of players each season. Our research started by pulling the most up-to-date player stats from the Fantasy Game API and running statistical analysis on all the EPL teams and all individual players using Python. The final goal of our project was to write a Python Algorithm, which uses the data from our analysis to make \u201csmart\u201d picks and build the most optimal Fantasy League squad given our limited budget of 100MM.", "Note: Most optimal Fantasy squad will be measured in terms of the total amount of Fantasy points returned per Fantasy dollars spent = ROI.", "2. Key questions our analysis aims to answer:", "Individual Player ROI = Player Fantasy points / Player Fantasy Cost (in other words our total points return per 1MM Fantasy-dollars spent on a player.)", "Note: This project was executed on Nov 14th, 2018, after Gameweek 10, so all the data and tables presented in the article are accurate up to that date.", "First, we started by arranging all the Barclays EPL teams by their current table standings and looking at the aggregate squad points for all their players to see if that correlates directly to the team\u2019s table position.", "We can clearly see that in general there is a linear correlation between how well a team is doing in the English Premier League and the cumulative fantasy points of its players. The orange bars above show the total cost of each team\u2019s players in terms of Fantasy League currency. This helps us identify teams that generate a decent return of Fantasy Points per dollar spent (ROI) on average such as \u2014 Manchester City, Liverpool, Chelsea, AFC Bournemouth, Watford, and Wolverhampton. This also exposes a few of the teams that would be considered a bad investment such as \u2014 Tottenham, Arsenal, Manchester United, Fulham, Huddersfield, West Ham, and Southampton.", "Next, we plotted each Team\u2019s cumulative player ROI against the number of players that the coach uses on a regular basis (players who have played at least 360 minutes so far in the season). This will help us identify the teams that have too many expensive and under-performing players who rarely play the full 90 minutes each game due to the frequent squad rotation their coach employs, which makes them a bad investment in the long run, since they will not be generating fantasy points consistently each game. Also, this graph below will help us identify the teams with coaches that do not use frequent player rotation, which results in those teams having a more consistent core of regular squad players. That will inform our algorithm to pick more players from those teams since their players are expected to generate a higher aggregate ROI in the long run because they would be involved in a lot more game action on average compared to players from teams that use frequent player rotation.", "In the graph above we\u2019re looking for teams with a very tall blue bar (cumulative player ROI) and a shorter orange bar (total number of players that the coach uses on a regular basis). The leader in this category is Wolverhampton, with an AVG ROI of 8.21 and only 11 players that the coach uses on a regular basis (an average of 8.21pts yield per dollar spent on each Wolverhampton player). That means that most of Wolverhampton's players are undervalued compared to their performance and that the coach uses the same 11 players on a regular basis and only uses subs towards the end of the game or when a regular team player gets injured. Even teams like Manchester City, Liverpool and Chelsea are in this category with 13\u201314 regular squad players, which means that picking players from any of the teams above is a good investment in the long run because the regular squad players play more minutes on average compared to players on the bench.", "The big losers in this category are Manchester United, Tottenham, Arsenal, Everton, West Ham and Fulham with ROIs in the 4\u20135 range and with a number of regular squad players going as high as 15\u201316. This means that by picking players from these teams, you are making a \u201cbad investment\u201d by risking having your players not play every game due to the coach\u2019s use of frequent squad rotation. Also, the stats clearly show that these teams\u2019 players are very overpriced compared to their performance in the Fantasy League indicated by their lower than average ROIs.", "After identifying which teams yield a higher cumulative ROI, we then zoomed in on the individual players. In stock market terms, we have identified all the high-yield market sectors \u2014 the teams \u2014 and now we want to start analyzing all the individual stocks in each sector \u2014 the players. The plan is to isolate a list of players with the highest ROIs and write a Python algorithm that will use smart logic to pick the most optimal combination of players, which will generate the highest return on investment for our limited budget of 100MM.", "Looking at the scatter plot of Player Cost vs. Player Total Fantasy Points above, we would want our AI to pick players who appear as west-north as possible on the plot (players of low cost who generate a lot of Fantasy Points). Note that we would also want to include some of the top players from the east-north corner of the plot since these would be some of the star league players who generate a lot of points, and even though they are a bit expensive, they still end up with a decent ROI. The graph below plots the Top 20 ROI vs. the Bottom 20 ROI players. So, we\u2019d expect our final algorithm to pick as many of these high yield players as possible. And we want to stay away from players who are very overpriced compared to their performance ( High-Cost / Low Fantasy Points) such as Hary Kane, Alexis Sanchez, Romelu Lukaku, Christian Ericksen, Alvaro Morata, Paul Pogba, Dele Alli and more.", "We decided to plot the stats above, including the AVG ROI of all players in the league (green line = 5.74) to get a visual idea of what \u201coverperforming\u201d and \u201cunderperforming\u201d players look like. For example, Marcos Alonso, who is the top yield player in the league has an ROI of 12.11, which is more than double the AVG of 5.74, which makes him a no-brainer pick for our algorithm.", "In the Pie Charts below, we can see a distribution of the teams with the most-overpriced players versus the teams with the most undervalued players. We are expecting our final algorithm to pick players from a variety of teams that have a lot of high-yield players such as \u2014 Bournemouth, Wolves, Liverpool Chelsea, Manchester City, Watford, and Everton. This smart approach is very different than the approach that the average Joe uses to play the Fantasy game, which is to mostly pick players from his/her favorite team, plus a few players from 4 or 5 of the most popular teams \u2014 Arsenal, Tottenham, Manchester United, Chelsea, Liverpool or Manchester City, and then fill in the rest of their fantasy team with cheap \u201cfiller\u201d players who never play during the real games and do not generate any Fantasy points.", "Now it\u2019s time for the most fun part \u2014 writing the actual Python algorithm and comparing the results of the AI picks to what an average person might pick for their Fantasy team.", "To understand the logic of our Algorithm one must first understand the rules and constraints of the EPL Fantasy Game below:", "So, we started our python algorithm with an if-else statement for these conditions and then added our own conditions and logic on top of that, so that each time that the algorithm loops through our list of players, it can use smart logic to make a valid pick guided by our conditions below:", "Here is some of our condensed Python Code for the team picking algorithm:", "Below you can see a screenshot of the final team that our Algo picked:", "Note: The team below is only accurate up to Nov 14th, 2018. Our Algorithm is designed to update the player stats after every Gameweek and make new picks based on the fluctuations in team/player ROI stats.", "Note: We wrote a similar algorithm for the AVG Joe team, which focuses more on spending the budget on star players from big teams, who are often overpriced and might not return the highest cumulative ROI for our limited budget of 100M.", "Note: We also asked a classmate to pick a random team of his own, so we can compare his picks and verify that our random team-selector function for the AVG Joe algorithm is accurate.", "Now that both algorithms have been built and executed, let\u2019s compare the results of our \u201cMoney Team\u201d vs. the \u201cAVG Joe\u2019s Team vs. the \u201cRandom Classmate Team\u201d to see which one performed best and by what margin. The final results showed that our team scored a total of 944 points vs. only 812 pts. for the AVG Joe team (similar to our classmate's team), which is a significant 132pt difference! The bar-plot below demonstrates our results:", "Interesting questions to answer: Did our Algorithm return the highest ROI team? Did it beat the others by a significant margin? Did our Algorithm successfully pick players from some middle of the table teams, which we initially identified as undervalued? Did the AVG Joe Algorithm and our classmate pick more of the expensive overpriced players from the top teams?", "Below we can see that our Algorithm picked a combination of players from most of the high ROI teams that we identified at the beginning of our project:", "This is a much more balanced and unbiased selection method than what the AVG Joe used when selecting his/her players. Please note that the pie chart below shows the team list for the 11 players that the AVG Joe team selected as their main squad. Since the AVG Joe spent most of his/her budget on picking 11 very expensive players, he/she had to spend the remaining budget on the cheapest available players to fill in all the substitute positions, but none of these players can be used to generate fantasy points due to the fact that they never actually played in the real EPL games and were only used as team-fillers. These are a few sub-players from Brighton and Cardiff.", "Removing team/player biases and favoritism and focusing on the actual player stats, allowed our Algorithm to get the most bang for our buck and beat the average EPL Fantasy player by a total of 132 pts or a whole 16.25%! In the end, it turned out that my friend and I were not actually \u2018unlucky\u2019 and there was a reason why our Fantasy League teams performed very poorly year after year. This deep dive into the player data allowed us to realize that we were allowing team favoritism and a tendency to buy a lot of the overpriced players to hurt our overall Fantasy League performance.", "We plan to keep monitoring the data, checking for any drastic changes and outliers in the player stats further in the season when players start getting injured and the battle for points trophies gets more heated. We would also like to compare how the algorithm\u2019s team performs at the end of the season compared to most recreational players in the world. Also, we plan to update this blog once a month for those of you who are interested in following our AI\u2019s progress, so please revisit the blog at the end of each month for performance updates and enjoy the rest of the EPL action!!!", "December Updates: New blog started with updated code and team ready for the first week of EPL action:
