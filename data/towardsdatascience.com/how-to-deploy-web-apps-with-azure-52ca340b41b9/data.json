In short, we will cover:", "> Setting up our Azure App Service", "> Create our Deployment Pipeline with Azure DevOps", "First, we need an app \u2014 if you don\u2019t have one, no problem \u2014 we can use a Natural Language Generation app, which you can find on GitHub here.", "Azure needs a dist/ directory \u2014 which is an Angular-built distribution directory \u2014 containing our entire app compiled and ready for production.", "To build dist/ we open the Angular CLI and navigate to our Angular app directory. We then tell Angular to build using the production configuration with ng build --prod \u2014 the app will then compile into the dist/ directory.", "We need to make sure our ng build --prod command outputs our app directly into the dist/ directory. By default, Angular will distribute to dist/<app-name>/ \u2014 we change this in angular.json:", "Now, inside the dist/ directory we should be able to see index.html \u2014 if it is not there, find where it is and adjust the \"outputPath\" value in angular.json accordingly.", "First, we need to head over to the Azure portal \u2014 the front-page of the Azure cloud.

We then see on line 13 that the script will install Node.js to our VM.", "Finally, our YAML script installs the Angular CLI and then builds our app using the same method we used earlier to create the dist/ directory \u2014 this performs the same function (we can skip this in the earlier stage too, but it is useful for confirming that the app compiles without error).", "But we are missing one final step, the deployment to our Azure App Service.", "To add this, find Show assistant in the top-right corner \u2014 click this. Now we will see a list of all the tasks we can add to our YAML script; we need Azure App Service deploy:", "After clicking on this, a form will appear.
