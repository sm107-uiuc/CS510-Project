Let\u2019s create one with multiple Axes:", "We created the figure and axes (ax1 and ax2) with one line of code using subplots function.", "Matplotlib offers a highly flexible working environment. We have full control over the plots we created. Recall that everything we see on a matplotlib figure is an instance of Artist.
