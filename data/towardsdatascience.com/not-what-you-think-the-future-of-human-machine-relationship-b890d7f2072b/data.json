We are so used to having machines work for us in all aspects of our lives that we don\u2019t even notice these interactions between machines and us.", "What\u2019s different this time? What are the new dynamics between robots and humans in the age of artificial intelligence (AI)?", "Scene One \u2014 Algorithmic Management: Workers Being Managed by Algorithms", "More and more companies started to manage their workforces with algorithms. Sharing or gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft were the first to develop automatic tools to manage their remote workers including user rating systems and automated \u201cnudges\u201d.", "In the logistics industry, companies like UPS and Amazon are using automated systems to track their workers and optimize throughput. These algorithms collect data of workers and make (semi-)automated decisions to incentivize worker behaviors in real-time.", "A few startups also began to offer AI solutions monitoring worker or driver behaviors. Compared to human supervising, these technologies enable better scaling of operation and there are increasingly adopted by more companies.", "Scene Two \u2014 Blue-Collar Labor Working For Algorithms e.g. Data Labelers", "Previously I talked about the three main types of ML: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, and Reinforcement Learning. Today, more than 90% of the ML algorithms used are still based on Supervised Learning.", "In other words, these algorithms learn and generalize from labeled training data. To supply the labeled training data, a growing industry emerged, having humans manually organize datasets so machines can digest and learn.", "Scale AI is one of the many startups working with human workers to categorize data to train ML models. The company was founded only three years ago and recently closed a whopping $100 million series C. Scale works with around 30,000 contractors to tag datasets with human insights for autonomous car and other AI companies including Waymo, Airbnb, and Lyft.", "Scene Three \u2014 Remote Control and Imitation Learning e.g. Humans Working for (or Pretending) Robots.", "Deep Learning outperforms traditional ML when it\u2019s trained with a large amount of data. However, getting quality data could be difficult and expensive.", "One of the approaches to address this data inefficiency issue is to use Imitation Learning: training algorithms with expert demonstrations. FortressIQ is one of the startups applying imitation learning to automating processes. Its system captures and analyzes human software interactions so it can automate the processes afterward.", "On the other hand, security robot startups like Cobalt Robotics, leverage machine learning to patrol workspaces and identify anomalies while having humans monitoring fleets of robots and taking over control when necessary.", "This is not science fiction. It\u2019s happening now to someone we know and will soon affect every one of us.", "We are starting to see some side effects of these new forms of human-machine interaction.", "In a recent study, Lior Zalmanson and Robert W. Gregory found that Uber drivers feel that the app knows a lot about them but they have little understanding about how the algorithm works and makes decisions.", "Drivers feel isolated and dehumanized. They question the fairness of the system, especially when they get penalized without a clear explanation.", "Gig economy workers also feel that they are constantly being watched and scrutinized by the algorithms. They don\u2019t know what the data will be used for. They don\u2019t know if the allocation of work, ratings, or payments are fair. And if it\u2019s unfair, do they have people to talk to or other ways to file their complaints?", "The lack of explainability and interpretability has been a major issue for ML. It\u2019s efficient and more scalable to manage workers with these automated tools. But productivity should not be the only goal. Transparency and empathy need to be taken into consideration.", "In the case of Cobalt Robot, humans play a critical role as they handle all the cases that robots cannot deal with. But as robots continue to become smarter, they may come to different conclusions than their human counterparts.", "Should humans always be able to overrule robot decisions?", "Consider another example: robotaxis. Waymo has already launched robotaxi pilot. Tesla also announced its plan to launch robotaxis as part of its vision for an autonomous ride-sharing network in 2020.", "Who should be making the decisions in an autonomous robotaxi? The car? The backup human safety driver? Someone who monitors a fleet of robotaxis remotely? Or the passengers?", "In what scenario and when? Will the answer be different if you only have a split second to react? Who should be responsible for any consequence? The companies? The backup drivers? Or the engineers who designed the algorithms?", "Researchers are working on Transfer-Learning and Meta-Learning to design models that can \u201clearn how to learn\u201d. But honestly, we are still far away from artificial general intelligence.", "In the foreseeable future, we still need to teach machines and help them become more autonomous. We will need to adjust ourselves and evolve with AI-enabled machines. And we need to learn the best way to work alongside intelligent machines. Are we ready for such a drastic social shift? What can we do to create the future we want?
