The Spark has development APIs in Scala, Java, Python, and R, and supports code reuse across multiple workloads \u2014 batch processing, interactive queries, real-time analytics, machine learning, and graph processing. It utilizes in-memory caching, and optimized query execution for fast analytic queries against data of any size. It does not have its own file system like Hadoop HDFS, it supports most of all popular file systems like Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), HBase, Cassandra, Amazon S3, Amazon Redshift, Couchbase, e.t.c.", "The Advantages of using Apache Spark:", "To run pyspark on a local machine we need Java and other software. So instead of the heavy installation procedure, we use Google Colaboratory which has better hardware specifications and also comes with a wide range of libraries for Data Science and Machine Learning. We need to install pyspark and Py4J packages. The Py4J enables Python programs running in a python interpreter to dynamically access Java objects in a Java Virtual Machine. The command to install the above-said packages is", "SparkSession has become an entry point to PySpark since version 2.0 earlier the SparkContext is used as an entry point. The SparkSession is an entry point to underlying PySpark functionality to programmatically create PySpark RDD, DataFrame, and Dataset. It can be used in replace with SQLContext, HiveContext, and other contexts defined before 2.0. You should also know that SparkSession internally creates SparkConfig and SparkContext with the configuration provided with SparkSession. SparkSession can be created using SparkSession.builder builder patterns.", "To create a SparkSession, you need to use the builder pattern method builder()", "The example to create a SparkSession", "The pyspark can read data from various file formats such as Comma Separated Values (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Parquet, e.t.c. To read different file formats we use spark.read. Here are the examples to read data from different file formats:", "Let\u2019s read the U.S Stock Price data from January 2019 to July 2020 which is available in Kaggle datasets.", "The code to read the data which is in CSV file format.", "Let\u2019s see the schema of the data using PrintSchemamethod.", "Spark schema is the structure of the DataFrame or Dataset, we can define it using StructType class which is a collection of StructField that defines the column name(String), column type (DataType), nullable column (Boolean), and metadata (MetaData). spark infers the schema from data however some times the inferred datatype may not be correct or we may need to define our own column names and data types, especially while working with unstructured and semi-structured data.", "Let\u2019s see how we can use this to structure our data:", "The above code shows how to create structure using StructTypeand StructField. Then pass the created structure to the schema parameter while reading the data using spark.read.csv() . Let\u2019s see the schema of the structured data:", "There are various methods used to inspect the data. They are schema, dtypes, show, head, first, take, describe, columns, count, distinct, printSchema.

Delete Column: Use drop the method which takes the column name and returns the data.", "We often encounter missing values while dealing with real-time data. These missing values are encoded as NaN, Blanks, and placeholders.

Let\u2019s see an example to fetch the data where the adjusted value is between 100 and 500.", "It returns 0 or 1 depending on the given condition, the below example shows how to select the opening and closing price of stocks when the adjusted price is greater than equals to 200.", "It is similar to the like operator in SQL, The below example show to extract the sector names which stars with either M or C using \u2018rlike\u2019.", "The name itself explains that it groups the data by the given column name and it can perform different operations such as sum, mean, min, max, e.t.c. The below example explains how to get the average opening, closing, and adjusted stock price concerning industries.", "PySpark provides built-in standard Aggregate functions defines in DataFrame API, these come in handy when we need to make aggregate operations on columns of the data. Aggregate functions operate on a group of rows and calculate a single return value for every group. The below example shows how to display the minimum, maximum, and average; opening, closing, and adjusted stock prices from January 2019 to January 2020 concerning the sectors.", "We are going to utilize matplotlib and pandas to visualize data, the toPandas() method used to convert the data into pandas dataframe.

Let\u2019s see how to save the data in different file formats.

If you\u2019re already familiar with Python and SQL and Pandas, then PySpark is a great way to start.", "This article showed how to perform a wide range of operations starting with reading files to writing insights to file using PySpark.
