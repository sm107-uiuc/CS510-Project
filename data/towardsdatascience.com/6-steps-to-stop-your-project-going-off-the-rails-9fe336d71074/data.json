It\u2019s a 73-mile long train line running straight under Central London. It was supposed to be finished and running by the end of 2018. It is now expected to open by \u2018late 2021\u2019. This delay is projected to cost up to \u00a31.35 billion in lost revenues.", "Given the costs associated with project over-runs, you\u2019d think managers would be better at writing plans that they can actually stick to. However, time and again, schedules get broken, and budgets get obliterated. Stephen J. Dubner (of Freakonomics fame) explores this phenomenon, \u2018The Planning Fallacy\u2019 \u2014 a toxic blend of over-optimism and failure to learn from experience, which results in bad planning, in turn leading to bad project outcomes.", "\u201cThe planning fallacy is a tendency to underestimate the time it will take to complete a project while knowing that similar projects have typically taken longer in the past. So it\u2019s a combination of optimistic prediction about a particular case in the face of more general knowledge that would suggest otherwise\u2026\u201d \u2014 Prof. Roger Buehler", "Even if most of us don\u2019t have to worry about the complexities of boring a massive tunnel under a major European city, we\u2019re far from immune to the planning fallacy in our day to day lives (it\u2019s the reason why your new garden deck remains unconstructed, propped against the side of your house).", "I have a big project in my life right now.", "I\u2019m completing a course in data science, and once I\u2019ve graduated, I\u2019ll be moving to a new city and trying to get myself a shiny new job. Frankly, I can\u2019t afford for this project to go all \u2018Crossrail\u2019 on me, so I need a watertight project plan.", "Even though we\u2019re focussing on a relatively small one-man project in this blog, the points below are applicable to planning pretty much any project of any scope; launching a new product at your company with a team of thirty people, growing a startup with a business partner, or, indeed, building a new deck in your garden on your own. The main differences in managing these example projects would come during the actual implementation.", "For now, let\u2019s dive into our six-step program for better project planning!", "This sounds obvious, but a really solid project definition will save you a whole world of pain later on. To ensure that a project is well-defined, one can use the SMART principle. This is typically deployed when setting targets (e.g. for career progression), but it has plenty of applicability in project management.", "Whilst \u2018moving to a new city\u2019 might sound like a single self-contained \u2018action\u2019, it\u2019s not a straightforward task. In fact, it\u2019s pretty daunting \u2014 where do you even start? I wrote a previous blog that talked about \u2018MECE\u2019 Issue Trees as a way to break down complex analytical problems. I would take a similar approach here.", "Let\u2019s take the example of moving cities, and sequentially break down the big, potentially overwhelming actions into their constituent parts.", "This process only took me five minutes, but already I\u2019ve broken down \u201cMoving Cities\u201d into ten smaller, more manageable tasks. We could always take this process further (e.g. \u2018Pack possessions\u2019 could break down into the different rooms of the house, which we might want to tackle on different days). Indeed, the more granular you are at this point, the more accurate your final plan is likely to be.", "Either way, these ten sub-tasks are the items that need to populate your project plan \u2014 not the high-level action that we started with. It\u2019s worth noting that each sub-task should also conform to the S.M.A.R.T. framework.", "This step is important, regardless of your project\u2019s size. For each of the tasks that we defined above, decide exactly who:", "These may not be the same person!", "Of course, you should ensure that each task is assigned to someone who has both the capability and the time capacity to get it done. It\u2019s no good assigning a task to someone if they\u2019re going to get pulled onto something else by another manager.", "You should still go through this step even if you\u2019re planning a one-man project. Look at all the sub-tasks that you\u2019ve listed out (and thus assigned yourself to). Is this a reasonable workload for you? Are you even able to do all of the tasks yourself? Note \u2014 if you need to learn something in order to (e.g. researching a particular Python library), then this \u2018act of learning\u2019 needs to be a separate item in your plan!", "This is the crux of a successful project plan. Take the individual tasks you defined in stage 2, and make an honest assessment about how long each one will take in isolation.", "Do NOT do this with the overall project deadline in mind. This will distort your judgment of each task, and cause you to understate how long they\u2019ll take (which is one of the key elements of the planning fallacy).", "Our project will likely contain various sequences of tasks that must be done in order, one after the other. Using our \u2018moving cities\u2019 example, such a sequence could be: Researching areas to live -> Contacting estate agents in those areas -> Arrange apartment viewings -> Attend viewings -> Select apartment -> Pay deposit on apartment, etc\u2026", "Of course, we could construct another sequence concerned with moving our possessions between cities. Note that researching removals firms doesn\u2019t necessarily require me to have arranged apartment viewings beforehand.", "A project\u2019s critical path is the individual sequence that has the longest overall duration. The video below shows the mathematics of critical path calculation (it\u2019s more logical and lateral thinking than maths!)", "The key takeaways from this exercise are:", "What should you do if the critical path suggests that your project is going to overrun? Perhaps the project you\u2019ve been given three months to complete looks like it\u2019s going to take four\u2026", "What you should certainly NOT do is go back and decrease the time estimates you set in stage 4. Remember \u2014 we were honest when we set those estimates. Changing them now, simply to cram everything into an arbitrary timeframe, is as good as surrendering to the planning fallacy before you\u2019ve even begun.", "As a general point, you should also try to build in a \u2018buffer\u2019 (empty space towards the end of the plan) for the project to shift into in the depressingly likely case that something goes wrong or takes longer than planned.", "A Gantt chart is probably the best way to visualize the sequencing of tasks on a project. Microsoft Excel is a perfectly serviceable place to make one manually, though there are software solutions that will produce them automatically (if Python is your jam, then Plotly has good Gantt chart functionality).", "You\u2019ve taken the time to write a killer project plan. USE IT!", "Of course, how a project plan is implemented depends on the scale of the project and how many people are involved. This is neither the time nor place to delve into scrums and sprints, however, there are some rules of thumb that are applicable across the board.", "Thanks for reading all the way to the end of the blog! There are, of course, many other aspects of project management that will help your projects to be successful, but I hope that this has given you a good place to start.
