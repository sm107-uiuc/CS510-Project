Today we will challenge the best way to achieve those goals in the paid search world introducing the concept of incrementality. We will do it so by not only explaining the business rational and theory behind it but also proposing actual practical steps to operate in an incrementality framework as well as offering code samples to tackle the challenge in an efficient manner.", "Let\u2019s then start by defining incrementality as the impact that a specific action has in changing total output (that being cost, sales, revenue, profit or other). To understand incrementality we have to realise that there is always a baseline situation against which you want to measure the impact of any given action:", "A quick note before proceeding: A reasonable expectation regarding the meaning of the expression paid search incrementality could be the pursuit of understanding the incremental value of the channel as a whole (i.e. what would happen if we turned off ppc at all? Would some potential customers still find us via other marketing channels?). Although this can be an immensely insightful study for some companies, this is not what this article will be exploring today. Instead, this article will be focusing on what we described in scenario 3 and its application to the Paid Search world. Hopefully, this could be useful to help you think about your PPC goals and targets, and how to measure what are your optimal bids for achieving them.", "So like in the example of restaurants optimising the number of menu items they should have, chances are that some google ads advertising will be beneficial and profitable for your business and that too much google ads advertising starts to become marginally loss making for your company. This article proposes a framework for finding that optimal amount of google ads advertising while bearing an incrementality mindset and steering away from an averages way of thinking. This means making the transition between optimisation maturity 2 and 3 described below (which can be as important and fundamental as making the transition between optimisation maturity 1 and 2):", "But what do we mean by campaigns with the same averages but different incrementality economics? Let\u2019s consider the following example: For both campaigns ABC and XYZ, you have set a target cpa of 6\u00a3 (assuming smart bidding here but should be no different if you\u2019re running keyword level manual bidding) and Google is able to get you 100 conversions at that average cost for each campaign. Without taking incrementality into consideration you might have no reason to take different actions when optimising each campaign. However, what might be happening in the background is that campaign ABC would be able to get you 80 conversions at an average price of \u00a35.8 and extra 20 conversions at an average price of \u00a36.8 (average cpa for the total 100 conversion still being \u00a36/conversion) whereas campaign XYZ would be able to get you 80 conversions at an average price of \u00a34 and then finds some slack to get you an extra 20 conversions at an average price of \u00a314 (average cpa for the total conversions still being \u00a36 pounds \u2014 and yes this can happen and it does happen all the time in so many occasions!). Basically, in one case you are acquiring extra 20 conversions at a price that\u2019s still reasonable and in the other at a price that probably makes you lose money and this sums up the idea of why averages often hide half of the picture. We finish this section with a chart that illustrates this idea:", "At this stage, we have laid the theoretical framework in regards to why PPC Incrementality is important, but we haven\u2019t yet proposed a practical way to operate under this level of optimisation maturity and that is probably the main point of this article. It is harder though than operating on an averages framework hence fewer companies adopt it. The good thing about working with averages is that the data is usually readily available for consumption and it does not require extra steps for generating it. Google ads will provide you with detailed spend and conversion data from which you can easily calculate your average cost per conversion on the account itself or on almost whichever \u201cslice\u201d of the account (per campaign, ad group, device, a combination of device and campaign, location, audience, etc.). If you want to operate on an incrementality framework you will have to figure out which data you want to generate, do generate it and ensure its quality and accuracy.", "So, how do you run an incrementality test on your ppc account? And yes I say a test because on the one hand for many people ppc incrementality might have not been a thing they have yet implemented and on the other ppc incrementality does require testing per se. When we earlier gave an example in which out of you 100 conversions you would get at a total cost of \u00a3600 you could potentially get 80 of them at a cost of \u00a34 and extra 20 at a cost of \u00a314, we did not mention that there is actually a way to know that is the case (or not) for sure (at least statistically speaking). And the vehicle for that is the very likely known to you google ads\u2019 Drafts and Experiments. This tool will allow you to A/B test any campaign in your account splitting search traffic equally among the control and variant (or original and draft campaign in google ads jargon) and peek into what would have happened to your metrics (spend and conversions) had you have the draft instead of the original in place. The difference between your draft and original campaign will give you your incremental spend and incremental conversions. Careful though, if we don\u2019t equate statistical significance into our test, it will be as informative as doing nothing. Moreover, chances are that you will hardly ever get statistical significance at the campaign level and you will have to get less granular in your test (i.e. consider starting at account/group of campaigns/portfolio level).", "Thence it eventually boils down to the following steps (and now we enter into the practical application of the article):", "This is planning, playing with numbers and forecasts phase. You should start with a hypothesis as in any good experiment and that hypothesis should be actionable (i.e. its confirmation or not should make you take either action A or action B) and measurable with a good degree of accuracy (i.e. you must be able to generate enough data to reach a statistically significant conclusion and there shouldn\u2019t exist any technical, commercial or business blockers preventing you from generating such data). Let\u2019s get back to our example in which we had a ppc account generating a total of 100 conversions with an average cpc of \u00a36. An example of a good hypothesis, in this case, could be:", "With this in mind you\u2019ll now run some scenarios playing with the variables of the test:", "The more options you consider for the 4 variables described above the more scenarios you will end up with so we want to strike a balance between a comprehensive mix of scenarios and not getting overwhelmed by them. Back to our example, we have created some scenarios ourselves as well. We have considered two metrics; two variations in bidding levels; two different assumptions to what happens to spend and conversions when varying each of the bidding levels; and two test durations. All these combinations resulted in a total of 16 scenarios as per the table below:", "The first thing that is important to explain is that you will generate a lot more \u201cspend\u201d data than \u201cconversions\u201d data, hence your spend confidence interval will usually be very close to its point estimate meaning that your test accuracy will mostly depend on your conversions data.", "Secondly, the confidence intervals calculation depend not only of your assumptions but also on how much data you will generate (you should look into your account\u2019s historic to have an idea of how much that is in your case). In the \u201cEvaluate the Test\u201d section we dive deeper into confidence intervals calculations which you can then also apply when calculating the expected CIs in the scenario analysis.", "So, once we have all these it\u2019s time to make decisions regarding the final design of our experiment and looking at the scenarios in the example it seems that the following are not possible:", "Hence our options would be either:", "Which one you end up choosing depends on what\u2019s more important for you in the tradeoff of test duration vs lower funnel conversions.", "At this point you have chosen the design of your test and here is where we need to get a bit more technical as we will be introducing code samples to tackle this step. Python being the data language of election will be what will be using, plus we will be interacting with the adwords API. So to start with you will need to connect to your account\u2019s AdWords API. If you haven\u2019t used the API before, the first thing you have to do is to get a Developer Token; a Google Client ID (this is different from the Client Customer Id \u2014 the one you actually see in google ads user interface with a number similar to this one: 562\u2013425\u20133085); Google Client Secret; and Google Refresh Token. There\u2019s very useful documentation in how to get started with the adwords API and generate all of the above in here.", "If you have succeeded on the above then the following script should connect you to your adwords API:", "The next thing you will probably have to do relates to budgets. If you are not using any shared budgets in your account you can ignore this next bit, but my bet is that at least some of your campaigns are sharing budgets. If that is indeed your account\u2019s case then the next bit sets to address one of the drawbacks of using Drafts and Experiments: you can\u2019t create a draft for a campaign that is using a shared budget. This means that you will have to create individual budgets and assign each of them to your campaigns. Fortunately, you can also do this programmatically, which will save you lots of time when doing it for all the campaigns in your account that you proposed to enter the incrementality test. Once you decide what is a sensible amount for each campaign\u2019s individual budget, the following scripts will help you create them:", "Now is a good time to introduce why google has probably named this feature Drafts and Experiments and not juts Drafts or just Experiments, since creating a draft is next on the list. In a nutshell, a draft when created is a duplication of an existing campaign that will always remain linked with its original campaign (i.e. can\u2019t run on its own independently) and that will see some component of it get changed vs the original campaign (in theory you don\u2019t have to but that would seem pointless); whereas an experiment is the settings that will determine in which circumstances and for how long a test between a draft and an original campaign will happen (what is the split of traffic, if this split is made on a cookie or search basis, what\u2019s the start date, etc.). A draft is a campaign, an experiment are settings.", "So next on the list is to create the Draft, which can be accomplished by running the script below:", "And surely the most important thing to note is the information returned by this create_draft() function as we will need it afterwards to make changes to the draft campaign and also to create the experiment. And that is exactly what we will be doing next: changes to the draft campaign.", "As in the examples earlier above we will consider that you are operating on a target_cpa smart bidding strategy and that you want to find out what happens when you drop your targets by 30%. The code below will help you with that.", "The code above is doing two things, firstly it creates a target cpa portfolio with a target that is 30% less than the portfolio that is assigned to the original campaign, and secondly, it assigns that newly created portfolio to the draft campaign we created in the step before. There are a few additional things though that we should bear in mind:", "Once the above is done, we\u2019re off to the final step of making an experiment live using Drafts and Experiments. Not a complicated one, you just need to grab the draft_id an campaign_id returned by the create_draft() function, then chose an experiment name (ideally something along the lines of a bit that identifies the original campaign and a bit that identifies the whole group of experiments that are part of this test like a suffix: campaign_123-decrease_30_test for example), a split percentage (recommend 50%) and a split_type (recommend Cookie). The following code will then handle the final operation of this section:", "When you are running a test there is nothing worse than seeing it being invalidated, particularly for totally unavoidable reasons. This section is about the watchpoints of things that can go wrong if we are not careful and that ultimately would invalidate this test\u2019s data (these incrementality datasets) that is so precious for our end goal. The crux of the matter is that the only setting that should be different between your original and draft campaigns is the bidding levels. So:", "Ultimately it\u2019s a balance of either trying to avoid making many changes to the campaigns that you have created a draft and experiment for; or having a robust system in place that will ensure changes applied to original are also applied to draft.", "Finally, one extra note to close this section: Did your portfolios in the draft campaigns went into learning mode and behave \u00abfunny\u00bb in the first few days? If yes, consider excluding these days from your incrementality dataset.", "So you\u2019ve launched your test and you made sure it\u2019s running on fair terms, the next thing you want to do is to gather and prepare the test data in a manner that\u2019s suitable for analysis and evaluation. In line with what we have done so far we will resort to adwords api to tackle this step of the process as well.", "But first let me ask you, have you heard about fivetran? If not please do yourself a favour a go implement it straight ahead! Assuming you currently use fivetran or you went on implementing it and came back to the article, we will use the google ads fivetran connector to get ourselves the data we need. The alternative would be to use the AdWords Query Language (AWQL) directly, but fivetran handles all of that for us with just a few clicks.", "So, using fivetran what we need to do is to create a new google ads connector and sync a Campaign Performance Report into your database of election (psst\u2026 snowflake is the best one) choosing the following fields as per the image below:", "And finally, once this data has made its way into your database, the following query will organise it in a way that\u2019s suitable for test evaluation (Such query will serve as the backbone for the evaluation of the test):", "At this stage, your test is coming to an end or is already finished. You have collected and prepared your data in a way that is now suitable for analysis and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019re going to do now. But how? There\u2019s not one single right to way to it, but we propose that we use a statistical technique called bootstrap resampling (which is actually not so different from what google itself uses to report their confidence intervals \u2014 they use jackknife resampling though). The reason why we need to do this has to due with google only reporting confidence intervals on individual campaigns\u2019 experiments, so if you are running an experiment on a multitude of campaigns you will have to calculate such confidence intervals yourself as if they were one big campaign because they are in fact all part of the same experiment.", "The end goal of this stage is not just to find the difference in spend and in conversions between the test and control groups (because that is relatively easy \u2014 we just need to look at total spend and conversions on both groups of the experiment) but also to find a confidence interval for that difference hence the resampling. By resampling we will be taking a sample (pass the redundancy) with replacement of n observations of the performance of different campaigns on different days and compare the differences between test and control (n being the total number of rows yielded by the query provided in section 4 \u2014 i.e. total combinations of campaigns/days). We will be repeating this process a multitude of times (usually between 1,000 and 10,000) and for each of them comparing the difference between test and control. Having this set of samples we are now able to calculate the point estimate (the mean of the resample\u2019s means) and the variance of performance amongst this set of samples and hence calculating our statistics\u2019 standard deviation as:", "And now having both the variance and the observed difference between control and test we are able to calculate the so much wanted confidence interval as:", "Finally, we can say with 90% of confidence that the true difference in performance at different bidding levels in our ppc account lies between the lower bound and the upper bound of the confidence interval and make business decisions accordingly \u2014 back to our example in the scenario analysis section this means that if the confidence interval is below \u00a315 we will maintain our bidding levels, however, if it is above \u00a315 we will decrease our bids by 30% (as the marginal cost of the marginal conversions would be above our threshold of profitability)", "The actual code to do make such calculations using python and a dummy dataset mimicking one prepared accordingly to the methodology proposed in step 4 are as per below:", "If you are interested in finding out more about this resampling technique and the theory behind it I really recommend this article.", "This is probably one of the most interesting and joyfully stages of this whole journey. You have successfully identified what\u2019s the incremental value of going from bidding level x to bidding level y and gave your business crucial information to make a decision on whether to keep the biding levels or change them depending on the incremental value of your incremental spend. You have done this for the overall account potentially if your doing it for the first time or if you don\u2019t generate a lot of conversion data; or you have gone further and did it for multiple portfolios, groups of campaigns or others (meaning that your test was actually a set of tests and you took actions on each of them accordingly) \u2014 for simplicity though, in this section we will assume you did an overall account test.", "Nonetheless having a clear hypothesis that we want to answer being the main goal of this venture, a ppc incrementality test should also create many byproducts that you won\u2019t want to ignore. The byproducts might need to be planned (for example if you purposely breakdown your campaigns into targeting locations where it is raining at the moment and locations where it isn\u2019t raining \u2014 farfetched in most cases but for instance if you have a windshield business or you sell snow chains this might be important for you) but usually they will be available in on or more of the many adwords report types and in many cases they will even be unintentional and only found after careful post test analysis. So let\u2019s dig more into this second option: I will give a couple of examples in bigger depth and in addition suggest a list of factors that might have an interesting impact into different incrementality levels within your account \u2014 your job is to look at all of them and find out which ones are more decisive for your business.", "Example 1: Impression share can play a critical role in incrementality. Imagine you sell two types of t-shirts in your website \u2014 A blue and a red one (and you have a ppc campaign for each of them). They\u2019re both sold at the same price but the blue T-shirt\u2019s conversion rate is 40% and the red\u2019s is 10%, hence you\u2019re willing to pay 4x more for a blue T-shirt ppc click than a red T-shirt click. In this case you\u2019ll end up with the same cost per conversion on both campaigns but you\u2019ll likely have a higher impression share on the blue campaign (because you\u2019re paying more per click). What\u2019s important about this is that usually, it\u2019s difficult to go after the extra bit of potential customers that you\u2019re not showing ads to when you have 80% impression share than going after a few more of the yet so many available potential customers when your impression share is 20%, hence (rule of thumb) the higher the impression share the higher is your marginal cost per conversion and this is particularly noticeable on both extremes of impression share. Below is a real life based example of the role of impression share in marginal cost per conversion:", "Example 2: Your main competitor offers their services both via web and via an app and to attract customers they use both google search ads and universal app campaigns. This means that your competitor will have a wider range of possibilities and a higher probability of competing for the same search keywords in a mobile device than in a computer. The competitive landscape will be more favourable in computer devices and all things equal you would expect your marginal cost per conversion to be higher on mobile devices than in computers.", "List of factors potentially playing an important role into incrementality:", "Finally, what\u2019s still most important about these analyses is that they should and most likely will inform which tests you will run next. Let\u2019s say again this was the very first test you ran and you had no preconceived idea of which factors would most contribute to incrementality within the account. After you run such exploratory analysis you will be able to formulate a more robust hypothesis and ensure you design a test to statistically prove (or not) that. For example, you might be able to group campaigns into four groups because you observe a pattern and design a test that will ensure you find with precision their incrementality levels and shift spending across them according to the test results; or you might design a test-focused in confirming (or not) that campaigns/ad groups / or devices with higher impression share will be less incremental hence shifting budget to the ones with lower levels of IS.", "If you have made it this far then congrats, you\u2019ve done it \u2014 you have optimised your paid search account in an incrementality framework. Nevertheless, now it\u2019s also the time to think about the future and how you are going to keep operating in an incrementality world. Below a list of the 3 most important things you want to consider at this wrapping up stage:", "This article covered the reasoning behind paid search incrementality, why you should implement it in your marketing optimisation routines, and a practical way to indeed implement it; but instead of using this section to stress any of those points, I will save it to talk about the impact which at the end of the day is what really matters. Hope this will be the extra bit of motivation you need to actually go for it and implement it on your paid search account. So let me end talking about a startup in which we implemented this methodology and what it meant for the company:", "Leaving a note on potential alternative ways to tackle this challenge other than the Drafts & Experiments route. The first one is to use google ads bid landscapes \u2014 these are basically estimates that google makes about spend, conversions and conversion value were you to have different target cpas or target road. You can use these in the google ads UI for a one-off or programmatically via the API: The main drawback is that is only available on an ad-group level which may not generalise well for your use case and in addition the ad group needs to meet certain criteria. If this becomes available via the API on campaign or portfolio level this can become really powerful though. The second alternative is to use the trafficEstimator API \u2014 Haven\u2019t used it myself because I have been working with smart bidding mostly but if you use manual bidding this tool should help you calculate how many clicks you\u2019d generate for different bidding levels(max cpcs in this case) and if you assume a flat conversion rate from click to conversion you will be able to calculate you marginal cost per conversion from bidding level x to bidding level y.", "Your home for data science.
