Often times information on the internet can be incorrect, or can be poorly documented because the individual explaining things to you is not necessarily a great writer, despite how great they might be at programming. One thing I enjoy a lot is when programming and learning can be made fun by being done with something that you are passionate about. I like to think back to a peer of mine who had a strong medical background and was spoiling herself with data science. All of her projects seemed to correlate with that interest, and it really seemed to make her projects stand out as she had passion and enjoyment in discussing the topics she was researching.", "Learning a language is something that can be interesting on its own, but can be made even more interesting with a little spin put into it. The difference between a great programming book and a not-so-great programming book is self-awareness; we\u2019re all programmers so there is no need to take everything so seriously. There are a lot of really cool examples of books that I have read with fun and interesting projects to help you learn a new programming language.", "Python has come into even more popularity in recent years with the rise of machine-learning. This is for good reason, as Python and C make quite a capable combination when it comes to Data Science. If you would like to learn Python, now is your chance, and \u201c Learn Python The Hard Way\u201d is the way to do it.", "This was a book that one of my instructors made me aware about forever ago, and I am glad he did. This book is enjoyably pessimistic, and might give you a few laughs \u2014 but at the same time has a really great methodology. The idea behind learning Python the hard way is to throw you into the world of Python with no clue whatsoever how to program and force you to type along. After all, what is a better way to learn than by doing? The book does a great job at walking the reader along so they understand concepts while simultaneously pushing them further outside their comfort zone.", "If you are thinking about learning Python, I would definitely recommend this book. This book is especially great if you admire self-deprecating humor, as you might be able to infer from reading the subtitle.", "A Very Simple Introduction to the Terrifyingly Beautiful World of Computers and Code.", "This is obviously a book for those who are new to programming. What is great about this book is that it will teach those who have never touched a programming language in their life. If you\u2019re thinking about getting into programming, especially machine-learning, then Python is certainly a great language to build your foundation in.", "If you\u2019re unfamiliar with Bjarne Stroustup, you might want to know who he is before approaching C++. Bjarne Stroustup is a Danish computer scientist credited with the creation of the C++ programming language. With that, as the creator of the language he likely has some of the best books about programming in that language.", "What I like about this book is that it gives you a bit of a look into the inner-workings of C++ without ever getting so complicated that you have to reread paragraphs. Bjarne\u2019s writing is direct, but almost has a witty undertone to it that makes the book that much more enjoyable. Ideas are presented in a way that most users of any other language could definitely pick up on.", "C++ is still a very widely used language today. Most of the time, C++ is used for one of the following:", "But there are many more uses for C++ that aren\u2019t on that list, and there is absolutely nothing wrong with using the language for nearly any application as far as I am concerned. However, be aware that C++ will be a little harder of a language to learn than a simpler scripting language like Python or Java-script, and is more akin to something like Java SE. It certainly is possible to learn C++ as your first introduction to programming, as C++ was the first programming language I learned around 12 years ago. I think that the reason for that was because I wasn\u2019t aware of the usability of scripting languages really at the time.", "I would say whatever practical uses you have for a programming language should be the single factor that decides which languages you approach. For example, I mostly work in Python, Julia, R, and Common Lisp. Three of those are functional languages and half of them are basically made for statistics. I do write some C or even Assembly every now and then, but usually those languages aren\u2019t of use to me because of what I do. So what you should do is figure out what exactly it is you want to program, and pursue languages that interest you that are widely-used for that operation.", "Taking a functional pivot for a moment, I introduce to you to Common Lisp: A Gentle Introduction to Symbolic Computation. This is a book I hold near and dear to my heart, as it was the one I used to learn Lisp. Lisp was one of those languages I always wanted to learn, but never quite got around to picking up until the middle of last year.", "This book will take you through how Lisp handles basically everything, which is really nice because it can be rather hard to find information on building Lisp packages online. On top of that, there is a brief introduction to meta-programming, macros, and using symbols as code inside of data \u2014 Common Lisp\u2019s bread and butter.", "I would say no matter what you want to do, with your programs, you should at least be a little familiar with Common Lisp \u2014 or some Lisp variant like Clojure or Scheme. Why? Well, the syntax and expressive typing of Lisp will make you a better programmer. It will also get you very familiar with how methods work from the lower level. There is a reason that everyone enjoys building Lisp interpreters, and nobody likes building C interpreters.", "In other words, Lisp has far easier syntax and expressions for a processor to understand with far less memory movements and CMPs/JNEs in the Assembly to do so. As a result, interpreting Lisp with Assembly comes rather naturally compared to most other languages.", "Let\u2019s face the facts: C is a rather hard level to learn and program in. Especially for a newer programmer, learning C can be a daunting task to accomplish that is going to take a lot of work. At the same time, however, there is no replacement for the C language. The C language is so ingrained into the entire computing ecosystem that we will never get rid of it, so we might as well learn it.", "What I liked about this book is that it takes each individual part and explains how they go together, what order they go together, and most importantly:", "Like C++, I certainly wouldn\u2019t advise learning C as your first language even though it is possible. I say this only because there are other languages out there that will allow you to learn programming concepts a lot faster without having to worry about syntax and pointers. After you get familiar with these concepts, that programming base you built will carry over wonderfully into any other language you approach, including C.", "Taking a complete one-hundred-eighty degree turn, allow me to introduce you to Javascript & JQuery by Jon Duckett. What is great about this book is that it takes a rather basic and relatively simple approach to writing a beginner-friendly scripting language. Java-script as a language is a lot like Python, and is the biggest tool in the domain of web development that we have available to us today.", "JQuery is also an industry-standard technology commonly used on websites. Where things really get exciting, though, is when the two are combined together and synergize with one another. One critique I do have for this book is that it is rather basic and purely explanatory, which makes it a little boring to read consistently all the way through. The approach I would take with this book is using it as a reference book, rather than a reading book. There is lots of very useful information that can be easily referenced and recycled in this book, as the examples are usually pretty top-notch. This is certainly one of the best choices on this list for absolute beginners, especially if you also have a fondness for web development.", "Well there you have it; those are some of my favorite books that I have read to either get me started in a language I was unfamiliar with, or use consistently as a reference when I get stuck in my code. Though all of these books are certainly worth a read, for some there might be more incentive to read certain books more than others. There are also probably a million different books out there for picking up a new language. There are so many that I could never possibly quantify all of them, but I would appreciate any book recommendations left in the responses! Feel free to leave what book you found the most helpful in learning the language of your choice!", "Your home for data science.
