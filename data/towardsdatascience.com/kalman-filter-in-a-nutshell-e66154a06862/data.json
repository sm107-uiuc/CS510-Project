By going through this example, I hope my readers will understand that the motivations and logic behind it is really very pragmatic in nature and not so complicated after all.", "So let\u2019s get started with our example.", "I am dropping a tennis ball from a helicopter (or maybe my airship), I would like to predict its position in the air until it hits the ground.", "You would think this is a very simple problem, right? After all, we\u2019ve got our equations of motion:", "Where g is acceleration due to gravity (9.81 meters per second squared).", "Well, unfortunately the real world is not that simple. If you are dropping a lead ball I suppose the equations of motion are all you need, but for something light like a tennis ball, it\u2019s trajectory might be affected by all sorts of things.", "For example, there might be a really strong wind blowing.", "Or a really hungry alligator might be near by\u2026", "So, if your prediction solely comes from the equations, it might be really off by the time the ball reaches the ground.", "Suppose we drop a ball 20,000 meters above ground, it will mostly follow the the equations of motion, with random forces such as wind and alligators affecting it\u2019s trajectory:", "Let\u2019s take a moment to look at this equation.", "The matrix F applied on the motion vector at t-1 are the equations of motion we have just looked at:", "The vertical vector G applied on N represents the amount of deviation to position and velocity modeled as normally distributed acceleration caused by real world noises such as wind, birds, alligators, etc:", "0 \u2014 noises applied to acceleration at time t", "So the complete simulation of motion at time t is:", "Here, N(0, sigma(a)\u00b2) represents a normal distribution of random noises applied on the position and velocity of the tennis ball. But why is this noise not applied to acceleration? Because the noise is transient and does not build upon the previous perturbation to acceleration and its effect is only accumulated in the velocity and position of the tennis ball. (Thanks to Klaus Lichtenegger for pointing that out!)", "Our initial conditions, therefore, are as follows:", "And suppose that our random forces effectively have a standard deviation of say 20 meters per second squared (an exaggeration).", "The trajectory of the tennis ball will look something like below:", "How accurate is our prediction with equations of motion?", "Now suppose we try to predict the trajectory of the tennis ball with only the equations of motion, how accurate will it be?", "As you can see, the difference can accumulate and become quite significant.", "How do we improve this prediction with Kalman filter?", "Kalman filter takes advantage of the fact that you don\u2019t need to wait till the tennis hits the ground to know its position. If you have a camera with you, for example, you can take a picture of the tennis ball every 10 seconds and estimate its position from it so that you can update your prediction from the observation. (So don\u2019t ever forget to bring your phone!)", "Suppose at time t, we take a picture of tennis ball, what will it look like?", "It\u2019s not going to give you a perfect observation (nothing can be perfect). But you can get a good estimate from it. Below is the mathematical representation of the observation:", "In this case, you have the actual state of the ball for which you don\u2019t know the exact values, but you can observe it with an observation model, H.", "H represents our camera, since from the picture taken by a camera you can only find position y at time t, it\u2019s a horizontal unit vector. If, say, we have a radar that can actually observe the velocity as well, we can use [[1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]] as observation model:", "The third part N(0, sigma(z)\u00b2), represents the inaccuracies associated with the observation, and it\u2019s a normal random variable with mean 0 and standard deviation sigma z. Think of it as how accurate your camera is (or how pricey it is), similarly for N(0, sigma(w)2), if you have a pricey radar.", "Apply Kalman filter to improve the predictions with observations.", "Kalman filter provides us with a recipe for using the observation to improve the prediction.", "\u2014 here the idea is that if the observation is perfect (R=0), then the gain should be 1, so that your updated estimate is basically the observation.", "\u2014 if the variance of the position is high (the prediction is not very accurate), even if the observation is not that accurate, it\u2019s a good idea to give a bit more weight to it since compared to the accuracy of the prediction it\u2019s not so bad.", "As you can see, the purpose of Kalman filter is to improve your predictions with periodic observations. If you have observations, great, let\u2019s use them, if not, just continue the prediction process.", "Below is a comparison of performance using Kalman filters to improve prediction with observations every 50, 10, 5 seconds:", "As you can see, more frequent observations definitely improve predicted values.", "By going through this simple application of Kalman filter, I hope my readers have gained an intuitive understanding of the Kalman filter estimation improvement process. As we can see from the example, how accurate the prediction is ultimately depends on the model used to generate the prediction. Kalman filter can help improve the prediction with appropriately chosen error models for the prediction(sigma a) and the observation (sigma z). There are many improvements that can be made to the Kalman filter, we\u2019ll talk about them in the future.", "Please see my GitHub gist for complete code: Gist for Kalman Filter", "Your home for data science.
