Sometimes locally on my notebook, sometimes on a server through JupyterHub. But why not combine both and run a JupyterHub on a Raspberry Pi? This way everyone in the household can start a notebook from every device with a browser. The data always stays home and as Raspberry Pis become more and more powerful, we can actually do real data science on it.", "There are many articles out there that describe how to set up JupyterHub, most of them, however, use Anaconda. Unfortunately, Anaconda does not support ARM-systems like the Raspberry Pi and Miniconda, that is often suggested as an alternative, is apparently not further maintained. So let\u2019s go with pip.", "Did I do something wrong? When I typed \u201cpython\u201d in my fresh Raspbian Buster installation, it opened \u201cpython2\u201d. Seriously? Isn\u2019t it 2020? So let\u2019s quickly redirect the system to python3:", "and install the python package manager pip:", "Accordingly, we need to install these three components.

You can generate the template using the following command. Afterwards, move it to a location outside your home directory:", "In the following steps, when we make changes in the config file, we need to modify this file /root/jupyterhub_config.py. Since it is located in /root, we need to use sudo.", "For example, by default JupyterHub runs on port 8000. Maybe we already have this port in use, so let\u2019s change it to 8888. For that uncomment the following statement in the config-file and adjust the port:", "Our JupyterHub is now ready to go. We could start it with jupyterhub -f /root/jupyterhub_config.py & (where -f points to the config file we just created). However, the hub would only survive until the next restart of the system. Fine for a first try but if we use it on a regular basis, it is certainly better to set up JupyterHub as a system service so that it is automatically launched at system start.", "To register JupyterHub as a system service, create the file /lib/systemd/system/jupyterhub.service and fill it with:", "Make sure that the line starting with ExecStart contains the correct location of the JupyterHub binary and the config-file or adjust accordingly.", "JupyterHub will now launch at system start. The last command shows you the status which is hopefully \u201cactive (running)\u201d.", "If this is the case, go to http://<address of your raspi>:8888.

Every system user of the Raspberry Pi can now log in and launch their own notebook server!", "JupyterLab is the next-generation web-based user interface for Project Jupyter. It allows you to work with documents and notebooks in a very flexible manner. If you are not convinced yet: It even has a dark mode\u2026", "To use JupyterLab instead of the traditional notebooks, we first have to install it using pip and then enable the extension (use sudo to do it systemwide):", "Now, we have to add (or uncomment and adjust the respective line) the following in the config-file:", "To do actual data science, we will certainly need a bit more than just the python standard library. We have essentially two possibilities: We can install them system-wide. Alternatively, every user can install them in their home directory.", "A reasonable approach would be to install the most often used packages system-wide and let the users install everything else on their own. As an example here is how to install numpy system-wide. For numpy to work, you will also have to install the following system package:", "Users without sudo-rights can install packages in their home directory with, for example:", "You can actually open a terminal from within JupyterLab, so there is no need to set up a ssh-connection for \u201cnormal\u201d users. Just go to the launcher window and open a terminal.", "In our current setup, users are managed by the operating system. This means every user of the Raspberry Pi can also start their own notebook server.", "Admins have additional rights. For example, they can access the Admin Panel from where they can see which users are logged in and start and stop their servers. Admin rights are handled through groups. For example, if we wanted to nominate the user \u201cgerold\u201d as admin, we would first create a group (we could also use a pre-existing one) and add the user to it.
