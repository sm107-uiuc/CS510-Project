Now, some problems have constraints to their solutions and are not that straight-forward to solve with simply taking the gradient and setting it to zero. In this article, we talk about constrained least squares.", "The new optimization problem takes the following form:", "What is different in comparison to the previous formulations that we saw here and here? This pesky s.t. line. S.t. is short for subject to, and what is our optimization subject to? It is subject to a set of linear equality constraints, since by now we know that this formulation is short for a set of linear equations.", "Now, we also have to introduce some terminology to talk about the problem in a bit more detail. It is quite simple, a solution (i.e. the vector w) is called feasible if it satisfies the set of constraints. It follows that a set of solutions that satisfy the set of constraints is called the feasible set. Conversely, the feasible set contains the optimal point, i.e. the solution to the problem.", "If you read my previous article on multi-objective least squares. It is known that the multi-objective least squares optimization problem is formulated with a vector \u03bb that weights the separate objectives. Interestingly, the constrained least squares optimization problem can be seen as a special case of the multi-objective least squares problem. Let me state it plainly:", "Constrained least squares is a special case of multi-objective least squares.", "And how is it a special case? Well, in the constrained least squares case we have 2 objectives: the constraints and the main objective. We can formulate it in a sense as a multi-objective least squares problem:", "But wait, this looks pretty much the same as multi-objective least-squares, but with a little bit different notation\u2026", "Seems suspiciously similar, right? So, what is the catch\u2026 The catch is that in the case of constrained least-squares, where we have hard constraints, we would set \u03bb 1 to infinity. Logically, minimizing this objective such that the second lambda is much greater than the first:", "Yields a solution to the constrained least squares problem with a set of hard constraints. Here is the code:", "The results are obviously not that surprising, pretty much what you would expect \u2014 the estimate does not fit the objective perfectly, since the optimum of the objective function is not contained in the feasible set. Note that the plot is 3D because each point in X is 2D and the output that we regress is 1D.", "Of course, depending on the problem it can happen that the optimum is contained. With soft constraints the problem becomes much more manageable, a deeper analysis of this is going to be covered in future articles.", "Good job, now if you have read this article with my previous articles on least squares:", "You are pretty knowledgeable about least squares. This is not to say that I have covered everything concerning least squares, there are still specific cases left that tweak the objective function a bit to fit the problem. Such as in the case when we are using kernels, or in the case where we are forecasting time series. But, most of the times we can reduce the new problem to the basic formulation, allowing us to use simple straight-forward linear algebra for solving a set of linear equations to obtain the solution.", "On that note, keep on learning and thanks for reading!", "Your home for data science.
