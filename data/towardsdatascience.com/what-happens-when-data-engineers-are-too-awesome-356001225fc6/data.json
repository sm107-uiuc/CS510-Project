On the surface, this seems like a wise investment. The analysts and scientists have time freed up to work on modeling and presentations to business sponsors. There is a hidden downside. I will argue that we should not separate the analysts and scientists far from the data sources.", "The standard rule of thumb is that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning the data. Data Scientists are not cheap. It makes financial sense to dedicate resources to data engineering. Many data scientists hate dealing with raw data. They are happy to let the engineer worry about sourcing the data and getting the formatting aligned. Most of the time, I agree with this arrangement. I spent months and months advocating for data engineering roles within my data analytics team. I love automation. Useful clean data is key to automation. When a good engineer knocks six hours off our process time, we heap well-earned praise upon them.", "So, why am I hesitant to go all-in on this alignment? The raw data. Not the data from an API or a curated dataset. Real-world business data. The kind of data that infuriates with its caveats. Only a tenured subject matter expert truly understands the variations of data and why the nuances occur. Real data is ugly. The job category has nulls where it shouldn\u2019t, and someone shows as 158 years old. Really?", "Data engineers and most data scientists groan when they see this variable data. It messes with the automated tasks and doesn\u2019t fit nicely into our algorithms. We are sometimes too quick to \u2018manage\u2019 the ugly data and outliers. We may automatically median out the nulls and exclude all rows where the customer is over 100 years old. We drop our heads on our desks when we see that some of these customer names have quotes, and some do not. We cry out, \u2018WHY?\u2019", "I want to make a point about the story that data tells. Even the lousy data points tell stories if you search enough. Rather than remove the quotation marks from the name field to match those rows that don\u2019t have the quotations, perhaps you can consult your SME. Why does that happen? If you are proficient in the base coding language of the application, you can look for yourself. You may find out that customers entering their information themselves do not get quotes in the name field. Customers who are automatically signed up by a third party, such as their healthcare providers, show up with quotes. Depending on what you are measuring or trying to predict, this is rich data! This variation might become an indicator that the customer entered this program voluntarily or not. That piece of information may not live anywhere else in the database.", "The ability to look deeply into the data to identify hidden features is a real differentiator. It may set you apart from the other data scientists and, in the best scenario, set your company apart from the competitors. You need to differentiate yourself, your work, and your outcomes. Plus, detective work can be fun. I personally do not like to use any data sources that are \u2018curated\u2019 without being able to see and understand the underlying code that built those pieces of data.", "So, to begin differentiating your data feature skills:", "Your home for data science.
