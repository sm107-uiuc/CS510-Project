The aim of any hackathon is to let your imagination guide you to push the boundaries of your knowledge and skills in this field.", "After 2 years of self-learning, I decided to put my skills to test on the actual battleground with other data scientists. So I decided to take part in online hackathons. I decided to shortlist websites and soon picked Analytics Vidhya to start my hackathon journey.", "My initial start was not that good enough. But I managed to score a Top 50 rank in one of my first 4 online hackathons.", "One important thing I learnt from it was not to participate in all available hackathons.", "It is important to shortlist a specific hackathon you want to focus on and give your best for it. Don\u2019t participate in multiple hackathons simultaneously as every hackathon needs proper time and hardwork.", "In August, Analytics Vidhya launched Data Supremacy Hackathon.", "And after reading about the problem statement, I decided to participate and give my best. I will be deciding the solution in different sections for easier understanding.", "The hackathon was a binary classification problem where we have to predict if a particular student is eligible or not based on his historical background.", "Total features given : 13 features [ columns ]", "This is an important step which almost everyone skips.", "Don\u2019t directly jump to writing machine learning code. First understand the problem and what every feature means. See if you can find any relation with the features and the target variable.", "After doing a proper study of all the features, I decided to start with the code.", "Following are the libraries which I have used for the whole hackathon.", "The 3 basic libraries I use almost everywhere.", "Note: I have included more libraries than the ones I have actually used to show you all the libraries which I have tried during the hackathon.", "It is now time to read the training and testing csv.", "I had to split the snapshot into two pics as it won\u2019t be visible in one pic.", "Target column is the column to be predicted in our testing file.", "Around 75% of my total time was dedicated to preprocess the data.", "I studied all the columns to think of all the ways I could preprocess them and came up with my final preprocessing code.", "Note: Preprocessing techniques for every column is different and won\u2019t be same everywhere.", "First, it was time to remove the textual part from city column", "This will contain a list with 2 values ( the former being \u2018city\u2019 and latter bring the number assigned)", "You can see the changes done. I did the same for test_data.", "Then I decided to check if the data contains any missing values.", "We need to deal properly with these missing values, as discarding them will lead to loss of important information.", "Before we start imputing missing values and preprocessing them, we will combine the training and testing data. This will help in making the same changes to the whole dataset.", "Before combining, pop out the target column from training data as it is not present in testing data.", "Now it was time to start further preprocessing. I changed the datatype of city column from string to integer:", "I replaced the gender column to integer category:", "I did the same for another 2 columns:", "To illustrate how company_size looked like:", "The company_type column had categorical values:", "Instead of giving random numbers to replace, I replaced them with increasing order of their audience.", "I also did a few replacements in the remaining columns.", "I tried various imputation techniques including the SimpleImputator from sklearn library. I even tried imputing them with mean but it wasn't preforming better than imputing them by 0", "Since the data had a different range in their values. I decided to standardize the data before I proceed to our model.", "I have used MinMaxScaler which allows me to customize my minimum and maximum value of range.", "In order to move to our model, we need to remove the ID column.", "Honestly speaking, I tried more than 10 algorithms to see which one works.", "I started from RandomForest to CatBoost.", "But XGBoost outperformed all the other algorithms. So I stuck with it to create the model function:", "The above snippet includes model fitting and plotting the feature importance graph in one function.", "Finally comes my model and it\u2019s parameter:", "How did you get these parameters?", "I used GridSearchCV function which helps in deciding the best parameter from the range of parameters you feed in to it.", "GridSearchCV prints out the best parameters from the permutation of hyperparameters we pass. ( Scoring is set to \u2018roc_auc\u2019 )", "After getting the appropriate hyperparameter, It was time to fit the model.", "As you can see, training_hours was the most important feature for making the student eligible followed by city_development_index and experience.", "I used KFold to evaluate my model to check it\u2019s effectiveness.", "KFold will provide train/test indices to split data into train and test sets. It will split a dataset into k consecutive folds. Since the model accuracy and kfold are very similar, the model is working properly.", "I uploaded more than 20 submission files in total to improve my score and reach the peak.", "All the hard work paid off. I secured 3rd rank in the hackathon amongst 1000 people worldwide. Following is the snapshot of the leaderboard.", "The code can be found on my GitHub repository :", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
