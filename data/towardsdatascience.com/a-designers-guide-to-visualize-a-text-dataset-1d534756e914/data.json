As a user experience and information designer, I wanted to build on my technical skills. I achieved this by combining my \u201cinterests\u201d and picking an unusual yet interesting dataset.", "After a lot of searching, I came across this wonderful interactive dataviz project, \u2018The Office\u2019 Dialogue in Five Charts by The Pudding. This project was a great starting reference and it also pointed me to an awesome dataset that I could visualize. This dataset is essentially a collection of all the lines spoken in every episode of The Office.", "Great! I had found data, and now I could finally begin!", "First, I decided to set up some goals and constraints for this project based on my technical abilities and the skills I wished to learn.", "Why did I start this project in the first place? What did I hope to learn? What did I want to accomplish?", "My goals for this project were:", "Next, to guide my design, I started thinking about the objectives of this visualization. My approach was to start asking questions that could be explored.", "The goal wasn\u2019t to answer all the questions, but use them to brainstorm visualization concepts and ideas.", "I brainstormed some ideas and viable solutions based on the available data and my goals. My ideas revolved around representing numerical values derived from a text-based dataset.", "I decided to sketch out my final design, before beginning to code. This proved to be a useful artifact, for figuring out the math and the logic.", "Here, I have visualized a linear conversation in a non-linear manner.", "Every dialogue spoken in an episode is denoted as one line segment. To convey the continuous nature of a conversation all the line segments are connected to each other. However, they are connected at a right angle i.e. at the end of one line segment, the next one begins, but with a 90\u00b0 pivot.", "As the design suggests, I encoded data in the following manner -", "And the beauty of a non-linear data visualization is,", "I needed to convert this dataset into a more defined structure to be able to do something useful with it. Now, my idea was to use python to clean the data and use R to render it into a visual form.", "The output of python program became the input to R program.", "A CSV file, which can be imported into R studio, that contains information about co-ordinates for each line segment and its color.", "I started with one random episode - Office Olympics!(It also happens to be one of my favorites!)", "I began by copying dialogs from the website and pasting it into a .txt file. I imagine python code can be written to scrape necessary data from the website, as well. Data cleanup included getting rid of text that wasn\u2019t dialogs. On this website, the storyline of an episode i.e. actions of each character were included in square brackets and were removed from the overall text.", "The next task was, figuring out the math. As the design suggests, I computed color and coordinates for each line segment, based on the character who had spoken the dialog and its length.", "After executing this block of python code, I had the necessary input. I used the CSV file generated from the python program to draw a line based data visualization using R studio. Even though it was a small and relatively easy piece of code, writing it was a useful learning experience of the ggplot2 library.", "And voila! That\u2019s how it\u2019s done.", "With a few modifications in Illustrator, below are some outputs from this project. I\u2019ve tinkered with colors for different patterns.", "I can assume that this may not be the most brilliant or complex thing you have read. However, I do hope that it is one of the more interesting things you\u2019ve come across today.", "With this post I want to encourage you to,", "Lastly, if you are looking for inspiration related to data visualization, here are some projects to get you started:", "Check out my other project, where I created hand-drawn visualizations to represent data.", "Your home for data science.
