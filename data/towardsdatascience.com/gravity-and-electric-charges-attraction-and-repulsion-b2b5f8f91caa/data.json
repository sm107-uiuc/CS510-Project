One can represent creation and annihilation as sources and sinks. The sources appear in the action multiplied by the quantum field of the theory. They describe how the vacuum is being disturbed.

To allow for calculations one needs the sources to have definite mathematical forms. The simpler possibility is to choose the Js to be Dirac delta functions in three spatial dimensions:", "The sources are time-independent but they overlap. Substituting Eq. 12 into W(J) we get (after some simple steps of algebra):", "Here T is the interval during which the sources interacted and E is the interaction energy between the interacting sources. Note that the energy is negative. This is extremely important since it implies that the sources attract each other as a consequence of their coupling to the field \u03c6. Solving the integral using complex analysis we find", "We see that that the attraction between the sources decays to zero exponentially fast at distance 1/m. This is a fundamental result since it means that the range of a force depends on the mass m of the particle described by the field \u03c6.", "We just found a deep fundamental result: the range of a force depends on the mass of the exchanged particle.", "Notice also that as the masses get closer they lower the energy. Hence dE/dr > 0. This potential energy was proposed in 1934 by the Japanese theoretical physicist and Nobel laureate, Hideki Yukawa to explain the attraction between nucleons in the nucleus that occurs due to their coupling to a field like \u03c6.

The corresponding W(T) is then:", "Note now that the overall sign is negative. This implies that masses attract each other in contrast to like charges we saw in the previous section.", "What we saw in this analysis is indeed fascinating.
