This translates to long term benefits for Lazada: better user experience, better user loyalty and better sales revenue.", "However, one question remains. How do we define \u201cperformance\u201d? In other words, How do we define good and bad retailers?", "Nike sells sports shoes with smaller product volumes but higher margins compared to Target with diverse product offerings. Specialized retailers (Nike) sell fewer product types than generalized retailers (Target).", "If our baseline metrics are sales volume, could we say that Target is \u201cbetter\u201d than Nike? If no, then how do we define these groups of retailers so we can judge their performance to customize their rewards offerings?", "Well, if you are confused as I am, you are right. Because there is no right or wrong answer. It depends on your domain expertise, intuition, and luck to determine the objective definition.", "But there is a technique that you can execute quickly to shape your stories to tell.", "\u201cEverybody is a genius.

Then iterate them throughout different assigned groups until they converge.", "It effectively clusters different customers/observations and features to create natural groupings.", "Since I intend for this guide to be a short introduction for you to implement K Means Clustering, I include a StatQuest video which best explains its methodology.", "Using K Means Clustering, I designed retailer categories such as specialized retailers, niche retailers, supermarket (daily products) and department store (wide product variety) retailers.", "Then I used each category of retailer to evaluate different incentive plans and suggested personalized promotions and rewards for each seller.", "This framework allowed me to promote the best sellers to Lazada users and improved long term sales and user experience by appx 34% from the baseline.", "Since I could not share and publish Lazada data, let\u2019s use the HR Retention dataset to get our hands dirty to profile with K Means Clustering.", "What are the profiles of employees who are quitting the company.

The idea here is to tell a story with the visualization shown by the data which anyone can interpret differently (hence unsupervised learning).", "As a general starting point, I suggest to start simple and use 3 features of your pickings, then expand the n_input_features as necessary. A stretch goal you can aim is to use PCA or feature selection techniques to pinpoint features with maximum information gain to reach your goal.", "Interestingly, Unsatisfied performer and Mediocre profiles quit the most while Underachievers and Satisfied Superstars are loyal to the company.", "Once you are done with profiling, you can share your profiles and solutions such as the following:", "The best thing about using clustering and data profiling is that you have a framework to base your story telling upon. Once you understand these structures, you will be able to form sensible hypotheses and solutions.", "With that, congrats! You just did your first data science profiling with K Means Clustering within 5 minutes or less.", "Disclaimer: There are more methods to improve such as choosing optimum n_clusters and feature selections with PCA or other methods.
