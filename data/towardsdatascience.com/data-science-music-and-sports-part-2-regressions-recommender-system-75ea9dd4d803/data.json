In this series of blog posts we describe the experiment we have performed to assess the impact of music on running. Through the statistical analysis of running exercise records, we develop a personalized song recommender system that could improve your running performance.", "In Part 2 (you are here) we present the machine learning framework: the feature engineering and the validation schema. We describe the use of regressors to assess the impact of music on running performance, and we construct a personalized music recommender system to enhance it.", "In Part 1 we covered the experimental setup, the data collection and processing, and a first assessment of the impact of music on running.", "The data recorded by wearables is a powerful resource for applications within the Health and Sports industries. In this blog series we describe a case study that exploits the data collected during running exercises. We use a Polar sports watch to record physical data, while the Spotify app streams music. Using the relevant APIs, in Part 1 we built the dataset and introduced the experimental setup. We defined a metric to assess running performance (GAP efficiency), discussing multiple aspects of the dataset. We concluded that a multivariate analysis was necessary to establish the impact of music on sports performance. With all the data pieces in place, we proceed now with this analysis.", "We build a machine learning solution that takes as input the data recorded in a running exercise up to a specific point in time. The solution processes that data and predicts the running performance in the immediate next time interval of the exercise. It is based on regression algorithms, which are trained on the collection of previous exercise records following a validation schema tailored for time-series. Through this process, we establish the initial ability of algorithms to predict future running performance with the collected dataset. Next, we add input features related to the music streamed, and we quantify the impact of this addition on the predictive power of the regressions, particularly on the adjusted coefficient of determination. When this addition leads to a significant improvement, it is an indication the music may have a real impact on the running performance variable. We show how to find at each relevant time the song that maximizes the predicted GAP efficiency. The solution becomes a music recommender system to enhance running performance.", "The methods and techniques in this post apply to many problems dealing with time-series, like the ones in sales or demand forecasting for instance. We focus on the data science concepts, rather than on the coding implementations. However, we list throughout the post the relevant libraries and key functions to reproduce the workflow within a Python environment.", "The data of the exercises is recorded by Polar with a sample rate of a second, have a look at Part 1 for the details on data collection. There are several reasons to resample it for our experiment. First, the GAP efficiency is defined as a ratio involving the speed and the heart rate:", "With the heart rate being reactive to changes in effort, those show up in the GAP efficiency only after some time. Second, a sample rate of a second is more sensitive to the limited accuracy of the sports watch sensors. Dealing with anomalous readings of the speed, the heart rate, or the altitude, is easier when these are down weighted on a time interval. Third, we are interested in studying the effect of listening to a song for some time while running. The solution must provide recommendations on that time frame, there is no need to provide a recommendation every second. With these motivations, we resample the exercise data into 90 second intervals.", "With these time windows, the GAP efficiency is no longer only predominantly given by the previous sample effort. The effect of the accumulated fatigue (through the record of speeds, elevation gains or heart rates since the beginning of the exercise), the effort within the same time interval, or the effect of listening to music will all have a bigger impact on the predictive power of the algorithms. The specific size of the resampling may seem arbitrary at first. We experimented with various sizes, concluding that 1.5 minutes is a well balanced choice. It is beyond the 45 second threshold, where GAP efficiency autocorrelations are not significant anymore. And it leaves us with enough recorded data points to train the regressors.", "In the figure above we show some of the resampled distributions for the fartlek exercise we used for illustration in Part 1 of this blog series. For each 1.5 minute time interval, the values are defined as the average of the recorded data over that time.", "With the resampled data, we present the feature engineering process. We follow an approach based on moving time windows of multiple sizes. The size of the windows depend on how close the data is to t. The idea is that the further back we go in the past, the less detailed the data needs to be. In order for the regressors to predict the GAP efficiency at a time t of a running exercise (Regressor Target), we input the following information:", "These add up to 49 input features. This construction may seem a bit arbitrary at first, we actually tested several variations. We added and removed variables, we included more and less lags, increased and decreased the moving window sizes etc. In every data science project, feature engineering is one of the most important parts of modeling. The final choice of features stems from the validation phase itself, since the addition of more features may not necessarily improve performance. We input enough informative features, while we avoid pushing the model to face the curse of dimensionality and all its consequences.", "For the resampling and feature engineering process we use Pandas. Some useful functions for time-series are shift for lagged features, rolling for moving average windows, and expanding for windows of variable sizes.", "After the feature engineering process, we have multiple data points to train from many running exercises. The solution thus involves multiple time-series (one per running exercise), we require a careful schema for the selection and validation of the models. A naive cross-validation process would easily lead to data leakage, as we could end up using data points from the future to train a model that predicts on the past. This may not seem as such a sensitive issue as in other prediction problems, like sales forecasting, trading or supply chain demand. But considering the effects of prolonged endurance-training on the GAP efficiency that we described in Part 1, we do need to be careful here as well.", "For the validation process we use a nested cross-validation schema called anchored forward-chaining. This process (and variations) is referred also as day forward-chaining, or rollin-origin-recalibration evaluation. As in any data science problem, we first separate a few of the most recent running exercises to build the test set. These are only used at the very end, in order to estimate the estimated model performance out-of-sample. The data points from the rest of the running exercises build the training and validation set. We need to preserve the chronological order of these running exercises at all times. These multiple time-series are used to perform the model selection:", "These validation metrics are used to select the optimal choice of model and hyperparameters. To estimate the out-of-sample performance, we proceed with an analogous forward-chaining process, adding the running exercises we separated in the test set, and averaging the metrics at the end.", "We decided to anchor the training window including always everything from the first recorded exercise. This way we maximize the data points we use for training at every step. Alternatively, we could implement a rolling window of a fixed size on each step, ensuring we always train using an equal amount of recent recorded exercises. However, the effects of having more data points surpass the impact of having older data as we move forward, given the slow nature of the endurance-training improvements on the GAP efficiency.", "To assess the impact of adding extra input features, we study the regular and adjusted Coefficient of Determination (r\u00b2). We also study the Mean Absolute Error (MAE), instead of the squared one, given we do not want metrics to be too much driven by outliers.", "As a first benchmark we consider a Naive solution that just predicts at a time t the GAP efficiency observed at t-1. If we are not able to improve on the outcomes of this model, it will be an indication of a lack of predictive power in the experiment. Luckily, this is not the case here.", "As for the pool of machine learning regressors, we consider a family of linear models with combined L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization terms. They combine linear and polynomial features to allow for non-linear relations. As they are not data hungry algorithms, we consider support vector regressions, testing several kernels. We train Random Forest regressors, as these are usually good to set reasonable model benchmarks. We also train gradient boosting regression models based on XGBoost. These are usually prompt to overfitting with scarce datasets as we will see.", "Moving to models of increasing complexity, we study the performance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. For both cases, instead of the feature engineering process described above, we directly input the resampled running variables as recorded up to the prediction time t in the running exercise. The idea for the CNNs is to treat the spectrum of variables as a pseudo image with multiple colors (one per feature). We anticipate these are data hungry models that play a minor role in the experiment for now. We expect to have an in depth exploration once we accumulate more training data.", "For all the models, the limited dataset puts extra pressure on ensuring proper regularization techniques are in place. Note that some regularization processes require feature scaling.", "The linear regressions are from scikit-learn (ElasticNet). From there, we use Pipeline, PolynomialFeatures, Scaler, mean_absolute_error, and r2_score functions, together with RandomForestsRegressors and SVR. For the gradient boosting we rely on xgboost, while the neural networks are implemented using Keras. We use itertools to implement the nested cross-validation schema.", "After validation, the best model performs better than the Naive model, with a validation MAE of 0.14, 47% smaller than the Naive one. Part of the patterns in the running exercise data are thus properly captured by this best model. The overall negative trend of the GAP efficiency during the exercises due to accumulated fatigue, the increase of the GAP efficiency after slow paced phases, the effect of elevation gain, or the weather variables, these all account for part of the GAP efficiency variance in the exercises. As indicated by a best coefficient of determination r\u00b2~0.3, while for the Naive model the coefficient was negative. The best model value is still not too promising though.", "As we explained in Part 1, we have followed a varied running plan including fartleks, base, progression, tempo and hill runs. Compared to a setup where we would have run repeatedly against a fixed track, a varied plan has many benefits, but it has a notorious drawback. The GAP efficiency is influenced by the effort through the heart rate, and the running speed. In a varied plan, the running speed is constantly changing, and almost all of the time at the will of the runner. In the fartlek of the figures above for instance, after a progressive warm up from 11km/h to 13 km/h, the fartlek spans 6 intervals of 4 minutes at a target speed of around 15km/h, each followed by 2 minutes at lower speeds around 10\u201311km/h, and a final recovery phase at 11km/h. Those target speeds are part of the training plan, they change depending on the specific running session. As we are not providing this information to the regression algorithms, these changes on speed, and thus a big part of the changes on the GAP efficiency, are of a random nature for the regression models.", "Therefore, it seems reasonable to provide some extra information to the algorithms. Ideally, we would input the type of running exercise (fartlek, progression, tempo etc), together with the target speed at the different phases. Here, as a proxy for that, we provide as input the actual speed at time t. This way, predicting the GAP efficiency at t becomes related to a prediction of the heart rate at a known speed. The fact that we use the actual speed instead of the planned one may bias the predictions a bit. But as this experiment is about running performance at submaximal efforts, the target and the actual speeds are not that different for 1.5min intervals. With this addition, the predictive power of the models increases, with the best model predicting the GAP efficiency with a validation MAE of 0.11, and a coefficient r\u00b2~0.69.", "Finally, we add the song features as we described in Part 1. These are a list of quantitative descriptors of a song: duration, key, modality, tempo, time signature, loudness, plus some Spotify computed features: energy, instrumentalness, speechiness, liveness, acousticness, valence and danceability. All these features are defined here. In order to predict the GAP efficiency at time interval t, we add the features for the music that is streamed during that same time interval t. As the size of the time window is 1.5 minutes, we expect the potential effects of music to be visible already in that same window. Check what we discussed about dissociation in Part 1.", "Once the music features are added, the best model after the nested cross-validation leads to an apparent increase in the predictive power. The validation MAE decreases to 0.097, and the coefficient of determination increases to r\u00b2~0.71. This coefficient speaks about the strength of the dependence between a response variable (GAP efficiency) and the predictor features. It does so by computing the proportion of variance in the GAP efficiency that is associated with the variance on the input features. Thus, this improvement looks promising, because the increase on the coefficient may indicate an actual impact of music on running performance.", "However, the improvement is still not statistically significant given the current dataset. Even though the adjusted coefficient of determination has also increased, the improvements on both the validation MAE and the r\u00b2 are smaller than the uncertainties when estimating them. It is too soon to discard that the improvements are not just a statistical fluke. It may be the case that when we collect more data we reach a statistically significant result. But even in that case, we will still require further explorations. The coefficient of determination is usually part of causal analysis, but improvements on it do not directly imply causality. The study presented here will be complemented with further domain expertise, a more generalizable experiment, and an in depth causal inference study including an extended sensitivity analysis. For now, we assume the increase of the predictive power is related to the effects of music on running performance, so that we can proceed with the construction of the recommender system.", "The best model after the nested cross-validation is an ensemble of support vector and linear regressions with sizable regularization factors combining both L1 and L2 terms. The linear regressions consume combinations of polynomial features up to cubic order, with the quadratic and cubic combinations severely filtered to a small selection of interaction terms. The filtering process is optimized during the validation process by monitoring the adjusted coefficient of determination. This ensemble beats the performance of more complex algorithms, like the XGBoost trees or neural networks we have constructed. We also considered a model based on gradient boosting linear regressions, but it tended to overfit and obscure model interpretability. The final ensemble is based on averaging instead.", "As for the overall impact of features on the predictions, the largest impact is due to the speed at time t. The predictions are also heavily impacted by a combination of terms that include the heart rate, speed and GAP efficiency at several lags. Features from the most recent lags impact the predictions more, the impact decreases with time. The recent heart rate and speed are negatively related to the prediction, while the recent GAP efficiency is positively related. The accumulated elevation gain also contributes to the prediction, in this case lowering the GAP efficiency for larger values: hills add a lot of fatigue when running. As for the weather features, the stronger the wind, the lower the predicted GAP efficiency. This is expected, given the impact of the wind on fatigue. Interestingly, the higher the atmospheric pressure, the higher the GAP efficiency. This is aligned with findings in the literature, check for mid and long distance running results there.", "For the runner in this study, the largest music feature effects are given by the energy. This is a variable Spotify defines as a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. The larger it is, the higher the predicted GAP efficiency. The interaction terms with the speed are positive, which means this effect increases with speed. This is aligned with the discussion on the p-value plot of Part 1. A better running performance is achieved avoiding both instrumental and/or predominantly spoken tracks, as the larger the instrumentalness and the speechiness are, the smaller is the GAP efficiency. The GAP efficiency tends to be higher for songs with a larger danceability as well, which also has a positive interaction term with the speed. Finally, the lower the key (standard pitch class), the higher the GAP efficiency predicted for this runner. This is a brief overview of the types of conclusions we reach with this approach. As we emphasized in Part 1, these are only applicable to the runner of this experiment (N=1 statistical analysis). An analogous process would be used to personalize for the records of any other person.", "We use the trained model to construct a music recommender system. During a new running exercise, every time a song is about to end, the solution processes all the exercise recorded data up to that point. It makes predictions for the GAP efficiency in the next interval of the running exercise, when hypothetically streaming each of the songs over a selected pool. From these, the system finds and recommends the song that leads to the highest GAP efficiency prediction. Thus, it maximizes the predicted running performance. Once the next song is about to end, the system repeats this process with the updated running exercise record.", "The pool of songs consists of random selections with 100 of the songs the runner listened to during the exercises recorded. We aim to maximize performance, while keeping the recommendations within the tastes of the runner. Notice that the recommendations are tailored to the specific runner, and also to the specific conditions of the running exercise. These are the weather, the recorded speed, heart rate, cadence, elevation gain and GAP efficiency up to t, and also the speed the runner has planned for the next phase of the session.", "In the figure above, you see the predicted GAP efficiency for the fartlek we use for illustration throughout the blog series. The actual recorded GAP efficiency is shown in orange, the prediction of the best model described above including music features is the brown line. In dark green, we depict the predicted GAP efficiency if instead of listening to the music in the actual running exercise record, the runner had listened to the recommender suggested songs. For this particular exercise the improvement on the average GAP efficiency would have been of around 1%. In the figures below we show the three GAP efficiency curves for a progression run in the records, together with the system recommendations for that same run.", "Devising a completely functional solution for the recommender is out of the scope of this initial experiment. This requires a live integration with the Polar device and with the Spotify app, so that the recommended soundtrack is updated with live running conditions. We leave an in depth exploration of such a solution, and its generalization, for the future.", "We have described how to use data from running exercises to build a music recommender system. We have presented the feature engineering process from records of a Polar device and the Spotify app. We have detailed the training and validation schema constructed to select the best regression models. These algorithms predict the future running performance from the data available up to a point in time of an exercise. The addition of music features has led to an increase in the algorithm predictive power. We have exploited this to develop a recommender system. It suggests at each time during a running exercise the song that maximizes running performance.", "As described, the results are still not statistically significant. We will keep collecting data to reassess them with larger datasets. This will allow us to make an in depth construction of a complete solution.", "None of the brands mentioned here have been directly involved in this experiment", "Data Scientist | PhD.
