A famous probability puzzle based on it became famous afterwards, with the following format:", "You are on the game show\u2019s stage, where there are 3 doors. Behind one of them there\u2019s a car, and behind 2 of them there\u2019s a goat. You have to pick one of the doors and your prize will be whatever is behind it (obviously you want the car).", "Once you have picked a door, the host chooses, out of the 2 other doors left, one that has a goat behind it, and opens it, revealing the goat to you. Then, he gives you the choice between sticking to your previously chosen door, or switching. What do you do?", "Here is where this problem has raised a lot of furor: our intuition tells us there is no difference between switching doors or sticking to our choice, both hold a 50% of hiding the car. A closer look reveals, however, that it is indeed beneficial to switch doors \u2014 it will actually double your chances of winning.", "We tend to think that it won\u2019t matter whether we switch or not because we split the game into 2 parts: the first one, where each door has 1 chance in 3 of containing the prize, and the second one, where we have only 2 doors to choose from, so each can only have 1 chance in 2 of containing the prize. How could the host\u2019s decision of opening one door that does not contain the prize change the other doors\u2019 probabilities?", "Our intuition is wrong because it ignores the fact that the host did not just randomly open a door: he chose which door to open, based on his knowledge of where the prize is. If you picked first the door that hides the car (that has 1 chance in 3 of happening), then yes, he could choose any of the two doors at random. If you chose a door that hides the goat instead (2 chances in 3), then he must deliberately open the door that hides a goat, leaving the door to the car untouched.", "Well, a very simple and intuitive way is to build a table like this:", "In that table, we have all the possible combinations of doors x prizes, and the outcomes depending on our decision. As you can see, switching doors gives you 2 chances out of 3 to win the car, while not switching gives you 1 chance out of 3 \u2014 meaning you can actually double your chances of getting the car, just by switching doors!", "If the solution still bothers you, try the same problem, but with 1,000,000 doors instead. There are 999,999 goats and 1 car (ignore the logistic challenge behind this assumption). You pick a door and then the host opens 999,998 doors that contain goats, leaving you to decide between the door you picked and the door the host left closed. When you picked your door, you had 1 chance in 1,000,000 of being right. However, the fact that the host opened all those doors except for one, tells a lot about the door that he did not open, right?", "If you still don\u2019t believe it, I ran a simulation of the problem using the R language, running the game 10,000 times and displaying the winning rates considering both strategies (switching doors vs. not switching doors). As expected, the observed rates match the ones in the table above.", "At the time this puzzle became famous, a woman named Marilyn vos Savant gave the correct answer on a magazine column. The magazine then received letters from thousands of people, including mathematicians, claiming she was wrong. It took a lot of explanation, demonstrations and even computer simulations to convince them that they were wrong.", "This can help us understand that our intuitions on probability can be wrong, even for very simple exercises. Even more important, it shows us that even when we are wrong, our confidence can be so high that it makes us blind to reality (especially if we are a renowned mathematician). Thus, sometimes we should try and check the math behind our assumptions \u2014 even if they seem flawless.", "Your home for data science.
