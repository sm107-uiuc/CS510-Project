Mastering these capabilities will \u2014 dare I say it \u2014 make you an even sexier data scientist. Our team balances beauty and brains, all while pushing the limits, saving people in danger, and doing heroic acts. So let\u2019s get started.", "A virtual environment sets up an isolated workspace for your Python project. Whether you\u2019re working solo or with collaborators, having a virtual environment is helpful for the following reasons:", "The use of a virtual environment allows you (and your teammates) to have different dependencies for different projects. Within the virtual environment, you can test install packages without polluting the system install.", "Deploying the venv module is seriously helpful for avoiding issues down the line, so don\u2019t skip this step when getting started with your project.", "Read more: save space \u2014 and avoid installing the same version of multiple packages in different places \u2014 by setting up a virtual environment that contains the most commonly used packages for scientific computing. Then share that common environment as a .pth file across project-specific environments.", "Write good comments for improved confidence and collaborative abilities. In Python, that means following the PEP8 style guide.", "Here\u2019s an example with a docstring, a special type of comment that is used to explain the purpose of a function:", "Docstrings are particularly useful because your IDE will recognize this string literal as the definition associated with a class. In Jupyter Notebook, you can view a function\u2019s docstring by putting your cursor at the end of the function and simultaneously hitting Shift and Tab.", "You\u2019ve heard the expression \u201cstanding on the shoulders of giants.\u201d Python is an exceedingly well-resourced language. You can speed up your data science discoveries by recognizing you don\u2019t have to go it alone \u2014 you can and should reuse the utility code of the programmers who\u2019ve come before you.", "One great source for utility code is the blog of Chris Albon, creator of the Machine Learning flashcards that decorate the walls of my home office / bedroom. The landing page of his site offers navigation to hundreds of code snippets to accelerate your workflow in Python.", "For instance, Chris shows us how to apply a function (such a pandas\u2019 rolling mean \u2014 .rolling()) to a dataframe, by group:", "This code outputs a dataframe that contains a rolling average of every two rows, restarting for each group in the first part of the .groupby() statement.", "Use the pandas-profiling toolkit to automate much of your exploratory data analysis. EDA is the crucial phase zero of any data science project. It typically involves basic statistical analytics and looking at how features correlate with each other.", "This article walks you through a standard \u2018manual\u2019 data exploration approach and compares it to the automatic report created by the pandas-profiling library:", "In this excellent video about improving your machine learning workflow, Rebecca Bilbro offers the sage advice to check out your target column before doing feature analysis.", "Begin with the end in mind \u2014 this way you set up a solid understanding of the target variable before jumping into your effort to predict or classify it. Taking this approach helps you identify potentially thorny problems (e.g. class imbalance) up front.", "If you\u2019re dealing with a continuous variable, it may be useful to bin your values. Working with 5 bins offers the opportunity to leverage the pareto principle. To create quintiles, simply use panda\u2019s q-cut function:", "Each bin will contain 20% of your dataset. Comparing the top quintile of your target variable against the bottom quintile often yields interesting results. This technique serves as a good starting point to determining what might be anomalous about the top (or bottom) performers within your target variable.", "For further learning, also check out Rebecca\u2019s appearance on Women Who Code DC\u2019s Career Series, interviewed by yours truly:", "Visualizations aren\u2019t just for business intelligence dashboards. Throwing in some helpful charts and graphs will reduce speed to insight as you investigate a new dataset.", "There are many possible approaches to using data viz to advance your analytical capabilities. Some resources to explore:", "Data scientists have somewhat of a reputation for being tinkerers. But as the field is increasingly drawing nearer to software engineering, the demand for concise, highly performant code has increased. The performance of a program should be assessed in terms of time, space, and disk use \u2014 keys to scalable performance.", "Python offers some profiling utilities to showcase where your code is spending time. To support the monitoring of a function\u2019s runtime, Python offers the timeit function.", "Some quick wins when it comes to improving your code while working with pandas:", "Working with time series can be daunting. My bootcamp instructor showed up to class with a haunted look on the day he prepared to lecture on this topic.", "Fortunately, the dtw-python package provides an intuitive way to compare time series. In short, Dynamic Time Warping calculates the distance between two arrays or time series of different length.", "First, DTW stretches and/or compresses series of potentially different lengths to make them resemble each other as much as possible. To borrow an example from speech recognition, employing this technique would help an algorithm recognize that \u201cnow\u201d and \u201cnowwwwwwww\u201d are the same word, whether spoken by a snappily impatient adult or a tempestuous toddler. After the transform, the package computes the distance between individual aligned elements.", "ML Flow enables the tracking of parameters, code versions, metrics, and output files. The MlflowClient function creates and manages experiments, pipeline runs, and model versions. Log artifacts (e.g. datasets), metrics, and hyperparameters with mlflow.log_artifact, .log_metric() and .log_param().", "You can easily view all metadata and results across experiments in a local host browser with the mlflow uicommand.", "Also, check out this complete guide to the data science workflow:", "Using if __name__ == '__main__' provides the flexibility to write code that can be executed from the command line or imported as a package into an interactive environment. This conditional statement controls how the program will execute given the context.", "You should expect that a user running your code as an executable has different goals than a user importing your code as a package. The if __name__ == \u2018__main__' statement provides control flow based on the environment in which your code is being executed.", "Why is this helpful? Well, someone running your code from the command line will have the intention of executing functions right away. This may not be true of someone importing your package as utility code into a Jupyter Notebook.", "In if __name__ == \u2018__main__' you should create a function called main() that contains the code you want to run. Across programming languages, the main function provides an entry point for execution. In Python, we name this function main() only by convention \u2014 unlike lower level languages, Python does not ascribe any special significance to the main function. By using the standard terminology however, we let other programmers know that this function represents the starting point of the code that accomplishes the primary task of the script.", "Rather than including blocks of task-accomplishing code within main(), the main function should call other functions stored within the module. Effective modularization allows the user to reuse aspects of the code as they wish.", "The extent to which you modularize is up to you \u2014 more functions means more flexibility and easier reuse, but may make your package more difficult for a human to read and interpret as they traverse logical breaks between functions.", "As a full-time Python programmer, sometimes I wonder if I\u2019m overly dependent on this tool for scientific computing. Python is a delightful language. It\u2019s straightforward and low maintenance, and its dynamic structure is well suited to the exploratory nature of data science pursuits.", "Still, Python is definitely not the best tool to approach every aspect of the broadly defined machine learning workflow. For example:", "In this panel discussion hosted by The TWIML AI Podcast, experts explore the data science applications of their chosen programming language.", "It\u2019s somewhat bizarre to hear a JavaScript dev talk about the potential to use this typically web-development-centric language for machine learning. But hey, it\u2019s gutsy and creative \u2014 and it has the potential to democratize data science by breaking down the barriers between machine learning and traditional software development.", "For now, JavaScript has a numbers advantage: 68% of developers use JavaScript, compared to 44% who use Python, according to the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey. Only 1% use Julia, but that\u2019s predicted to change rapidly. Could more ML developers means more competition, more insights, even more arXiv papers? All the more reason to sharpen your Python skills.", "In this article, we covered 10 potentially overlooked Python skills for data scientists.
