The reason? He felt that no matter how hard he tries, he will never beat AI Go players like AlphaGo. It is a rather sad decision and development of his historical defeat in competition with Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaGo. It gives the whole thing a more dramatic tone than it should be. However, the defeat of human Go players to AI is neither the end of the world for the Go game nor for the human players. Quite the opposite, I believe this could mean a brand new chapter for the Go game, and an opportunity for us to go back to the original purpose Go game is invented for.", "For those not familiar with what happened, according to Wikipedia:", "AlphaGo versus Lee Sedol, also known as the Google DeepMind Challenge Match, was a five-game Go match between 18-time world champion Lee Sedol and AlphaGo, a computer Go program developed by Google DeepMind, played in Seoul, South Korea between the 9th and 15th of March 2016. AlphaGo won all but the fourth game;[1] all games were won by resignation.[2] The match has been compared with the historic chess match between Deep Blue and Garry Kasparov in 1997. \u2014 Wikipedia", "Barring the seemingly dramatic defeat, Lee Se-Dol actually is the only human player actually defeated AlphaGo, even it was only one match. But this defeat deeply hurt the human Go master\u2019s confidence, in an interview with Yonhap News Agency in Seoul, he said:", "\u201cWith the debut of AI in Go games, I\u2019ve realized that I\u2019m not at the top even if I become the number one through frantic efforts,\u201d said Lee. \u201cEven if I become the number one, there is an entity that cannot be defeated,\u201d", "To commemorate his retirement, he plans to get into a competition with another AI go player HanDol developed by South Korea\u2019s NHN Entertainment Corp that has already defeated 5 of South Korean\u2019s top Go players.", "So what to make of all these? Does this mean Go human players are worthless anymore because AI can already do a much better job? Is Go game not worth playing since a human can never beat a machine? Does this suggest the beginning of the end for human intelligence and the rise for AI to rule them all? The answer is a resounding NO, but to ask why, we need to go back to the original of the Go game.", "Go is a very ancient game. It\u2019s said that Emperor Yao(\u5c27) of ancient China invented the Go game to teach his naughty son. His son DanZhu(\u4e39\u6731) was very combative, yet refused to read any book his parents throw his way. How do you talk sense into this kind of kid? Well, entice him to play games of course! It turns out, DanZhu enjoyed the Go game very much. The competitive nature of the game plays into his combative personality, yet to win consistently, he needs to be more patient, smart and strategic. So he gradually learned all these and his parents were much happier. It\u2019s a rather old and simplified story, but it tells one thing: Go is not created to see who is the best, it is created for educational purposes. I\u2019ve learned to play Go when I was 12 years old and I still remembered our teacher telling us:", "\u201cTo win the game of Go, you need to be good at calculating the current move, but also thinking long term. You need to accumulate small advantages yet never forget about the big picture. You need to be brave enough to fight the good fight when needed, yet never too reckless if you know you can\u2019t win. When you are behind, you need to have the patience to wait for the best opportunity to strike. When you are ahead, it\u2019s even harder to not get complacent and make mistakes. Doing all these, and you can start to compete in Go game\u201d", "The game has so much depth and such a high \u2018skill cap\u2019 that no one can claim he has mastered it. It\u2019s said that\u2019s the game played by people in heaven. Myths aside, Go as a game can definitely shape a person\u2019s character, sharpen his mind and strengthen his will. All of these are way more valuable than winning itself.", "There is an old saying in Chinese that goes \u201ca person\u2019s Go game style echos his personality(\u68cb\u5982\u5176\u4eba)\u201d. It\u2019s easy to hide one\u2019s true nature under well-organized words, but it\u2019s much harder to hide when you\u2019re in a fiercely played game. Go game used to be part of the interview process when ancient Chinese emperors hire his officers. It\u2019s also a way to communicate. Since it\u2019s very popular in ancient China, anyone knows how to read knows how to play Go. Engaging in a healthy competitive Go game is the fastest way to know another person. From your opponent\u2019s playstyle, you\u2019ll quickly know what kind of person he is. Is he conservative and not taking any risks? Is he used to follow some textbook moves or like to think out-of-the-box? After several games, no matter who wins or loses, you\u2019ll know.", "So the million-dollar question is: Does human beaten by AI on Go game change any of the above traits of the game? The answer is obviously no. People can still use Go to cultivate their brain and will. Making friends and finding respect for opponents. It is still a fun game with tons of depth. Winning is not all that important. There is a saying in Go community that goes \u201cA game with a heavy reward can never generate beautiful and brilliant matches(\u4e89\u68cb\u65e0\u540d\u5c40)\u201d. This means if people care too much about winning, their creativity will get surpassed and they will all play safe, resulting in very boring games.", "Yes, humans are now not as good as winning the Go game as AI, but what\u2019s the big deal? There are things humans do better and there are things computers do better. Actually, there are plenty of things computers do better than humans. Calculating numbers, process information, not making mistakes. I seldom see people feel bad and say \u201cOMG, I\u2019m not gonna do math anymore because my computer is better than me!\u201d People just say, \u201cOk, the computer is better than us on computing numbers. Great. Let\u2019s use it to do the dirty work and let\u2019s focus on inventing new and more powerful algorithms\u201d. Right? In fact, this is the exact reason that leads to the inventing of AI and eventually leads to the creation of AlphaGo. Go game is no different. If we stop the mentality of \u2018AI vs Human\u2019 and embrace the idea of \u2018AI works for Human\u2019, then great new possibilities will emerge.", "The Lee Se-dol story might be a bit sad, but there is another story related to AlphaGo that is totally in a different tone. Chinese young Go master who was ranked #1 in China professional competition, Ke Jie, also had a three matches game with AlphaGo, and he lost miserably. All three matches were lost and he stood no chance at all. What his reaction? He was obviously in awe and paid respect to his formidable machine opponent, but at the same time, he is intrigued, very intrigued. He said playing with AlphaGo felt like opening a door to another totally different world. The way AlphaGo played the game is not like anything he encountered before, and he was already a seasoned player and won tons of awards in China and abroad. He then researched thoroughly the three matches he lost, trying to learn from it, and grow out of it. And you know what happened afterward? He had a mind-blowing 12-win streak on his professional competitions, beating every and single human opponent stand on his way.", "Different mentality leads to different results. The similar losing games yet different players and different outcomes make us think. Maybe losing to AI is not such a bad thing. We human is always best at learning from past mistakes and getting better.", "Adapt and grow, learn and create, that\u2019s something human can definitely do better than the computer, and only the sky is the limit.", "Once we switched our mentality, there are plenty of things Go player can do.", "For one, Maybe Mr. Lee Se-dol can join an AI team and try to help develop a new algorithm that can beat AlphaGo. He already planned to play the \u2018HanDol\u2019 AI, and maybe in the future, he can start an \u2018AI Go Game League\u2019 and get his revenge by beating AlphaGo with a new AI player he helped develop named \u2018Se-dol Go\u2019.", "Or maybe Mr. Ke Jie can leverage what he learned from AlphaGo and help develop an AI-based Go training system to improve human player's game. Use AI as a test tool to explore and verify.", "Maybe the AI community and Go community should work together to develop different styled AI Go players and have them play in a league, we might be able to see a lot of beautiful games and advance Go game theory.", "When AI and Humans work together, only the sky is the limit.", "Found this article useful?
