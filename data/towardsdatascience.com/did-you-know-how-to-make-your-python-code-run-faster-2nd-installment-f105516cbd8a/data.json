In this tutorial, we will again aim to improve our code run time but, by using some programming best practices like:", "I am sure everyone reading this post would remember their days of primary education. Our mathematics teacher always impressed upon memorizing multiplication tables from 2 to 20. Ever wondered why? Simple, these tables form the foundation for mathematical calculations, and storing them in your memory can help you calculate faster.", "The old concept of memorizing difficult concepts is built into modern world programming concepts by the name memoization.", "Quoting Wikipedia, memoization is defined as the optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same input occurs again.", "To demonstrate this concept in Python, let\u2019s first define an expensive function. To emulate an expensive function, which is computationally time-consuming, we will call sleep function from the time package and artificially increase the run time of the function.", "Python code to create the function is written below. This function uses a numerical argument as the input, sleeps for 5 seconds, and then returns the square of the numerical value as output.", "With the approach used above, every time we make a function call, the function will first sleep for 5 seconds and then return the actual result. Let\u2019s time profile this function by making 3 consecutive calls.", "Given, we have called the function 3 times, the total execution time recorded is 15 seconds.", "Every time we think of implementing iterative operation in our code, the first programming construct which comes to our mind is the loop. Loops do a reasonable job when working with smaller data sets but the performance degrades as the size of the data set increases. A small change in the programming mindset can help us overcome this challenge.", "Consider a scenario where we are required to perform some operation on one column of a Pandas Data frame containing 1 million rows. If approached traditionally, one will loop through 1 million records one after the other.", "Vectorization, on the other hand, would suggest performing this operation just once on the complete column (not record by record). This way, you are escaping performing the same operation 1 million times. Following examples demonstrate how can we eliminate loops from some common programming scenarios:", "Let\u2019s consider a simple scenario where we have a Pandas data frame containing base and perpendicular lengths of 100k right-angled triangles and the task is to calculate their hypotenuse. The formula for this calculation is as follows:", "Let\u2019s capture the run time when performing this operation using the pandas apply method (iterative application of a function on a series object):", "Using apply (one of the most efficient forms of pandas looping) to loop through 100k rows has taken us approx 3.43 seconds. Let\u2019s see how vectorization can help us in improving the performance of this code.", "Another common scenario where vectorization can come in handy is, when the loops are to be executed conditionally. To demonstrate this, we have created some dummy data that has information on hourly electricity consumption in our house for the year 2019 (365*24 records). We want to calculate the cost of electricity for each hour given the charges are different for different hours in the day. The charges table is as follows:", "Evaluating the performance when writing simple loop:", "Using pandas\u2019 most efficient looping approach (apply method) we could achieve our objective in 417 milliseconds. Let\u2019s evaluate the performance when performing the same operation using vectorization:", "In the last 2 tutorials, we have tried equipping you with the approaches to write efficient codes. Try these approaches and let us know if they were helpful.", "Will try and bring more interesting topics in future tutorials. Till then:", "Your home for data science.
