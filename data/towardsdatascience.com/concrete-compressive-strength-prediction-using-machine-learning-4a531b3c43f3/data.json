This is generally determined by a standard crushing test on a concrete cylinder. This requires engineers to build small concrete cylinders with different combinations of raw materials and test these cylinders for strength variations with a change in each raw material. The recommended wait time for testing the cylinder is 28 days to ensure correct results. This consumes a lot of time and requires a lot of labour to prepare different prototypes and test them. Also, this method is prone to human error and one small mistake can cause the wait time to drastically increase.", "One way of reducing the wait time and reducing the number of combinations to try is to make use of digital simulations, where we can provide information to the computer about what we know and the computer tries different combinations to predict the compressive strength. This way we can reduce the number of combinations we can try physically and reduce the amount of time for experimentation. But, to design such software we have to know the relations between all the raw materials and how one material affects the strength. It is possible to derive mathematical equations and run simulations based on these equations, but we cannot expect the relations to be same in real-world. Also, these tests have been performed for many numbers of times now and we have enough real-world data that can be used for predictive modelling.", "In this article, we are going to analyse Concrete Compressive Strength dataset and build Machine Learning models to predict the compressive strength. This notebook containing all the code can be used in parallel.", "The dataset consists of 1030 instances with 9 attributes and has no missing values. There are 8 input variables and 1 output variable. Seven input variables represent the amount of raw material (measured in kg/m\u00b3) and one represents Age (in Days). The target variable is Concrete Compressive Strength measured in (MPa \u2014 Mega Pascal). We shall explore the data to see how input features are affecting compressive strength.", "The first step in a Data Science project is to understand the data and gain insights from the data before doing any modelling. This includes checking for any missing values, plotting the features with respect to the target variable, observing the distributions of all the features and so on. Let us import the data and start analysing.", "Let us check the correlations between the input features, this will give an idea about how each variable is affecting all other variables. This can be done by calculating Pearson correlations between the features as shown in the code below.", "We can observe a high positive correlation between compressive Strength (CC_Strength) and Cement. this is true because strength concrete indeed increases with an increase in the amount of cement used in preparing it. Also, Age and Super Plasticizer are the other two factors influencing Compressive strength.", "There are other strong correlations between the features,", "These correlations are useful to understand the data in detail, as they give an idea about how a variable is affecting the other. We can further use a pairplot in seaborn to plot pairwise relations between all the features and distributions of features along the diagonal.", "The pair plot gives a visual representation of correlations between all the features.", "We can plot scatter plots between CC_Strength and other features to see more complex relations.", "The observations we can make from this plot,", "CC Strength vs (Fine aggregate, Super Plasticizer, Fly Ash)", "We can visually understand 2D, 3D and max up to 4D plots (features represented by colour and size) as shown above, we can further use row-wise and column-wise plotting features by seaborn to do further analysis, but still, we lack the ability to track all these correlations by ourselves. For this reason, we can turn to Machine Learning to capture these relations and give better insights into the problem.", "Before we fit machine learning models on the data, we need to split the data into train, test splits. The features can be rescaled to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1 i.e. all the features fall into the same range.", "After preparing the data, we can fit different models on the training data and compare their performance to choose the algorithm with good performance. As this is a regression problem, we can use RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) and $R\u00b2$ score as evaluation metrics.", "We will start with Linear Regression since this is the go-to algorithm for any regression problem. The algorithm tries to form a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable i.e. it fits a straight line given by,", "Where w_i corresponds to the coefficient of feature x_i.", "The magnitude of these coefficients can be further controlled by using regularization terms to the cost functions. Adding the sum of the magnitudes of the coefficients will result in the coefficients being close to zero, this variation of linear regression is called Lasso Regression. Adding the sum of squares of the coefficients to the cost function will make the coefficients be in the same range and this variation is called Ridge Regression. Both these variations help in reducing the model complexity and therefore reducing the chances of overfitting on the data.", "There is not much difference between the performance with these three algorithms, we can plot the coefficients assigned by the three algorithms for the features with the following code.", "As seen in the figure, Lasso regression pushes the coefficients towards zero and the coefficients with the normal Linear Regression and Ridge Regression are almost the same.", "We can further see how the predictions are by plotting the true values and predicted values,", "If the predicted values and the target values are equal, then the points on the scatter plot will lie on the straight line. As we can see here, none of the model predicts the Compressive Strength correctly.", "A Decision Tree Algorithm represents the data with a tree-like structure, where each node represents a decision taken on a feature. This algorithm would give better performance in this case, since we have a lot of zeros in some of the input features as seen from their distributions in the pair plot above. This would help the decision trees build trees based on some conditions on features which can further improve performance.", "The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) has come down from 10.29 to 7.31, so the Decision Tree Regressor has improved the performance by a significant amount. This can be observed in the plot as well as more points are closer to the line.", "Using a Decision Tree Regressor has improved our performance, we can further improve the performance by ensembling more trees. Random Forest Regressor trains randomly initialized trees with random subsets of data sampled from the training data, this will make our model more robust.", "The RMSE has further reduced by ensembling multiple trees. We can plot the feature importance\u2019s for tree-based models. The feature importance\u2019s show how important a feature is for a model when making a prediction.", "Cement and Age are treated as the most important features by tree-based models. Fly ash, Coarse and Fine aggregates are the least important factors when predicting the Strength of Concrete.", "Finally, let us compare the results of all the algorithms.", "We have analysed the Compressive Strength Data and used Machine Learning to Predict the Compressive Strength of Concrete. We have used Linear Regression and its variations, Decision Trees and Random Forests to make predictions and compared their performance. Random Forest Regressor has the lowest RMSE and is a good choice for this problem. Also, we can further improve the performance of the algorithm by tuning the hyperparameters by performing a grid search or random search.", "Originally published at https://pranaymodukuru.github.io on March 5, 2020.", "Your home for data science.
