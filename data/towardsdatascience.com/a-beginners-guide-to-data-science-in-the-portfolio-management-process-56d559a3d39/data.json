How does a portfolio manager/advisor go about determining the appropriate mix of stocks, bonds, cash, gold, bitcoin, or whatever? How does this manger ensure that what she is doing outperforms or \u2014 more importantly \u2014 is a more appropriate fit for her client than the results achieved by a monkey throwing darts at a dartboard?", "These are questions that Data Science can help answer!", "At the onset of the Portfolio Management Process, portfolio managers need to understand their clients\u2019 objectives and constraints in order to construct an appropriate asset allocation. Reviewing a client\u2019s objectives and constraints includes understanding her risk/return appetite, liquidity needs, investment time horizon, tax profile (asset location can be a powerful tool!), unique circumstances, and any current legal issues. With a solid understanding of these objectives and constraints, portfolio construction can begin.", "An analysis of how categorical inputs like liquidity needs (none, current, future, etc.), time horizon (short-term, long-term, etc.), or taxes (pays taxes or does not pay taxes) blend together in the decision making process is beyond the scope of this blog. Rather, my goal in writing this blog is to explore the critical statical computations, such as mean, covariance, correlation, and standard deviation, that go hand-in-hand with proper portfolio construction/optimization.", "Consider two stocks: A and B. Managed portfolio Z is constructed by purchasing $60,000 worth of A and $40,000 worth of B. How can we use what we know about A and B to make predictions on the future performance of Z? Well ignoring risk for a second, this is quite simple.", "Let\u2019s define the expected return of A and B (denoted E(A) and E(B), respectively) as A and B\u2019s population means. In other words, E(A) equals the average return of A since A\u2019s initial public offering.", "How can we use this information to predict our managed portfolio\u2019s expected return knowing the weighting of our portfolio is 60% A and 40% B? The formula is:", "E(Z) = WA*E(A) + WB*E(B); where WX is asset X\u2019s percent weight in the portfolio.", "For illustrative purposes, we will assume E(A) = 15% and E(B) = 17.5%, giving us an expected return for our managed portfolio of 16%.", "Now let\u2019s focus on risk; we will use standard deviation as a proxy for the portfolio\u2019s risk. To understand standard deviation, we first need to understand what a correlation coefficient is. The correlation coefficient is a measure of the strength of a linear relationship between two data sets (in our example A and B\u2019s performance), and it ranges from -1 to 1 inclusive. A correlation coefficient of 1 means that a perfectly positive linear relationship exists (as A increases, B will also increase), and a coefficient of -1 means that a perfectly inverse linear relationship exists (as A increase, B will decrease). A correlation value somewhere in the middle, indicts the strength (or lack there of) of the linear relationship with the sign indicating the direction.", "So, how is the correlation coefficient calculated? If we denote the correlation coefficient as p, then p is calculated as:", "It is worth quickly mentioning that cov(x,y) is short hand for the covariance between random variables x and y. Covariance, depending on sign, shows the tendency in the linear relationship between x and y (i.e., the variables show similar behavior). By dividing by (std_x*std_y), we standardize the covariance in an effort to make it comparable (i.e., we care more about the strength of the linear relationship rather than the tendency of the relationship).", "Once we have our p, solving for our portfolio\u2019s standard deviation (by taking the square root of its variance) is quite simple. We will denote our portfolio\u2019s standard deviation as rZ, so the portfolio\u2019s variance is:", "For illustrative purposes, we will assume the standard deviation of A is 20%, the standard deviation of B is 10%, and the correlation of A and B is 0.85. Using our formula for rZ above, we calculate an expected standard deviation for our managed portfolio of 15.5%.", "Buy a computer. Its hard to do by hand. That being said, we should understand what a computer program is doing under the hood.", "Below is the methodology behind generating portfolios on the efficient frontier, which Investopedia defines as:", "\u2026the set of optimal portfolios of risky assets that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk or the lowest risk for a given level of expected return.", "2. avg_stock_price = 1 X n matrix of average prices for each stock.", "3. stocks_demeaned = m X n matrix of the individual stock prices minus the average price for that stock. This gives us a measure of how far each data point is from its mean.", "4. covariance_matrix = m X n matrix that is the product of the stocks_demeaned matrix multiplied by its transpose. We only care about the diagonal line (from top left to bottom right) of the resulting matrix.", "Note: the diagonal line from top left to bottom right of the covariance matrix is representative of the variance of the individual stocks, as illustrated below.", "5. asset_weights = n X 1 matrix of the allocation weights for each risky asset", "With the inputs we defined above, we can calculate expected portfolio return and expected portfolio variance doing some matrix multiplication using the following formulas (z = portfolio):", "r\u00b2z = Wt * (Covariance Matrix) * W; where Wt = the transpose of W", "Now that we have calculated the expected return and expected standard deviation of our portfolio, we can generate tens of thousands portfolios by changing the individual weights in matrix W, and plotting these portfolios on a scatter plot, like the one below:", "Using the above scatter plot, a portfolio manager can easily obtain the portfolio weightings that best aligns with her client\u2019s risk/return objectives. Finally, it should be noted that an active manager seeking the best risk-adjusted returns should focus on the portfolio that is highlighted above by the red star (the one with the highest Sharpe ratio).", "Portfolio construction/optimization can seem daunting at first. However, with a solid understanding of the mathematics, one can comfortably understand what makes for an appropriate allocation.", "Note from Towards Data Science\u2019s editors: While we allow independent authors to publish articles in accordance with our rules and guidelines, we do not endorse each author\u2019s contribution.
