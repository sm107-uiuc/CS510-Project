Since then, malware attacks have been rising at an alarming rate with nearly twelve million reported cases of malware in the first quarter of 2019 alone. Back in 2017, the \u201c WannaCry\u201d attack pulled a lot of gazing attention to this issue when nearly two-hundred-thousand people were affected by a single worm. These infections included, but were not limited to:", "Unfortunately, with technological evolution comes malware evolution, and practical solutions to technological problems can very quickly become stepping-stones in the creation of software with malicious intent. Cyber Security is an enormous topic that frankly I\u2019m not too engaged with, but obviously; security is extremely important when all of our personal information, including credit cards, bank statements, and addresses are all in databases online.", "While we all know that cyber-attacks are dangerous, and maybe we should refrain from going to any website where such a thing is out of our control, there is a high potential for a new kind of worm to hit the internet in the coming years. In recent years, machine-learning has been advancing our technological growth at a fantastic race. But with any new technology, whether it be guns, knives, bows, spears, fire, or even machine-learning, comes malcontent.", "A data-based worm has terrifyingly high potential, because unlike any other worm; it has the potential to improve itself. Typically, transmission and effects are something that is orchestrated by the software\u2019s creator them-self in the making of the worm. However, machine-learning-based malware has the potential to entirely blow this approach out of the water. A virus that adapts to data it collects is a scary concept, but in all honesty is entirely possible.", "In the words of Matthew Griffin from Fanatical Futurist,", "\u201c Artificial Intelligence is a cyber security game changer, for better and worse, and we need to be better prepared for what\u2019s coming.\u201d", "In fact, in recent exploits machine-learning models have in fact been used repeatedly by intruders in attempts to steal passwords, and user input. If we want to continue living securely without worms attacking our data consistently, cyber-security itself will likely have to change. This isn\u2019t necessarily so much a topic of data ethics anymore, as ethics are rarely in play when malware is created. In typical, legal Data-Science, we have something called Data anonymization, which is a code of conduct for protecting the data of your participants and preserving their anonymity. A breach of this concept is a breach into traditional data ethics, an ethical ideology that explains how and when to collect data.", "Typically, malicious software can be divided into different categories, some with entirely different goals.", "Data snooping is the collection and logging of sensitive information that is typically encrypted. A snooper attack can often be the beginning of much more, and can jeopardize not only your name, and address, but also your bank account and legal information. Additionally, data snooping is often a precursor to a much more in-depth and typical attack.", "Infiltration is regarded as a very negative situation, as the malicious software is now inside of your computer executing tasks with administrative privileges that you didn\u2019t allow. Usually when an infection has entered the infiltration stage, unless directed otherwise by the creator, the computer will become completely a slave to the virus.", "Ad-ware is a little more light-hearted, yet is still a serious issue. Ad-ware is not necessarily software with malicious intent, but can often clutter up and slow down a system after installing itself without your permission. This is often done through sketchy installers with confusing installation menus that \u201c add-on\u201d the ad-ware when the user accidentally accepts to install it. Ad-ware is of course a market with financial gain for those participating, allowing the companies that make money off the ad-ware to then share that profit with them.", "Ransom-ware is usually something that can be observed after an infiltration. The narrative of ransom-ware is typically that of a ransom plea for encrypted data. This is especially damaging in computerized markets containing sensitive information about employees and customers. Wanna Cry (as discussed above) is a great example of ransom-ware.", "With the clever disguise of machine-learning, anything can be possible: Fake companies, Fake promises, and yes, Fake Identities. Given that machine-learning is well-known for its image recognition, and video manipulation, It has some serious damage potential with the reigns in the right hand.", "In recent news, over and over it has been explained that artificial intelligence has beat out humanity at hacking, and is beyond able to counter most cyber-security efforts with its natural adaptation. So what can be done about an artificial brain that has a subjective goal to infect as many systems as possible? Of course we\u2019ve heard the age old tale of \u201c Don\u2019t go here, don\u2019t go there,\u201d but if those really worked \u2014 why are we still worrying about this threat?", "It\u2019s a scary, sad reality about technology, some of it will always be used to a negative reception. What\u2019s more interesting is the future of cyber-security itself. As of now, there are many people who do cyber-security research for a living. Machine-Learning is already used to prevent adware and spam, so it would be interesting to see what kind of security features will be powered by ML in the future.", "Ethically, the proposals that would be made in an application with malicious intent would be morally juxtaposed with what most machine-learning enthusiasts stand for\u2026 But it is no secret that machine-learning technology is becoming more accessible by the day. With the accessibility and global traction machine-learning is getting, its hard to believe that it won\u2019t be used in any negative way. After all, that is precisely how most negative things come to be in the first place.", "Your home for data science.
