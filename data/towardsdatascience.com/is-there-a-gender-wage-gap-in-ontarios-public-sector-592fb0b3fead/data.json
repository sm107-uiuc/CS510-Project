This analysis is aimed to investigate whether there is a gender wage gap for high paid Ontario Public Sector Employees (Employees who are on the Sunshine list).", "A sunshine list is a list consisting of public sector employees (e.g. government, health care, teachers) making $100,000 salary or higher per year. The Province of Ontario, Canada discloses the names, positions, salaries, and total taxable benefits every year on this website.", "The sunshine list data is published annually on the government website since 1996 to make the public sector more transparent and accountable.", "The data downloaded from the government website are not in a consistent format and also does not include gender information. One popular approach to get gender information is to derive it from First Name. Although there are multiple types of genders, here only uses female and male for simplicity.", "By browsing the data, a few data cleaning steps are required to meet the objective which includes:", "There are multiple machine learning models to help with Gender Prediction. For instance, Naive Bayes, Neural Network. For simplicity, I use US names 1930\u20132015 database and NameSor (a gender API) to derive the genders.", "Example of NameSor API codes (slightly changed from original codes published by the developer to make it more feasible):", "Unfortunately, not all the employee's information is recorded accurately on the sunshine list. For example, some employees don\u2019t have the first name, or some employees only have 1 character as a first name. Those employees\u2019 genders cannot be identified with such limited information. The good news is that the population is really small, under 0.5%.", "The number of employees on the Sunshine List increases tremendously over the last 24 years from ~4,500 to ~150,000.", "Great effort is observed in the Public Sector to reduce the gender wage gap. The women representation % on the Sunshine list almost doubled from 24% in 1996 to 45 % in 2019.", "Unfortunately, the sector groupings in the data are not consistent over the years. Some adjustments applied for the data cleaning, such as replacing \u2018&\u2019 with \u2018and\u2019, changing uppercase to lower case, etc. I\u2019ve also grouped a few sectors, for instance, the government of Ontario to make the data more clear. Here, only top sectors are selected for comparison (Hydro One is not included as it has been partially privatized since 2015).", "Data suggests women representation % increases sharply for Health care and School boards with more women on the list than men in recent years. These two sectors are also traditional women's dominant careers for nurses and teachers.", "However, in the provincial and municipal governments, men are still dominant with almost no changes in the past few years. Clearly, some efforts need to focus on having more women\u2019s voices on the table to ensure diversity in the government. A diverse cultural government can better understand the issues from all perspectives and make more effective policies that align with the promised vision and mission to form a better society.", "Coming down to the objective of this analysis \u2014 is there a wage gap in Ontario Public Sector?
