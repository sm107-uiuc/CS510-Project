There\u2019s been tons of hype around machine learning, and large numbers of individuals are flocking to academic institutions to gain degrees within ML \u2014 myself included. The importance of making the right decision as to what level of advanced qualification you want to pursue cannot be exaggerated enough.", "To help make decisions a bit easier and provide some clarity, I will make a case for pursuing a PhD in machine learning and conclude with my personal opinion.", "To give structure to this article, I\u2019ll discuss the benefits of undertaking a PhD using the three criteria listed below as guiding beacons.", "Disclaimer: My highest qualification is currently an MSc in Computer Vision and Machine Learning. Do be aware I\u2019ll attempt to approach this article/research from an unbiased point of view. Feel free to point out in the comments if you feel I have slipped in my unbiased analysis.", "If academia were compared to sports, then a PhD could be similar to the Olympics, as they both produce elites within their respective domain. Athletes have four year training periods between each Olympic game; comparably for PhD students, the ordeal usually lasts four years in the United Kingdom, and up to six years in the United States.", "A PhD in machine learning entails the exploration and advancement of a specific subject matter within the many subfields of machine learning. Within the AI industry \u2014 also other industries \u2014 a PhD is seen as a prestigious achievement.", "Let\u2019s use our guiding beacons to analyze further a case for taking a PhD in machine learning.", "Machine Learning practitioners with PhD degrees have the potential to command higher salary figures in comparison to their MSc counterparts.", "For the role of a Machine Learning Researcher/Scientist, 90% of the ML Researcher roles within the United Kingdom require at least a PhD from applicants; some roles required applicants that had published papers in top conferences such as NAACL, or NeurIPS.", "Having a PhD certainly opens more doors to more positions. The average salary I found for the advertised roles is \u00a380,000 ($99,607). It does make sense that to be an ML Researcher, you would essentially hold a qualification that proves your ability to conduct research.", "How about applying for Machine Learning Engineering roles?", "ML Engineering roles do not entirely require an advanced qualification such as a PhD degree. That been said, when an ML Engineer has a PhD degree, coupled with a few years of work experience in machine learning, then the applicant is definitely in a position to be highly considered.", "After looking through several roles, it\u2019s safe to say that an applicant with a PhD and some work experience could apply for a large number of advertised machine learning roles.", "Over the past decade, the demand for ML practitioners has increased drastically, the number of job postings for ML Engineers grew over 300% between 2015\u20132018 and it doesn\u2019t seem to be slowing down anytime soon. The increase in demands means that companies and organizations (even governments) are seeking highly skilled individuals. And luckily holding a PhD degree could place you in a subgroup of individuals that are deemed as high qualified individuals or specialists within a specific ML topic.", "Top companies with AI sectors, such as DeepMind, OpenAI, Google, and Facebook have a high demand for machine learning researchers. These companies are essentially pioneers within the AI industry. For example, Deepmind(the company responsible for AlphaGo), have a few roles for Research scientists and the minimum required qualification is a PhD.", "To close off on the earning section, I will mention one last thing on the earning potential of a PhD holder. Most of the advertised job roles salary have a range, for example, an advertised role for an ML Engineer could have a salary range of \u00a370,000 to \u00a390,000. Consideration of an application for the upper end of the scale is decided by factors such as experience, culture fit, job requirement fit and lastly, qualification. It is no secret that individuals with PgD have a high chance of earning 50% more than their MSc counterparts; this is true across several industries and not just Artificial Intelligence.", "The opportunity to undertake a PhD also presents the possibility of creating both technological and societal impact. A PhD in machine learning places you at the forefront of academic research for the advancement of specific fields that have the potential to project humanity a bit further into a desirable future for all.", "The research results from PhD holders, presented during or after their PhD have impacted industries around the globe. Advancement in Object detection has resulted in better visual systems in autonomous vehicles. Progress in natural language processing has supported efficient and accurate language to language translations (just think Google Translate).", "How about we mention some names?", "I\u2019m sure you would have heard of the name Ian Goodfellow, and if you haven\u2019t, he\u2019s one of the individuals responsible for Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). Ian is currently the Director of Machine Learning at Apple. He\u2019s a PhD holder and has worked in the likes of Google and OpenAI.", "Another familiar name is Andrej Karpathy, he\u2019s currently the Director of AI at Tesla and has previously interned at DeepMind and Google. I\u2019ve read a few of his blog articles and here\u2019s is an article that might be relevant for those about to undertake a PhD.", "Joseph Chet Redmon, the creator of YOLO, also undertook a PhD at the University of Washington.", "There is no doubt that the work undertaken by PhD holders can revolutionize an entire industry and the direction that AI as a field takes. There are tons of names that I haven\u2019t mentioned, but I also don\u2019t want to make this article tens of thousands of words long.", "My point is, plenty of individuals have the possibility of making technological, academical, and societal impact based on either the work they completed during their research years or the skills they acquired from their research studies.", "There\u2019s a wealth of knowledge to be gain from taking a PhD in machine learning. Theoretical knowledge is amassed over the PhD period as researchers must understand the underlying intuition, concepts, and logic within developed techniques and proposed algorithms.", "An in-depth theoretical knowledge requires the time and dedication that only a PhD based form of education or research can allow.", "Researchers that write papers have to refer and evaluate tens of other research papers to produce the result of their current paper. Just the amount of knowledge gained from writing a research paper is enough to make someone an expert within the respective field.", "An additional form of knowledge to be gained from undertaking a PhD are notably programming, mathematical and technical. Machine learning is a highly specialized field, the high technical requirement the field demands means the researchers are usually more than equipped in high-level topics in mathematics of well versed in a suite of programming language to assist with the implementation of neural networks.", "During my research, I stumbled across a list of papers and dissertations written by researchers from top universities from the UK and the US. Have a brief scan of the topics and feel free to delve into this wealth of knowledge.", "I\u2019ve mentioned a lot of benefits to undertaking a PhD in machine learning in this article, and I\u2019ve most likely missed some key advantages.", "That been said, it wouldn\u2019t be fair to at least briefly highlight some disadvantages to taking a PhD.", "I won\u2019t elaborate too much on the disadvantages, but I\u2019ll provide enough information for curious individuals to take on personal research in the mentioned disadvantages.", "Let me conclude this article by giving my personal opinion on undertaking a PhD in machine learning.", "Leaping to pursue an advanced qualification is a personal decision where several things will have to be considered, such as family, funding, time and commitments. Not a lot of individuals are presented with the opportunity to stay or go back to an extensive academic career.", "Undertaking a PhD takes a specific personality and mindset; individuals that already take on personal research and go beyond the means of regular knowledge within topics in machine learning are probably more suited for a PhD.", "In comparison, some individuals are not concerned with the inner workings and theoretical reasoning behind the neural network architectures or object detection algorithm, but they are concerned with the direct usability and practicality of the techniques. This type of individuals might not be suited for the academic life and responsibilities that come with a PhD.", "I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be pursuing a PhD any time soon. Although this could change in the next 15\u201320 years.", "This brings me to another point, learning doesn\u2019t need to stop.", "I hope you\u2019ve gained some useful insight from this rather lengthy article. For those that have crucial decisions to make in the next coming months or years, I would advise conducting in-depth research as to what life as a PhD student might look like for you.", "To connect with me or find more content similar to this article, do the following:", "Your home for data science.
