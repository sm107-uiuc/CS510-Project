You decide to dive in this Deep Learning thing, people are talking about. Great, you switch on your PC to check some state of the art literature before going deep into the endless Github forest to hack around in remote repositories. During your preparations, what might happen is that you stumble across a promising piece of work that tells you that they have used a Triple ResNeXt-101 Cascade Mask R-CNN or something similar\u2026Ahaah\u2026", "Your journey might end here, and you return to your cozy cottage, without chests full of shiny algorithms and knowledge you could have shared in your local tavern.", "This series is all about providing a guide through the terminology and history you have to know during your adventure. The deep learning literature, scientific publications as well as blogs and discussions about it, is full of abbreviations and fancy names for concepts and models. Start reading it feels like trying to catch a waterfall with a common bucket. In this series you will find a reading guide that navigates you through scientific and none scientific milestone literature and additional explanation about deep learning and convolutional neural networks (CNNs).", "A couple of years ago, I was in the situation to jump into my deep learning adventure. Despite a background in data analysis, it was a little bit of a challenge to get used to the terminology and concepts applied in deep learning. Starting to read deep learning literature felt to me like starting to read Game of Thrones novels: A shear endless flood of names and relations; highly ramified family trees, which merge and branch off here and there with nearly the same names\u2026still, pretty exciting reads.", "I started to literally draw those family trees of deep learning architectures and finally there it was, an overview from 2012 until late 2019 of the evolution of CNNs in image recognition, image segmentation and object detection. I decided to write it down and it eventually became this open access review paper [1]:", "Everybody who is interested in a scientific but intuitive review and straight forward reading guide to deep learning with CNNs for image processing with a focus on scientific literature, is highly welcome to read it. Despite it is written for a Remote Sensing journal, it tells the evolution from a computer vision point of view and is therefore applicable to every field which uses CNNs for image processing, not just remote sensing.", "\u201cOkay then, why this Medium article when this guide already exists?\u201d Legit question, to further stress the Game of Thrones analogy, think about it like this: The main books tell the story with all facts and progress to which ever end; same as the scientific literature on deep learning, published at conferences, in peer reviewed journals and arXiv. You can follow the whole story just by reading the main literature. But there is more, side stories which support the main plot, fan fiction and discussions about single characters, whole stories about the origin of the world we are interested in, or simply the lore. For me, I see places like Medium, Youtube or Stackexchange boards as the sources where you can find the lore about deep learning literature, which make the main story much more intuitive. Therefore, this reading guide has some more sources beside the scientific literature, which I found very helpful to reflect about what is discussed in scientifically published papers.", "The following tables are structured in a way, that you can decide how deep you want to dig into the topic. The first couple of sources in each table are introductions, overviews or reviews. The rest are sorted in a way, that you will need the information of the previous sources progressively. So, I recommend to go to the Github repository of this series, get the tables and start reading and make notes on your own. Take all the time you need to get through, but every time you get lost in the deep dungeon of information, return to the guide and figure out where to go next or return to a point you feel comfortable and start off again.", "I hope you will enjoy the adventure as much as I did and live through those epic moments when insights start to gear into each other!", "In 2012, Alex Krizhevsky et al. [2] won the ILSVRC by introducing the CNN AlexNet. Together with the publication of Ciresan et al. (2012) [3], the year 2012 can be seen as a starting point for modern developments in deep learning and CNN research. Both publications are about the task to predict a single label for an image, so called image recognition or image classification. Successors in this task are focusing on optimizing the important feature extractor of a CNN, the so called convolutional backbone. Since convolutional backbones are also used in e.g. image segmentation and object detection the developments in image recognition became a driver for for the whole field. Understanding the evolution of CNNs for image recognition is therefore essential for further readings.", "The picture above shows milestone architectures grouped into 5 families which help to organize the reading", "The Vintage Architectures are known for their idea of stacked operations which extract features from input data while going deeper into the network. They established this structure which is often compared to the visual cortex of mammals.", "The Inception family originates from the earlier work of Le Cun et al. 1989 [4] (the so called LeNet) and its networks are also referred to as GoogLeNet. They are known for:", "The ResNet family is all about residual connections. This new way of how to design a convolutional block with a connection that goes around the convolutional operations, enabled networks to get considerably deeper but still be trainable. Architectures from the ResNet family are today a very popular choice as feature extractors.", "The last group is about the NAS and MobileNet family since they both have the goal to be parameter efficient and they evolved together to finally become the EfficientNet models, the sota architectures in 2019.", "With this literature at hand, you are well prepared for the first challenges of your deep learning adventure. I highly encourage you to do side quests, like visiting an online course or getting your hands dirty by exploring TensorFlow or Pytorch and return to your reading guide if you are ready for the next step. See you in the next part of this series in which the chapter of image segmentation will be explored.", "Your home for data science.
