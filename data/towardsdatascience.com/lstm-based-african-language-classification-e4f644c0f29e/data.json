No frontiers can stop LSTMs. Transformers, maybe.", "Our sequences will be words from a not so popular language, called Yemba. You might have never heard about that language before. Feel at ease to look at pictograms below to get an idea of Yemba writing.", "Yemba is an African language spoken by just few thousand native speakers today. Despite originally being a spoken language exclusively, Yemba writing was developed ca. 90 years ago. Like so many languages in the world, Yemba is a tone language, similar to Vietnamese.", "In tone languages, words are made of consonants, vowels; and tones \u2014 the variation of musical pitch which accompanies the utterance of a syllable.", "The foundational model of tone orthography in Yemba was put in place by His Majesty Chief Djoumessi Mathias of Foreke-Dschang, the pioneer who designed the first Yemba alphabet in 1928. Later, in 1997 a modern Yemba-French dictionary was created as a result of a joined international research effort.", "Our goal is to encode Yemba words as embeddings vectors, and to build a LSTM network that is able to predict whether a Yemba word is either a noun or a verb, by looking only at the characters and tones present in the word.", "We do not aim to implement a full part-of-speech tagging. Rather, we will train the network to learn groups of letters and tones which commonly appear in Yemba nouns, compared to those which are specific to Yemba verbs.", "For this purpose, we use a pre-processed English-Yemba dataset downloaded from the Yemba.net online dictionary. We encourage you to visit the page and hit few translations from English, French, German, Czech, Chinese, Spanish, Italian to Yemba. It\u2019s fun.", "Above we can see few words from the dictionary. You can try to read them if you want to have good mood. Actually, Yemba writing is based on the International Phonetic Language. Anyone with knowledge of phonetics could actually be able to read and speak Yemba! Theoretically.", "Although we restricted our dataset to nouns and verbs, Yemba also includes adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, pronouns, etc., however in limited number compared to nouns and verbs. The distribution of word types is shown below.", "Below we show few statistics about our dataset.", "Our Yemba words are built from a 45 letters alphabet (vocabulary). The vocabulary represents each Yemba letter by a unique integer. This is a typical preprocessing step in natural language processing.", "Before feeding the words into a LSTM, we have to tokenize each word, by replacing each letter in the word with its index from the vocabulary. This process turns the word into a vector of numbers X. In order to have the same vector size for all words, we pad the vectors to the length of the longest word in our dataset.", "Our LSTM will learn to match those vectors to the correct word type: 0 for a noun and 1 for a verb. Therefore we also build a vector of labels Y to store the correct classes.", "Next, we split our vectors into a training set with 2166 words, and a validation set with 542 words.", "We build a 1-layer LSTM with 100 cells. We do not feed the words vector directly to the LSTM. Instead we first learn their embeddings representation in a 8-dimensional space.", "Embeddings are known to capture the semantic relationships between the letters building the word. The output from the LSTM is transformed by a fully connected layer with sigmoid activation to produce a probability between 0 and 1.", "We train the network by using binary crossentropy as loss function and Adam as optimizer. Classification accuracy is used as metric for evaluating the classification performance since our two classes are pretty well balanced.", "As shown above, the network achieves convergence very fast. The LSTM is doing a great job, by predicting with 93.91% classification accuracy on test dataset.", "We also tried GRUs on our Yemba classification problem, by replacing the LSTM layer by a GRU layer with the same number of units (100). Training was a little bit faster, and accuracy was a little bit better, 94.19% on validation set, instead of 93.91% as with LSTM.", "Let\u2019s now evaluate the trained LSTM network on 100 random nouns and 100 random verbs and check the confusion matrix.", "The confusion matrix exhibits few false positives and false negatives: 1 verb was predicted as noun and 2 nouns were predicted to be verbs out of 100. The miss-classified words are shown below.", "Fact is, verbs in Yemba usually have a noticeable prefix \u201ce\u201d, \u201cle\u201d or \u201cli\u201d, which corresponds to the \u201cto\u201d in the English language. It appears that this semantic or grammatical construct was correctly picked up by our character-based LSTM. The word \u201cekubli\u201d, which means \u201cavarice\u201d in English, starts with \u201ce\u201d. Therefore, the LSTM predicted it as verb, although it is a noun. Same for \u201c lef\u0254\u201d which means \u201cdynasty\u201d. Because of its prefix \u201cle\u201d, it was considered to be a verb.", "This practical case shows the magic of LSTMs in grasping semantic meanings even in remotely inaccessible languages with a strange vocabulary and phonetic nuances, such as Yemba.", "In a follow-up article, we implement a seq2seq neural translation model to translate English sentences into Yemba.", "Your home for data science.
