I hope that you find the included financial model, available here (select \u201cView Raw\u201d or hit Download), useful as you evaluate potential home purchase options. With the help of this post and the model, you\u2019ll better understand the costs associated with home ownership and the inherent opportunity costs of not investing down payment and ongoing maintenance costs into other assets, e.g., passive market ETFs.", "Given my avid interest in investing and the fact that my wife and I purchased a home in 2018, I recently revised my approach to modeling out our monthly expenses, long-term savings plan and forecasting additional funds we\u2019ll have to allocate to our family\u2019s investment strategies. Also, with the enduring Covid-19 situation, this topic is timely since more millennials are now considering home ownership. This is largely due to the evolving perspective many have experienced given shelter-in-place requirements, the projected migrations out of major cities to suburbs/residential areas and the increasing desire for things many homes afford, such as a yard and better WFH office space.", "In this post, I provide context and a scenario-based model that you can use to evaluate different home purchase options, including variable purchase prices, down payment amounts, and lending terms, among others. The scenario-based model has flexible inputs, allowing you to customize it based on your current income(s), monthly expenses, and your personal financial situation and investment preferences.", "Please note that this model does not yet account for all considerations, such as 1) whether or not you should refinance and how to evaluate multiple options there, 2) it doesn\u2019t present a full rent versus buy analysis (I link to a helpful resource and it does factor in net recurring costs in the home ownership IRR), 3) evaluates the most common 15 and 30 year fixed but not other loan types, e.g., ARM and 4) it doesn\u2019t account for taking on PMI (lower than 20% down payment) and eliminating PMI once loan-to-value becomes <= 80%. In true product management fashion, I\u2019ll iterate on future posts if there\u2019s enough interest for features like this.", "Personal pain point and reason for building this scenario-based model.", "While there are a number of useful online resources that can help inform your home purchasing decision, some of which I\u2019ll share in a bit, where I believe this post is unique is that it will take those analyses several steps further and can be personalized to your decision set. This initial post shares a framework for thinking through the associated opportunity costs you\u2019ll encounter when weighing the decision to tie up equity in a home versus other potential investments. In other words, given your personal assumptions, it\u2019ll help you forecast out what the money you didn\u2019t put into a larger home could return in the market (or some other asset(s) of your choice); and allows you to test scenarios where you\u2019re better/worse off with a particular home purchase versus investing your capital elsewhere.", "In a follow-up that I will complete based on interest in this post, my plan is to turn again to Mode Analytics (older example here). In part 2, you\u2019d further your data science analytics and dashboard development skills, creating an interactive dashboard that charts the various scenarios your financial model generates from your personalized inputs. The model, for that future post, would generate a CSV file that can be used as a flat file data source for an interactive Mode Analytics dashboard.", "In tandem with this post, my other related articles that talk further about establishing an investment system by leveraging Python include:", "Disclosure: Nothing in this post should be considered investment advice. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future returns.

Therefore, I assume no liability for any losses that may be sustained by the use of the method described in this post, and any such liability is hereby expressly disclaimed.", "As mentioned in the intro, there are four limitations (I\u2019m aware of) to my approach: 1) does not evaluate refinancings, 2) no full rent versus buy analysis, 3) looks exclusively at fixed rate mortgages (e.g., 15 and 30 year) and 4) model doesn\u2019t account for PMI scenarios. Below I share resources that address #s 1 and 2. If #4 becomes of interest based on feedback, then I\u2019ll look to update the model to incorporate PMI. My personal situation has not involved PMI, but this decision is personal and if people need additional guidance here, I\u2019ll re-evaluate.", "Refinance evaluations. I really enjoy Zillow\u2019s tools across the board and have found their refinancing calculator to be helpful, at a high level, as I\u2019ve evaluated potential refinancings. As general guidance, the short form rule of thumb is to understand what your closing costs are, aka what are you being charged to complete the refinancing; let\u2019s say those are $2k. Then look at your monthly savings versus current monthly payment; let\u2019s say that\u2019s $100 per month. This means it would take you ~20 months ($2k / $100 savings per month) to earn back your upfront costs on the refinancing. Needless to say, you should stay in your house for more than 20 months for this to start to make sense.", "Rent versus Buy. In considering renting versus buying, I believe Travis Devitt put together a helpful resource on this, which formed some of my thinking and helped me be much smarter about the considerations: link to Travis\u2019s tweet.", "Resources. Before you get started with the model in this post, I\u2019d encourage you to read through the first two resources below to have a much better handle on the economics of and path to home ownership. Of note, the Betterment post is extremely detailed and helpful; I\u2019ve based several of my model\u2019s base case assumptions using data directly from this post. The last resource presents data and addresses head on the home ownership gap that persists in America. I\u2019m unfortunately not an expert and do not have all of the answers, but I\u2019m willing to contribute to causes and provide help/answers where I can to support closing this gap. Please feel free to reach out to me on Twitter, @kevinboller, or leave a response to this post, if there\u2019s a cause you recommend I look into or a question that I can help answer on the topic of home ownership.", "When you open up the model, you will start on the Inputs worksheet that drives the rest of the formulas throughout. The schedule on the Monthly Model sheet provides a 10-year forecast. You can certainly extend this further if you would like, but it\u2019s hard for me to believe that the average person is making a 30-year decision and I prefer to evaluate shorter time periods; this is particularly because all models are wrong and trying to model out the next 30 years is likely even more wrong than the next 10.", "Cell C2 on the Inputs sheet is the most important cell in the entire model. Everything in column C on this sheet should also not be modified, as the inputs will fill in based on the selected scenario, chosen in C2, which pulls from column 1 to n columns away from column C. In the columns to the right of column C, and you can add more scenarios to the right if you\u2019d like, you change the assumptions based on the scenarios that you\u2019re evaluating. Note that any cells in blue font mean that they can be modified, and any cells in black font should not be since they\u2019re formula based and are scenario agnostic. While the provided scenarios are all positive cases, e.g., 3.2% home appreciation, you can certainly evaluate the same scenario multiple different ways. For example, maybe you want to compare a base scenario of 3.2% annual house appreciation and 7% annual investment returns versus 0% housing appreciation and 4% investment growth to see the impact over time to your adjusted net worth.", "Key point: always be cognizant that when you make any adjustments to scenarios 1\u20134, you should always go back and cycle through the scenarios in cell C2 \u2014 type 1, 2, 3, 4 into C2 in order to cycle through these scenarios and have their inputs flow through the model; this will become evident once you get use to the remaining worksheets.", "The Home Purchase Details and Loan Details sections, if you\u2019ve read the resources noted above, should be straightforward. In columns D \u2014 G, I\u2019ve included 4 templated scenarios. Income and Expenses have placeholder values and should be adjusted to reflect your personal income and expenses. I would put in after-tax income figures so that you have a better-estimated proxy for what your cash flow will be after servicing your monthly expenses; and the capital that you\u2019ll have available to invest after those expenses are serviced. For the remaining expenses after HOA, such as home maintenance, I\u2019d recommend leaving those as is since they\u2019re based on the Betterment post\u2019s data. Same recommendation for the Home Sale Inputs assumptions, including selling and closing costs.", "For the Investment Performance, % of excess cash invested means that, for the money you retain post paying your monthly expenses, how much of that will you invest into a passive ETF, stocks, etc. You then must make an estimate on your nominal return, which I\u2019ve set at 7%. You can choose to be more/less aggressive than this. Your available cash reserve, which you likely would not need, is money set aside in the event that you need more cash to support expenses in a given month (expenses exceed income); you might do this if your monthly expenses exceed your income but you manage cash flow during the year anticipating lumpier cash inflows, e.g., RSU vests twice per year; but this is not necessarily advisable or likely applicable to most.", "Net Worth Inputs, the last section, is how you\u2019ll directly compare your home investment and other investments across scenarios to see the impact on your net worth. Again, the annual home appreciation of 3.2% is a Betterment post assumption. The down payment opportunity cost means, in scenarios where you pay a larger down payment than the base scenario (always have base in column D), we\u2019ll deduct what that capital would\u2019ve returned if invested elsewhere (instead of used for a larger down payment). Since the extra down payment upside is reflected in the return of the home value in the scenario where you buy a larger home and/or pay more upfront, this will show your net return relative to base. It should also make all scenarios apples-to-apples when comparing across scenarios with higher upfront home costs.", "In cell C1, you\u2019ll see the current scenario being evaluated based on the scenario you\u2019ve input into C2 on the Inputs worksheet. This model shows a monthly breakdown across 10 years, and also rolls these up to annual totals for those 10 years. Row 37 shows net operating profit pre-tax, which takes your post tax income and deducts your monthly expenses. While I recommend income to be entered post-tax, the spreadsheet cannot account for your actual tax scenario; therefore I\u2019ve called it pre-tax as further adjustments will occur when you file/pay taxes. Below this is your debt paydown (rows 45\u201349) and a schedule that goes through what excess cash will be invested, the projected returns from those investments, and the cash reserve (money not invested) that will build over time.", "You\u2019ll see in rows 65\u201367 the buildup of your investable cash over time. For relevant higher cost scenarios, the opportunity cost for what you could have returned by buying a smaller home/making a smaller down payment will also accrue value over time in the same manner. It\u2019s important to note that the investment returns in this model offer a simplified, linear view of your money growing over time. No investment will grow linearly at your annual expected return divided by 12 months; further, since this is exhibiting a dollar cost averaging approach, where you invest when you have available capital on a monthly basis, your actual returns will exhibit more volatility than the simplified model framework. Regardless, you shouldn\u2019t get bogged down in the monthly returns and recognize that 1) you will, on average, see this appreciation annually in your investable assets (home and ETFs, et al) and 2) this model is intended to help you take a longer-term view. Ideally, given the friction in transaction and closing costs, you\u2019ll provide yourself with 5 to 10 years in your home before deciding on moving/buying a different home.", "Net Worth over Time first evaluates the build up in home equity. This is driven off the input to annual home appreciation (which is adjusted to a monthly rate of increase in Inputs) and the paydown in debt based on the terms of the mortgage. To finalize the net worth calculation, the upside the additional down payment would\u2019ve generated in scenarios beyond base scenario is deducted, investment growth is added and you can manually input any additional assets and liabilities that you\u2019d like. My personal model schedule is more detailed than this, including retirement assets (Roth, 401k, etc.). When ready, you should consider building those into your model if you\u2019d like a complete picture of your net worth alongside the projected contributions to those accounts and related growth over time.", "While home equity grows over time, increasing your overall net worth, the Betterment article does a good job of highlighting the \u201cproblems with calculating investment returns\u201d. For sake of brevity, there are three core drivers, in addition to home appreciation, that impact your return on home investment: 1) transaction costs, 2) cash flows, including ongoing costs (note, these are reflected in our model, see row 49 on Inputs worksheet), and leverage, aka a mortgage, increasing gains to the upside but also increasing risk on the downside. As a result, to see a true apples-to-apples comparison, in the Charts and the Recurring Costs + IRR worksheets, we\u2019ll see how you\u2019ll need to deduct estimated transaction costs in order to reflect your true net worth and your home investment\u2019s projected IRR.", "On the Charts worksheet, we compare a few core metrics across scenarios over the first 5 year period. Extending this to 10 years, or beyond if you extend the model further, should be straightforward if you have some familiarity with developing and extending models.", "In the first chart, we compare your projected net operating profit (NOP, income less expenses) across scenarios. You can see in this case that NOP is greatest in scenario 1 and second highest in scenario 4. In scenario 4, you\u2019ve elected to pay for the same home as scenario 1, but you\u2019ve selected a 15-year mortgage over a 30-year one. To each their own, but I subscribe to Ric Edelman\u2019s theory of having a 30-year mortgage \u2014 I prefer greater liquidity and diversification. Using these scenarios, you can see in Scenario 2 that you\u2019ll have ~70% of the NOP you have in scenario 1, and in Scenario 3 you have ~35% of the NOP you would\u2019ve had in Scenario 1 (in this scenario, you bought a home 3x as expensive as Scenario 1).", "In the second chart, go to cell K101, the chart shows investment details for the selected scenario, and the table below breaks down the scenarios head to head. Given the linearity of returns and the same assumptions regarding how much is invested (80%), you\u2019ll see that your total investment balance + excess cash for the scenarios past #1 will mirror the differences in NOP between scenarios. You can decide if you\u2019d like to modify the scenarios\u2019 assumptions; for example, if you buy a smaller home, maybe you\u2019ll allocate more of your capital to investing (90%?) and/or be more aggressive with your other investments, expecting a return higher than 7%.", "In the 3rd chart, go to J160, you\u2019ll see your net worth over time and your debt paydown over time on the secondary y-axis. For the first three scenarios, the existing loan balance as a % of original mortgage, and home equity as a part of home valuation are relatively in-line. The only difference is that I\u2019ve assumed modestly higher interest rates for larger home purchases/greater amount borrowed. You\u2019ll also see that your home equity reflects 30% of your net worth in scenario 1, increasing to ~60% and 90%+ in scenarios 2 and 3, and arriving at 40% in scenario 4 (where you\u2019ve elected a 15-year mortgage; higher than scenario 1 given this). While you might conclude in column O (cell 0160) that you\u2019re indifferent across scenarios and your net worth is relatively the same, this is not entirely correct. After deducting for projected closing costs (see U161), which estimates the net realized value you could get from the sale of your home, you see that, after 5 years, scenarios 2 and 3 actually trail scenario 1 for your adjusted net worth; whereas you\u2019re effectively in the same spot in scenarios 1 and 4 (same purchase, different mortgage duration). The near tie between scenarios 1 and 4 indicates that, based on your investment opportunity set, you\u2019re relatively indifferent to investing more in your home (shorter duration mortgage) versus in a diversified ETF (assuming a 7% annualized return) \u2014 tax consequences, such as deductions for mortgage interest or taxes on dividends, have not been considered for this framework but could impact this comparison. For final details on how to evaluate your potential home investment\u2019s returns, we\u2019ll go to our last worksheet.", "As stated before, the Betterment article is well detailed and very helpful to become more knowledgeable on the mechanics and implications of home ownership. However, after reading the article, you\u2019ll still not have a way to customize the learnings to your personal situation or decision set. Given that I agreed with the author\u2019s approach to returns, I\u2019ve re-created two of the tables in that post within my last worksheet. The benefit is that you\u2019ll be able to tweak scenarios and inputs and they\u2019ll flow through these tables based on the same structure as that post.", "In the Annual Recurring Costs of Home Ownership table, this lays out how to calculate net annual recurring costs (rent versus buy) for the particular scenario that you\u2019re evaluating. For detail on this, see Ongoing Costs of Home Ownership in the Betterment post. Since this may raise questions, I\u2019ll point out a difference between the model in my post and the table from the Betterment one. In the Betterment table, annual property taxes grow with the value of the home and homeowner\u2019s insurance grows at inflation. While this is more accurate, I\u2019ve left each scenario\u2019s fully loaded monthly mortgage payment (including property taxes and insurance) constant over the model\u2019s 10 year forecast. This is to reduce cognitive overload for what we\u2019re covering and to make it easier to understand this model relative to online mortgage calculators and estimated payments. Since I do not grow property taxes and insurance modestly over time, this means the home ownership returns are slightly overstated; however, since this is done equally across scenarios, I believe this has an immaterial impact on your evaluation. To highlight the minimal difference, you\u2019ll notice in the Betterment post\u2019s Annual Recurring Costs Of Homeownership table that, after 10 years, annual property taxes and home insurance costs on a $250k home purchase only increase by ~$500 and $200, respectively.", "I also show two IRR schedules, one for a five year investment horizon and the other for a ten year investment horizon. You\u2019ll notice that the IRR is highest for scenario 4, where you pay the lowest upfront down payment (same as scenario 1) and you pay down your loan faster due to having a 15-year versus a 30-year mortgage. In this case, while your net annual recurring costs are higher in scenario 4 versus scenario 1, the greater equity value you\u2019ve generated through paying down more of the debt principal drives the higher IRR. This exhibits the upside of the levered return from home ownership when you are able to benefit from home value appreciation.", "However, I\u2019ve simplified some things in the annual recurring costs table, such as the annual rent saved assumption. The annual rent saved should likely be the same for all of your personalized scenarios (please feel free to reflect this in your own evaluation), but given my assumption to drive off of the mortgage payment, saved rent is actually higher in scenario 4 and the other higher cost scenarios. I\u2019ll need to think if this can be represented differently, but the result is that scenario 4\u2019s IRR is likely overstated. For now, I\u2019ve left these tables as more of a generalized illustration of the return profiles across scenarios. If you would like, it should be very easy to override the formulas in columns H and I in the first table on Recurring Costs + IRR. You can just input your particular rent saved and renters insurance saved, and then grow these at inflation.", "As expected, Scenarios 2 and 3 have modestly lower IRRs than Scenario 1, since you see the same price appreciation as in Scenario 1, slightly slower debt paydown due to greater interest costs and your net annual recurring costs are higher given the higher mortgage payments. Last, similar to the Betterment post, you see that the returns improve over a longer holding period (10 years versus 5), as it takes time to recoup your upfront closing costs from purchasing the home.", "I\u2019d finally note that this model does not present an overall returns analysis across your entire set of assets; and the home ownership IRR is done independently on the final worksheet. My advice here is to focus less on returns but on the outcome that generates the highest adjusted net worth, while balancing the risk you\u2019re comfortable taking to achieve this adjusted net worth. This is a more complicated topic and I\u2019ll consider following up more on this if there is related feedback and questions.", "To conclude this post, I hope that you find this framework useful in evaluating your personal opportunity set in terms of potential homes to buy, related purchase prices and key variables such as % down payment, mortgage interest rates and loan duration. While I\u2019ve pointed to very helpful resources that I found to better understand the economics of home ownership, I\u2019ve not found another resource that 1) personalizes monthly cash flows, 2) forecasts your build up of net worth over time, including home equity, and 3) provides a customized schedule to evaluate potential investment returns, opportunity cost, and your home\u2019s potential IRR.", "The scenarios in this model largely conclude similar findings to those in the Betterment post. It takes on average 4\u20135 years to break-even on your closing costs, and a home can potentially be a sound investment and even exhibit a comparable return profile to a total stock market ETF (such as Vanguard\u2019s VTI). This will not always be the case and the Betterment post does a good job of highlighting where things can go wrong.", "In combination with the resources I\u2019ve linked to, now that you have a customizable model that allows you to evaluate your decision set across your housing and investment opportunities, you should feel fully informed that you\u2019ll make a well researched decision and step into home ownership with your eyes wide open. In doing so, I believe that owning a home can be a great place to be; and you\u2019ll have a strong grasp on how it fits into your overall personal finances and your forecasted investment and retirement strategy.", "If you enjoyed this post, it would be awesome if you would click the \u201cclaps\u201d icon (more than once!) to let me know and to help increase circulation of my work.
