In this article, we will be building our own model from scratch.", "The purpose of this article is to let you have an understanding of what typically goes on inside a computer vision model. We will be creating a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognise apparels. Yes, you heard that right, we are not recognising handwritten digits (MNIST) or detecting dogs anymore. We are now recognising apparels.", "In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset researchers try. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work on MNIST, it won\u2019t work at all\u201d, they said. \u201cWell, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others.\u201d", "MNIST is too easy. Convolutional nets can achieve 99.7% on MNIST. Classic machine learning algorithms can also achieve 97% easily.", "This article assumes that you have some form of basic knowledge on machine learning and neural network, such as train test data, optimizers, loss functions, metrics, forward propagation, backward propagation etc. If not, do not worry. The concepts are very basic and lots of information can be found online. I will try my best to explain every single line of the code required to build your CNN.", "The following libraries must be imported to build our model. If you followed part 1 of this article, you will not need to install any additional packages. Or else, do check out the article to find out which 2 packages you should download! (yes, all you need are 2 packages to create your own Neural Network)", "Gluon comes with its own data libraries. You can download the Fashion MNIST with a single line of code.", "Since we will be evaluation our model later, we shall download the validation dataset as well by setting the parameter trainto False.", "We can then print out the shape and data type of our first image:", "Lastly, we observe that we have 60,000 images in our training data.", "The data must be transformed into a format that Gluon neural networks can digest. Fortunately, Gluon also provides us with functions to achieve this easily:", "Sending your image one by one into your neural network is a bad idea. It will take up a huge amount of time to feed your network. Hence, we create a data loader to load data into batches of 256 (you can experiment and change this batch number).", "4 parameters are required to create our DataLoader:", "We will be replicating a LeNet-5 model.", "We first start off with a blank canvas: nn.Sequential()", "Next, we add layers and layers of hidden layers into our model according to the LeNet-5 architecture.", "For our model to determine if it is performing well, we will need a loss function. You can think of loss functions as errors, as to how far we are away from the correct labels/ground truth.", "In a multinomial classification problem, we will usually use the Cross-Entropy Loss function. The Cross-Entropy Loss function is usually paired with softmax to squash the values between (0,1).", "With our loss function, we need a way to determine how good our model is. We determine this by using metrics. There are several metrics such as F1, Recall, Precision, Accuracy etc. The most commonly used metric is accuracy.", "train_acc allows us to create an object and keep feeding it with the predicted result and the actual result. It will automatically recalculate the accuracy until you call for the accuracy. This will be demonstrated at a later part of this article.", "We need to define our optimizer. There is no point in knowing how good/bad our model is performing if we are not doing anything to improve it. Hence, we make use of stochastic gradient descent to tell our model what to do next given the current error/accuracy that we have.", "This section puts together everything we have done so far to train our model. I will be explaining the code below step-by-step:", "The above code should take quite some time to run, depending on the power of your computer. You can observe how the loss decreases and the accuracy increase as the number of iteration increases. This shows that our model is learning well.", "Lastly, we do a final evaluation of our model to have an idea of how well it is performing on unseen data. Do remember to create a new accuracy metric and do not reuse train_acc to prevent leakage of information.", "Congratulations on completing this article! By now, you should be able to create and design your own neural network from scratch. There are many other deep learning libraries such as Tensorflow, Keras, Pytorch and Scikit-learn that can achieve the same results as well. Go with what you are familiar with. Different packages should still provide you with similar results.", "I encourage you to check out different models and architectures that are available and experiment with different data you can find online.", "Your home for data science.
