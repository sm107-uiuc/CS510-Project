To summarize everything, I\u2019ve proposed three pillars that a Data Scientist should look to improve in order to reach seniority:", "In this article, we\u2019ll talk about a part of the first pillar: outsider knowledge. What are the technical skills you need to obtain that are not pure Data Science and are not intrinsically related to interpersonal communication?", "There are two main areas that a Senior Data Scientist must touch in order to increase his get-sh*t-done coefficient: deployment and product ownership.", "A Data Scientist creates models, dashboards, and reports for management consumption and data processing. But nothing gets actually used without a competent Data Engineer arranging scalable, robust solutions to deliver these data applications.", "The ideal world would consist of a Data Engineer for every Data Scientist. Alas, that is just not our\u00a0reality, as Engineers are not as common as Scientists in the Data ecosystem.", "Now, there is no sure-fire recipe for the deployment of a model. It depends on many different factors: the processing power required to run it, the inherent complexity of data transference between instances for complex serial computations, the desired speed for inference\u2026", "Every deployment should be a handcrafted solution for your model and problem.", "If your model needs to have extremely fast inferences, you should focus on parallel solutions. If there are no time constraints, feel free to release the deep networks. If there are memory constraints, rein in your BERTs and YOLOs and think small. Minify. Distill your network. The best solution metric-wise is not necessarily a marketable one.", "With the solution ready, the deployment ritual starts. Do prepare coffee sacrifices and channel your inner DevOps. A Senior must at least have superficial knowledge about each step of this process.", "Summarizing: create an interface to insert and retrieve data, package your model in a reproducible way, publish it in a platform, monitor errors and performance, and if needed, distribute it between different machines to increase throughput.", "Seniority correlates to responsibility. And with responsibility, you start to take a bigger role in your projects. This is a common trend in any programming role and the major difference between career paths, splitting them into management and specialist roles.", "In the Data world, this split becomes a little foggy: in addition to being a new field, Data projects are mostly self-contained and need more technical knowledge to manage. In addition, there may be a good amount of friction in order to adapt exploration projects to the Agile workflow, common on most startups.", "Now, there is a rising trend of hiring specific Product Owners and Managers for Data-related issues. While that trend does not consolidate into a full-blown position, a Senior Data Scientist must take some responsibilities himself.", "The most important thing here is project organization, basically. Self-organization to fulfill your tasks, to accurately measure the amount of time you need to clean a dataset, to explore it both manually and statistically, to train reasonably accurate models over it, to deploy and monitor it. You must be able to define and manage the lifecycle of your project, from inception to validation.", "Let's say that you have been allocated to drive a project to create a domain-specific sentiment analyzer. This needs to be accessible from a given URL, with a simple text string input and a sentiment output. What are the necessary steps for successful development?", "For each of those steps, can you measure how much time you would need to complete them by yourself? Can you break those in independent tasks to divide the workload between teammates? Which tasks demand complex, technical know-how? A Product Owner that is not used to data exploration tasks won't be able to do it in the most optimal way, so you gotta step up! PoC by PoC, you become a POC (Project Owner Consultant).", "I\u2019m partial to the thought that a Data Scientist is a good learner and not necessarily a know-er. Don\u2019t be desperate to delve into every area and be a master in it. Slowly but surely you will accumulate knowledge and experience if you deal with Data on a daily basis. We are all walking up in the steps of Data together!", "Thank you for reading, and have fun in this Data-filled universe!", "Your home for data science.
