I admit that this comparison might sound a little far-fetched. Indeed, to Peepshow fans it might sound a bit like \u201cthe Business Secrets of the Pharaohs\u201d [1]. However I want to persuade you that some things about Leadership are fundamental, and as people running (or aspiring to run) data teams we should look further afield for inspiration on how to set our team culture. And it usually pays to follow a winner, right?", "Firstly, we should understand that Nelson was both brilliant and bold. His plan for victory on the eve of Trafalgar was to put his ships in two lines and charge at the French. And that was pretty much it. He left it up to individual commanders to sink French ships anyway they saw fit. In the end, the British won a shattering victory that assured Britain was the world\u2019s dominant maritime power \u2014 right up until the USA got really going about a century or so later.", "All very interesting, but what has that to do with data science?", "Well firstly lets look at the style of leadership that\u2019s implied. Nelson isn\u2019t providing a list of tasks for his captains to complete, or attempting to micro manage their time. Rather he tells them \u201cas long as you\u2019re fighting the enemy, you\u2019re doing the right thing and I\u2019ll back you\u201d. In other words, he provides a broad goal and gives them permission to do whatever they need to do to achieve it.", "Now if you\u2019ve hired the right people, your data scientists are going to be smart, motivated and independent minded. Perhaps you decide to take a leaf out of Nelson\u2019s playbook and come up with a broad goal of your own:", "\u201cno data scientist can do very wrong if they launch a model into production\u201d Some Head of Data Science, sometime in 2019", "Sounds great right? Issue the instruction, and then have a bunch of smart people figure out how to do the actual work. Meanwhile you can goof off early and head to the golf course (US) or the pub (UK).", "To understand why this is not going to work on its own, we can return to Nelson and his navy. Nelson issued his order in the context of a naval culture that rested on a shared set of skills, experiences and beliefs. He knew he could trust that his captains would implement his goals because he knew how they thought and fought.", "So what was this shared culture composed of? And is any of it relevant to data science? Well here are seven similarities that I can see:", "In Nelson\u2019s time, training to become a naval officer would begin at the age of twelve. These children served on active fighting ships, where they were partnered with a more experienced junior officer (himself often a teenager) who would show them, quite literally, the ropes.", "I couldn\u2019t find the casualty rate for these midshipmen, largely because no-one seems to have been very interested in recording it. Suffice to say, by the time the survivors had reached a command position, they had been amassing a body of technical knowledge from a very early age.", "Your data science team is going to have to know a body of technical, factual stuff. We\u2019ll return in another post to what that technical stuff is exactly. For now let\u2019s say it\u2019s some combination of software skills, statistics and machine learning. Part of a head of data science\u2019s job is to make sure the team has those skills. Traditionally that has meant hiring people from outside the organisation. However as data science becomes increasingly established in large organisations, it is also becoming a popular choice for younger internal candidates on graduate rotation schemes or similar. Ensuring that the right people get the right training is a non-trivial part of the job. In the end, just like Nelson\u2019s captains, you are going to have to be assured that everyone on your team knows and understands a shared body of knowledge.", "The battle of Trafalgar was preceded by the blockade of France. This was Britain\u2019s answer to Napoleon\u2019s continental blockade \u2014 you\u2019re not blockading us, we\u2019re blockading you! British ships were kept at sea for months on end, disrupting French trade. This had the effect of bottling French warships up in harbour. By the time of the battle of Trafalgar, British sailors were just better at sailing, not because of any inherent superiority, but simply because they\u2019d been doing it more.", "Members of a data science team are going to have to get better at data science by doing data science. This sounds trivial, but it raises difficult problems of balance. You\u2019re going to have to push people to get the right experiences for them. There are going to be tasks people want to do because they\u2019ve done them before and are good at them. Then there are tasks people want to do because they\u2019ve never done them before and want to get good at them. And finally, there are tasks no-one wants to do because they\u2019re boring. Somehow you have to ensure both that the right people are getting the right experiences and that all the necessary work is getting done. In the end, like captains on the English ships stood out to sea, you need to be confident in the experience of your team.", "Nelson used Shakespeare\u2019s phrase \u201cband of brothers\u201d to refer to his relationship with his senior captains. It seems he considered himself as a first amongst equals, with historians arguing that it showed \u201csocial equality in the service of the country\u201d [2]. Nelson always consulted with a group of captains prior to major engagements to run through and improve his plans.", "As a head of data science, you are going to have to have a good, open relationship with the senior members of your team. They\u2019ll know stuff that you don\u2019t and have had experiences that you haven\u2019t. You\u2019ll need to tap into that knowledge. However the danger with flat hierarchies is that you end up instead with \u201caccidental hierarchies\u201d, in which someone ends up dominating. If this is an #iamverysmart [3] person who definitely, definitely has all the answers, then the open culture that you\u2019re trying to cultivate is in the process of being destroyed. In this case, you just have to make someone a temporary lead who has the necessary personality to maintain the openness. This might not be the person who thinks it should be them! The trick we\u2019re trying to achieve is the one Nelson pulled off. No-one doubted that Nelson was in ultimate command of the fleet, and that captains were responsible for their ships. However the hierarchy was flat enough that plans could be discussed and improved collaboratively.", "Winning matters. Prior to Trafalgar, the British navy had won a succession of battles: on the Glorious First of June 1794, at Groix in 1795, at Cape St Vincent in 1797, Camperdown in 1797, the Nile in 1798, and Copenhagen in 1801. By 1805, they expected to win, and win they duly did.", "As individuals your data scientists should already have an \u201celite\u201d mentality as individuals. They\u2019ve probably developed this at university, in academia, or even better, by succeeding in the workplace. Your job is to translate that into an elite team mentality. In the end you will see people doing extraordinary things when projects start to go wrong, because \u201cdelivering is what we do\u201d. In that kind of culture, a failed project is kind of unthinkable. This success then feeds forward into the shared belief that the team is a successful one, which generates more hard work to bring more success, and so it goes. As in Nelson\u2019s navy, a culture of success breeds more success.", "OK, we shouldn\u2019t overplay this. By modern standards, Nelson and his contemporaries were \u201cmale and pale\u201d. However here is a description of their backgrounds:", "\u201cAs the son of a country clergyman, he [Nelson]came from that wide social range from the lesser gentry to the middle classes which provided the Royal Navy with so many of its officers. He might be compared with his contemporaries on the flag list St Vincent, Duncan, Cornwallis, Keith, Gardner, Gambier, Collingwood, and the brothers Bridport and Hood; St Vincent\u2019s father was a provincial barrister, Duncan\u2019s Provost of Dundee, Gardner\u2019s an army officer, Gambier\u2019s lieutenant-governor of the Bahamas, Collingwood\u2019s a merchant, and the Hoods\u2019 another clergyman.\u201d [5]", "At a time when continental navies were being led by sons of the nobility, the British navy was promoting from the middle classes based on merit.", "Your data science team has to be the same. Like it or not, you\u2019re in the middle of a fierce fight for resources. If you are an internal facing team, there will be a bunch of people wanting to outsource you. If you are external facing, there will be dozens of hungry competitors. Like Nelson, you need the best people you can get, regardless of any other considerations.", "On the 14th March 1757, Admiral John Byng was executed by firing squad. According to his court martial, he had \u201cfailed to do his utmost\u201d in the face of the enemy. Historians suggest that Byng was executed to settle the debate between the enlightenment view that war was now about the scientific deployment of forces (in which case retiring before a superior enemy as ordered was the rational course of action), and older, bloodier views of warfare [6]. More succinctly, according to Voltaire, he had been executed \u201cto encourage the others\u201d.Whatever the reason, from the time of Byng to Trafalgar and beyond, actions of the Royal Navy were often marked by extreme aggression. Better to die at the hands of the enemy than in disgrace by firing squad.", "Now of course you don\u2019t want your data scientists to be displaying extreme aggression. And you\u2019re probably not going to be allowed to execute any of them either \u2014 tempting though that may sound. However at some point in every data science project, you leave behind work that\u2019s been done already and have to rely on your ability to do something new. This can be scary, but that comes with the job! Your team culture has to encourage a bold \u201ccan do\u201d spirit, to encourage people to make that first step into the unknown. As in Nelson\u2019s Navy, backing away when things seem difficult can\u2019t be tolerated.", "The effect of resources on Nelson\u2019s navy is probably best summed up by this graph:", "In effect, by the time of Trafalgar, the British had outspent their continental rivals for two and a half centuries. They had more ships, more guns and more fighting men. That\u2019s one big reason they kept winning.", "In the old days of data science, legend has it that you could give a smart person a ballpoint pen, a fresh notepad and access to a computer. Then you could step back and expect them to work miracles. That world is over \u2014 if it ever existed at all. Your team is working in a universe of massive tech giants, experienced external consultancies and APIs provided by tightly focused start-ups. It will be constrained by the resources that it has at its disposal, limited by man hours, compute resources and the resources spent on the quality and quantity of data. Therefore you need to be realistic about what\u2019s possible, and match the problems you tackle to the resources you have to devote to them. In the end, as with Nelson, it helps to be bigger than your direct competition \u2014 or if that\u2019s not possible, at least in the same spending league.", "So there we are: seven reasons why your data science team should be like Nelson\u2019s navy. In the end, it\u2019s not about the broad goal you set the team. That\u2019s the easy bit. The hard bit is building the culture and environment in which you set that goal, so you can be confident that your team will successfully deliver.", "[1] If you\u2019re not a Peepshow fan, you almost definitely should be. It\u2019s a British sitcom available on Netflix, and channel4.com . The conceit of \u201cthe Business Secrets of the Pharaohs\u201d episode is that it follows one of the main characters trying to get his idiot business book published.", "[2] See for example \u201c For Party Or Country: Nationalism and the Dilemmas of Popular Conservatism in Edwardian England\u201d by Franz Coetzee. Yes I know that Nelson wasn\u2019t an Edwardian, but Chapter 1 covers the preceding years. It\u2019s a history book after all.", "[3] The wince inducing epicentre of #iamverysmart people is of course https://www.reddit.com/r/iamverysmart/", "[4] Total Factor Productivity for the Royal Navy from Victory at Texal (1653) to Triumph at Trafalgar (1805).
