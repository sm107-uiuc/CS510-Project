As \u201cregular\u201d intelligence is usually being measured as IQ, and Time Intelligence is one of the most important topics in data modeling, I decided to start a blog series which will introduce some basic concepts, pros and cons of specific solutions and potential pitfalls to avoid, everything in order to increase your overall TIQ and make your models more robust, scalable and flexible in terms of time analysis", "Dear reader, we are closing to an end of this series. After a detailed explanation of why you can, but you shouldn\u2019t, use Auto Date/Time feature in Power BI, then underlying the significance of Date dimension within your data model, in the previous article I\u2019ve offered you various solutions for creating a proper Date dimension.", "So, it\u2019s time to wrap-up with some examples of the most frequently used time-related calculations and some neat differences between them.", "In the simplest way, Time Intelligence represents some kind of calculation related to dates. Don\u2019t let to be confused with the word \u201cTime\u201d and expect to see hours/minutes/seconds/milliseconds as the lowest level of granularity when someone talks about \u201cTime intelligence\u201d.", "The more appropriate term would be \u201cDate Intelligence\u201d, but since \u201cTime Intelligence\u201d is already generally accepted, let\u2019s stick with this naming convention.", "The main characteristic of all Time Intelligence functions in DAX is that one way or the other, they need to operate on a column of Date or Date/Time data type. This means that one of the input parameters for these functions needs to be the Date or Date/Time column.", "Also, all of them will shift your selected dates into some new dates (be it in the past or in the future).", "Last, but not least, Time intelligence functions support the single day as the lowest level of granularity \u2014 this means that you can\u2019t use them in calculations for hours/minutes/seconds, etc.", "There are dozen of Time intelligence functions, but some of them are being used more frequently than the others. For example, almost every Power BI report that operates with numbers needs some kind of comparison in order to identify trends. Or, displaying cumulative values is also one of the top business requests.", "These functions look simple at first glance, but at the same time, they are quite powerful. Let\u2019s look at this simple example of calculating running totals for the selected year.", "In the Contoso database, I\u2019ve created a measure to calculate the Sales Amount:", "Now, let\u2019s create our measure for calculating running totals:", "When I drag these measures to a report and select months from January to August 2009, you can immediately notice the difference in numbers on month level:", "That was quite straightforward, but let me explain what is happening in the background of Sales Amt YTD measure calculation because that is quite important in order to understand the whole logic here.", "Recall the time-shifting concept I\u2019ve mentioned above \u2014 here, we selected dates from January 1st 2009 to August 31st 2009. What is happening for YTD calculation is that the filter context is changed to include dates between January 1st 2009 and the last day of the selected month, no matter which month we selected!", "This is gonna be much more clear looking at the following example, where I selected months from March 2009 to August 2009:", "Take a careful look at the value marked in red. No matter we selected March to display our numbers, DATESYTD() function resets our filter and includes values from the beginning of the year. We don\u2019t see them in the table, but they are included in the March totals, as you can easily compare with the first screenshot. Totals for YTD remained unchanged, no matter we changed our selection in the slicer.", "One of the things I like most in DAX is the fact that you can achieve the same goals in multiple different ways. That also stands for running totals calculations, since instead of DATESYTD(), you can also use TOTALYTD() function. TOTALQTD() and TOTALMTD() works in the same manner, but on different granularity (quarters and months respectively).", "You should also pay attention to neat differences between specific functions because in one scenario they can give you exactly the same results, but then to perform completely different in some other situations.", "Therefore, if you want to perform Year-Over-Year comparisons, you can use both SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() and DATEADD() functions, and the following measures\u2026", "The only difference is that DATEADD() gives you more flexibility since you can shift intervals according to your needs and on different levels of Date hierarchy (quarters, months, days), while SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() is bounded to previous year only. PARALLELPERIOD() is also very similar, but still different enough, in the way that we are setting static interval for date shifting:", "But, as we change last created measure to\u2026", "\u2026you would expect that -1 YEAR relates to -12 MONTHS\u2026", "However, that is not the case, as PARALLELPERIOD will return total Sales Amount for the whole previous year (slicer selection has been disregarded):", "I don\u2019t want to say: use DATEADD() and don\u2019t use PARALLELPERIOD(). Or, avoid SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR() and use instead DATEADD(). All of these functions have their place in your calculations \u2014 key takeover here is: be careful when you\u2019re selecting Time intelligence functions for performing specific time calculations! As you\u2019ve already seen, in some cases they will all return the same results, but in reality, they behave completely differently.", "Time Intelligence is one of the most important concepts in Power BI (and Business Intelligence in general). Therefore, it\u2019s almost impossible to cover all stuff in a few blog posts, as I boldly tried. However, I sincerely hope that some basic concepts and ideas are more clear now.", "In the end, I bet that your TIQ (Time Intelligence Quotient) is higher than it was when you started this (hopefully) interesting TIQ journey.", "Your home for data science.
