Moreover, once you built a dashboard you will feel very protective of it and you will have a hard time accepting any negative comment.", "So, before you work weeks on a potential dashboard, taking care of every detail, better to build first a prototype and test it with colleagues.", "The prototype should reproduce the main functionality of the dashboard and, in most cases, it may contain sample but realistic data. The people who will look at it should have a general idea of the subject of the report but should not be super-expert.", "Listening, evaluating, and applying suggestions at this stage will be easier and faster. In my experience, some of the most appreciated analysis or features could easily come from these comments.", "In my experience, high-level managers don\u2019t have enough time and their attention is usually directed to specific projects or topics.", "Therefore, you need to keep in mind that the messages you want to convey should be easily understandable from the dashboard you are building.", "Trying to fit a lot of information in one dashboard could result in a mess. So, probably better to get rid of the excess.", "Focus on specific subjects could be referenced in the dashboard with links to other dashboards or other pages.", "Probably your managers won\u2019t have enough time to understand fancy charts they have not seen before, so probably you should stick with classic charts they already know (bar chart, scatter plot, line chart, etc.). But again, this depends on the managers.", "When you have to remove the excess there are some usual suspects to look for.", "It could be useful to add the most important indicators and KPIs in the uppermost part of the dashboard with a big font size. That\u2019s the part where they will start reading the report and, for this reason, that\u2019s where they will look for the most important numbers.", "Add some surprise. That could be some interaction with the chart the managers don\u2019t expect.", "If your visualization tools have this kind of feature, you can add an additional analysis or a focus when you click on a specific point of the dashboard. That is could be also a way to remove an analysis from the dashboard and show it on demand.", "There some things that contribute to creating a mess:", "Maybe you don\u2019t realize it but I assure you that all these things contribute to making readers uncomfortable (and even most of them won\u2019t know where this discomfort comes from).", "The font size should be big enough to be easily visible from the devices with which they will access the dashboard. Be maniac in aligning charts and measuring sizes.", "If you have brand identity guidelines (where is specified which colors and which font you can use) follow it rigorously.", "Moreover, if your managers already receive dashboards from other departments, try to keep the format uniform to avoid confusion. For example, if your managers are used to having filters on the left side is disadvantageous to move them to another side (they will lose time and patience looking for the filters).", "Ok, now you have a dashboard that has passed a robust \u201ccorridor test\u201d but when you open it takes some minutes to load all the charts. Too much for a manager. I would recommend staying below 10 seconds.", "There\u2019s a lot of ways to reduce the loading-time, some depend on the visualization tool you are using (Tableau, Power BI, etc.). But most are quite general:", "Sometimes, data sources could be blended together and that could save time.", "Moreover, if your data are time-related, it could be the case to filter out some old dates. Do you really need daily data for the past 3 years? Or maybe you can settle for daily data for the last 3 months and end-of-month data for the past?", "A well-designed and tailor-made dashboard could make the difference between reaching your audience and help them to make the right decision or to be ignored throwing away a lot of hard work.", "In this article, focused on professional dashboards for executives, I shared some of the things to keep in mind when building a new visualization:", "Follow this suggestion and your readers will love your dashboards!", "Your home for data science.
