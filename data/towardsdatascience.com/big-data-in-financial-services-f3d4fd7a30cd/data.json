Valued at $7.9 trillion, with millions of transactions per second and a world record of 2.9 billion shares traded in one day (in the year 2000), capacity-related delays are a big issue e.g. processing of 6.5 million quotes caused processing delays due to the vast amounts of data being processed (Greene, 2017).", "In 2014, the issue was compounded as the business strategy was to move away from being a predominantly US equities exchange to be a global provider of corporate, trading, and technology and information solutions. This meant more data processing and storage of enormous amounts of data content they were legally required to hold.", "Companies in the financial services industry are typically required to retain trading information for seven years- a regulatory requirement, which can result in huge storage bills. At NASDAQ, they had a legacy warehouse ($1.16m annual maintenance) and limited capacity (i.e. only 1 year of data online).", "Their big data volume consisted of 4\u20138 billion rows of data inserted per trading day.

NASDAQ could not afford to be loading yesterday\u2019s data when clients are running queries. Disaster recovery was another important factor for NASDAQ.", "The original scope of requirements was to replace on-premise warehouse with migration to AWS Redshift, keeping equivalent schemas and data, and that the big data solution must satisfy the 2 most important factors for consideration- security and regulatory requirements. The approach was to pull data from numerous sources, validate data i.e. data cleansing and securely load into AWS Redshift.", "To detail further, validation of data required alerts to bad/missing data daily, ingestion must enforce data constraints i.e. no dupes, and be fast and security to be paramount for sensitive transactional and company data. This initially caused an issue as AWS Redshift does not enforce data constraints. If there are dupes, it accepts it.", "Data is fundamental to their business and dealing with sensitive data means security requirements for Nasdaq are high as they are a regulated company and have to answer to SEC (the US Securities and Exchange Commission).", "Therefore they need to have systems that are secure as one of the big challenges of big data is that it will make personal financial information far more distributed and therefore easier to steal. AWS Redshift met security requirements by providing multiple layers of security:", "The benefits realization of this migration project completed on schedule with the following benefits:", "\u25cf Redshift costs were 43% of legacy data warehouse budget (for the same data set circa 1100 tables)", "\u25cf High watermark= 14b rows in a day", "\u25cf Best write rate circa 2.76m rows/second", "\u25cf Queries now running faster than on legacy systems.", "\u25cf The data storage load increased to over 1200 tables.", "\u25cf Passed security audits.

NDW (Nasdaq Data Warehouse) is currently growing 3 fold every quarter!", "NASDAQ\u2019s other issue was scalability without undermining performance and cost. NASDAQ found that the infrastructure required for Apache Hadoop and big data analytics can be difficult to manage and scale. All these past different technologies did not play well together and the cost to manage all these was difficult.", "It, therefore, used cloud virtualization to remove hardware limitations, reduced software infrastructure software complexity, cost, and time to deploy Hadoop and Spark. Virtualization simplified the amount of technology and resource needed, maximized processor utilization (18\u201320% to 80\u201390%), security was maintained, and performance increased by 2% through virtualization.", "From an engineering and operational perspective, NASDAQ was able to meet customer big data analytic needs without having to increase staff numbers. Blue data, therefore, helped NASDAQ drive innovation (Greene, 2017).", "GDPR (effective 25 May 2018): (Zerlang, 2017) confirms that transparency on data handling is core to GDPR. Cross-border financial services must record all the conversations for a minimum of 5 years or can be fined e.g. Barclays fined \u00a32.45m for incorrectly reporting on 57.5 million transactions. Similarly, (Gilford, 2016) states that GDPR may fine Tesco Bank \u00a31.9 billion for a data security breach.", "Current compliance processes must be reviewed by the financial institutions. Customer consented data can only be used for the consented purpose which means that any historic big data analytics example customer credit card spending data must be destroyed. Billions of dollars\u2019 worth of information will be lost. Therefore, financial institutions should re-look at the process of collecting data.", "Predictive modeling techniques in the future must be non-discriminating. Financial institutions must rework their algorithm and automation processes according to new GDPR guidelines.", "(Lahiri, 2017) states GDPR will modernize European data protection rules and a violation will be costly; 20 million euros or 4% of the turnover. (LeRoux, 2017) claims that GDPR's new regulation will be the killer of big data. (Woodie, 2017) confirms that GDPR's new amendments will make mandatory data handling processes, transparency regarding usage, and consumer-friendly privacy rules for the 743 million consumers in the EU.", "Data Privacy about sharing classified information leads to legal and commercial risk (Deutsche, 2014). Also, cross-linking heterogeneous data for re-identification of the individual is a privacy concern (Fhom, 2015). Therefore, the improper use of such sensitive data could have legal complications.", "A skilled workforce to interpret big data in high volume is also a big challenge because wrongly predicted outcomes could be very costly. Trained employees for big data technology is therefore vital as (Fhom, 2015) predicts that there will be a shortage of big data professionals.", "So, companies should plan training or hire a new employee before the implementation of big data projects. (McAfee et al., 2012) also advocates strong leadership, good company culture, willingness to adapt to new technology as key ingredients for big data success.", "The cost of constructing big data infrastructure is very costly in short term but will be giving a competitive advantage in the long run for the financial firms. Justification of time and money spent on big data (ROI) is not so transparent according to (Davenport, 2013). The firm\u2019s higher management are therefore betting on big data with a long-term strategy.", "To conclude, the different cases researched show a wide variety of Big Data technology being used and benefits such as storage reduction as in the case of Nasdaq & AWS RedShift and the resulting benefit storage reduction from 6PB to 500GB.", "From these case studies, we have found that the companies investigated all share committed importance and common goal towards the active use of big Data towards their own missions and objective. Between them, there are some commonalities e.g. more targeted marketing, and differences e.g. different types of technology employed for storage.", "By analyzing big data, industry players can enhance organizational efficiency, improve customer experience, increase revenue, improve margins, forecast risk better, and can find insight into entering new markets. (Yin et al., 2015) quotes big data improves operational efficiency by 18%.", "Similarly, (McAfee et al, 2012) states that companies which are data-driven make an average 5% to 6% more productivity as compared to their competitor in the market.
