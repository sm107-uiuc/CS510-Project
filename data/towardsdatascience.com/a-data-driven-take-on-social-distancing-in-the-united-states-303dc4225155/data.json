SafeGraph is providing free access to its various datasets to help researchers around the world with its response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus).

If you want to volunteer as a researcher, please sign up here.", "Please note that all the data provided by SafeGraph is privacy-safe and anonymized. To enhance privacy, SafeGraph excludes census block group information if fewer than five devices visited an establishment in a month from a given census block group.", "With COVID-19 rapidly spreading across the United States, it is important to look at mobility data to understand how people\u2019s behavior has changed as a response to the social distancing policies.", "In this post, I will provide some of the interesting insights I gathered from exploring the SafeGraph data.", "The daily Percent of Devices Completely Home is calculated using the metric device completely home from SafeGraph, which is an indicator that the device did not move throughout the day beyond ~100 square meters of its previous nighttime location. SafeGraph also clarifies \u2014 When we refer to \u201chome\u201d, we actually refer to the most common nighttime location in recent months identified to a precision of about 100 square meters. We do not know (or care to know) the precise home addresses of the anonymous devices.", "There is clear evidence that more people are staying at home and social distancing, however, the degree to which people are social distancing varies a lot by county, state, etc. (more discussion on this below).", "It also appears that the shift when more people started staying at home started right after March 13, 2020, the day the federal government declared COVID-19 a national emergency in the US.", "As expected, there is also clear evidence that people are traveling less. The median distance traveled from home also started to decrease after March 13, 2020.", "Stay at Home Index will be the metric I will be using in some of the following charts. I calculated this by looking at the difference in the Percent of Devices Completely Home during the first week of April compared to the first week in February (the baseline). 7-day averages were used to compute the final difference. A Stay at Home Index of 0.2 indicates that ~20% more devices were home during the first week of April compared to the first week of February (the baseline). The calculation of this metric was inspired by the Shelter in Place Index used by SafeGraph in their Shelter in Place dashboard.", "The top 5 states with the highest Stay at Home Indexes are New Jersey, Massachusets, Maryland, Rhode Island, and Connecticut. The bottom 5 states with the lowest Stay at Home Indexes are South Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Indiana, and New Mexico.", "Within states as well, there is a lot of variation in terms of how different counties practiced social distancing. More metropolitan and populated counties have higher Stay at Home Indexes (more on this below).", "Across most of these cities, people started staying at home after March 13. It is interesting to note that for some cities such as Phoenix, the official shelter-in-place order came as late as March 30, but the data shows that even in some of these cities people started to stay at home starting mid-March given the rampant spread of COVID-19.", "This shows that being able to stay home and work from home is a privilege for many. People in ZIP codes with a lower median household income were less likely to stay at home compared to those in ZIP codes with a higher median household income.", "Counties with a larger share of urban population were more likely to stay at home compared to counties with a larger share of rural population. The most densely populated counties and cities have shown to decrease travel the most dramatically.", "Interestingly, the people in counties with a larger share of Democratic voters in the 2016 Presidential Election were also more likely to stay at home than those in counties with a larger share of Republican voters. This ties in with the share of urban vs. rural populations in each county as well.", "As expected, a lot of these factors are likely to be intertwined and correlated, but the key thing to note is that the degree to which a community practices social distancing is determined by a lot of external factors. While more people are staying at home and traveling less across the country, the data shows that wealthier, urban workers are staying home the most while lower-income workers in rural areas don\u2019t always have that same luxury.", "Your home for data science.
