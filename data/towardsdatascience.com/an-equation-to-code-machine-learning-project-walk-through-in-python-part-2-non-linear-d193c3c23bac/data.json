This is \u201cEquation-to-Code\u201d walk-through part 3. This time", "In part 1, we talked about how to use linear regression to solve the linear separable problem. We learned vector representation, standardization, adding bias, sigmoid function, log-likelihood function, and updating parameters.", "This time we are gonna tackle a non-linear separable problem. If you haven\u2019t seen part 1, it is totally alright. Part 2 is self-contained. But if you want to get a better understanding of part 2, it would be better to read part 1 first.", "Here are the data and code.", "The content is structured as follows. * means you can skip this step if you already part 1.", "First, we need to plot this data to see how it looks like. We create a Python file and name it non_logistic_regression.py.", "After running the script above, you should see the figure below.", "It seems we cannot use one straight line to separate X and O. We call such a problem as the non-linear separable problem, where data is not linearly separable.", "In part 1, we use linear function to solve the linear separable problem.", "But for the non-linear separable problem, the linear function is too simple to handle. So we introduce polynomial logistic regression, which adds a polynomial tern in logistic regression.", "We use \u03b8 to represent the parameter. The \u03b8 mark in the left part means the function f(x) has the parameter theta. \u03b8 in the right part means there are two parameters. The last term is the polynomial term, which makes the model generalize for non-linear separable data.", "Notice that we have x1 and x2 two features in the non_linear_data.csv. We pick up x1 to as the polynomial term. So the function should become below form.", "In order to make training converge fast, we use standardization, also called z-score. We do it column-wise.", "We need to add a bias and polynomial term to construct the data matrix. We add a constant x0=1 in order to align the vector representation.", "You can find more vector representation detail in part 1: 3 The vector representation.", "In order to make the calculation more simple, we convert x to a matrix.", "We use x3 to represent the x1*x1.", "Then we will build a more powerful prediction function based on it, the sigmoid function.", "We use the z to represent the linear function and pass it to sigmoid function. The sigmoid function will give a probability for each data sample. We have two class in our data, one is 1 and another is 0.", "We can see the model predict the sample based on the linear function part.", "We can write the code below", "You can skip this step if you are not interested in the equation explanation or if you already read this in part 1", "Alright, we prepared our data, model (sigmoid), and what else do we need? Yes, a goal function. A goal function can guide us on how to update the parameter in the right way. As for the sigmoid (logistic regression), we usually use log likelihood as the goal function", "Wait, wait\u2026what the hell about these things!", "So we get the final part.", "Don\u2019t forget why we start this. A goal function can guide us how to update the parameter in the right way.", "We need to use this to calculate the loss to update the parameter. More specifically, we need to calculate the derivative of the log-likelihood function. Here I will directly give the final update equation. (If you are interested in how to get this equation, this video should be helpful)", "In step 6, the most important equation is this one. If you cannot understand how to get this, it is totally ok. All we need to do is to write it as real code.", "You can skip this step if you already read it in part 1", "This step is very important. Don\u2019t panic. We will crack it.", "Because we have three parameters, we can write it as three equations. We use x3 to represent the x1*x1.", "The := notation is just like =. You can find the explanation here.", "The most difficult part is the \u03a3 (summation symbol), so I expand the \u03a3 for better understanding.", "I colored the three parts in the equation because we can represent them as matrices. Look at the red and blue part in the first row where we update theta 0.", "We write the red part and blue part as column vectors.", "Because we have 20 data samples, so the dimension of f is (20,1). The dimension of x0 is (20,1). We can write matrix multiplication with transpose.", "The x1 and x2 is also column vector. And we can write to them as an X matrix.", "And theta is a row vector", "A Numpy array-like version might be easy to understand.", "Let\u2019s do a little calculation to make sure the dimension is right.", "Everything seems so right. Let\u2019s write the code. Actually, just two lines.", "Something strange? Remember what we write before the code?", "Actually, this is not real math notation, this is the Numpy notation. And if you are using TensorFlow or PyTroch, you should be familiar with it.", "(20,) means this is a 1-D array with 20 numbers. It can be a row vector or a column vector because it only has 1 dimension. If we set this as a 2-D array, like (20, 1) or (1, 20), we can easily determine that(20, 1) is a column vector and (1, 20) is a row vector.", "But why not explicitly set the dimension to eliminate ambiguity?", "Well. Believe me, I have the seam question when I first see this. But after some coding practice, I think I know the reason.", "Because it can save our time!", "Honestly, it is frustrating. Why we cannot complete these in just one step?", "Ok, let\u2019s take a look at how the numpy.dot() doc says.", "numpy.dot(): If a is an N-D array and b is a 1-D array, it is a sum product over the last axis of a and b.", "Hmm, actually I cannot get the point. But np.matmul() describes similar calculations with reshapes to (20,1) or (1,20) to perform standard 2d matrix product. Maybe we can get some inspiration.", "np.matmul(): If the first argument is 1-D, it is promoted to a matrix by prepending a 1 to its dimensions. After matrix multiplication the prepended 1 is removed.", "After updating the parameter 2000 times, we should plot the result to see the performance of our model.", "We will make some data points as x1, and calculate x2 based on the parameters we learned.", "In part 2, we use accuracy to evaluate how our model performance.", "Finally, we plot the accuracy line.", "We can see the line become steady after 1000 epochs.", "If you already have seen part 1, you should find part 2 is pretty easy to understand.
