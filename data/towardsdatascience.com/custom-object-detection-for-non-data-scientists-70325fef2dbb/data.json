TFRecords does, but in addition it is optimized for working with Tensorflow because it was created for Tensorflow, for example when you are working with a very large dataset and try to load it in memory, obviously you will not get it because you don\u2019t have memory RAM enought to do it, so you will have to work with batches, but if you use the the TFRecords you don\u2019t need works with
