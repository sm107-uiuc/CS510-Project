More commonly, most websites that are accessed, video games that are played, or even video\u2019s which are streamed involve some level of an API being utilized. As data scientist, we often use APIs to retrieve information such as stock prices, articles, or other types of information. More often than not, data scientists make HTTP requests which generally result in data being returned in the format of a JSON file.", "A representational state transfer (REST) type of API is an architectural style that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data (Figure #1). As users, we are often experienced with the client-side of an API when it comes to making an HTTP request using software such as Postman, or common Python libraries such as Requests. However, the underlying framework of how a APIs function remains a \u2018blackbox\u2019 to most Python developers. The purpose of this article is to explore this area by developing an API from scratch using the Flask framework.", "The main anatomy behind a REST API is composed of three key items: (1) the url& endpoint, (2) the method, and (3) the data. When a client makes an HTTP request against an API in order to retrieve data, the first item that must be designed is the URL. The URL generally encompasses the sites domain, a series of directory hierarchies, and finally the endpoint which generally follows the structure seen in Figure #2.", "There are four main methods that are generally used when making requests with a REST API: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. While these methods are mostly self-explanatory, the main takeaway is that data can be retrieved, added, or deleted from any given database using these methods. GET requests are the most common type of request mainly used to retrieve data from a server or database. POST requests are used to send data to an API in order to create or update an entry. Similarly to POST, PUT requests are used to send data to an API in order to create or update an entry, however, PUT requests are idempotent, meaning that the application of this method multiple times can be done without changing the final result. Finally, DELETE requests are used to delete certain entries within the database. Figure #3 below summarizes the main methods behind a REST API using a sample paraphrased command concerning each of the requests.", "Finally, the last item that makes up the API is the actual data to be queried which can range anywhere from small CSV files all the way to large relational databases. For the purposes of this article, I have created a database using Python\u2019s sqlite3 library by converting a sample CSV file.", "For the purposes of this article, we will be creating an API using a dataset of job postings concerning CS and Datascience positions. Let us now go ahead and create a database using the sqlite3 library. For the purposes of this article, we will stick to the sqlite3 library for simplicity, however, production-level databases should utilize MySQL or PostgreSQL for maximum efficiency both of which are readily available on cloud servers such as AWS. We begin with sqlite3 by creating a function that will allow us to create a new sqlite3 connection. The main objective here is to prepare a function that will create a new database file by creating a connection.", "With the database created, data can now be imported directly from a CSV.", "With both functions complete, we can now go ahead and execute these:", "This will result in the creation of a database filed called:", "With the main database file now created, we are now able to query data directly from the database using the API thus circumventing the use of the CSV. This allows for a faster and cleaner connection.", "The development of the back-end of a Flask application for an API is different than those of standard GUI-based web applications which most users are familiar with. The main difference, from a high-level view, can be summarized in figure #4. The main difference between the two is the shift in focus towards HTML and layout functionality for standard web applications as graphical user interface must be taken into account. On the other hand, the main focus within APIs concerns the routing and flow of information.", "We begin the process by defining our \u2018app\u2019 within the app.py file and creating a Flask application.", "We then must create a few functions that display data when certain routes are taken within the URL. Let us begin with a simple \u2018view all\u2019 function which displays all entries within the database. Please note that we are using the GET method as specified above.", "With this functionality enabled, end-users are now able to query all of the data within our database. This is not as problematic at the moment as the database contains no more than 1000 entries, however, this will be more problematic as the database grows and end users are required to wait long periods of time for the entire database to reach them. That said, part of the efficient design of any REST API is the ability to query data based on predetermined filers in order to query certain parts of the database. Given that the database consists of the columns \u2018id\u2019, \u2018datetime\u2019, \u2018country\u2019, and \u2018content\u2019, a \u2018best-designed\u2019 API will allow users to query data using the first three parameters. A function must be developed which allows for the data to be filtered using multiple endpoints by specifying either \u2018id\u2019, \u2018dateTime\u2019, or \u2018country\u2019. Please note that an an error 404 page not found is issued if none of the entries are specified.", "Finally, with all sections of the API now complete, the application can be run using Flask\u2019s run functionality.", "The three main end-points specified in the API allow users to query all data, or based on \u2018id, \u2018country\u2019, and \u2018datetime\u2019.", "For example, a user can query all data using:", "A user can also query data using one of the endpoints:", "With the API complete and functioning as anticipated, the next logical step is to deploy the application to a server. For the purposes of this tutorial, the API was \u2018deployed\u2019 locally using a local port. Some of the best options for deploying Flask-based applications include: AWS, Heroku, and PythonAnywhere. Having explored all three, I have personally found www.pythonanywhere.com to be the most user-friendly and cheapest of all three, with comprehensive documentation on the deployment process.", "In summary, a general overview of REST APIs was made in order to understand the main framework that governs this functionality. A SQL database was created in order to store our data of interest. Finally, an API was developed using the best practices of REST APIs using Flask allowing users to query data through multiple endpoints.", "For more information and access to the code, please visit my GitHub.", "Your home for data science.
