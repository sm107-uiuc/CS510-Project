However, even ML engineers who write these codes would rely on you in terms of visibility of how these engines are performing on the site. Additionally, the digital analytics team also influences the content placement and A/B testing of content (or different ML algorithms). So, some inherent knowledge of how recommendation engines actually work could be a valuable asset for you.", "The poster child for the advantages of a recommendation engine would companies like Amazon, Netflix, Tinder, etc. Your amazon homepage is the finest example of recommendations in practice. Rolling through the homepage you can find sections like \u2018Inspired by your shopping trends\u2019, \u2018Related to items you\u2019ve viewed\u2019 etc. all of them being powered by recommendation engines in the background. Recommendation engines are not just limited to presenting similar products on the eCommerce pages. The engines have a more profound use of presenting relevant and personal (right) content to the right customers at right time using the right channel.", "Beyond mapping products that were bought together, the use of recommenders can be extended to -", "Use cases for recommendation systems are not just limited to eCommerce but widely exist in domains like pharmaceuticals, finance, and Travel.", "Each of the techniques shown in the diagram may be used to build a recommender system model. Let\u2019s briefly explore the various recommendation engine categories.", "Content-based filtering, recommends items by comparing product attributes and customer profile attributes. The attributes of each product are represented as a set of tags or terms \u2014 typically the words that occur in a product description document. The customer profile is represented with the same terms and built by analyzing the content of products that have been seen or rated by the customer. Typically, the content-based filtering method provides a list of top N recommendations based on some similarity scores.", "Collaborative filtering filters information by using the recommendations of other people. Given a database of user ratings for products, where a set of users have rated a set of products, collaborative filtering algorithms can give ratings for products yet to be rated by a particular user. This leverages the neighborhood information of the user to provide such recommendations. The underlying premise of the collaborative filtering algorithm is that if two users agree on ratings for a large set of items, they may tend to agree for other items too.", "Collaborative filtering can be further classified into:", "Finally, Hybrid filtering is the system where we combine more than one type of recommendation system to come up with final recommendations.", "Singular-value decomposition approximation, most popular items, and SlopeOne are some other popular techniques that may be employed to build recommendation systems. Further learning on recommendation engines could be in the direction of exploring and studying these rarely-used techniques and applying them to real-world problems.", "For standalone implementation, both Python and R have packages that include the most popular recommendation techniques bundled together. Recommenderlab package in R is a one-stop-shop for building recommendation engines and provides awesome functionality to convert datasets into the required format and train/test ensemble of models. The recommender function contains the option to include parameters for different similarity scores that we want to choose.", "As an example for this article, we will take a more organic approach and try to implement a content-based recommendation for a news aggregator website.", "Consider the following use case -", "A news aggregator wants to solve the following problem: When a customer browses a particular article, what other articles should we suggest to him? The challenge is we don\u2019t have any information about customer preferences. We are either looking at the customer for the first time or we don\u2019t have any mechanism set up yet to capture customer interaction with our products/items.", "We will be pulling up data from a news aggregator dataset from UCI public repository.", "when a user is browsing a particular news article, we need to give him other news articles as recommendations, based on:", "Polarity identification algorithms use text mining to get the document's opinion. We will use one such algorithm to get the polarity of our texts.We need multiple similarity measures for this use case:", "Refer GitHub for the complete markdown of this project.", "Here is the break down of the code -", "The first part of the code (up to line 62) focusses on data wrangling, and then refining the dataset to contain only a fraction of data (for scaling down the project) and further focussing only on the top 100 publishers with the maximum number of articles.", "We use a bag-of-words representation of all article titles to measure their similarity scores. We use cosine distance as a similarity scoring measure because it is non-invariant to changes in the magnitude of values and will change if there are changes in the article.", "In this section, our aim is to filter the top 30 articles based on cosine similarity matches. So for example our current document is article ID 16947 titled \u201cUPDATE 1-Ukraine crisis worries hammer German investor morale\u201d by Reuters, then we pick up the top 30 matching articles based on cosine distance.", "We leverage sentimentr package in R to measure sentiments of the top articles that we have collected. A score of -1 indicates that the sentence has a very negative polarity. A score of 1 means that the sentence is very positive. A score of 0 refers to the neutral nature of the sentence.", "We also use publisher and category similarity from the current article by measuring it via the Jaccard index. The Jaccard index measures the similarity between two sets and is a ratio of the size of the intersection and the size of the union of the participating sets. Here we have only had two elements, one for publisher and one for the category, so our union is 2. The numerator, by adding the two Boolean variables, we get the intersection. We also calculate the absolute difference (Manhattan distance) in the polarity values between the articles in the search results and our search article. We do a min/max normalization of the difference score,", "Finally, we use these 3 scores to apply the fuzzy rule to the list and get rankings for our top 30 articles. Based on the interaction between the linguistic variables cosine, Jaccard, and polarity, the ranking linguistic variables are assigned different linguistic values. These interactions are defined as rules. Having defined the linguistic variables, linguistic values, and the membership function, we proceed to write down our fuzzy rules.", "This brings us to the end of our design and implementation of a simple fuzzy-induced content-based recommendation system.", "There is more to the story \u2014", "Part 2 \u2014 Customer Lifetime Value", "Your home for data science.
