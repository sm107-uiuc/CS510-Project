The customers have the right to cancel their subscription at any time, or, in some cases, downgrade to the free subscription model. On the other hand, companies want to keep their customers at the paid level.", "Usually, the customers who leave have some signs that they are about to do so. These signs differ from service to another; for example, for a telephone company, the leaving customers usually call the support more frequently, they submit some complaints, or they rarely use the service. These are some indicators that the company will lose this customer soon! In another type of services, say an online photo editing service, the signs of unsatisfaction include the frequent visit of some pages and topics like the downgrading FAQs, the contact us page, and the unusual frequency of visiting the help pages.", "The goal of the companies is to detect the customer\u2019s turnover decision before it happens, and hence, to contact him/her to give some discounts or other incentives to keep subscribing before the cost of maintaining them is way less than gaining a new customer.", "The loss of customers is called \u2018customer churn\u2019, or \u2018customer attrition\u2019 while keeping the customers and avoiding their leave is called \u2018customer retention\u2019.", "We have an example of a virtual company called \u2018Sparkify\u2019 who offers paid and free listening service, the customers can switch between either service, and they can cancel their subscription at any time.", "The given customers dataset is huge (12GB), thus the standard tools for analysis and machine learning will not be useful here as it will not fit in the computer\u2019s memory (even the data can fit in the memory of a 32GB computer, the analysis, and computations require way more than that amount, and the analysis will crash the system). The safe way to perform such analysis is to do it using Big Data tools like Apache Spark which is one of the fastest big data tools.", "The given dataset contains 18 fields, the fields include usedId, sessionID, subscription level, the visited page (the action made by the user like downgrade, upgrade, listened to next file, invited a friend, \u2026), a timestamp, user\u2019s gender, location, and name, in addition to some of the file\u2019s info like author , artist, and length.", "For this tutorial, we worked with only a 128MB slice of the original dataset.", "Data exploring (Exploratory data analysis, EDA)", "First, let\u2019s see the number of churn users.", "Then, explore the churn users by gender or by subscription.", "The free users are slightly more than the paid users, and the canceled free users almost the same ratio as the canceled paid users! it appears that the paid/free status is not influencing termination of the account. On the other hand, active males are more than females, and canceling males are higher than females too. Seems like males tend to cancel more than females; i.e. Gender seems to affect churn decision.", "Let\u2019s see when the churn users are most active", "The churn users are most active at the beginning of the month. Thus, most cancellation happens at the end of the month, which is logical to avoid renewal fees.", "Does the users\u2019 operating system affect their activity?", "Here we find that the happiest users are the iPad users (No cancelation), then those of the iPad.Most users who tend to churn are those who use Windows 8.x, Windows XP, and Linux. This may raise an issue about the software the customers use, is it as good and easy as the iPad and iPhone\u2019s software that makes the customers happy?", "There are many other features we explored, which is detailed in the GitHub page below.", "Creating or extracting possibly influencing features (Features engineering)", "After exploring the dataset and knowing the features to include, or those who need to be extracted from the existing data, we ended in the following set of possibly influencing features.", "Machine learning algorithms only deal with numeric values, hence, we should convert categoric features to numbers, for example, to give one gender a 1., and the other 0. If the feature contains unordered values, then we should encode them by the one-hot-encoding method, which involves creating a separate column to each value, with 1 or 0 to indicate if it applies or not.", "By finishing this operation, we have a new dataset for analysis, which is in the form of userID >> feature01, feature02, \u2026", "We have tested 5 machine learning model for classification to see which produces the highest accuracy. The used models are the Logistic Regression model, Decision Tree Classifier model, Gradient-Boosted Trees (GBTs) model, Random Forest model, Multilayer Perceptron Classifier model.", "As a final adjustment for the data, we have normalized all the input features and combined them into one vector. Then we divided the dataset into 80% for training the model, and 20% for testing.", "As we see in the table above, the accuracy of the logistic regression model is relatively good, 82% and 75% for the training and the testing datasets. the other measures like precision, recall, and F-score are slightly fewer than the accuracy values. This shows good performance of the model to detect churn customers. The attached chart shows the weight of each feature and its directional effect; for example, the submit_upgrade feature is an indicator that the customer is happy, and will not unsubscribe soon. Other important features for happy users are the number of songs they listen to (NextSong feature).", "On the other hand, the mean_session_hours and the frequency of visiting the Help , save_settings, and Homepages are indicators of unhappy customers that will churn soon.", "This model and all the tested classification models have a \u2018Features importance\u2019 output, which indicates that this feature influences the results more, regardless of whether it has a positive or negative effect. The features importance show that the most influencing feature is the days_total_subscription, which indicate an effect of the subscription length to the churn possibility. The second feature is the amount of thumbs_down , the Roll_advert, and the other shown features.", "This model appears to be very strict, as it neglects the effects of 31/37 features, while concentrates on 6 features only. However, despite that, the accuracy and other performance measures are very high on training and testing datasets.", "This model, has higher accuracy and performance measures on the training dataset than the previous two, but the results on the test dataset are worse, which means that the model overfits the data. The features\u2019 importance shows that the most important features are the NextSOng visits (number of songs played), which appear to be an indicator of satisfied customer, as well as the Thumbs_UP indicator. The Error page is the second runnerup here, which appears to indicate that the user is almost bored of errors, and will leave soon.", "This model, like the GBT before, has obvious overfitting, with very high training accuracy, and low testing accuracy. The random forest model agrees with the Decision Tree Classifier in the features\u2019 importance, as both show the most important indicators are the days_total_subscription and the Thumbs_Down while it agrees with the GBT on including all the features as important somehow. (Note that all the features that have less than 3% importance are collected in the MINOR category.)", "The machine learning modeling succeeded in predicting the customers' activity that will most probably end in unsubscribing. Despite the good results of all the models, the Decision Tree Classifier model appears to be the best here. However, the other models need to be re-adjusted using different settings to reduce the overfitting.", "Your home for data science.
