The effects novel research and innovation could have or are having in this field are often described in general and absolute terms. Partly, as a recent call from scientists working on AI and cancer care elucidates, this opacity owes to uncollaborative tendencies at a technical level. Clarity requires openness, to fact-check our own ideas and build on those first reached by others. Partly though, the opacity arises from other issues \u2014 recency bias, media concentration on the novelties or extreme capabilities and risks in the field, limited information on customer needs and constraints.", "To delineate noise and narratives from real problems and needs in enterprise AI, over the past several weeks I\u2019ve spoken to business units and technical experts at over twenty enterprises across industries like financial services, supply chain, agriculture, retail, and mobility/IoT. Below is a summary of a few trends that have emerged so far.", "The mantra that \u201cdata is the new oil\u201d has become wildly popular.", "Notions that every company must think of data as its paramount asset permeated many discovery conversations I\u2019ve had. But few enterprises have implemented preemptive strategies on what data is worth capturing, what quality is too suboptimal to keep, and whether there is such a thing as \u201ctoo much data.\u201d Most enterprises lack, and urgently need, a framework or dictionary of data to clarify what types and variables of data they have, how frequently the data is refreshed, who owns it, maintains it, modifies it, and so forth.", "Over an enterprise\u2019s lifecycle, these problems proliferate. As more data \u2014 like IoT or genomic\u2014 becomes available and incorporated by enterprises in these sectors, they must solve for added layers of data complexity. As they evolve and acquire other companies, they also absorb a whole new set of data warehouses, lakes, redundancies and anomalies.", "Without a clear strategy of what and how much data to capture, and more importantly specific explanations of why it\u2019s being captured and when it should be leveraged, an enterprise\u2019s AI capabilities are stifled. Their adoption of and utility from AI products and services in the company will be delayed significantly.", "2. The biggest AI needs remain the ones we heard about a few years ago.", "Although narratives on what segments of AI are exciting have changed over the past few years, the core needs for enterprises like insurers, banks, automotives, supply chain companies, retailers, and healthcare providers have remained largely the same \u2014 data hygiene, automation, and customer experience.", "A tremendous amount of enterprises struggle with ingesting, standardizing, and consequentially delivering data to solve for their business objectives. Data scientists internally continue to spend most of their time on these activities. Large quantities of data still need to be converted, labeled, enriched, and integrated. These data hygiene problems persist despite a wave of generalist startups (e.g. Trifacta, Vidado, and Hyperscience) that arose and grew in this market. And they persist despite those same enterprises, years ago, recognizing them as core roadblocks for AI. The preparation to be an AI-powered enterprise has proven to be a years-long, continuous journey.", "Automation \u2014 to augment human work rather than replace it \u2014 is emphasized as needed to continue growth in a post-pandemic environment and enable both feature parity and new product expansion faster than competitors. Some of the most common use cases, and startups who have recognized these areas and catered solutions to them, include: automated machine learning (e.g. DataRobot, Ople), image-based quality and cost judgments (e.g. Tractable, Cogniac), business process optimization through robotic process automation and mining (e.g. UIPath, Skan). Automation is also the AI category that is seeing the greatest need for more domain-specific applications, e.g. for claims (EvolutionIQ), drug discovery (QSimulate), talent acquisition (Censia), security (Obsidian), and so on.", "Finally, customer experience remains a center of AI focus for enterprises. Use cases I most commonly heard about include knowledge management and support in queues and call centers, chatbots and general support on transactions through NLP, and greater depth on customer grievances and growth needs.", "None of these needs and use cases are new knowledge. Instead, they\u2019re important reminders that AI problems don\u2019t vanish at enterprises just because well-funded startups have emerged, other areas in the field have gained media attention, and time has passed.", "3. There is a market for AI governance tools now, but its size in the U.S. is unclear.", "Narratives around responsible AI, ethical AI, explainability and transparency from the blackbox of AI, and AI governance have exploded in recent years.", "Several startups have arisen to address this market, including 2021, Arthur, Credo, Fiddler, and Parity. But adoption at enterprises that aren\u2019t consumer-facing software companies remains limited, and budgets largely unallocated toward solving or preventing these issues. Some of the questions and hesitations that came up in my conversations were:", "All of these questions will persist and need to be answered thoughtfully for this segment of AI to cross the bridge between hype and adoption. While specters of long-term risk and evocations of ethics sometimes resonate with enterprises \u2014 who are in the end just aggregations of employees unified toward a common set of commercial objectives \u2014 they must be coupled with other utility in order to attract large investments.", "4. Significant AI opportunities exist in improving organizational structure.", "One of the strongest signals of an enterprise\u2019s AI commitment is its organizational structure. But my conversations revealed that enterprises struggle with, and thus need support on, several structure-related questions:", "Some of these answers are now being provided in productized form. As some enterprises have moved from a paradigm of data and model prep to model production and management, MLOps \u2014 collaboration tools and practices connecting ML practitioners to operational teams like IT \u2014 has arisen as an important category of value. Startups like Verta, Cnvrg, and Valohai now offer alternatives to enterprises who historically have largely tried to build these systems in-house. Additionally, startups like FourthBrain and Cambridge Spark have emerged to catalyze AI upskilling for enterprises.", "The gravity of these organizational structure questions will continue to create large opportunities for collaboration for anyone who can help enterprises navigate through them. How these questions are answered will, over the long-term, determine which enterprises make the best use of their AI capabilities.", "The AI initiatives of Amazon, Google, Salesforce, IBM, Microsoft, Alibaba, and others, as well as media coverage on the newest risks or startup funding events, are useful to know but ultimately materially different from the AI questions and needs of less technology-first enterprises. Insurers, banks, automotives, supply chain companies, retailers, and healthcare providers are operating with different data, talent, and timelines. Their AI-related problems need significant strategic, manual, and services-based work before utilizing the growing suite of sophisticated AI products. They are afflicted by the same AI problems for years because those problems are monumental and growing.", "All of these conversations with enterprises on their AI needs crescendo with the realization that while we may already be in the golden age of AI, the vast majority of it lies ahead.", "Your home for data science.
