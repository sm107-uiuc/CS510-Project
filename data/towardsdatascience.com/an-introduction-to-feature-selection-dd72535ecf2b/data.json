Features that are present in our initial training data, but that might be introducing some kind of \u2018future\u2019 information into the model should be removed, as they will probably be biasing the results, and we will probably not have them available at execution time.", "This production time availability should be considered for every feature, not just the ones that might contain \u2018future\u2019 information. To make it crystal clear, lets see an example of one of these type of features:", "Example of \u2018future\u2019 feature: Imagine we are building an ML model to calculate the probability that a certain football team will win a match at half time, given some statistics for that match.", "For this, we have to train the model using data from previous complete matches (as we need to know if they have won or not at the end of the match; this would be the target of our model), however, we should only use features/variables that are taken from the first half of the match, as those are the features that we would have available at the execution time of the model.", "Also, if we used training data from lets say, minute 80, we would be introducing features into our model that would be biasing our \u2018half time\u2019 algorithm; aside from not actually having that variable truly available when we use the model.", "Alright, now that we know what feature selection is, lets see why we should use it when training a Machine Learning model:", "Example of \u2018abnormal\u2019 behaviour: Imagine we have built a model to predict the probability of certain hospital patients having heart disease, and suddenly it starts predicting that everybody is sick. This problem can be originated by some variable that is getting informed in a different way than it was in the training data.", "Maybe some porcentual value was given as decimal (0.75) in the training data and because a change in how IT manipulates this data, we are receiving it as an integer now (75, meaning 75%). This will obviously make our model behave weirdly, as it is expecting a number between 0 and 1 and its getting something completely different.", "If we have to go through 200 variables to see which one is causing the problem, we will have to work a lot more than if there is only 10 variables.", "There are many ways to do feature selection, and many of them are implicitly included in the data cleaning phase that any project should have previous to the construction of a model.", "The use of these kind of models for feature selection will be discussed in the next post. When using them, it is interesting to plot graphs like the following one:", "The previous graph shows the performance increase of a Machine Learning model as we add features in order of importance (the first model is trained using only one feature: the most important one. The second model is trained using the two most important features and so on\u2026)", "By using a graph like this we can decide where to cut, making a compromise between the performance of our model and the number of used features.", "To end, it is important to mention that feature selection is not the same as dimensionality reduction techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Dimensionality reduction techniques generally reduce the number of features of your data by combining the initial features to form new ones, whereas feature selection techniques select a subset from the initial set of features without modifying them.", "Feature selection is a very important step in the construction of Machine Learning models. It can speed up training time, make our models simpler, easier to debug, and reduce the time to market of Machine Learning products. The following video covers some of the main characteristics of Feature Selection mentioned in this post.", "Also, there are books on feature selection like which really go deep into the subject, in case you want to know A LOT more:", "That is all, I hope you liked the post.
