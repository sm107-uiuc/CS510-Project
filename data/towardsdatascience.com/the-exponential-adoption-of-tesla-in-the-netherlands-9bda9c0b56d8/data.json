The adoption of full-electric (lease) cars is actively supported by the Dutch government through tax incentives. Furthermore, the newest Model 3 is the first Tesla that is relatively friendly priced around 60k, instead of 100k+ EUR.", "To validate my observation I will explore an open data set that is available through the RDW. The RDW (Dutch Vehicle Authority) is responsible for the licensing of vehicles and they provide a daily updated data set of all licensed cars in the Netherlands.", "The CSV (about 7.7GB) is too big to import in a spreadsheet so we\u2019ll use Google\u2019s petabyte-scale data tool BigQuery to crunch the numbers.", "Because BigQuery limits manual CSV uploads to 10MB, we need to upload our file to a bucket in Cloud Storage first:", "Next, we create a new table in BigQuery by selecting the file in Cloud Storage, set a table name kentekens_2020, the schema settings auto-detect, the field delimiter comma and header rows to skip 1.", "In a few seconds the table is created and our data set is ready to explore. When we look at the details, there are 14.4 million rows waiting to be queried. According to the schema there are 64 columns. This means our table contains almost a billion fields (!). Each row represents a vehicle with a registered license plate.", "Since we only are interested in data about passenger cars, we get rid of all other categories by applying a filter on Voertuigsoort (Vehicle category). Let\u2019s group all cars by brand and count them.", "And the winner is\u2026 Volkswagen! To see how Tesla is ranking we can scroll down, but we can also visualise our results in Data Studio.", "There we are. We find Tesla at rank 29. If you look closely you will also spot \u2018Tesla Motors\u2019. This means we can\u2019t do an exact match in our brand filter. We want all brands that contain (lower or upper case) tesla.", "Now we count the percentage of Tesla vehicles compared to all passenger cars.", "In early 2020 almost 50k Tesla\u2019s are roaming the Dutch streets. This is about 0.5% of all passenger cars in Holland. These numbers don\u2019t impress me yet.", "To answer our initial question (is the amount of Tesla\u2019s on the Dutch roads growing exponentially?) we need to plot these numbers on a time frame. Therefore we use the column Datum_eerste_afgifte_Nederland, which gives us the date of the first registration of a specific car in the Netherlands.", "To exclude a lot of oldtimers from our data (the first cars were licensed even before the Great War, data quality alert!) we only look at data from 2008 and onwards. According to Wikipedia the first Tesla was delivered to Elon Musk personally that year.", "If we explore the results of this query in Data Studio we get a line chart that shows us the top (max 20) brands.", "As Tesla is nowhere to be found in the top 20, we have to set an include filter on the brand TESLA only to see the trend we expect to see.", "There! My observation that the amount of Tesla\u2019s on Dutch roads increased rapidly, seems validated by the data.", "The next step is to investigate the Dutch share in the global Tesla production supply. I\u2019ve found some numbers on Wikipedia and did some data cleaning, resulting in this small CSV, which I uploaded directly as a table to BigQuery:", "Now we can join these numbers with our own data.", "Watch the pink line. That is the percentage of Dutch Tesla\u2019s compared to the global production per year. 8.5 percent of all Tesla\u2019s produced in 2019 were licensed in the same year in the Netherlands. That\u2019s quite a share for such a small country!", "OK. Let\u2019s focus on the best selling models next and visualise the top 10 in Data Studio.", "Seems like the Model 3 is a best seller in the Netherlands. What about the other Tesla models? Any 2008 Tesla Roadsters out there?", "With 24 rows we have some cleaning to do, since Tesla doesn\u2019t have 24 different models out there. Let\u2019s also query models by date so we can search for our 2008 Roadster.", "The first Roadsters arrived in the Netherlands in Q4 2009. Those drivers were some true early adopters. Let\u2019s find out if the first four owners from that quarter still drive the same car!", "We have a winner! This bad boy (or girl) is still driving like it\u2019s 2009.", "What about the other Tesla\u2019s? Are they still licensed by the first owner? We\u2019ll find out.", "Turns out that Tesla owners are quite fond of their cars.", "Allright, wrapping up now. There is still a lot of data to play with, but I\u2019ll leave you with the development of Tesla catalog prices in the Netherlands (according to the RDW).", "Note: I am learning everyday, please feel free to add your remarks and suggestions in the comment section or contact me via LinkedIn.", "Your home for data science.
