We will be using the normal equation method for making this supervised machine learning model work. Where is linear regression used and how does it help us?", "Linear regression is used to predict prices, weather, stock prices, quality of items, sales, etc. It is a model useful for finding the correlation between the two factors, independent variables(used to make predictions) and the dependent variable(the values to be predicted). The key behind a good multiple linear regression model is a small cost function and I will be explaining what cost function is later in this article.", "We will be using the USA Housing data set. Using this data set we will be predicting the price of a house, given the features like average area income, average area house age, average area number of rooms, average area number of rooms, average area number of bedrooms and area population. Let\u2019s understand the math behind this simple algorithm and code it!", "The main equation to make predictions is:", "Here h(X) is the hypothesis or the function to get predicted values. \u03b80 is the intercept, \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83, \u03b84 and \u03b85 are the coefficients for the independent features x1, x2, x3, x4 and x5. We will assign x0 = 1 by convention. The coefficient is a relationship between the independent factor and dependent factor that determines the effect of the independent factor on the dependent factor. We will be using the above equation in its matrix form which I will be showing later.", "I have dropped the address feature column to work with continuous numerical values only for this model. The data set has a total of 5000 records and 6 feature columns. Now to split our data into training and testing, we will be first converting it from a pandas.core.frame.DataFrame to a numpy.ndarray and then use slicing to split it.", "After you are done with the conversion, shuffle the data using the numpy.random.shuffle function to make it random before slicing. For the split, I will be using 80% of the data(3750 records in this case) as training set and the rest 20%(1250 records in this case) as test set.", "Now that the split is done, we will need to further divide our training and testing set to independent variables and dependent variable. As you can see, the last column of the array is for price, we will again slice the array to assign all the feature columns except the last one to X train and X test and the last feature column to y train and y test since we have to predict the prices.", "At the beginning of this article, I told you that we will be assigning x0 = 1 by convention, so we will be appending an array of 1s as the first feature column of our X train and X test matrix. X matrix is also called the Design Matrix.", "Now if you remember, I told you about the coefficients \u03b81, \u03b82, \u03b83, \u03b84 and \u03b85, and the intercept \u03b80. We will now use the Normal Equation to find the \u03b8 vector which will help us determine the six values.", "To calculate the \u03b8 vector, we will be breaking down the normal equation into 2 parts and calculate it separately and once we are done with that we will combine it and get the total.", "var1 was the first part of the equation which was:", "var2 was the second part of the equation which was:", "Now that the two parts have been calculated, we can combine them to get the theta vector.", "So now that we found out the values for our intercept and coefficients, we will finally make the predictions using the hypothesis equation(which I had shown earlier) in its matrix form which is:", "Here the y vector shown is actually the predicted values\u2019 vector which we will use to determine how our model has performed.", "Now to evaluate how our model has performed, we will use the mean squared error or the cost function to evaluate. The smaller the error, the better the performance.", "The formula that I have just shown is the one we will be using and implementing on our testing data and predicted values. \u03b8 in J(\u03b8) is the \u03b8 vector which we had calculated, y hat is the predicted value and y is the actual value and both are at index i, where i is from i to n(testing sample size=1250).", "For linear regression, a highly suggested metric for measuring the model\u2019s performance is the R-squared score. It helps us understand how close the data is to the fitted regression line. The range of R-squared scores is from 0 to 1 where 1 is the best possible score but hard to achieve. The formula for R-squared is:", "Here y hat are the predicted values, y the actual y test value, y bar is the mean of y test and n is the sample size of testing set which in our case is 1250 records.", "We achieved a R-squared score of 0.9223931240402982 which is really good. This means that the model is able to explain 92.23% variability around the mean and considering the factor that we have a low mean squared error and a high R-squared score, we can say that our model has performed really well.", "I hope you found it informative!
