It can be applied anywhere, from forecasting sales for inventory planning to determine the impact of greenhouse gases on global temperatures to predicting crop yield based on rainfall.", "In this post, we\u2019ll go over what linear regression is, how it works, and create a machine learning model to predict the average life expectancy of a person based on a number of factors.", "According to Wikipedia, linear regression is a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. In simpler terms, it is the \u2018line of best fit\u2019 that represents a dataset.", "Below is an example of a line that best fits the data points. By creating a line of best fit, you can predict where future points may be and identify outliers. For example, assume that this graph represents the price of diamonds based on weight. If we look at the red dot, we can see that this particular diamond is overvalued because it costs much more given the same weight as other diamonds. Similarly, the green dot is undervalued because it costs much less than other diamonds with similar weights.", "So how do you find the line of best fit? Let\u2019s find out.", "We\u2019re going to focus on simple linear regression. The line of best fit, or the equation that represents the data, is found by minimizing the squared distance between the points and the line of best fit, also called the squared error.", "To give an example, there are two \u2018line of best fits\u2019 shown above, the red line and the green line. Notice how the error (the green lines between the line of best fit and the plots) is much greater than the red line. The goal of regression is to find an equation in which the sum of the errors is minimized.", "If you want to know the math behind it, you can watch Khan Academy\u2019s videos here, where they find the partial derivatives of m and b.", "If you want to use simple linear regression, you can use the LinearRegression class from the scikit-learn library.", "Simple linear regression is useful when you want to find an equation that represents two variables, the independent variable (x) and the dependent variable (y). But what if you have many independent variables? For example, the price of a car is probably based on multiple factors, like its horsepower, the size of the car, and the value of the brand itself.", "This is when multiple regression comes in. Multiple regression is used to explain the relationship between a dependent variable and more than one independent variable.", "The image below shows a plot between income (y) and seniority and years of education (x). When there are two independent variables, a plane of best fit is found instead of a line of best fit.", "What if you had a set of data where its line of best fit is not linear (like the image below). This is when you would want to use polynomial regression. Using Wikipedia again, it\u2019s defined as a form of regression analysis in which the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y are modeled as an nth degree polynomial in x. In simpler terms, it fits a non-linear relationship between x and y.", "When you want to use polynomial regression, a few extra lines of code are needed:", "To demonstrate how to build a regression model in Python, I used the \u2018Life Expectancy (WHO) dataset on Kaggle here. My goal was to create a model that could predict the average life expectancy of a person in a given country on a given year based on a number of variables. Keep in mind that this is a very basic model \u2014 my next post will go through different methods to improve a regression model.", "In terms of prepping the data, I more or less followed the steps that I laid out in my EDA blog posts.", "There are a couple of new topics that I introduced in this model, like converting categorical data (countries) into dummy variables and evaluating the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) of all variables. Again, I\u2019m going to go through all of these new topics in my next blog post.", "One thing that I wanted to share was the correlation heatmap because there are some really interesting correlations here:", "After cleaning the data, I executed the code above to create my polynomial multiple regression model with an MAE of 8.22 and a range of 44.4. In my next blog post, I\u2019ll actually introduce several methods to improve a regression model (also applicable to most machine learning models) using the same dataset that I used here.", "Your home for data science.
