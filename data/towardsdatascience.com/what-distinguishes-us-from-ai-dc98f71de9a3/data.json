Breakthroughs in artificial\u2026 | by Vladimir Bok | Towards Data Science", "h1": "What Distinguishes Us from AI?", "description": "Humankind has sought to cast itself as distinct from the rest of creation. Yet, the advent of AI systems capable of emulating our intelligence complicates the the belief in our unrivaled intellect."}, "outgoing_paragraph_urls": [], "all_paragraphs": ["The belief in our distinctiveness is central to human self-understanding; however, time and again, what was seen as our distinguishing attribute has proven to be a mirage.", "For millennia, humans have asserted themselves as superior to other living forms. From Mesopotamia to China, the mythologies of ancient civilizations traced humankind\u2019s origin to divine creation. Religious doctrines have echoed and solidified this sentiment. In the Bible and the Qur\u2019an, humans are portrayed as divinely ordained to have dominion over all creation. Even in Buddhism, where all things living are connected in an endless cycle of reincarnation, only a human can attain enlightenment.", "Scientific breakthroughs challenged this worldview. Charles Darwin\u2019s Origin of Species and the discovery of the genome relegated humankind to nothing more than a branch on a shared evolutionary tree. However, echoing our yearning for distinctiveness, science identified an entirely new set of features that restored humankind to our imagined state of primacy. Among the many attributes posited as unique to humans are abstract reasoning, language, complex social structures, and the use of tools. Granted, there are exceptions to these rules. Over time, we observed that some animals do use tools, communicate in complex ways, and organize in social structures that resemble early human communities. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that these capacities in humans far exceed our animal peers. No other species has built a cathedral, harnessed the power of steam, or sent one of its own to the Moon.", "Our ancestors looked to the heavens and sought validation in a divine origin; thanks to science, we need look no further than the insides of our skulls for reassurance of our distinctiveness. Yet, even that notion has begun to crumble with the advent of artificial systems capable of emulating our intelligence.", "Algorithms help us search for information, answer our questions, and perform complex calculations at speeds that even the smartest among us cannot dream of matching. Machines have beaten our best players in games ranging from checkers and chess to Go and Jeopardy. \u201cI, for one, welcome our new computer overlords,\u201d Jeopardy champion Ken Jennings wrote under his final response as IBM\u2019s supercomputer Watson triumphed over him and another flesh-and-bone contestant.", "Jennings\u2019s subservience may be premature. Despite the remarkable progress in artificial intelligence, the world of sentient supercomputers with the aptitude \u2014 let alone the ambition \u2014 to be our overlords remains the stuff of science fiction. Even the smartest of present-day machines are often incapable of performing more than a single task. IBM\u2019s Watson can answer virtually any question on Jeopardy but it is unable to, say, give relationship advice. Even the complex systems that will one day drive our cars will, in all likelihood, be capable of doing only that. Moreover, there are many tasks \u2014 such as the ability to engage in a coherent dialogue \u2014 that even single-use AI systems have yet to master.", "However, given the rapid pace of advance in deep learning and AI, it seems only a matter of time until computers exceed all our mental faculties. It started with chess. Mastering this ancient board game requires the type of intellect long considered exclusive to humans: logical reasoning, strategic thinking, and foresight. On May 11, 1997, the IBM supercomputer Deep Blue vanquished the world\u2019s reigning chess champion, Garry Kasparov, in a six-game match. In doing so, Deep Blue humbled not only the player but also our belief in the unassailability of the human mind.", "The game of Go was next. With an average of 200 possible moves per turn, Go\u2019s complexity dwarfs that of chess, which has only 20 possible moves per an average turn.\u00b9 In total, Go is estimated to have more board configurations than the number of atoms in the universe. Mastery of Go requires a level of reasoning far beyond brute number-crunching \u2014 but not beyond the capabilities of artificial game-playing minds. In 2016, Google\u2019s AlphaGo stunned the world by defeating the Go champion Lee Sedol. Although Deep Blue and AlphaGo are instances of narrow, single-task AI systems, their triumphs indicate the futility of carving out a niche where human intellect would retain a lasting advantage.", "As it becomes clear that there is no intellectual task computers are unlikely to one day master, it is tempting to seek solace in our ability to create art. Many believe that art embodies intangible qualities that only humans are capable of expressing. \u201cAI has no internal world, and it has no need to create its desires or fears,\u201d argues Romy Lorenz, a cognitive neuroscientist, in her BBC interview about computer creativity.\u00b2 It is hard to imagine that a breathless machine \u2014 no matter how sophisticated \u2014 would create a masterpiece as captivating as, say, Michelangelo\u2019s frescoes in the Sistine Chapel. Yet, the belief that artistic creativity is exclusive to humans may, in time, prove as wishful as the scenes of divine creation the frescoes depict.", "A growing body of evidence suggests that machines can internalize even the seemingly intangible aspects of human artworks, heralding a future in which independent artificial systems match our artistic expression. A telling indication is machines\u2019 capacity for artistic style transfer. Artistic style is the set of features that characterize a particular artist or art movement. It refers to how something is portrayed, rather than what the subject matter is. Style is what distinguishes Claude Monet\u2019s work (which eschews lines and contours in favor of free brushstrokes) from the precise, academic realism that characterized Neoclassicism. \u201cStyle transfer\u201d refers to rendering an image in the style of another \u2014 such as taking one of Monet\u2019s paintings and making it indistinguishable from the exacting aesthetic of Neoclassical artworks.", "Any talented human artist is capable of style transfer. She would study a given artist\u2019s signature style and then paint the subject matter of another\u2019s artwork in that aesthetic. However, it is not something we would expect an artificial system to accomplish easily. Unlike chess or Go, there is no clear objective to achieve. A canvas lacks the constraints of a chessboard or the 19\u00d719 grid on which Go is played. Style transfer requires reasoning about the stylistic hallmarks of one artist (as separate from the content of a given painting), and the content of another\u2019s artwork (as distinct from its stylistic elements). It is hard to imagine that the cold, mathematical processes that underpin all of machine intelligence would be capable of the requisite abstract insight about something as intangible art.", "Yet, that is precisely what the German researchers Leon A. Gatys, Alexander S. Ecker, and Matthias Bethg accomplished. In their 2015 paper \u201cA Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style,\u201d\u00b3 Gatys and his colleagues present a technique that employs deep neural networks to disentangle the style representation of an image from its content. To demonstrate its effectiveness, they apply the technique to separate the content and style of two arbitrary images and then recombine them into a third image, one that renders the content of the first image in the style of the second.", "The following figure (taken directly from Gatys et al.) shows the content of the photograph in the top left corner in the style of five iconic masterpieces: The Shipwreck of the Minotaur by J. M. W. Turner (1805); The Starry Night by Vincent Van Gogh (1889); The Scream by Edvard Munch (1893); Seated Nude by Pablo Picasso (1910.); Composition VII by Wassily Kandinsky (1913).", "Each of the synthesized artworks is a convincing rendering of the photograph in the corresponding painting\u2019s style. The marked stylistic differences among the canvases attest to the technique\u2019s generalizability to capture the style representation of any artwork. In effect, Gatys and his colleagues demonstrate that artistic style can be internalized by an algorithm, so much so that it can be applied independently from a painting\u2019s content.", "Gatys et al.\u2019s methodology is as thought-provoking as the results they achieved. Rather than designing and training a special-purpose AI model to accomplish their objective, Gatys and his colleagues used computational by-products of an existing object recognition network. They observed that as it trains to classify items, the model learns to distill out the structural elements that comprise the subject matter of an image, separating them from the elements that constitute the image\u2019s appearance. The representations of content and style can then be disentangled and manipulated independently.", "Gatys et al. speculate that the ability to separate style from content is an important hallmark of not only machine image recognition but also biological vision.\u2074 Our ability to identify an object is invariant to the particulars of its appearance. Our eyes and brains can recognize an item regardless of lighting conditions, weather, time of day, and countless other factors. A rose is a rose is a rose, to borrow Gertrude Stein\u2019s famous phrase, irrespective of whether it is nighttime, daytime, summer, or spring \u2014 or even whether the rose is painted. The ability to abstract variations in style while preserving object identity is a remarkably practical feature of any object-recognition system, biological or artificial. Gatys and his colleagues cite compelling, albeit indirect, evidence that our visual cortex may indeed perform computations analogous to the method they present.\u2075", "Jennings\u2019s subservience to computer overlords may yet prove eerily prescient. In what would be one of history\u2019s bitterest ironies, machines would be free from the kind of existential soul-searching that plagued humankind for millennia: There would be no doubt about what makes them distinct. Science robbed us of the illusion of divine creation; to our AI overlords, we would be the creators. If not in its origin, humankind may become divine in its undoing.", "Your home for data science.
