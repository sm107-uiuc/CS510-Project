Do you want to automate all these boring stuff and focus on the more creative ones? Automated Operation and Maintenance\u2019s value comes from the elimination of manual and repetitive tasks using tools and platforms to automate a process that was once a manual one, such as patching, configuration, and deployment, etc.", "Before learning about automated operations, let\u2019s go back to the starting point and see what operations are. Operation and maintenance should include the following:", "Automated operation and maintenance should also include the above six categories. In practice, we will focus on three automation. First, automated environment definition; Second, automated deployment; Third, automated monitoring.", "The first phase of automated operation and maintenance is operational automation. In this phase, we connect a series of manually performed operations in daily routine with scripts or tools. The simplest example is to put multiple shell scripts together to perform a specific operation. This level of automation only solves part of the problems of manual execution, because once the operating conditions have changed, the shell script may have to be changed, the operation and maintenance pressure is still very large, and error-prone. The more servers and systems you manage, the greater the probability of errors.", "The second phase of automated operation and maintenance is scenario automation. At this level, the automation tool will judge how to run according to the external environment, and these judgment conditions are predefined. This level of operation and maintenance system requires various types of environmental data to make judgments, and it also needs to be able to operate according to changes, such as different execution steps. Therefore, this level of operation and maintenance system needs to interface with many other systems, such as configuration systems, network management systems, etc., it is best to have a process engine as well.", "The third phase of automated operations is an artificial intelligence operation, so-called AIOps. This level of operation and maintenance system has a data core, with the ability to analyze and judge itself based on the data and to make decisions and execute itself. The main work of this level of operation and maintenance is to add analysis strategies to the system, operate and maintain this intelligent operation and maintenance system, and intervene to make manual judgments on key nodes of the system.", "The value of automated operation and maintenance is to separate operation and maintenance from tedious, routine, and human accident-prone work, and to do the more valuable business operation and maintenance and service operation and maintenance. From this perspective, automated operation and maintenance are neither the starting point nor the end. Automatic operation and maintenance is not a panacea. How to build your automation system depends on what kind of services your business supports. Automatic operation and maintenance are, after all, just an advanced tool. The value of operation and maintenance is ultimately reflected in the business, and the way to achieve it is operation servitization (or Operation as a Service). Therefore, the goal of operation and maintenance automation is to get rid of all humans intervene, and achieve a level that we can make operation and maintenance convenient as a service.", "Next, we will introduce the architecture of automated operation and maintenance. The contents of this section mainly include the objectives of the automated operation and maintenance system, the overview of the automated operation and maintenance system architecture, and principles for the construction of the automated operation and maintenance system architecture.", "First, let\u2019s look at the goals of the automated operation and maintenance system. We can summarize the objectives to build a set of automated operation and maintenance system in four words:", "The core of the automated operation and maintenance system is the automated operation and maintenance management platform. The other modules may be slightly different according to the business situation. Typical modules include automated security inspection systems, automated update systems, automated data analysis and data backup systems, and automated monitoring and alarm systems. The automatic update system is divided into the server-side update system and client-side update system. Between the various modules, the automated operation and maintenance platform will provide low-level support for the automated security inspection system and the automated update system; the automated data analysis system and the automated update system will be interconnected, and the automated data analysis system will give feedback on the results of the automated update system.", "The automated operation and maintenance system is systematic engineering, planning, and construction idea. There are several principles for your reference.", "Small and medium-sized companies do not need a sophisticated but huge system. If the system is designed from the beginning to be very large and features are very rich, it may lead to some situations that cannot be controlled. This system may not work in the end because the coupling is too strong, the development cannot be controlled, or the project is stranded because of funding issues. But if the goal from the beginning is to solve some specific problems and be targeted, then it will be easier to advance.", "The second is to consider scalability. When designing the system, there may not be so many functions or design considerations, but it is necessary to consider whether the system can still support when the number of servers expands relatively. For example, whether the system can be used on the order of 10 to 100 or thousands servers.", "In many cases, there may already be more mature protocols and tools on the market. Evaluate them to see if they can be used in your production environment. If you can use it directly, there is no need to make another set by yourself. This set of tools you have made yourself has not been verified in many aspects and may cause security problems. Doing them based on mature protocols and frameworks can improve efficiency and ensure stability and security.", "First, let\u2019s understand one concept: Monitoring is the core of automated operation and maintenance. The main factor influencing the efficiency of operation and maintenance work is the response speed. Operation and maintenance personnel need to stare at the alarm page continuously and then notify the corresponding personnel to handle the alarms. In the production system, we need to regard the status monitoring of the servers as the core issue of automated operation and maintenance. Monitoring is used to drive the initiation, processing, and termination of operation and maintenance events. ElkStack Zabbix and Zabbix-Agent obtain the daily working status and service information of the server and generate time series statistical graphs for analysis of results.", "Through accurate and effective alarm strategies, professional people can do professional things. The production system can send alarms through email, WeChat, and SMS, and can timely notify the corresponding personnel according to the type of faults and impact level, and can escalate the event according to SLA. Some operation and maintenance systems are developed for WeChat platforms, which can provide more functions, such as handling problems through the template. For example, when the server\u2019s disk utilization reaches 90%, the alarm will be notified to the corresponding processing staff. At this time, the processing staff can select from WeChat and operate the corresponding garbage removal template, data repair template, and removal of historical log templates, etc., that can be used for clearing operations. Such a model naturally greatly improves operation and maintenance efficiency.", "Templated deployment is an indispensable tool for automated operation and maintenance. For the operation and maintenance engineers, the load of the maintenance of the server in the true sense is not heavy, and the real burden is the deployment of the environment. Sometimes the deployment of the environment will occupy more than 80% of the time of the operation and maintenance engineers. Due to the different versions of the operating system, manual and random initialization of the system environment, and the update of different software package versions, a series of problems will cause engineers to have a variety of strange problems when deploying operation and maintenance tools or company products. A template describes how to deploy a set of resources and install the required software. Templates specify the resources to use, the attributes to set, and the parameters required for the automatic deployment of a specific application. Then you can automatically create and configure all resources in the template using the orchestration engine to simplify deployment and O&M.", "Next, we look at several automated operation and maintenance frameworks and tools. There are three mainstream tools in the industry: Ansible, SaltStack, and Puppet.", "Ansible is developed based on Python. It cannot deploy in batches. The modules that ansible runs are deployed in batches. Ansible provides a framework, the main modules include connection plugins, multi-tasking plugin playbook, and so on.", "SaltStack is a centralized management platform for server infrastructure, with configuration management, remote execution, and monitoring functions. SaltStack is based on Python and combines lightweight message queues with Python 3rd party modules. Functions that can be achieved by deploying the SaltStack environment include batch execution of commands on thousands of servers, and centralized configuration management, file distribution, server data collection, operating system foundation, and software package management based on different business characteristics.", "Puppet is a centralized configuration management system for the Linux Unix platform; it is based on the C/S architecture and developed in Ruby language. It can manage configuration files, users, cron tasks, software packages, system services, etc. Puppet refers to these system entities as resources, and its design goals are to simplify the management of these resources and properly handle the dependencies between resources. Puppet is a C/S-based configuration management tool. Puppet-Server is installed on a central server, and client software is installed on target hosts that need to be managed. When the client connects to puppet-master, the configuration file on the puppet master is compiled and then run on the client.", "Finally, let\u2019s summarize. First, we introduced the scope of automated operation and maintenance including three automation, environment automation, deployment automation, and monitoring automation. Next, we introduced the three phases of automated operation and maintenance, namely operation automation, scenario automation, and artificial intelligence operations. We also introduced the value of automated operation and maintenance. It is separating operation and maintenance from tedious, routine, and human-prone tasks, and doing more valuable business operation and maintenance and service operation and maintenance.", "We then introduced the objectives of the automated operation and maintenance system. We can summarize them in four words: completeness, simplicity, efficiency, and security. Next, we introduced the overview architecture of the automated operation and maintenance system. The automatic operation and maintenance management platform is the core of the entire system. Other typical modules are automatic security inspection system, automatic update system, automatic data analysis and data backup system, and automatic monitoring and alarm system. Next, we introduced the principles of the construction of an automated operation and maintenance system. There are three principles: gradual progress, consider scalability, and pragmatic purposes.", "In the last section, we introduced a concept: Monitoring is the core concept of automated operation and maintenance, and response speed is a major factor that determines the efficiency of operation and maintenance. Effective monitoring methods can improve the response speed and the efficiency of operation and maintenance. We introduced templated deployment, which is an indispensable tool for automated operation and maintenance. Finally, we introduced several tools for automated operation and maintenance, namely Ansible, SaltStack, and Puppet.", "Wow, that\u2019s a lot of stuff above, feel exhausted, right? I feel the same too. After my over five years of experience in operation and maintenance, I found a solution: Serverless! What is that? That is running your applications without operating and managing your servers! This is the process from HumanOps to AutoOps to NoOps. you outsource all the operation and maintenance jobs to the best of the best engineers in this world, all of these are managed by the public cloud service providers, who have already built many automation tools to operate their network and now they sell the service to others. This is the era of serverless.", "Your home for data science.
