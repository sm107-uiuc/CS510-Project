In every corner, there is a micro kitchen and entertainment with fun themes which are featured so many times by Vloggers. I waited until the interviewer came up. He introduced himself as the hiring manager and we found a room with an interesting oddly shaped whiteboard and tall wood tables.", "The interview went really well \u2014 it was just like a conversation with a friend with a little bit more understanding about myself and the interviewers. Although there were the tough technical and coding questions, the process was fun and thankfully, filled with smiles.", "Once I passed the technical and hiring manager interviews, I was assigned interviews with the big guns: the senior director and global lead. I smiled as much as possible and confidently articulated my thoughts for multiple behavioral and hypothetical questions.", "A few months later, I received the offer and accepted it the week after. I was elated that I finally could call myself a Data Analyst (Machine Learning) at Google.", "Such was the process I had in my latest job interview and similarly, other big data companies.", "In this blog, I will give you tips on how you can ace the data analysts/scientists interview from big companies such as Google, Gojek, Visa, banks, etc. I created this blog to answer the repeating questions from my juniors on how to ace the tough data interview for big companies.", "As a disclaimer, I won\u2019t expose the specific questions from specific companies due to the blogging policy. But I will generalize my best so that you could still learn from my experiences. If you want to know more specifically on How Google hires, there is a good book by Lazslo Bock.", "In most interviews, you will encounter three types of interview questions: technical, behavioral, and hypothetical.", "This is usually the first or second round to ensure that you can fulfill the bare requirements of the technical expertise before you interview with the hiring managers and their supervisors", "You will be presented with tables of columns of dates, strings, and numbers. Based on this, you need to find the aggregated number of years, or certain categories (such as age range or places, etc) using SQL languages.", "To approach these questions I suggest you to :", "Most likely, you will also receive some questions to join tables (inner join, outer join) with an understanding of aggregations and their filters (group by and having). Refer to the following image.", "At this point of time, if you forget the syntax, be honest with the interviewers. Write down whatever you know and move on. Most likely your interviewers will know that despite your thorough understandings of SQL joins, you could always google the syntax up. If you make mistakes, do not let them stop you. Forget it, smile, and move on.", "Your interviewer will move on to some coding questions. This could be anything such as how you sort a certain 2 D array or even how you search for certain patterns within strings of words or even aggregating data using Pandas and Python.", "Similarly, to answer this we need to start with:", "Overall, I found CS Dojo and Devpost useful to ace the technical interview. Please check them out.", "This is the types of questions where your interviewers want to know about your biggest achievements and how you solve problems and conflicts.", "What are some of the data projects that you worked before.", "This is the chance for you to shine. As an aspiring data analyst/scientist, most of you should have a few portfolios to brag about. If you have Github Projects, deploy and showcase some of the applications you build. If you write blogs on Medium like I do, showcase your most popular projects and demonstrate your high visitor traffics. Whatever projects you have, focus on giving metrics which exhibits your skills and confidence.", "Let me give you an example", "\u201cat Visa I have worked in extracting client key reports for clients (acquirers and issuers). These are the key information which are managed as a part of authorization process that Visa has to ensure secure transaction channels. As a result, the users can now generate the reportings through their own portal with 43% time saved. I also mentioned my project from Lazada to use clusterings and features engineering to find important seller features then relate them to how I could contribute for the role.\u201d", "Make sure that you could highlight your projects and specify how this is relevant to the job you are applying into.", "These are a few questions which your interviewers will use to understand your reactions or train of thoughts specific to the role you applied. Your goal here is to guide the interviewers through your key actions in a structured and rational manner.", "If we find some vulnerabilities on <product> but there are denials from the product manager or higher ups. How would you react?", "This is a tough question, but companies would want to see how you handle tough situations and able to execute \u201cthe right path\u201d rather than \u201cthe easy path\u201d.", "These are the few questions that you should ask:", "Once you know the problem, then you could argue your findings by using data-driven decision making.", "By highlighting your thoughts with questions and structured answers, you will impress your interviewers.", "How would you design machine learning models for <insert tasks>?", "This is the case where you are tested with your understandings of modeling for a certain task. Generally, in this case, you could:", "One of the main reasons why I could have fun is that I prepared. I went through many different prep questions and constantly bother my friends and girlfriend to help listen to my pitch. They have given me so much feedback which I could gladly reflect to the hiring manager. Similarly, you should spend time to prepare as much as possible.", "By the end of the day, your interviewers are your friends. Just relax and be outspoken. Listen more and have fun. I was having fun as I could share my main career experiences. From my conversations with the hiring managers, I learned more about the role than how they learned from you, which is a very satisfying feeling.", "After your interviews, reflect on the process for 5 minutes. Take note of what went well or what went wrong. If you are a believer like me, pray and give thanks for the valuable experiences. No matter what happens next, you would be able to bring your aspirations and skills into the next level. So far, I have been rejected 3 times at Google and only with God\u2019s grace that I could finally be accepted. I had fun and gratitude.", "Overall, I sincerely hope this experience of mine would help you ace your Data Analytics job interviews. All the best and may God Bless You.", "I really hope this has been a great read and a source of inspiration for you to develop and innovate.", "Please Comment out below for suggestions and feedback. Just like you, I am still learning how to become a better Data Scientist and Engineer. Please help me improve so that I could help you better in my subsequent article releases.", "Thank you and Happy coding :)", "Vincent Tatan is a Data and Technology enthusiast with relevant working experiences from Google LLC, Visa Inc. and Lazada to implement microservice architectures, business intelligence, and analytics pipeline projects.", "Vincent is a native Indonesian with a record of accomplishments in problem-solving with strengths in Full Stack Development, Data Analytics, and Strategic Planning.", "He has been actively consulting SMU BI & Analytics Club, guiding aspiring data scientists and engineers from various backgrounds, and opening up his expertise for businesses to develop their products .", "Vincent also opens up his 1 on 1 mentorship service on BestTop to coach how you can land your dream Data Analyst/Engineer Job at Google, Visa or other large tech companies. book your appointment with him here if you are looking for mentorship.", "Lastly, please reach out to Vincent via LinkedIn, Medium or Youtube Channel", "Your home for data science.
