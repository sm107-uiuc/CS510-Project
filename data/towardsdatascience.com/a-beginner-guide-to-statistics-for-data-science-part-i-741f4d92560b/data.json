Why do we need Statistics? How to do data analysis using statistics? What is a population? Why we have samples? \u2026\u2026.and the list goes on. Well, these are some of the very few questions any beginner will ask when first trying to jump into the field. In this post and the coming ones, I will be explaining the basic concepts of statistics in a super-easy way. So stay tuned!!", "As per Wikipedia, \u201cStatistics is a mathematical science pertaining to the collection, analysis, interpretation, and presentation of data.\u201d", "It is a science of learning and making decisions from the data. Nothing more nothing less.", "We are living in the Digital Age where at each point, we are generating data i.e. information. Much of this information was interpreted mathematically by using statistics. For example, if you search the average height of an Indian in google it will say 5 feet. How? Do you think they asked every one of the whole 1.33 billion people? Well, it\u2019s hard to ask(considering time, money, and resources)\u2026.Then how come they say that the average height of Indians is 5 feet. It\u2019s all because of Statistics and its various methods that interpret the population of interest.", "Statistics provides tools to understand the data much better. When used correctly, statistics tell us any trends in what happened in the past and can be useful in predicting what may happen in the future.", "The first and foremost thing in statistics is to understand what of population and Sample and what\u2019s the difference between both of them.", "Usually, Statistics is divided into 2 parts:", "2. Inferential Statistics: It is the part of statistics that draws conclusions about the population parameters such as mean, mode, median based on the sample taken from the population. It is, therefore, important that the sample accurately represents the population. It includes sampling and hypothesis testing. For example, you have data of 100 students score studying physics. You want to conclude scores of all of the students studying physics in a city, Inferential statistic helps you to achieve this.", "It is the average of all the data points. If you have n data points x1,x2,x3,\u2026,xn then the mean of the data will be", "x\u0305 (x-bar) represents the Sample Mean in Statistic.The above formula can also be represented using a Greek Symbol \u03a3(sigma)", "Similarly, when we calculate the average of the whole population of size N, it is called a Population Mean and is represented by \u03bc(mu)", "It is the value that separates the higher half from the lower half of the data sample. It is the midpoint of the data when sorted.", "To calculate the mean of n data points, simply sort the data and find the middle element. There can be 2 different cases:", "The main advantage of using the median in describing data as compared to mean is for skewed data(data where outliers are present, Outliers refer to the values distinct from the majority of the observations. These occur either naturally, due to equipment failure, or because of entry mistakes.). Median describes the data much more accurately in case of skewed data.", "For example, consider the income of an individual in the US. The data is highly skewed if you consider Bill Gates\u2019s income as one of the data points in your sample which is enormous as compared to any normal individual in the US making the data highly skewed. Therefore in such cases describing your data via mean will not be an approximate choice as mean will mostly represent the Bill Gates salary. Median income, therefore, will be a better way to represent the income of an individual in the US.", "It is the most common value in the dataset i.e the value that occurs more frequently in the data. For example, the mode of the sample [1, 3,3,3,3, 6, 6, 6, 7,7,7,7, 7, 7, 12, 12, 17] is 7. The mode is most easily understandable and quickly visible. Many decisions in day-to-day life are taken on the modal concept like going to watch a movie where most people are going or choosing the type of icecream most people are buying.", "If the data contains multiple values that are occurring the most frequently, you have a multimodal distribution. If no value duplicates, the data do not have a mode. Typically, you use the mode with categorical, ordinal, and discrete data.", "The mode is the only measure of central tendency that you can use with categorical data(data points that are divided into categories)-such as the most preferred place to visit in India.", "It all depends on what type of data you have. If your data is symmetric, the mean is the best one to describe the center of the data. In case your data is highly skewed go with median and in case your data is mostly categorical go with mode.", "It is the average squared deviation from the mean. A high variance means that the data is highly spread out whereas a small variance signifies the data to be closely clustered. Population Variance is denoted by \u03c3\u00b2 whereas sample variance is denoted by s\u00b2.", "Let\u2019s consider a sample population of n elements, x1,x2,\u2026,xn. with a sample population mean of x\u0305. The sample variance of the data is the average squared distance between the sample mean and each data value.", "Why n-1 is there under sample variance calculation? The sample variance equates out to be always smaller than the population variance hence, degrees of freedom is accounted for as the conversion factor. This is known as Bessel\u2019s correction.", "Just like variance, Standard deviation is also the measure of the spread of data points from the mean. The only difference is that it is a square root of the variance. This enables it to have the same unit as that of the data and thus provides ease in understanding explanations from insights. Population Standard Deviation is denoted by \u03c3 whereas Sample Standard Deviation is denoted by s.", "Similar to mean, Standard deviation is also highly affected by outliers and skewed distributions.", "Why measure Standard Deviation instead of variance?", "That\u2019s all for now.
