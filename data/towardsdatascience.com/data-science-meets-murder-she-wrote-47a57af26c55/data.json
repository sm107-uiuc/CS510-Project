boring \u2014 especially if you don\u2019t come from a Computer Science background and loathe the perspective of spending endless afternoons looking for wrong indentations or converting lists into strings and viceversa.", "Mastering data science skills, however, is rapidly becoming an asset in many fields of knowledge, and data-driven methodologies such as Natural Language Processing or Social Networks Analysis could provide exciting insights even to traditional research in the Humanities\u2014 just look at the brillant work done at the Stanford Literary Lab.", "Therefore, I\u2019ve decided to devote my first post on Medium to show how data science techniques could be quite handy in analysing cultural products \u2014 the case study being one of my all-time favourite shows, CBS\u2019s classic whodunit Murder, She Wrote (1986\u20131994).", "Although I do not expect you to have binge-watched all the 264 episodes (+ 4 television films) of MSW, I reckon you\u2019ll probably be familiar with the show\u2019s general premise: retired English teacher Jessica Fletcher (Angela Lansbury) from fictional Cabot Cove, Maine, becomes a bestseller mystery writer and starts to bear witness to a ludicrous number of murders, which she regularly solves through her analytic skills (and a good deal of mind tricks). To be fair, the abnormal increase in mortality rate which seems to follow her wherever she goes led conspiracy theorists to speculate she\u2019s the actual murderer and the BBC to label the sleepy hamlet of Cabot Cove \u201cthe murder capital of the world\u201d (not really, though) \u2014 in any case, the series offered viewers light-hearted and entertaining mysteries for more than a decade.", "This article offers a data science-oriented perspective on MSW briefly looking at two interesting aspects of its structure, namely the network of its characters and the distribution of its fictional locations. Both projects required extensive web scraping and data manipulation with Python, but I\u2019m not going to bother you with code: those interested will find links to the relevant Google Colab notebooks below. The results will not reveal shocking truths about the show you and your grandma loved to watch, but they will nonetheless offer a nice demonstration of the visualization power of data science tools.", "[The reference notebook for this section (MSW Interactions Parser) was provided by my good friend Michele Lacchia, who did the hard work long before I learned Python properly. You\u2019ll see the difference between his terse script and my messy attempts later on; in the meanwhile, don\u2019t forget to visit his outstanding blog.]", "Even the casual watcher can easily recognise a fixed structure in MSW: most episodes begin with Jessica arriving in some place and getting involved in homicide investigations, and end with the culprit getting caught thanks to her deductions. This translates in a lot of episode networks where Jessica acts as the gravity point, linking together a number of background figures which will most often never come back (even though their actors certainly will, as the showrunners seemed to love casting the same people again and again in different roles)", "Conversely, if the episodes are set in one of the the series\u2019 two main venues, Cabot Cove or New York, troubles come knocking at Ms. Fletcher\u2019s door, usually in the form of a relative/old friend/former student/totally random recent acquaintance who needs help to avoid conviction for a crime s/he obviously didn\u2019t commit. Here the episodic structure is slightly altered because of some returning characters, but the focus on Jessica remains sharp.", "Accordingly, to avoid drawing a network crowded by a hundreds of one-time extras, only characters which appeared at least three times during the series\u2019 run were considered. To make things easier, the network was built on co-reference, i.e. a link (edge) was drawn between two characters (nodes) when they appeared in the same episode. This approach is based on the (empirically true) assumption that each character within an episode usually interacts with any other, forming what social networks scholars call a clique.", "On the technical side, character names and interactions were extracted from the \u2018Cast\u2019 tab of each MSW episode on IMDB (sample) and exported into a .csv file which I fed to Gephi, the visualisation suite I use. Never blindly trust your algorithm: I double-checked the results with these lists of MSW regulars and I found six people whose names were not correctly recognised on IMDb. I made some adjustements, and even though three very marginal characters (Cabot Cove Gazette publisher Ben Devlin, beautician Corinne and NY porter Ahmed) remained out of the picture, the overall network representation could be accepted as reliable.", "Here\u2019s the visualization of the 988 interactions between the top 30 characters of Murder, She Wrote:", "The graph above employs the Force Atlas layout, which basically \u201cpulls strongly connected nodes together and pushes weakly connected nodes apart\u201d, while the colours reflect the characters\u2019 primary residence (red for Cabot Cove, green for New York, violet for other cities).", "At first glance: there\u2019s little doubt the show gravitates around Jessica, with the nearest co-leading characters being Cabot Cove residents Dr. Hazlitt (William Windom), who is the second most-credited MSW character, and Sheriff Mort Metzger (Ron Masak), who overshadows its predecessor Sheriff Amos Tupper (Tom Bosley) by virtue of his longer tenure as Cabot Cove\u2019s chief law enforcer.", "What is interesting, though, are the roles and relations of minor recurrent characters, such as Eve Simpson (Julie Simpson), Cabot Cove\u2019s realtor, who appears to form a small cluster with the other ladies from Loretta Spiegel\u2019s beauty parlor (upper right of the graph). Even more prominent is the clique on the left, centred around reformed jewelry thief and insurance investigator Dennis Stanton (Keith Mitchell), who shares a lot of screentime with his secretary Rhoda Markowitz, his boss Robert Butler and bulldog policeman Lt. Catalano.", "Most non-Cove characters, however, are quite isolated: if we set aside Jessica\u2019s two favourite nephews, Grady Fletcher (Michael Horton) and Victoria Griffin (Genie Francis), which are also linked to their spouses, a number of people display only a single tie with the protagonist. This broad category includes both cops regularly helped by the sleuth (such as Liutenants Gelber and Caceras) and longstanding fan favourites such as charming MI6 operative Michael Haggarty (Len Cariou) or hard-boiled private eye Harry McGraw (Jerry Orbach), whose popularity was enough to grant him a spin-off on his own (the short-lived The Law & Harry McGraw, 1987\u201388).", "Looking at the graph, it might have made more sense to focus a spin-off on Dennis Stanton: among all main characters not stricly related to Jessica, he is the only one to have a cluster of his own (as pointed out in the comments, however, Stanton was introduced after the McGraw spinoff, when the producers weren\u2019t up for such experiments anymore). This eventually depends on the six episodes, in Seasons 6 and 7, in which he features as the leading character: because of Angela Lansbury\u2019s reduced commitment to the series, the showrunners had indeed to insert \u201cbookend\u201d episodes where she acted only as narrator and the investigations of Stanton and his team featured prominently.", "Fans, however, tended to dislike these \u201cfiller\u201d episodes without Ms Fletcher, and NBC producers ultimately decided to abandon Stanton and bet on McGraw for a new show \u2014 even though the experiment proved unsuccessful and Orbach soon returned to star as a recurring character in MSW.", "[Here\u2019s the reference Colab notebook: MSW Episode Localizer. I did it by myself, so expect low-quality code, but it works.]", "Another interesting task data science could tackle was finding where each MSW episode is set and then plotting Jessica\u2019s travels on a map: despite many episodes playing in Cabot Cove and New York, where she moves in Season 8 to teach at Manhattan University, the action often unfolds in other cities and towns Ms. Fletcher visits for personal (family gatherings of all sorts, visits to old friends) or professional (book tours, conferences, awards) reasons.", "To sum up the process behind the results: I started from this nice blog, which contains a detailed plot summary for all MSW episodes. I scraped all plot summaries with Beautiful Soup, cleaned them with regular expressions and eventually performed Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the text chunks with SpaCy \u2014 I was looking specifically for words which fell in the GPE/LOC categories, indicating various types of locations. The results were put in a dictionary, with places as keys and frequencies (how many times an episode is set there) as values; the dictionary was plotted on a map with Basemap (I know I should have used Cartopy, but it does not go along well with Colab and, well, I just find Basemap handier).", "After all this trouble I realised there was a simpler way \u2014 as teachers (should) remark in Data Science 101, an insufficient exploratory data analysis (EDA) often results in doing a lot of job for tasks which could have been solved in an easier way. The blog posts were actually tagged from the start with the episode\u2019s (approximate) location; therefore, one could have just scraped the tags with BeautifulSoup and plotted them straight away.", "It turned out this latter method was more precise, despite my early assumption that extracting locations from the plot summaries would have yielded more geographical details \u2014 it did, in a couple of times, but it also missed loads of important places where episodes were set.", "Furthermore, I must confess I couldn\u2019t, in all conscience, let Cabot Cove out of the picture just because, well, it\u2019s entirely fictional. Accordingly, I added as stand-in the village which is most commonly cited as its real-life inspiration, Boothbay Harbor (by the way, external shots of Cabot Cove were actually taken in Mendocino, California).", "As expected, almost all episodes are set in North America, with a dozen in Europe (especially in London and Ireland, where Jessica\u2019s roots lie) and some occasional trips to Asia (Japan and Hong Kong), Africa (Cairo) and Oceania (Australia). Let\u2019s zoom on the USA:", "It seems Jessica has traveled quite widely across her country; despite an apparent dislike for the Corn Belt, she has visited most U.S. states, with two clear clusters in California and in the Northeastern coast. Broadly speaking, all zones of the map are occupied, and the NER on tags even missed some more precise locations, such as the Arizona county in which \u201cThe Secret of Gila Junction\u201d (S12E3) takes place.", "This wraps it up for today \u2014 this example of data analysis was quite simple, but it yielded some interesting results. Hope you enjoyed the read, and please do comment for corrections and improvements.
