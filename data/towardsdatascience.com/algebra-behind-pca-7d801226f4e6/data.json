PCA is definitely the most popular one presented by the candidates. I personally don\u2019t like digging too deep into areas which might not be relevant for the role, as I might not even know the answer myself! But I like to ask if they know how PCA works. Although I don\u2019t expect candidates to know the exact algebra, I like to see if they have some intuition, if they just don\u2019t know (which is completely fine with me) or if they try to pretend they know, which is where my brain alerts me with an amber flag.", "Some candidates start talking about how PCA uses the eigenvectors to calculate the final features. And here is where I like asking, what is an eigenvector and what does PCA calculate the eigenvector of? And here is where most candidates start shaking. Again, even if this is not something you MUST know to become a data scientist, I personally prefer to get an answer such as I am not sure than something the candidate doesn\u2019t know about.", "In this post, I hope to help people gain some basic intuition on how PCA actually works and feel confident to answer it in an interview if you are ever asked for it.", "Eigen comes from German which means own, so one could translate eigenvectors and eigenvalues as own-vectors and own-values of a matrix. But what does this actually mean?", "Let\u2019s take a step backwards and formalise the definition of eigenstates. We define an eigevector v of a matrix A with eigenvalue a as:", "In words, the implementation of a linear transformation (a transformation which preserves sum and multiplication) on vector v, which changes v by a scalar a. Hence, applying the dot product of matrix A on v will just change the length of the vector but not it\u2019s direction, if and only if v is an eigenvector of A! Note that A is a n x n matrix, it will have n eigenvectors and n eigenvalues when doing the eigendecomposition.", "Just to clarify, not all dot products between a matrix and a vector satisfy this condition.", "A must be a square matrix (same number of rows than columns) in order for it to be eigendecomposible. On top of this, in order for the eigenvectors to be well defined, all eigenvalues must be different from each other.", "Finally, it is also important to note that all eigenvectors are perpendicular to each other and each one has it\u2019s own eigenvalue assigned to it.", "To understand how the algebra of PCA works, let\u2019s first think what the goal of PCA is. With PCA we want to reduce the number of features from our full dataset and keep as much information as possible from the original data and remove the highest correlations.", "But wait! How do we measure these correlations to prioritise the direction? Well, we do have a matrix that keeps track of the correlation between the different features, which is the covariance matrix, so let\u2019s use that!", "A quick note on this: there are other matrices that can be used for PCA, but the covariance matrix is one of the most popular and intuitive one.", "So one can do the eigendecomposition of the covariance matrix to see which are the eigenvectors with higher eigenvalues. The eigenvector corresponding to the highest eigenvalue (x1) will be the one which indicates the highest variance in the data, hence the direction with least correlation between the features. The second one (x2) will be the second-highest variance direction perpendicular to x1 and so on.", "In a nutshell, once one has calculated the covariance matrix, if one wants to reduce from n dimesions to m dimensions, it\u2019s as simple as:", "Let\u2019s see the following example to have a clearer picture of what\u2019s going on:", "Imagine we have two features: the size of a flat in a given city and the price for that given flat. Our task is to reduce our data to a 1D space. The given dataset is shown in the left figure below.", "The steps one should take are (again, there are multiple ways to do this, we are just presenting one as an example!):", "I hope this gave you a basic idea on what\u2019s happening when using PCA!", "Your home for data science.
