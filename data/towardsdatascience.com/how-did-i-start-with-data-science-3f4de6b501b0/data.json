And, there is so much to learn.", "When I first started with Data Science I was totally baffled by the Mathematics behind.", "There was so much to learn. Add to that the fact that it was all very foreign to me. I was sort of confused about all the algorithms and the maths behind.", "And coding was a whole other thing. I didn\u2019t know to code.", "This post is my story of how I started with Data Science.", "First of all, I would like to start by introducing who I am. I am a Mechanical Engineer.No CS Degree. No formal Math/Stat education.", "So I am exactly what you would call a true beginner.", "I got a business analyst job in 2010. For the first three years did a lot of grunt reporting work including Excel/SQL, Spotfire.", "It was in 2013 that manager asked me to his office. Here is the discussion as well as I can remember:", "Manager: I want you to learn some Python.", "Me: Python? I have never done programming in my life. Why now?", "Manager: Have you heard about Data Science? There is something called the Random Forest Algorithm that I heard about. Since you are the only non-developer around I thought you might be able to dig in (Business Read: Since you are the only one with no work on his hands, why don\u2019t you do something)", "I was scared. But I was also curious. Is it something I want to do?", "My next few months were filled with learning up new things. I read and read, watched MOOCs, took notes. The whole 50 yards.", "I remember that I used to stay till 3 AM in the night every day so that I could read more. Maybe a payback for slacking off a little too much in college.", "And I am still not done.", "As for the opportunity, I read what RandomForest is used for. Just understood a little about the classification problem statement so that I can be of value at my organization as soon as possible.", "I remember reading a blog from someone who had implemented it in Python. I Copy Pasted his code. Ran on my local machine. And Voila!!!", "It ran. I was so glad. It was a different feeling altogether. The feeling that could only come from running code I guess. I know I am a nerd.", "We used that small piece of code to run on a classification dataset for that company and included it in a product. My manager was impressed.", "At that point in time, I really didn\u2019t know any data science. I didn\u2019t know about Entropy, decision trees, and Cross-validation. Hell, I didn\u2019t even understand Linear Regression.", "To tell you the truth the model I created might have overfitted as hell. But I just know that it was a start.", "And the start is the most important thing when it comes to data science. I regularly get questions from my regular readers as to what they should do to get a start.", "My answer most of the times is to start doing stuff. Make things happen for yourself on Kaggle. Create your own Github Repository and fill it with your own self written code. Do some MOOCs.Here is a list I recommend.", "Work on your own projects. In fact, I have a section in my resume named Personal projects. Include such a section in your resume.", "Once I had a start, I started trying many models to do the same task.", "I started up with Kaggle. And when I was not able to compete I started reading more.", "I took many open MOOCs. I learned about new things.", "I was open to learning new things. I was open to understanding new things.", "The main thing that I did while learning data science is never losing hope when I encountered Maths.", "I remember not understanding a thing when reading on the inner workings and going back and doing the whole reading once more whenever I had the time.", "I was still creating things in the meantime. I tried that my understanding never become a hurdle for my company.", "And then one day I realized that I was able to even understand the Math behind if I was willing to put effort.", "I started up with the breadth and eventually got into the depth of things.", "So yes, get your start. Get your hands dirty.", "Run the code. Try to improve it by playing with the parameters and reading up about the algorithms behind.", "And I hope maybe then someday you will be motivated enough to get into the depth fully like me.", "Thanks for the read.
