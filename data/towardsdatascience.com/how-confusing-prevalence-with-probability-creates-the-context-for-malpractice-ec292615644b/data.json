I am hoping it will also make decision scientists out of some of us. That would lower the chance of malpractice that people like my friend, Jane, had to deal with from her Primary Care Physician.", "Before I introduce you to Jane\u2019s story, let me first tell you about John, a cautious individual who took the Covid-19 antibody test as soon as he could get his hands on it. His hopes of being an asymptomatic carrier who has now developed immunity were dashed when the test came out negative. John is trying to interpret the results, and you, a budding decision scientist, have been asked to assist. You start by looking at the CDC website and find that they are trying to educate you about sensitivity and specificity with an example where the sensitivity is 90%, the specificity is 95%, and the prevalence of Covid-19 in the population is 5%. Let\u2019s remind ourselves of the definitions of sensitivity and specificity:", "Sensitivity: Given someone in the tested population has Covid-19, the fraction of those that have a positive test result for antibodies.Specificity: Given someone in the tested population does not have Covid-19, the fraction of those that have a negative test result for antibodies.", "Now, we are ready to tackle the first question.", "Question 1: What would you say is the prevalence of prior Covid-19 infection in those who have tested negative for antibodies?", "The internet is full of explanations on the math, and below is a video I created that shows one intuitive way of understanding this.", "The video above shows that our answer is 0.5%. If you picked B, you did great! Now, John asks you about your probability of him having Covid-19 in spite of testing negative for the antibody. What would you say?", "Question 2: Given that you know John has tested negative for the antibody, what is your most justifiable probability of John having Covid-19? (Assume you know nothing else about John)", "Pause and think. When you are done, scroll down beyond the sunflowers below.", "Probability is a measure of your belief, and not a prevalence or frequency to be discovered. You could pick any of the four options, but the question we asked is around the probability that you\u2019d have the easiest time justifying given the data you have so far. That would be option B, provided you are willing to project the data from a tiny sample onto a much larger population.", "Probability is a measure of your belief, and not a prevalence or frequency to be discovered.", "If you picked C or D, you would be challenged to explain what information you were able to glean that was beyond the data provided. If you picked A, then I would challenge you to see if you really meant it. The only thing we humans can be 100% sure of is that we will die one day (and also that we did not die yesterday). It is a very bad idea to be 100% certain about anything else. It is the only answer in that list that violates a cardinal principle of science. Quoting the beloved Richard Feynman,", "\u201cIt is imperative in science to doubt; it is absolutely necessary, for progress in science, to have uncertainty as a fundamental part of your inner nature. To make progress in understanding, we must remain modest and allow that we do not know. Nothing is certain or proved beyond all doubt. You investigate for curiosity, because it is unknown, not because you know the answer. And as you develop more information in the sciences, it is not that you are finding out the truth, but that you are finding out that this or that is more or less likely.", "That is, if we investigate further, we find that the statements of science are not of what is true and what is not true, but statements of what is known to different degrees of certainty\u2026 Every one of the concepts of science is on a scale graduated somewhere between, but at neither end of, absolute falsity or absolute truth.\u201d", "Every one of the concepts of science is on a scale graduated somewhere between, but at neither end of, absolute falsity or absolute truth.", "All of this sounds rather pedantic and intellectual, but I assure you it\u2019s not. Let\u2019s now turn to Jane\u2019s story to understand why. At the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in New York City, Jane fell very sick and showed all the severe symptoms of Covid-19. Thankfully, she was with her mother who reached out to me. I immediately suggested that Jane take a teledoc appointment, which she did. The doctor confirmed that this looked like a strong case of Covid-19. Jane was advised total rest for a month. After 6 weeks or so, the severe symptoms had receded, except for one. She still could not speak. She needed more rest, and her workplace had by now kicked off a short-term disability evaluation process. This required certification by a Primary Care Physician (PCP). Jane had an antibody test done, which came out negative! She took the results to her PCP.", "Before I proceed with the story, let\u2019s try another question.", "Question 3: If you are a PCP who has examined Jane\u2019s reports and her antibody test results, what probability would you place on Jane having Covid-19?", "Think about this over some more sunflowers, and scroll down.", "I know you didn\u2019t pick 0%, but unfortunately, that is what Jane\u2019s PCP did. The PCP pronounced that Jane couldn\u2019t possibly have Covid-19 because her antibody test was negative. The PCP violated Feynman\u2019s principle of science by being 100% certain. In a population of 1000 antibody tests, Jane\u2019s test result could have been in the 5 that were a false negative, and the PCP did not allow for that possibility.", "However, the PCP made a second blunder. He confused prevalence with probability. Sole reliance on prevalence data of Covid-19 makes sense only when you have no other data about Jane. However, unlike John\u2019s example above, we have a lot more information about Jane. She is not a statistically uniform number, but a human being with very specific symptoms. The whole point of using probability is to allow ourselves the freedom to consider multiple sources of information and use that in our decision-making. Jane\u2019s PCP ignored every single piece of case history that Jane presented. Then, in a remarkable act of cognitive dissonance, he tied up his rejection of the possibility of Covid-19 with a thesis for why Jane still couldn\u2019t talk. He wrote in his notes to the insurance company that she must be suffering from anxiety. This was not accompanied by any anxiety medication. Meanwhile, Jane\u2019s mother told me her daughter had been calm the entire time, mentally prepared to face death if that should be the outcome. Jane and her mother discovered the anxiety explanation when the PCP\u2019s office shared the notes that had been sent to the insurance company handling the short-term disability process. You can take a guess around what the insurance company is going to do with the PCP\u2019s notes.", "How would thinking probabilistically have guided the PCP\u2019s thoughts differently? This is where Bayes\u2019 theorem comes in. The same information that was presented at the start of the article is now shown using a probability tree below. Instead of interpreting this as prevalence, we are explicitly defining the following distinctions:", "Then, we can infer the probability of Covid (or not) given a particular test result. You only need middle-school algebra for this, using the graphical method below that deploys Bayes\u2019 theroem.", "Use this Google Sheet to play with the model below and understand the math.", "Now, we are ready to use the information at our disposal. First, let\u2019s start with the WHO website which lists the common and the less common symptoms, and then goes on to define the serious symptoms:", "Jane had difficulty breathing, shortness of breath, chest pain, pressure and was unable to move. She had and continues to have loss of speech. And yet, when she went to her PCP, she was told that her suspicion of having Covid-19 was a result of anxiety. If you are reading this like I am, it is scientifically irresponsible to put a 5% prior probability of having Covid-19. In fact, my prior jumps up to 75%, given she had ALL the symptoms that WHO lists for serious conditions. I am comfortable with such a prior by the fact that two teledocs confirmed it for her, as did a recent cardiologist visit and an urgent care visit. Unfortunately for Jane, it is the PCP who gets to pronounce the verdict to the insurance company. Let\u2019s go back to the math. If the PCP had been probabilistically inclined, he would have drawn the following tree:", "As you can see, the probability of Covid-19 given the antibody test came \u201cCovid -ve\u201d has now jumped from 0.5% to 24%. This was answer C in Question 3 above. That\u2019s roughly 1-in-4 people who would have had Covid-19 even if the antibody test comes out negative. Now that the tiny hole of 0.5% uncertainty has expanded into a window of 24%, why stop here?", "All this while, I have been conflating the presence of antibodies with the presence of Covid-19. What if that\u2019s not true? Decision Analysis invites us to ask a fundamental question: \u201cWhat\u2019s missing in the data that would explain a lot of what we are seeing?\u201d For one thing, if it turns out that not everyone who gets Covid-19 develops antibodies that can be picked up by the tests, that would be pretty material to the conclusions we make. It turns out that the CDC has not approved the antibody tests and is still evaluating them.", "Decision Analysis invites us to ask a fundamental question: \u201cWhat\u2019s missing in the data that would explain a lot of what we are seeing?\u201d", "If I took a skeptical position and believed that only a third of those who get Covid-19 would develop antibodies, I will get startlingly different conclusions, like so:", "If Jane had a negative test result, my probability for her still having Covid would be 68%! The right question to ask is: am I justified in placing a 33% chance of developing antibodies? There are bits and pieces of evidence that should give me some pause, like this one in a prison where almost everyone developed antibodies.", "I am actually predisposed toward the idea that most Covid-19 patients will develop antibodies. The question for me is whether these antibodies are detectable by the specific test kits in the market. Given how early we are into this, and that one study should never be enough to make us form strong beliefs, I can\u2019t justify going over a 2/3 chance. Let\u2019s see what happens with that belief:", "I would place a 55% chance that Jane had Covid-19 given her antibody test came negative. This was answer D to Question 3 above, and a far cry from a 0.5% chance of having Covid-19. The simple and powerful mathematics of probability allows us to reason in a manner that is consistent with our common sense. I would strongly suspect that Jane\u2019s body is struggling to fight the infection, given that she still can\u2019t speak. This is a highly likely reason for not having the detectable antibodies that the tests are looking for. After she has seen and felt improvement in her ability to speak, it would make sense to repeat the antibody tests at least two or three times, as she would be much more likely to have developed detectable antibodies in such a situation.", "The CDC in the US and its counterparts in other countries would be well advised to condition their specificity numbers by the severity of Covid-19 symptoms. If they did that, they might find much lower specificity for those with severe symptoms. With that conditioning, my skeptical prior of 33% might make sense, as many with severe symptoms don\u2019t make it, and those that do recover take a lot of time. Countries planning to use antibody tests as a method for assessing how many people have been infected with Covid-19 would want to incorporate this conditioning in their thinking.", "Jane has already received advice from others to sue her PCP for malpractice, but she is too tired to fight that battle. I am much more interested in upgrading the way we make decisions. Her PCP is most likely following a simplistic Covid-19 checklist and is not bothering to keep himself updated with the evolving WHO guidelines. If you know of doctors who are making decisions like Jane\u2019s PCP, my hope is that this article will help you engage with them constructively. Embracing uncertainty is the proper scientific position to take, and it opens up an altogether different realm of thinking that is far more useful than false certainty.", "Thanks to Rahul Brown, Dr. Alejandro Martinez and Dr. David Hutton for their feedback during the writing process.
