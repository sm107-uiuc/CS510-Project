In the past five decades, large wildfire frequency and the area destroyed have risen by more than four and six times, respectively. The increased risk posed by wildfires has prompted scientists to try to assess wildfire risk to help inform whether to move people to safety before disastrous wildfires occur.", "To overcome this challenge, I used vast amounts of data with deep learning to produce dynamic forest dryness maps of the western US for the first time ever. These maps may eventually lead to improved wildfire risk assessments.", "In wildfire risk assessments, forest dryness \u2014 an important predictor of wildfire ignition and spread \u2014 is estimated using meteorological indicators such as prior precipitation and temperature. Researchers refer to forest dryness as live fuel moisture content (LFMC) because it indicates the amount of water in fuels, like trees and shrubs, relative to their dry biomass. Lower the live fuel moisture content, drier the fuels, greater the risk of wildfires, and vice-versa.", "However, meteorological indicators do not always represent true forest dryness. Just like the plants on your balcony, different plants have unique strategies to respond to drought. Some might be able to conserve water by closing their stomata (pores on leaves) while others might not. Some might be able to gain more water by growing deeper roots, while others might not. However, mapping what species grow where and how each of them respond to water stress is difficult. Thus, fire models often ignore these effects. This may lead to incorrect estimations of forest dryness, ultimately introducing errors in our wildfire risk assessments. How can we do better?", "When I saw the US Forest Service collecting thousands of forest dryness measurements across the western US, I saw an opportunity. Using those measurements, I directly estimated forest dryness using a neural network.", "Although observing forest browning and greening is common, observing forest dryness (and wetness) is challenging because we cannot see the water inside the trees. While some models exist to estimate forest dryness, they fail to scale because they need to know the geometry of vegetation canopies. As a result, scientists have been able to estimate forest dryness of only 5\u201317 species of vegetation. By letting a neural network figure out the effects of canopy geometry using various remotely-sensed inputs, I was able to map forest dryness over the entire western US by validating 56 different species.", "On cross-validation, I found that my landscape-scale forest dryness mapping effort was as accurate as other smaller scale analyses. The vast amounts of ground-data available for model training, combined with the modifications performed to the neural network based on domain-knowledge yielded this result (mentioned below).", "Since forest dryness is a time-dependent variable that is dependent on temporal observations from the whole preceding season (in this case 3 months), I used a recurrent neural network based on a long-short term memory (LSTM) model. This decision was taken after initial results indicated that predicting forest dryness just from a snapshot (in time) of satellite observations led to very poor temporal predictability.", "The LSTM model was trained using microwave backscatter from Sentinel-1 satellite and optical reflectance from Landsat-8 satellite.", "I adapted the model to be physics-assisted through the use of carefully designed inputs based on our conceptual understanding of the physical processes linking the inputs to forest dryness. This was done in 2 ways:", "The complete code repository for the implementation of the physic-assisted recurrent neural network can be found here and further details of the algorithm is included in this open access publication in the journal Remote Sensing of Environment.", "With dynamic, wall-to-wall maps of forest dryness now available, I plan to test the sensitivity of wildfire occurrence and size to forest dryness. In the process, I will quantify the value of these forest dryness maps for wildfire risk forecasting.", "Explore the dynamics of forest dryness in your local neighborhood in the western US using my web app.", "A modified version of this article originally appeared in the AWS Public Sector Blog.", "Your home for data science.
