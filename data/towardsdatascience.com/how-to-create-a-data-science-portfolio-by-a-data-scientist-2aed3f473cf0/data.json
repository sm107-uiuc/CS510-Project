It\u2019s really during times like these where mental and physical health is extremely important to keep us going.", "As I mentioned in my previous article, data science does not crash with the economy. The data industry is still in demand, some would even argue it is in high demand right now due to circumstances. Business owners start to turn to us when things start to hit the fan.", "That being said, the interest in the data science occupation remains high. People want to get into the field, and I get it. Who doesn\u2019t want to be called working the sexiest job in the 21st century?", "The New Sexiest Job of the 21st Century, Data Scientists \u2014 LinkedIn", "It is not all rainbows and flowers though. You\u2019ve got to face some tough screenings and interviews, the ones where you don\u2019t know what to expect.I\u2019ve written all about it here. Take a look.", "As someone who\u2019s been in the field for 2 years now, the first advice I give to my fellow junior data scientists on getting the job is to have a data science portfolio. Nothing beats having a website showcasing all your work with proper code and documentation. Employers will instantly get a feel for your work and professionalism, giving you that extra edge in securing that job.", "Funny enough, I was a real hypocrite.I did not have a portfolio myself, until now.", "Hold on, I have good reasons for why I had to hold off producing my personal portfolio website. Don\u2019t get mad yet.", "I know. I know. Who doesn\u2019t?I don\u2019t want this to come off as an \u2018 I don\u2019t have enough time\u2019 kind of excuse.However, I have to balance my day job while writing here on Medium as well. I have written over 20 Articles over the past year now. Technical write-ups are not simple to produce. Producing clean code and explaining it to the reader in layman terms takes time. It\u2019s almost like a side hustle I would say.", "I am an Actuarial Science graduate. I mastered SQL during my internship.I mastered Python during my time as a data scientist.There are only so many languages I can learn in such a short amount of time.", "I wholeheartedly want to produce my portfolio website with my own written code. There are several alternatives out there like Wix and Squarespace where you can simply spin up your own website on the fly, but I prefer to do it myself.", "Having said that, my website is running on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I had to self-learn all of the languages on my own which took some time.", "This is an interesting one. The sole purpose of a portfolio website is to showcase your work, but what if you have no work to show?", "This is even more frustrating when you\u2019ve just started your career. Yes, you can show self-initiated projects, but employers like to see what you\u2019ve actually achieved in real circumstances. Furthermore, I take pride in my work. I don\u2019t showcase something I\u2019m not proud of.", "I had taken my time in accumulating exceptional work. The more I focus on my job, the more work I produce, hence the delay", "Here\u2019s what my website looks like.It\u2019s simple and straight to the point.", "The landing page. Your name is always expected here.This page sets the tone for the entire site. I have defaulted to using a design where its some huge text in the middle to grab attention.My name and passion are displayed here. Nothing much.", "The page where I display all my work, with proper documentation and code. I only include projects that I deem worthy. I also made an effort to include a variety of projects. I have projects in", "All of which are related to data science. I am grateful to be exposed to many types of projects which allow me to show the variety in my work. The variety of projects exhibits my skills in data, from engineering to visualization. It helps to set expectations of employers.", "Make sure the links to documentation and code are well done and working. Your code should be readable. We do not expect employers to understand code, but we are expected to explain our code in layman terms to the employer during the interview.", "Be sure to include comments, spaces, and proper indentation in code to show that you know what you\u2019re doing. You never know who is going to read your code, it may range from product managers to senior software engineers. Hence, please keep your code tidy and professional.", "The about section. This is where you get to tell a little bit about your story.Introduce yourself and talk about your passion, goals, and achievements.On the contrary, employers want to know who they\u2019re hiring.", "Put yourself in their shoes. Would you want to hire someone you know nothing about? Or someone who is genuinely passionate about what they\u2019re doing? Companies are made of people, and people want to know who they\u2019re working with. The personality is what you are trying to show here, keep it short.", "This is an extra section for me. Being a writer on Medium, I have publications to show off. I write about stuff I\u2019m interested in, and I want to show that. Once again, this is to show how passionate I am with my work.", "It is also easily a topic starter. Employers might ask, do you engage in any of your own projects? You can answer by saying, yes and I have written all about it, you can look it up here. It certainly beats just talking about it, as employers can actually see what you have done.", "After reading through the site, you have left the visitor with curiosity.He/She wants to know more about you, or maybe even work with you.This section is to provide ways to reach you so that they can take this relationship further.", "I coded up the site with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.I used Bootstrap, a free and open-source HTML CSS Framework to provide responsive layouts. After completing the project, I find bootstrap very easy to work with as it provides responsiveness to your website, all you need to do is to assign the right CSS class to elements. Here\u2019s an example.", "I\u2019m defining a div here where I insert my title text for each project.Bootstrap works like a grid system, where it divides the browser page into rows and columns across the page. Setting the class col-xs-12 col-sm-4 tells the browser that this div should occupy 4 columns in width when the screen is small. When the screen is extra small, it should occupy 12 columns, which is nearly the whole page.", "This means that for a normal desktop window, this div will take up 1/3 of the browser page. When you browse the page with a phone, the div expands and takes up the whole page instead. It is insanely useful as you will want some elements to be displayed larger on mobile because they look better that way.", "Here\u2019s what my project cards look like on a desktop.", "Here\u2019s what my project cards look like on mobile.", "Huge Difference.It is extremely important to make sure the mobile version of the webpage looks good, as google states that 70% of traffic comes from mobile. In my opinion, Bootstrap is an excellent starting point if you want to try out web development as it is easy to learn, easy to implement and rich in resources.", "I also use javascript to add some animation, smooth scrolling, and page navigation on the site. The most obvious ones you see are the fade-ins when you scroll into the portfolio section.", "These animations are nice to have, but not necessary. It certainly makes the site looks prettier, but if you can\u2019t afford to learn Javascript in a short time, just come back to it later. You can have the whole site laid out and add animations later down the road.", "I host the site using Github Pages.Github Pages offer a free solution to showcase your website without setting up any server and databases. It looks for content for your project in a specific branch in your git repo. It also generates a unique URL for you so you don\u2019t have to purchase a domain name. Here\u2019s how to do it.", "Go to your Github Repository -> Settings -> Github Pages -> Select Branch.In my case, I only had 1 branch which is the master, so that\u2019s what I ran with.", "I would advise against using Github Pages if SEO is one of your concerns. If you want to be found on Google, you would want to set up your own domain name and establish SEO manually. Github Pages have dedicated SEO Plugins but I can\u2019t vouch for its effectiveness. I\u2019ve tried WIX SEO before and it is way more complex and effective.", "And there we have it.A simple, free and effective way to set up your own Data Science Portfolio.", "You have essentially completed the first step to show the world how talented you are. The rest is actually doing the work.", "Also, it\u2019s pretty cool to have.", "We are not done yet with our data journey. With the lack of talent in the industry, educating yourself with proper knowledge in data and Machine Learning will give you an edge in landing that data role. Stay tuned, I am writing about more data science projects, as well as more stories, guides, and experiences in the data industry. In the meantime, feel free to check out my other articles to temporarily fill your hunger for data.", "As usual, I end with a quote.", "The world is one big data problem. \u2014 Andrew McAfee, co-director of the MIT Initiative", "You can also support me by signing up for a medium membership through my link. You will be able to read an unlimited amount of stories from me and other incredible writers!", "I am working on more stories, writings, and guides in the data industry. You can absolutely expect more posts like this. In the meantime, feel free to check out my other articles to temporarily fill your hunger for data.", "Thanks for reading!
