(Meaning, you can play around with them, zoom in, pan out, save, see labels more clearly, etc.)", "In stage one of this project, I began with the motivation to develop a better understanding of a user\u2019s twitter-world. Dealing with the complexity of a social network, the initial stage required us to bundle a user\u2019s influences \u2014 twitter \u2018friends\u2019 \u2014 into Communities based on analyzing the flow of information. We attempted to cluster together groups of users where information \u2018persisted\u2019 \u2014 indicating a circulation of ideas, thoughts, etc. around some focal point that the ego-user (i.e. myself in this case) had \u2018followed\u2019. This approach emphasized the information sharing property of social media, treating each user as a \u2018node\u2019 that both carried and generated information to other nodes. By the end of the exercise, we had accomplished a relative spatial mapping that helped visualize for us the information network latent in our Twitter-world [Figure 0.0]. So to say, we had traced the \u2018where\u2019 \u2014 coming to realization of the secret meetings (hidden by the sheer volume of flow) that the users we follow hold in plain sight. Such a discovery of an intelligence network inevitably leads to the next curiosity: \u2018what\u2019 is it exactly that is flowing? In other words, what information is flowing and persisting in these communities?", "Information Systems and Data Science often come hand in hand in the field of Social Media Analytics. What allows their union is the area of Natural Language Processing (NLP), and processing language generally requires some form of quantification so we can model the information before we torture it with math. For this project, I will be looking at some standard NLP methods to quantify and \u2018observe\u2019 textual information (tweets). This will be followed by some analysis and plotting of various relationships that we can use to make some descriptive inferences of the community profile.", "The higher objectives of this post are two-fold:", "1. Quantifying Information (Term Frequencies and Named Entities)", "3. Building User Profiles (based on their tweet content and role in the communal information flow)", "I will scope this post to the analysis of intra-community properties without going into insights gained by inter-community analysis. What this means is, we will only look at one community at a time. For the purpose of showing the entire flow, I will use my community #6 from stage one, a community consisting of young Muslims spread across various fields and interests [Figure 1.0]. Recall that this is a \u2018subjective\u2019 analysis \u2014 the group of users that make up this community is only the subset of users that I follow from the more broader community. In this sense, this community is a sample of a larger community \u2014 which means insights could very well translate over but would not necessarily be completely accurate.", "Furthermore, since once again we are concerned with information \u2018flow\u2019, we will only be looking at the tweets that \u2018flowed\u2019 in the community \u2014 which I have approximated as tweets that were retweeted more than once within the community. These tweets fall into 2 specific groups:", "Within Community Flow \u2014 Tweets generated (originally tweeted) by someone within the community and then propagated (retweeted) by someone within the community.", "Outside Community Flow \u2014 Tweets generated by a user not within the community but then propagated by someone within the community.", "Figure 1.1 shows distribution of the flow ratio weekly, showing that each week, the tweets propagated within the community consists of 10\u201325 times more of tweets generated outside that community compared to tweets generated within the community. This can be seen as a social property of the community.", "Figure 1.2 below shows the weeks of information flow this analysis will look at. Be advised that the maximum number of tweets that can be pulled from twitter for any given user is ~3200. Therefore, if a user tweeted (including quoted and retweets) more than 3200 for the year, we will not have all their tweets of 2018 so the distribution is a little skewed but nevertheless the difference between outer and inner flow is obvious.", "This categorization of flow results in a further categorization of users into serving a mixture of 3 roles within the community:", "Generator \u2014 As someone who tweets information that flows within the community. (creates information)", "Internal Propagator \u2014 As someone who propagates (retweets/quotes) information generated by a member of the community to other users within the community. (spreads information within community)", "External Propagator \u2014 As someone who propagates information generated by someone who is not a member of the community to users within the community. (brings outside information into community)", "Of course, a user can serve multiple roles at varying amounts and we will analyze this later on.", "Lastly, the tweets are also categorized but in a more involved manner. Every tweet was preprocessed to clean out user mentions, hashtags, urls, medias, etc. until we had their raw text and we could use prominent text processing libraries (spacy in this case) to tokenize and tag tweets. Figure 1.3 is a sample of the data we can get from preprocessing text in this manner.", "Words are never \u2018only words\u2019, they matter because they define the contours of what we can do. \u2014 Slavoj Zizek", "To initiate our investigation, it is important to return to the fundamentals , to the very units that carry information: words. Speaking to the mentioned Zizek quote, to discover the \u2018words\u2019 is to define the \u2018contours\u2019: the surface boundary of the shape that constrains the community as is (I confess I have completely misappropriated his statement for my own gain, for which I can only believe he would be proud). This might seem very obvious in one realm (words carry information\u2026duh) but becomes more meaningful in the area of Information Systems as it helps to answer a critical question: how do we quantify \u2018information\u2019? The answer is almost childlike: by \u2018counting\u2019 words.", "Important Note: Keep in mind all our analysis and insights are time-dependant and they only indicate the behaviour of the community within the timeframe for which we have their tweeting history (roughly speaking, the year 2018).", "Let\u2019s take a look at the frequencies and plot out some of the more significant terms [Figure 2.1]. Let\u2019s also specifically take a look at \u2018Named Entities\u2019 (NE) [Figure 2.2]. How to look at these charts:", "How do we extract insights from the above figures? I\u2019ll point out some and leave the rest for you to note.", "Another way to look at this data (if there are not a lot of points and the labels are clear) is in a scatter plot where the axis are the relative frequencies (log scaled) from the different flows [Figure 2.3]. The plot below is for Named Entities and depicts some of the analysis we made above (ex. note the terms [Muslim, Muslims, Islam, Islamic] in the top right of the chart, indicating significance in both OutsideFlow and WithinFlow)", "In the same spirit as the above points, we can continue to extract more comparative properties that help to define the community. Yet, though this exercise may prove valuable, our spirit would eventually wane as we realize the tediousness of this task. We also will start to recognize some inaccuracies and begin to ask questions like \u2018Wait, is this term really significant or is it just showing up because its associated with this other term and the other term is really the one that\u2019s significant?\u201d. This leads us deeper \u2014 we don\u2019t just want a bunch of words, we want to really get down to the crux of what all these words represent. If words defined the contour of this community, we want to now get to the \u2018latent sources\u2019 of the contour \u2014 what is \u2018causing\u2019 these terms to appear? This is the motivation behind the NLP techniques of topic modelling.", "Put simply, Topic modelling takes a collection of \u2018documents\u2019 (tweets in our case) which are made of various \u2018terms\u2019 (words in the tweets) and finds N (the number of topics) unique weighting strategies to apply to the terms such that each of \u2018document\u2019 is categorized into a mixture of the N topics. There are numerous tutorials and details about this you can search for so I will not bother to go into more detail than that. Specifically, I vectorized (basically quantified) the tweets using TF-IDF and then used LDA to find the \u2018Topics\u2019. Figure 3.1 depict our final topics in WithinFlow. This sort of approach doesn\u2019t give us a great picture of the \u2018viewpoint\u2019 of the community around the topic, just what the topic is \u2014 we know \u2018what\u2019 they are talking about, not necessarily their opinion on it. (Though more involved analysis can certainly estimate opinion as well \u2014 we\u2019ll see a small example of that later when we are discussing polarity and subjectivity.)", "The sizes of the bubble in Figure 3.1 indicate the \u2018weight\u2019 of the term (on the y-axis) to the topic (i.e. Topic 1 in the WithinFlow has \u2018Article\u2019 as its most significant term). If we take the 7 most significant terms in each topic we get a term-summary of sorts for each topic [Figure 3.2]. We can then take the same topic model and apply it to the OutsideFlow to see how topic weights compare in the information flow coming from outside the community. Figure 3.3 visualized a comparison of Topic Weights over the two flows.", "While we\u2019ve clustered terms into topics, we need to go up one level and see how these topics model entire tweets.", "Each tweet is assigned a weight for each topic making a topicVector. We can then spatially map out tweets after some feature reduction on the topicVector to bring it into 2-D space. We can see the clusters that form as well as tweets that are not as much associated with any specific topic but are somewhere between them in relative space. Figure 3.4 visualizes the tweets and clusters for WithinFlow (if you download the notebook file, you can hover over (and zoom in) each point and explore which tweet each dot corresponds with \u2014 hovering over different clusters will show you which \u2018kind\u2019 of tweets are contributing to our topics!).", "We can see isolated clusters as tweets that fall closely in their respective topics but others that are spread out among other topics (i.e. a tweet could be 10% topic 1, and 40% topic 2, and 50% topic 3, etc\u2026). The tweets in the middle of the \u2018ring\u2019 are a mix of multiple topics with lower weights and therefore are not isolated into a cluster. These tweets could be interpreted as not really falling into any topic, or being hard to classify \u2014 they\u2019re outliers nevertheless.", "We can also apply our topic models to the OutsideFlow, shown in Figure 3.5. We see more of a mix and less defined boundaries in the OutsideFlow tweet clusters \u2014 this is expected as generally the information flowing from outside will not be so well-defined as internal propagation. Once again, you are are encouraged to open the notebook file and hover over various clusters to get a feel of what the clusters are representing and what kind of tweets are causing cluster-mixing.", "Using topic weights, we can categorize each tweet into a specific topic by choosing that topic that is weighed largest for the tweet. We can then visualize the ReTweet Count (how many times the tweet was retweeted) distributions for each topic within each flow separately \u2014 in this manner we can measure the \u2018profitability\u2019 property of our topics. Each chart in Figure 3.6 shows the distribution of ReTweet counts for each type of information flow (blue=WithinFlow, Orange=OutsideFlow). These distributions give us a probabilistic idea of how many retweets a tweet within this topic gets.", "Another interesting measure that can be explored is a tweet\u2019s polarity (how much \u2018emotion\u2019 is expressed in the text ranging from -1.0 to 1.0\u2014 how \u2018polarized\u2019 it is) and its subjectivity (how \u2018personal\u2019 the expression is ranging form 0 to 1). I used a pretty weak method of calculating these measures (simply aggregating the polarity & subjectivity of each word in the tweet which can be gained from predefined libraries and mappings) but nevertheless we can make some cool, alien-looking graphs! These are joint density graphs which basically model bi-variate (2 variables) distributions \u2014 they are a nice visual to tell us where most of the tweets are on a polarity- subjectivity scale. The colour indicates the \u2018density\u2019 so for example, the maxTopic=3 chart for WithinFlow (red) shows a deep red circle centred around (polarity = ~0.1, subjectivity = ~0.25) \u2014 indicating most of the tweets in topic 3 have those polarity/subjectivity values.", "These are general trends, and I will take the time again to remind the readers that our analysis is both subjective (based on my personal followings) and temporal (the information flow in 2018-ish).", "Let\u2019s move on to users because everyone knows\u2026 the real gossip isn\u2019t about ideas\u2026 its about the people! Since we know which tweet came from which user in the community, we can go up a level again and investigate at the User-level.", "FYI: All these user profiles were public (at the time i collected this data, so legally I\u2019m cool). If a user has 1000+ followers (pretty much an arbitrary number I \u2018intuitively\u2019 decided..), I\u2019ve kinda just assumed they are openly public and should be okay with profiling their tweet. For <1000 followers, I have messaged and asked if they were okay with it and removed their data if they indicated otherwise. However,", "If you wish for your name to be removed for any reason, let me know!", "Before we mix user profiles with our generated topics, let\u2019s start by profiling our user\u2019s individually\u2026 there are algorithms that can help us to find the most discriminative terms from a subset of documents (i.e. tweets by a specific user) compared to the entire set of documents (all the tweets in the information flow). Figure 3.8 shows the most discriminative terms in the user\u2019s generated tweets (genDiscTerms) and the tweets they propagated (propDiscTerms) that \u2018set them apart\u2019 from the rest of the information flow. This does not mean these are their most significant terms!", "These already gives us an idea of the user! But we want to be able to profile users based on their contributions to the topics we have found in our information flow. To accomplish this, we can aggregate our topic-tweet weights from the previous section by the User who Tweeted and the User who ReTweeted. This allows us to profile the users in the community with respect to their 3 roles that we highlighted earlier (Generator, Internal Propagator, External Propagator). Figure 3.9, 3.10, and 3.11 depict User-Topic Occupation Percentages \u2014 to read them:", "We can also use scatter plots to see a high-level role profile of the user space. Figures 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14 show higher-level relationship between different user roles in the community (i.e. Figure 3.12 is a comparison between a User\u2019s total Internal Propagation Occupation % in the community (across all topics) and the user\u2019s total Generation Occupation % in the community).", "Figures 3.9\u20133.14 collectively are, in my view, one of the more valuable measures that can capture user behaviour not only by their content but their type of activity. Here are some sample high-level readings that can be gained from the above 6 figures.", "Of course, there are a lot more insights, depending entirely on what kind of questions you are looking to answer and if you\u2019re trying to determine the behaviour of a single user, etc.", "\u2026but wait, there\u2019s more! We can also break down the various user roles by topic and explore inter-topic correlations. To save you from a barrage of charts, I have included the analysis in Appendix A for anyone interested.", "The main purpose of this post was to classify the substance of the information flow so I\u2019ve remained shy in attaching interpretation to our observations and extracting predictive insights. This is because, when interpreting, we face a soft limit of technocratic approaches: the observations, as well-plotted and interesting as they are, could mean anything and everything. For this problem, (I believe) data scientists have to make a brave attempt at leveraging the field of sociology to provide us with a theory or two to interpret what we have found \u2014 emphasizing a philosophical view I hold dearly: the necessity of backing data science related analytical processes with \u2018Theory\u2019. Though community detection also followed from the concept of a \u2018sociological\u2019 ego-network, this was still a very superficial reference to the sociological field. To further our analysis of the content of information flow, we will require something much, much deeper. (hint: Goffman? Bourdieu? Sartre?.. Heidegger?)", "Community Detection (Stage 1) helped us to find \u2018where\u2019 the information flowed, Topic Modelling (Stage 2) has helped us to find \u2018what\u2019 information is flowing \u2014 the next stage (3) is the \u2018why\u2019. In the future, I plan to wrap this project up by introducing connections between data science analytics and sociological theories (in the field of social media analytics) and how they can help us to interpret and constrain the meaning from our results. Stay tuned\u2026", "Now I know this looks like a lot of charts, dots, and lines but not to be intimidated! Figures A.1 and A.2 show the relationships between external and internal User roles (External Propagator vs Internal Propagator / Generator) by topics (ex. the top left chart in Figure A.1 relates External Propagation Occupation % for topic 0 vs. Generation Occupation % for topic 0 and the top right chart relates External Propagation Occupation % for topic 0 and Generation Occupation % for topic 8). In our case, we have a pretty small sample size (~22 users) and therefore these charts are to be taken with a grain of salt, but in principle, we can get use these visualizations to get even a deeper understanding of specific topic relations.", "To read the plots below, it is best to look for oddities as you scan from left to right or top to bottom. What we are looking for is peculiar behaviour \u2014 i.e. if the internal propagation occupation % of topic X is correlated in a different manner with the generation occupation % of topic Y than with other topics, this could hint towards the topics having an effect on each other.", "There is a stronger trend showing that users propagating external information around topic#0 tend to generate less information around Topics 4,5,6,7, 8.", "Generally, looking at the diagonals, Users who generate more information around a certain topic tend to propagate less external information.", "Peculiarly strong positive correlation between internally propagating topic#2 and externally propagating topic #2.", "Looking at the diagonal, it seems that, generally, users who internally propagate any give topic more also tend to externally propagate the same topic more as well.", "My general purpose in these posts is a hands-on approach to explore concepts I\u2019m personally curious about \u2014 so, regardless of your field, if you have any interesting ideas you want to discuss or collaborate for where you think Data Science can provide some value, feel free to message me and we can talk.", "Your home for data science.
