Specifically, this article describes the basis of this task and illustrates its main concepts onto the California housing dataset.", "The structure of this article is the following:", "Regression analysis is defined in Wikipedia as:", "In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the \u2018outcome variable\u2019) and one or more independent variables (often called \u2018predictors\u2019, \u2018covariates\u2019, or \u2018features\u2019).", "The terminology you will often listen related with regression analysis is:", "Regression analysis is primarily used for two distinct purposes. First, it is widely used for prediction and forecasting, which overlaps with the field of machine learning. Second, it is also used to infer causal relationships between independent and dependent variables.", "Regression and classification are both supervised learning methods, which means that they use labeled training data to train their models and make predictions. Therefore, those two tasks are often categorized under the same group in machine learning.", "The main difference between them is the output variable. While in regression, the output is numerical or continuous, in classification, the output is categorical or discrete. This defines the way classification and regression evaluate the predictions:", "The following link gathers some loss functions when training both classification and regression models.", "There is some overlap between the algorithms for classification and regression; for example:", "Some algorithms can be used for both classification and regression with small modifications, such as decision trees and artificial neural networks. Some other algorithms are more difficult to implement for both problem types, such as linear regression for regression predictive modeling and logistic regression for classification predictive modeling [1].", "There are various types of regressions that are used in data science and machine learning. Each type has its own importance on different scenarios, but at the core, all the regression methods analyze the effect of the independent variables on dependent variables. Here we mention some important types of regression:", "Explaining each one of them in detail would cover several articles so, if the reader is interested in further information about regressors, I recommend reading [2, 3, 4].", "In my opinion, this is the most difficult task, not only in regression but in machine learning in general.", "Even though I think that experience is probably the right answer to this question, some tips [5,6]are:", "The most common model in regression analysis is linear regression. This model finds the relationship between the independent and dependent variables by fitting a linear equation. The most common method for fitting this regression line is using least-squares, which calculates the best-fitting line that minimizes the sum of the squares of the vertical deviations from each data point to the line.", "Building a linear regression model is only half of the work. In order to actually be usable in practice, the model should conform to the assumptions of linear regression [7,8]:", "It is difficult to fulfill all these assumptions, so practitioners have developed a variety of methods to maintain some or all of these desirable properties in real-world settings. The following articles [9,10] explain some examples.", "To showcase some of the concepts previously introduce, we implemented a linear regression model onto the California housing dataset. Here is the code along with a brief explanation for each block.", "First, we import the required libraries.", "Next, we load the housing data from the scikit-learn library :", "To know more about the features, we print california_housing_dataset.DESCR:", "These are eight independent variables based on which we can predict the value of the house. The prices of the house are indicated by the variable AveHouseVal , which defines our dependent variable.", "We now load the data into a pandas dataframe using pd.DataFrame.", "After loading the data, it\u2019s a good practice to see if there are any missing values in the data. We count the number of missing values (none for this dataset) for each feature using isnull() .", "Let\u2019s first plot the distribution of the target variable AveHouseVal depending on Latitude and Longitude . The image is supposed to plot the state of California, USA. As observed, houses located close to the sea are more expensive than the rest.", "Next, we create a correlation matrix that measures the linear relationships between the variables.", "We use scikit-learn\u2019s LinearRegression to train our model on both the training and test sets.", "Let\u2019s print the distribution of the residuals to verify afterwards the assumptions of the linear model.", "The linear regression model is not the best model when studying this dataset so, we will approach other models in future articles.", "Just as a hint, here there is a good link about how to continue:", "One of the big problems with non-normality in the residuals and heteroscedasticity is that the amount of error in your model is not consistent across the full range of your observed data. This means that the amount of predictive ability they have is not the same across the full range of the dependent variable. Transforming the dependent variable can help to correct this but it difficulties the interpretation. If the square-root transformation did not fully normalize your data you can also try an inverse transformation. The strength of transformations tends to go from 1. Logarithmic, 2. Square Root, 3. Inverse (1/x).", "If the readers are interested, I recommend trying the following datasets:", "About the Boston housing dataset, I recommend reading this other article.", "Also, in this web link, there is a collection of some thematically related datasets that are suitable for different types of regression analysis.", "Finally, many datasets can be found in:", "If you enjoyed this post, please consider subscribing.
