In such applications, not only the accuracy of classification algorithms is important but also the sensitivity or true positive rate (detection/recognition rate) of the algorithms. An example of a data imbalance in the training phase of a machine learning model can show the importance of both accuracy and detection rate. An arbitrary class ( e.g. car) with a large number of samples will give good accuracy because a classifier has seen many examples of this class during the training, however, the classifier will perform poorly on class (human) with a small number of samples. This means the overall recognition rate of the system will be lower. Accuracy, precision, and recognition rate can be measured with a Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.", "ROC was used initially for radar signal analysis during the world war-II. Currently, ROC analysis is employed in signal detection theory, machine learning, measurement systems, and medical diagnostic applications.", "In this article, we will discuss how the ROC analysis can be used for the classification accuracy of computer vision algorithms. The basic concept of ROC analysis can be easily understood with the confusion matrix, also known as the error matrix.", "A confusion matrix shows the number of correct vs incorrect predictions made by the classification model with respect to the actual outcomes/ground truths. A generic confusion matrix has four categories as shown in Table 1. We explain it with a simple example, the detection of the human body in a black background as shown in Figure 1.", "Given the confusion matrix, it is easy to construct a point in ROC or Precision-Recall spaces. In the ROC space, False Positive Rate (FPR) is plotted on the x-axis and the True Positive Rate (TPR) is plotted on the y-axis.", "The FPR is the ratio of misclassified samples (false positives) to total negatives samples(false positives + true negatives). In simple words, when the answer is actually no, how many times the answer is reported as yes. It encompasses the black background area in Figure-1.", "The TPR is the ratio of correctly classified samples (true positive) to total positive samples (true positive + false negatives). In simple words, when the answer is yes, how many times the answer is reported as yes. It encompasses the white human body part area in Figure-1.", "In PR space, Recall is plotted on the x-axis, and Precision is plotted on the y-axis. The recall is the same as TPR and Precision is the ratio of truly classified samples (true positives) to the total positive samples. In other words, precision is if the answer is positive, how often it is reported as positive[2].", "Precision and recall are two evaluation metrics used to measure the performance of a classifier in binary and multiclass classification problems.", "Precision measures the accuracy of positive predictions, while recall measures the completeness of positive predictions.", "In other words, precision is the fraction of true positives among all predicted positives (true positives + false positives), while recall is the fraction of true positives among all actual positives (true positives + false negatives)\u00b9.", "A high precision means that there are few false positives, while a high recall means that there are few false negatives.", "Embedded smart camera systems are gaining popularity for a number of real-world surveillance applications. However, there still exist challenges i.e., variation in illumination, shadows, occlusion, and weather conditions while employing the vision algorithms in outdoor environments. To meet these challenges, imaging pipelines are created in order to reduce background noise. Background subtraction is an important step in the imaging pipeline to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. In this work, a low complexity background modeling and subtraction technique will be evaluated with the ROC curve. The performance of three background subtraction algorithms; Low Pass Infinite Impulse Response filter, Progressive generation, and Hybrid technique will be compared. For simplicity, the subtracted images are segmented in order to limit the study as a binary classification problem.", "The positives and negatives for reference segmented image against ground truth picture (calculated/extracted manually) are shown in Figure 1. In the figure TP represents pixels that are correctly labeled as positives, FP represents pixels that are incorrectly labeled as positive, TN represents pixels that are correctly labeled as negative and FN represents pixels that are incorrectly labeled as negative.", "By using the four combinations of TP, FP, TN and FN we can plot the ROC curve which can be plotted Precision VS Recall or True positive rate (TPR) vs False positive rate (FPR).", "Precision or Recall: The properties of actual positives cases that are correctly identified.", "According to the definition, a good algorithm should produce a small number of false positives and false negatives at the same time. This means that both Precision and Recall should have high values. The precision and recall produce a single value with one threshold so we have used a range of threshold values to produce a curve. This also helps in identifying a suitable threshold [1].", "Comparison of Three background subtraction algorithms: ROC curve for the three background subtraction techniques including Low Pass Infinite Impulse Response filter, Progressive generation, and Hybrid techniques is shown in Figure 2. It is evident that hybrid techniques have high precision and high recall as compared to the other two methods.", "Alternative illustration of the same results can be read in Figure 3 which shows the ROC curve with False positive rate (FPR) against True positive rate (TPR). In this curve TPR is high and FPR is low for our proposed algorithm as compared to the other two published systems.", "In machine learning, often the classification problem is reduced to Binary decision problems because of reduced complexity. Evaluating the performance of the classification algorithms is important because overall system detection performance not only depends on accuracy but also on the detection rate. ROC curve shows the performance of a classifier over all possible thresholds and a user can select a suitable threshold value for the algorithm.", "ROC curve is generated by plotting a true positive rate along the y-axis against a false positive rate along the x-axis. The given example of comparing the performance of three background subtraction methods with ROC curves shows that it is easy to quantify the results by looking at the precision and recall of the three algorithms.", "1- Yannick Benezeth, Pierre-Marc Jodoin, Bruno Emile, H_el_ene Laurent, Christophe Rosenberger.
