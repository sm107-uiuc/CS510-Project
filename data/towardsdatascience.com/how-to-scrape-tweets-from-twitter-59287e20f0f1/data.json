Platforms such as Twitter lend themselves to holding useful information since users may post unfiltered opinions that are able to be retrieved with ease. Combining this with other internal company information can help with providing insight into the general sentiment people may have in regards to companies, products, etc.", "This tutorial is meant to be a quick straightforward introduction to scraping tweets from Twitter in Python using Tweepy\u2019s Twitter API or Dmitry Mottl\u2019s GetOldTweets3. To provide direction for this tutorial I decided to focus on scraping through two avenues: scraping a specific user\u2019s tweets and scraping tweets from a general text search.", "Due to the interest in a non-coding solution for scraping tweets, my team is creating an application to fulfill that need. Yes, that means you don\u2019t have to code to scrape data! We are currently in Alpha testing for our app Socialscrapr. If you want to participate or be contacted when the next testing phase is open please sign up for our mailing list below!", "Before we get to the actual scraping it is important to understand what both of these libraries offer, so let\u2019s breakdown the differences between the two to help you decide which one to use.", "Tweepy is a Python library for accessing the Twitter API. There are several different types and levels of API access that Tweepy offers as shown here, but those are for very specific use cases. Tweepy is able to accomplish various tasks beyond just querying tweets as shown in the following picture. For the sake of relevancy, we will only focus on using this API to scrape tweets.", "There are limitations in using Tweepy for scraping tweets. The standard API only allows you to retrieve tweets up to 7 days ago and is limited to scraping 18,000 tweets per a 15 minute window. However, it is possible to increase this limit as shown here. Also, using Tweepy you\u2019re only able to return up to 3,200 of a user\u2019s most recent tweets. Using Tweepy is great for someone who is trying to make use of Twitter\u2019s other functionality, making complex queries, or wants the most extensive information provided for each tweet.", "UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN TWITTER\u2019S API GETOLDTWEETS3 IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING. SNSCRAPE HAS BECOME A SUBSTITUTE AS A FREE LIBRARY YOU CAN USE TO SCRAPE BEYOND TWEEPY\u2019S FREE LIMITATIONS. MY ARTICLE IS AVAILABLE HERE FOR SNSCRAPE.", "GetOldTweets3 was created by Dmitry Mottl and is an improvement fork of Jefferson Henrqiue\u2019s GetOldTweets-python. It does not offer any of the other functionality that Tweepy has, but instead only focuses on querying tweets and does not have the same search limitations of Tweepy. This package allows you to retrieve a larger amount of tweets and tweets older than a week. However, it does not provide the extent of information that Tweepy has. The picture below shows all the information that is retrievable from tweets using this package. It is also worth noting that as of now, there is an open issue with accessing the geo data from a tweet using GetOldTweets3.", "Using GetOldTweets3 is a great option for someone who\u2019s looking for a quick no-frills way of scraping, or wants to work around the standard Tweepy API search limitations to scrape larger amount of tweets or tweets older than a week.", "While they focus on very different things, both options are most likely sufficient for the bulk of what most people normally scrape for. It\u2019s not until one is scraping with specific purposes in mind should one really have to choose between using either option.", "Alright, enough with the explanations. This is a scraping tutorial so let\u2019s jump into the coding.", "UPDATE: I\u2019ve written a follow-up article that does a deeper dive into how to pull more information from tweets like user information and refining queries for tweets such as searching for tweets by location. If you read this section and decide you need more, my follow-up article is available here.", "The Jupyter Notebooks for the following section are available on my GitHub here. I created functions around exporting CSV files from these example queries.", "There are two parts to scraping with Tweepy because it requires Twitter developer credentials. If you already have credentials from a previous project then you can ignore this section.", "In order to receive credentials, you must apply to become a Twitter developer here. This does require that you have a Twitter account. The application will ask various questions about what sort of work you want to do. Don\u2019t fret, these details don\u2019t have to be extensive, and the process is relatively easy.", "After finishing the application, the approval process is relatively quick and shouldn\u2019t take longer than a couple of days. Upon being approved you will need to log in and set up a dev environment in the developer dashboard and view that app\u2019s details to retrieve your developer credentials as shown in the below picture. Unless you specifically have requested access to the other API\u2019s offered, you will now be able to use the standard Tweepy API.", "Great, you have your Twitter Developer credentials and can finally get started scraping some tweets.", "Before getting started you Tweepy will have to authorize that you have the credentials to utilize its API. The following code snippet is how one authorizes themself.", "Scraping a specific Twitter user\u2019s Tweets:", "The search parameters I focused on are id and count. Id is the specific Twitter user\u2019s @ username, and count is the max amount of most recent tweets you want to scrape from the specific user\u2019s timeline. In this example, I use the Twitter CEO's @jack username and chose to scrape 100 of his most recent tweets. Most of the scraping code is relatively quick and straight forward.", "If you want to further customize your search you can view the rest of the search parameters available in the api.user_timeline method here.", "Scraping tweets from a text search query:", "The search parameters I focused on are q and count. q is supposed to be the text search query you want to search with, and count is again the max amount of most recent tweets you want to scrape from this specific search query. In this example, I scrape the 100 of the most recent tweets that were relevant to the 2020 US Election.", "If you want to further customize your search you can view the rest of the search parameters available in the api.search method here.", "What other information from the tweet is accessible?", "One of the advantages of querying with Tweepy is the amount of information contained in the tweet object. If you\u2019re interested in grabbing other information than what I chose in this tutorial you can view the full list of information available in Tweepy\u2019s tweet object here. To show how easy it is to grab more information, in the following example I created a list of tweets with the following information: when it was created, the tweet id, the tweet text, the user the tweet is associated with, and how many favorites the tweet had at the time it was retrieved.", "UPDATE: DUE TO CHANGES IN TWITTER\u2019S API GETOLDTWEETS3 IS NO LONGER FUNCTIONING. SNSCRAPE HAS BECOME A SUBSTITUTE AS A FREE LIBRARY YOU CAN USE TO SCRAPE BEYOND TWEEPY\u2019S FREE LIMITATIONS.

In this example, we scrape tweets from a specific user using the setUsername method and setting the amount of most recent tweets to view using setMaxTweets.", "Scraping tweets from a text search query:", "The two variables I focused on are text_query and count.
