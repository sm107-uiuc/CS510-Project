One of the popular discussion topics between themselves and job advisors is a recommended number of active applications and job interview per month. Having it too small means not giving yourself enough opportunities/chances for the success but also having too many appointment means not being able to properly prepare for them.", "So how to strike a happy medium? So here\u2019s where a particular statistical approach comes to play - thanks to a binomial distribution and some assumptions about ourselves we can optimize the number of interviews per month. In order to do it we have to understand first what a binomial distribution actually is and what it is used for.", "Its mathematical formula is written below. It should be noted here that it is not a continuous function and in such a case it is called a Probability Mass Function (PMF).", "Here the symbol \u201c!\u201d denotes a factorial (a product of all integers from 1 to the factorial number, e.g. 4! means 1*2*3*4). This piece of equation calculates how many combinations of events are there.", "k \u2014 number of desired successes", "p \u2014 elementary event success probability", "In general then, the binomial distribution tells you what is the probability of a k number of successes in n trials.", "In our case this will be the number of work offers received (k) after a given number of interviews (k). There is one more parameter \u2014 the probability of a single event success (p). If is constant during an experiment we call it a Bernoulli experiment. The most common example of such an experiment is flipping a fair coin \u2014 p is constant and equal to 50%.", "In our case, the elementary probability is how likely it is to pass each of the interviews successfully. To assess it, without having any prior data, we have to make some assumption about our performance and our chances.", "Let\u2019s say that you assume that up to 5 interviews you can prepare quite well and you assess your chances as 25%. As the number of interviews increases your level of preparation decreases and therefore the chances. At maximum number of interviews you can consider, let\u2019s say 20, you give yourself only 5%. Using a piece-wise linear function we can plot our performance curve. Therefore our elementary probability is not constant anymore but is a function of n:", "The following code allows us to generate the values.", "We can plot this on a graph. It shows our assumptions in a nice graphical form.", "Now what we have to do is to define our desired number of successes (k) \u2014 it is usually recommended to have more than one work offer in the end \u2014 to have a leverage during a negotiation phase.", "So let\u2019s assume we want to have at least 2 work offers (k) at the end of the month (3, 4 or more even better!). Therefore we want to calculate a sum of probabilities:", "If you don\u2019t sum it up you will calculate what is the probability to get exactly 2 work offers at the end of the month.", "Now, having all inputs defined, all that is remaining is to plug these values into our equation and plot the outputs. Don\u2019t calculate this by hand! Python\u2019s NumPy and scipy libraries allow us to do the calcs very conveniently in just a few lines.", "It can be implemented in two ways: with a sampling technique using the Numpy library or using PMF method from the SciPy library. The latter is faster and more precise therefore I will use it here.", "The resultant plot (below) shows us that the highest probability of getting 2 work offers at the end of the month is when we have 11 interviews \u2014 around 55%. However, note that 9 and 11 interviews have a similar probability \u2014 still above 50% and you spare some of your time. Therefore, in this case, you may aim to have between 9 and 11 interviews per month to maximize your chances.", "Now the calculation scheme is established and we may consider improving our assumption by using an S-shaped curve, e.g. a logistic function instead of a piece-wise linear one for the performance curve. The equation of the logistic function is:", "Where:L \u2014 the maximum value (a saturation level, upper bound)x\u2080 \u2014 the sigmoid midpoint (curvature switch point)K \u2014 the logistic growth rate (defining slope/steepness)", "As the standard logistic function is an increasing one we want to fit its inverse version. Additionally, we need to offset it so we can move it up and down to define our desired lower probability bound \u2014 otherwise it will be 0 by default. Fitting this function to set of given points is out of scope for this article but you can play with its parameters to get something that satisfies you. In the end, our equation looks like:", "Where U is our desired offset value.", "Below the exemplary curve fitted to data.", "The final results are depicted below. In this case the optimum number of job interviews is 9 per month. To still have more than 50% of success you may aim for 8 or 9 per month. Note that above the 18 interviews the probability raises again. This is because your performance stays nearly constant (lower saturation value) but you have more and more trials.", "Now you can play with all the variables and coefficients to see what would the best number for you.
