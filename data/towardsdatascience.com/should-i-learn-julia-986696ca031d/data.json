The question is, is it something worth adding to a data scientist's arsenal?", "The first thing to know about Julia is that it was easy to download and use (on Mac anyway, good luck Windows users). It was also a breeze to install the kernel to allow it to work within Jupyter notebooks.", "Julia isn\u2019t an object-oriented language like Python, so to get writing we need to let go of some (but not all) of those tidy \u2018Pythonic\u2019 ways of doing things.", "Classes don\u2019t exist in Julia, so we have to make do with structures like we would with MATLAB. Again, like MATLAB, Julia adopts excellent syntax for linear algebra, which is built natively into the language. This replaces the need for modules like NumPy, in favour of more intuitive syntax like A*x , x' and ./ for multiplication, complex conjugate and pointwise division.", "The other thing that users should be wary of, and have to get used to with Julia, is ending functions and loops with theend keyword. However, you\u2019ll be pleased to hear that the reason for this is because Julia isn\u2019t a whitespace sensitive language so you\u2019ll never see an \u201cinconsistent use of tabs and spaces in indentation\u201d error again!", "Julia is still technically a dynamically typed language, meaning that you don\u2019t need to tell it which variable has which type \u2014 similar to how Python works.", "However, Julia does support typing which can enforce a variable to be a specific type, unlike Python. This is pretty handy for two reasons:", "This is one of Julia\u2019s niftiest features\u2026", "When implementing mathematical expressions in MATLAB or Python, we can often be met with variables like x_hat or sigma . However, in Julia, we can use the Unicode characters as variables instead of giving us x\u0302, and \u03c3!", "\u201cWell how am I supposed to remember the keyboard combination for x\u0302and \u03c3? I\u2019m not googling it every time I want to use it!\u201d", "It\u2019s a valid concern, but not to fear as the core developers of Julia are one step ahead of us. For x\u0302, just write x\\hat \u21e5 and for\u03c3 , write\\sigma \u21e5 , similar to how you would in LaTex.", "Whilst the cynics may think this is a gimmicky feature, I think it allows for much more readable code and as the Zen of Python says, \u201cReadability counts\u201d.", "In my last article, we implemented a logistic regression model from scratch but what does that look like in Julia?", "In this implementation, we can see a perfect example of how Julia\u2019s Unicode characters can make code more readable. The native linear algebra support further simplifies the code by removing np. every time we want to perform multiplication or summation. We have also typed the function inputs to ensure that both the type and dimensionality of the inputs are valid.", "Julia\u2019s C based pedigree and typing allow for some pretty nice speed improvements over its sluggish Python parent. This can all be done without making any major improvements to the efficiency of the code.", "Let\u2019s calculate the first 10,000 prime numbers with this simple Python function:", "Which takes 2 min 42s. Let\u2019s compare that to Julia when we use typing:", "For the intrepid amongst us who want to deploy code in the wild, then compiling to a binary is a useful tool to have.", "Python developers are no strangers with the issue of defining dependencies, and wrestling with pip to ensure all packages remain interoperable. Julia\u2019s nifty solution to this is to compile to a single binary. Not only does this mean that deployment can be as simple as putting that binary in a Docker container and launching your service, but it also means that this comes with the same security improvements that come with using languages like Go.", "Then don\u2019t let Julia stop you, there is a Python interpreter built directly into Julia so using Python is as simple as using Pycall.", "It really is as easy as that! Pycall allows the use of all built-in Python namespace functions and feature (even use context managers).", "Debugging isn\u2019t quite as easy as it is in Python; this could be that I\u2019m just familiar with Python\u2019s traceback errors, or that Python just has a more descriptive way of telling you where your mistake is.", "Here\u2019s a quick example to try and illustrate in Python:", "I think one of these is a lot clearer than the other\u2026", "The only other issue with Julia is the lack of support for machine learning libraries. This may be a product of its relative youth, but it remains a frustrating feature. Julia has wrappers for Pandas, TensorFlow and Sklearn but this doesn\u2019t help us if we want to grab a pre-trained ResNet 50 or a Bert model as the chances are they will be written in Python.", "Having said that, the Julia community is growing and more native libraries are being built on an almost daily basis like Lathe and MLJ, so there\u2019s hope for us yet!", "The lack of class-based objects in Julia can also make using some of those libraries somewhat unwieldy when used outside of Python. For example Pandas\u2019 df.loc[] becomesloc!(df, ).", "Finally, there are too many functions in the basis namespace of Julia. In some ways, this is convenient and allows for a MATLAB-like level of usability and ease of writing code. However, it makes the readability of Julia code worse, with it often being hard to tell if a function is there by default, if it\u2019s user-defined or if it\u2019s been imported from another module.", "I say yes! What\u2019s the harm anyway? Writing production code in Julia is going to be tough at the moment given the lack of supported libraries available. But, Julia does offer easy to learn syntax, blazing fast code execution, a built-in Python interpreter and host of other potential improvements to a data scientist\u2019s workflow. Given its growing popularity, there might just be a reason to switch over in the future or, maybe your next project has some pretty tough performance constraints? Julia might just be the answer.", "Your home for data science.
