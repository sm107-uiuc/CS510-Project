The buzz word of the day \u2014 used by many product managers and companies. To prove their chops, companies sometimes pair PMs with data scientists to figure out ways to improve a product and make \u201cdata-driven decisions\u201d. But how does a PM work with data science?", "Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses techniques learned from computer science, statistics, and scientific research to extract actionable information via experimentation and predictive insights by analyzing structured and unstructured data. That\u2019s a mouthful so let\u2019s unpack it.", "interdisciplinary field [\u2026] computer science, statistics, and scientific research", "Data scientists need a combination of skills. For example, processing and organizing large amounts of data require computer science skills. Creating mathematical models to predict something requires understanding statistics. Generating hypothesis and testing those hypothesis uses the scientific research method.", "extract actionable information via predictive insights", "It\u2019s all about taking data and figure out a way to make automated actions or decisions. Data scientists accomplish this by creating statistical models that has errors \u201cless or on par to human decision making, [which] can be implementation at scale,\u201d says Arvind Venkataraman Ganesan, at Facebook.", "Set up tests to prove causation, not correlation. Data scientists use scientific research methods to help prevent drawing the wrong conclusion.", "Obtaining, organizing, and preparing data for analysis is important part of the data scientists role, made even more important for unstructured data (e.g., video, images, or text), which requires specific data engineering skills to collect, process, and store data.", "The difference between data science and data analytics?", "A common confusion occurs for PMs when a company has both data science and data analytics roles. What\u2019s the difference?", "Both roles are important and it shouldn\u2019t be view as one is better than the other.", "Tips When Working with Data Science", "Don\u2019t work with your data scientist in the same way as a data analyst. This doesn\u2019t mean that a data scientist can\u2019t do data analysis, but if you\u2019re trying to create predictive insights, then you need to work with the data scientists to shape the goal, problem, and hypothesis. Just as product managers don\u2019t want to be treated solely as project managers, you don\u2019t want your data scientists to be there just for running SQL queries or reporting.", "Understanding the backgrounds of your data scientist helps you build product teams to complement his or her weakness. Data science is a relatively new field and the people who are data scientists come from different backgrounds, each with its own set of strengthens and weaknesses.", "Determine if your problem can be solved by data science within your given timeframe.", "Some business problems can\u2019t or shouldn\u2019t be solved by data scientists due to a variety of issues:", "Even if you solve all of the above, your might have a time limitation. To create the predictive insights that can then be automatically actionable, you also need high degrees of confidence and consistency. That may require pre-work to collect, clean, and organize the data, adding additional time to the project. You may not have this time to invest.", "Good data is imperative. As a fellow data scientist told me, \u201cTypically the [lack of] training data is what causes a lot of issues of whether a problem is solvable to an acceptable quality.\u201d For example, if you\u2019re building a chatbot, but you don\u2019t have any chat logs, how are you going to training your bot to respond to different human requests. How are you going to collect or create this data? You may have to start with figuring out how to obtain training data before you can even tackle your business problem.", "Use hypotheticals to define what\u2019s acceptable. Assuming you have good data in sufficient quantity, there still isn\u2019t a guarantee that the data scientist can build a predictive model that meets an acceptable quality. For example, if the problem is how to improve the speed for loan approvals, would the business be okay with decreasing the approval time from 2 days to 5 minutes, but at the expense of rejecting incorrectly 10% of loans that was previously approved by a human? Thus, define what\u2019s an acceptable quality level upfront. Work with a data scientists and identify some hypotheticals outcomes on what the performance of the predictive model might be and what trade-offs are acceptable to the business.", "Incorporate your data scientists into the product team. Too often, data scientists are treated as a shared resource among multiple product teams and given a problem to solve on their own. If a model is developed, only then is it\u2019s time to involve engineering to put it into production. This may work at larger organizations. However, incorporating a person doesn\u2019t mean he or she just joins your standups. If the data scientist needs help with data organization or cleaning, have him work with another engineer on the team. If the data scientist needs to ideating on the problem space, you should be first in line to discuss.", "Special thanks to the following for reading, editing, and providing feedback.", "[Original published on 11/5/2020 on my substack, The Elements of Product Management.
