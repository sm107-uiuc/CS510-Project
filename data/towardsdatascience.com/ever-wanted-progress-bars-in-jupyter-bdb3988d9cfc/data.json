Especially, as you work more with Big Data, you will have to deal with massive datasets and use loops to perform computations for each observation.", "Loops are not at all fun when you have to watch for the asterisk in your Jupyter Notebook for many minutes and sometimes hours. The worst part is when the loop has thousands of iterations, you don\u2019t know if the loop is working correctly or just stuck at some iteration because of some silly mistake in data.", "The good news is you can create progress bars for Jupyter Notebooks with tqdm library. The library is incredibly easy to use and it also gives a certain styling to ugly black and white notebooks. Besides, while in progress, you can also make the bar show which iteration the loop is working on. Nice, right?

For notebooks, you can import the main module like this:", "tqdm sub-module offers all the flexibility and most of the functions of the module. trange is a shorthand function for creating progress bars using the range() function. Let's start with that:", "trange offers only that single functionality. For other types of iterables other than range objects, we will be using tqdm. Let's see the same progress bar using tqdm:", "The general syntax is just like that. In your loop, just wrap the iterable inside the tqdm().", "Iterables are basically any object you can loop over such as a list, a generator object, etc.", "Another really nice use case for the progress bars would be when using nested for loops. The syntax is the same for all levels of the loops. To distinguish the progress bars, we can use another parameter of tqdm() called desc. It will allow us to name the bars:", "The number of progress bars in the output depends on the outer level iterable. So be mindful of that when you have a long iterable for the outer level. There will be as many inner level bars as the length of that iterable.", "Sometimes, you will deal with a very long loop and it will be hard to watch which member the loop is working on. tqdm provides a very useful alternative for this:", "It is much better than using print statements that crowd out the output cells. In the above code, we first create the bar outside of the loop. Next, we use the bar after in and write the loop body. To indicate the member of the loop, we use set_description() method of the progress bar and pass the desired string.", "In this post, I only showed examples of progress bars on simple loops. You will see their benefit when you are working with more complex problems like performing operations on thousands of files or iterating over a million-row long pandas dataframes.
