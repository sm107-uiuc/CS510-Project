It\u2019s great for quick visualizations to guide data analysis and model building, but formal visualizations?", "Sorry, but these \u2018one-liner plots\u2019 not enough. And the extra few lines you tack on (something like plt.title(), presumably) aren\u2019t going to do your plot any justice, either.", "While default plotting is easy and yields mediocre results, building a plot from scratch using the building blocks from libraries matplotlib and seaborn allows us to create much more beautiful and unorthodox graphs. On top of this, with the right information, it\u2019s not much harder to create these creative plots, and well worth the extra effort to create a visualization that really stands out.", "Creating a beautiful plot from scratch can be broken down into five steps:", "Too often, visualizers dive headfirst into creating a plot, armed with the data but no clear notion of what they want to create. A tip professional dashboard-creator always recommend is to draw out your plot before you even begin coding it. That way, you will be able to identify what you think fits well and what doesn\u2019t, as well as being able to clearly mark objects and relationships that make up the complexities and meaning in the plot.", "Instead of plotting directly using a seaborn (or matplotlib) function like sns.barplot(), take time to invest in a FacetGrid. While it technically doesn\u2019t plot any information, it helps organize your data and sets up a clear framework in which you will be building your plot.", "Let\u2019s take a look at our data, which is relatively simple in structure:", "In our case, we only need to fulfill six parameters of FacetGrid: the data from which we pull from, a differentiating feature for subplot rows, another for hue (color), the dimensions of the plot (height and aspect, which determines width), as well as the plot palette, which in this plot is manually specified, but can be replaced with any of seaborn\u2019s built-in palettes.", "Currently, our plot is empty, because we haven\u2019t filled it up with anything, but we can see that the main framework of our plot has been built. It has automatically created four rows for us \u2014 one for each unique value in the column hue, as well as the dimensional guidelines we set.", "Creating a FacetGrid object g will allow us to easily add objects on top without needing to get down and dirty with different data flows and categories. Especially when creating graphs that are more complex, and have many objects layered on top of each other, the FacetGrid will prove a valuable investment.", "The main meaning of the plot is communicated in the centerpiece. In the case of our example, the centerpiece is the collection of four distribution plots. In our plot deconstruction, we identified each distribution plot of actually consisting of two plots \u2014 one with no fill to act as an outline, and the other with fill. This allows our visualization to look more professional.", "Whenever we add a plot object into a FacetGrid ecosystem, we must obey the following syntax:", "The benefit of using a FacetGrid is that we do not need to get messy with iterations \u2014 instead, the ecosystem automatically processes all of our commands in an organized fashion because we set up rigorous parameters earlier with the creation of the framework.", "Another observation in our plot deconstruction was that we wanted a line along the x-axis for aesthetic continuity. Adding a base x-line is simple:", "In this case, our plotting object is plt.axhline, and our \u2018measuring value\u2019 is y=0, since the x-axis is defined as all points in which y is equal to 0.", "Regardless of whatever type of plot object you would like to be adding \u2014 be it one-dimensional, like in this example, or two dimensional \u2014 you can use FacetGrid to help organize your plot.", "Because everything is in default currently, the plot may not look how we want it, but we will continually adjust the centerpiece as well as the supporting objects repeatedly according to the plot deconstruction until we are satisfied with its appearance.", "After the centerpiece is completed, it is time to add labels. In the plot deconstruction, we decided to remove the labels on the y-axis that represented density. In this case, each label is simply a number from 1 to 4, corresponding to that distribution. Using FacetGrid, this is a simple task:", "At this point, the benefits of using FacetGrid should be incredibly obvious. Simply by treating the function as a plotting object, FacetGrid does all the heavy lifting by retrieving the parameters we requested. The traditional method of labelling would be to manually retrieve the locations of objects using matplotlib\u2019s (frankly, outdated) systems and write an iterator, but using a more streamlined ecosystem does it all for us.", "Now that key elements \u2014 the centerpiece and the labels \u2014 have been completed, it is time to close up with finalizing touches, which are no less important than the other elements.", "In the plot deconstruction, we requested that there be some overlap between the distribution plots. In this case, instead of adding another plot objects, we will need to adjust the internal parameters of our FacetGrid object, g.", "We do need to make another general change in seaborn\u2019s styling to prevent issues with overlapping axes (namely, that they are cut off by whitespace).", "Tip: Matplotlib and seaborn have so many useful functions out there. No doubt, when you create your own plot, you will run into some issues. Documentation pages and Stack Overflow are your best friend! Be sure to utilize all the great functions Python plotting libraries have to offer.", "Lastly, to get rid of the titles and y-marks included by default, as well as the spines, we make a few more changes to the FacetGrid object.", "Consider an example of the plot we created here, visualizing how Linear Discriminant Analysis converted 784-pixel images representing handwritten digits into two-dimensional and one-dimensional representations.", "Throughout this five-step process, we were able to create an original plot using matplotlib and seaborn\u2019s massive arsenal of building blocks. Armed with this framework for creating plots and the power of documentation pages, you\u2019ll be able to build beautiful and inventive plots well worth the extra work.
