It is scary, true to the spirit of Halloween!", "If we cannot assume that most of our data (of business, social, economic, or scientific origin) are at least approximately \u2018Normal\u2019 (i.e. they are generated by a Gaussian process or by a sum of multiple such processes), then we are doomed!", "Here is an extremely brief list of things that will not be valid,", "Scary enough? Let\u2019s talk more about it\u2026", "Let\u2019s keep this section short and sweet.", "Normal (Gaussian) distribution is the most widely known probability distribution. Here are some links to the articles describing its power and wide applicability,", "Because of its appearance in various domains and the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), this distribution occupies a central place in data science and analytics.", "This is all hunky-dory, what is the issue?", "The issue is that often you may find a distribution for your specific data set, which may not satisfy Normality i.e. the properties of a Normal distribution. But because of the over-dependence on the assumption of Normality, most of the business analytics frameworks are tailor-made for working with Normally distributed data sets.", "It is almost ingrained in our subconscious mind.", "Let\u2019s say you are asked to detect check if a new batch of data from some process (engineering or business) makes sense. By \u2018making sense\u2019, you mean if the new data belong i.e. if it is within \u2018expected range\u2019.", "What is this \u2018expectation\u2019? How to quantify the range?", "Automatically, as if directed by a subconscious drive, we measure the mean and the standard deviation of the sample dataset and proceed to check if the new data falls within certain standard deviations range.", "If we have to work with a 95% confidence bound, then we are happy to see the data falling within 2 standard deviations. If we need stricter bound, we check 3 or 4 standard deviations. We calculate Cpk, or we follow six-sigma guidelines for ppm (parts-per-million) level of quality.", "All these calculations are based on the implicit assumption that the population data (NOT the sample) follows Gaussian distribution i.e. the fundamental process, from which all the data has been generated (in the past and at the present), is governed by the pattern on the left side.", "But what happens if the data follows the pattern on the right side?", "At the end of the day, we will still need a mathematically sound technique to quantify our confidence bound, even if the data is not normal. That means, our calculation may change a little, but we should still be able to say something like this-", "\u201cThe probability of observing a new data point at a certain distance from the average is such and such\u2026\u201d", "Obviously, we need to seek a more universal bound than the cherished Gaussian bounds of 68\u201395\u201399.7 (corresponding to 1/2/3 standard deviations distance from the mean).", "Fortunately, there is one such bound called \u201cChebyshev Bound\u201d.", "Chebyshev\u2019s inequality (also called the Bienaym\u00e9-Chebyshev inequality) guarantees that, for a wide class of probability distributions, no more than a certain fraction of values can be more than a certain distance from the mean.", "Specifically, no more than 1/k\u00b2 of the distribution\u2019s values can be more than k standard deviations away from the mean (or equivalently, at least 1\u22121/k\u00b2 of the distribution\u2019s values are within k standard deviations of the mean).", "It applies to virtually unlimited types of probability distributions and works on a much more relaxed assumption than Normality.", "Even if you don\u2019t know anything about the secret process behind your data, there is a good chance you can say the following,", "\u201cI am confident that 75% of all data should fall within 2 standard deviations away from the mean\u201d,", "I am confident that 89% of all data should fall within 3 standard deviations away from the mean\u201d.", "Here is what it looks like for an arbitrary looking distribution,", "As you can guess by now, the basic mechanics of your data analysis does not need to change a bit. You will still gather a sample of the data (larger the better), compute the same two quantities that you are used to calculating \u2014 mean and standard deviation, and then apply the new bounds instead of 68\u201395\u201399.7 rule.", "The table looks like following (here k denotes that many standard deviations away from the mean),", "A video demo of its application is here,", "It is obvious what the catch is by looking at the table or the mathematical definition. The Chebyshev rule is much weaker than the Gaussian rule in the matter of putting bounds on the data.", "It follows a 1/k\u00b2 pattern as compared to an exponentially falling pattern for the Normal distribution.", "For example, to bound anything with 95% confidence, you need to include data up to 4.5 standard deviations vs. only 2 standard deviations (for Normal).", "But it can still save the day when the data looks nothing like a Normal distribution.", "There is another bound called, \u201cChernoff Bound\u201d/Hoeffding inequality which gives an exponentially sharp tail distribution (as compared to the 1/k\u00b2) for sums of independent random variables.", "This can also be used in lieu of the Gaussian distribution when the data does not look Normal, but only when we have a high degree of confidence that the underlying process is composed of sub-processes which are completely independent of each other.", "Unfortunately, in many social and business cases, the final data is the result of an extremely complicated interaction of many sub-processes which may have strong inter-dependency.", "In this article, we learned about a particular type of statistical bound which can be applied to the widest possible distribution of data independent of the assumption of Normality. This comes handy when we know very little about the true source of the data and cannot assume it follows a Gaussian distribution. The bound follows a power law instead of an exponential nature (like Gaussian) and therefore is weaker. But it is an important tool to have in your repertoire for analyzing any arbitrary kind of data distribution.", "You can check author\u2019s GitHub repositories for other fun code snippets in Python, R, or MATLAB and machine learning resources.
