There is a clear interest should we manage to share beneficial solutions to different areas of the world more rapidly. Although one solution cannot necessarily be transplanted from one location to the other, it can be important to take the aspects relevant in the local context and adapt accordingly. As such, I decided to explore the current popular frameworks that are open-source as well as others that may be less well-known.

The Agenda is a commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development by 2030 world-wide, ensuring that no one is left behind. Code or repositories on their own will of course in no way, shape or form achieve this by default.
