My partner in crime for this project has been Andrew Sproul, who just like me has lots of passion for Data Science, ML / AI and the Fantasy Sports.", "This was a rough week for many of the top players in the world, with many of them scoring in the 30\u201340pt range! Collectively they still averaged 58pts compared to the GW average of 44pts. So, if you scored anywhere in the 50pts range and above you can feel pretty good about yourselves :)", "While we\u2019re on the topic of the Top 100 players in the world let\u2019s look at who the most selected players on their teams by position and the most preferred team formations for GW23 were.", "We used this data and the current player prices to create the team below which is a blend of the most selected players by Top100:", "Pretty good looking team, and lots of wiggle room to try some different picks on key positions, while still keeping a solid core of players.", "Now that Vardy is back in business, we\u2019re back to the more popular attacking formations of 3\u20134\u20133 as the top choice.", "Overall this was a pretty nice week for us with 68pts, way above the average of 44. Our hopes and dreams about Jimenez from the \u201cFinal Thoughts\u201d section of last week\u2019s Blog came true and we finally got a nice return on our investment. We also got sort of \u201clucky\u201d that Rashford didn\u2019t play, so we could get Grealish in as our first sub for 10pts. Our captain choice wasn\u2019t the best and we got a bit unlucky there with De Bruyne hitting the post from that beautifully taken free kick, so we only netted 2x2 = 4pts from him :( Finally, we also banked some nice points from Gazzaniga whom we\u2019ve had since day one after Loris\u2019 injury, so, all in all, we\u2019re happy!", "Let\u2019s start with the Adjusted Opponent Difficulty Rating (FDR) for the next three game-weeks below:", "Looks like West Ham, Southampton, Norwich, Wolves and Chelsea have a relatively difficult program, so our Algo will not be making any picks from these teams. Teams with relatively easy schedules are Bournemouth, Palace, Aston Villa, Everton, Newcastle, Liverpool, Watford and Brighton.", "The data below comes from an independent site that updates the latest injuries much more frequently than the Fantasy Website:", "As per a reader\u2019s request last week I will now be posting the top and bottom 50 players in terms of ROI, so our readers can have a look at a broader pool of high-ROI players to pick from and overpriced and under-performing players to stay away from.", "Our algorithm takes in adjusted budget per team formation and tries to maximize spend per position for the main 11 players, and then get you subs which are good ROI value to fill the rest of the team. Based on current ROI scores, filtering out any team with AVG opponent difficulty (FDR \u2265 75th %) over next three games and removing injured players from the list of available picks, our algorithm picked the team below as optimal for spending the full $100MM budget:", "As far as our own team is concerned, we had saved 2 free transfers so we can get more Liverpool players for the double game week. So, we ended up making the three transfers below:", "Willian \u2192 Salah, Saiss \u2192 Tanganga, Rashford \u2192 Greenwood", "We know it\u2019s risky if Klopp decides to make some rotations in midfield, but since both of Liverpool\u2019s games are away and there are 4 days of break between them, we\u2019re hoping that he would start the main squad for both games. We opted to go with Salah as captain since he seems to be in better form than Mane over the last few games. We also considered TAA, but we think many people will go with him, so we\u2019re looking for a bit of a differential given that we\u2019re behind on points.", "Looking at Best / Worst defense and offense can be used in a few different ways \u2014 for example, if a best offense team is playing a worst defense team, you might want to captain your attacking mid or striker. Also, you might want to give preference to DF and GK from the best defensive teams when looking at the algorithmic recommendations for these positions.", "SEVEN consecutive clean sheets for Liverpool now! Enough said\u2026:)", "Below you can see the teams, sorted by cumulative player ROI. Note that an active player is any player that has played at least 33.33% of the total possible game time. So, we are counting any player that has played a total of at least 620 minutes as active on that team.", "Stats are starting to converge nicely here as the more solid performers with reasonably priced players are now occupying the top 5\u20138 spots. Some of the teams with expensive players that are struggling to catch up and improve their overall ROI are Spurs, Arsenal, Everton, and West Ham.", "First and foremost, don\u2019t forget that this GW24 is THIS COMING TUESDAY! The main event of the week is certainly the double games for Liverpool, where a lot of people will probably be playing their triple captain chip. We\u2019re also considering doing that with Salah, but given that both games are away for Liverpool and neither Wolves, nor West Ham are in the bottom 7 defensive teams, we don\u2019t have enough confidence that there would be enough goals. We still might make Salah triple captain last minute, but for now we\u2019re going with just regular play. Other than that we\u2019re hoping for a clean sheet from Spurs v. Norwich, so we can bank some points on Gazzaniga and Tanganga.", "Good luck to all of you this week and as always \u2014 thank you for reading!", "Your home for data science.
