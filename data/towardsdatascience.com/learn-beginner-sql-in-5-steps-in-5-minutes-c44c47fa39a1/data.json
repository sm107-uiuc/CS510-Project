What helps me the most is to think of a table as an Excel table.", "A query is a request for data from a database table or combination of tables.

For example, if I wanted to pull Name then my code would look like:", "A neat trick is if you want to pull all columns, you can use an asterisk \u2014 see below:", "FROM determines which table you want to pull the information from. For example, if you wanted to pull the Name of the patient, you would want to pull the data FROM the table called patient_info (see above).

Let's go through the 3 additional optional steps.", "What if you wanted to select the Names of patients who are older than 23? This is when WHERE comes in.

A visual representation is shown to the right:", "If you want the Names of patients that satisfy two clauses, you can use AND. Eg. Find the Names of patients who are older than 23 and weigh more than 130 lbs.", "If you want the Names of patients that satisfy one of two clauses, you can use OR. Eg. Find the Names of patients who are younger than 22 or older than 23.", "GROUP BY does what it says \u2014 it groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.
