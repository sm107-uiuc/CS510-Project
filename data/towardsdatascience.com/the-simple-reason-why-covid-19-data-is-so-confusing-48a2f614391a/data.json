The cognitive dissonance caused by clashing messages has undesirable impacts ranging from people tuning out, or worse \u2014 reaching wrong conclusions, or worst of all \u2014 responding with the wrong behaviors.", "The reader must reconcile both headlines for either one to be meaningful as news. [2] Unfortunately, it\u2019s impossible to reconcile the two headlines without more information, so we\u2019ve built a table with the (hypothetical) data consistent with both:", "A two-dimensional table like this one can be read two ways: horizontally (where the percentages add up to 100% across the rows); and vertically (where the percentages add up to 100% down the columns).", "The horizontal view corresponds to the first headline. It\u2019s the view of politicians and professionals, who are looking across society. Crucially, it\u2019s much easier to collect data in this view \u2014 simply count the people in the hospital. The data organized this way is useful for resource and capacity planning.", "The vertical view corresponds to the second headline. It\u2019s the view of the general population, including most of the media. It answers the question \u201cWhat does this mean for me?\u201d Unfortunately, data is harder to collect for the vertical view, and rarely presented this way.", "There you have it \u2014 same information, two accurate but different views and interpretations. The simple reason that younger adults can make up a large percentage of hospitalizations while having a low hospitalization rate? There are so many more young adults than old people.", "We need this critical piece of \u201cprior information\u201d on the overall population to reconcile the two views, yet it is too often omitted \u2014 a form of what Daniel Kahneman (and others) call \u201cBase Rate Neglect.\u201d [3]", "Now that we understand that both views are correct and each answers different but important questions, does that mean there isn\u2019t a problem?", "No, there\u2019s a BIG problem: Most of the time the data is presented to us in the horizontal view, while most of us are interested in the vertical view question: \u201cWhat does it mean for me?\u201d [4]", "Mixed up views result in mixed up people. Many simply tune out. Others reach wrong conclusions \u2014 in this case, the alarming-but-wrong conclusion that over 40% of younger adults with COVID-19 are being hospitalized. \u201cMixed messages allow people to follow their biases and believe whatever they want.\u201d [5]", "Even worse: when the \u201cexpert\u201d (horizontal) view and the \u201cpopular\u201d (vertical) view are left unreconciled, it can breed mistrust of experts and their motives. Accuracy without clarity may lead to the boomerang effect, \u201cthe unintended consequence of an attempt to persuade resulting in the adoption of the opposite position instead.\u201d [6].", "In the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic, U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams asked Americans to stop buying masks because \u201cThey are NOT effective in preventing the general public from catching #Coronavirus, but if healthcare providers can\u2019t get them to care for sick patients, it puts them and our communities at risk.\u201d He was legitimately worried about the health care system (horizontal view) but blurred the risk to the public (vertical view). [7]", "Yet many people were aware of how Asian countries treated masks as essential to personal safety, causing confusion and sowing doubts about America\u2019s experts and their motives. Sadly, some people have responded in opposite to what the experts intended \u2014 at first by hoarding masks, and later (after the experts reversed course) by refusing to wear them.", "Accuracy and Clarity for Data Scientists", "Recognizing that there are two views provides an opportunity for the data scientist to lead in the quest for accuracy and clarity. We mentioned earlier that it\u2019s often difficult to compile the population data for the vertical view. This is especially true when we\u2019re dividing the population into sub-groups.", "Suppose the COVID-19 hospitalization data was missing much of the data for the vertical view:", "Imagine that you\u2019re patching information from three sources:", "Note that 1. and 2. are horizontal view data, and 3. is vertical view data. You want to answer the vertical view question: \u201cWhat does it mean for me?\u201d", "Bayes\u2019 Rule provides an elegant way of combining horizontal and vertical views to infer missing information. Even if much of the vertical view is unavailable (often the case) you may have enough information to create it:", "For the Sake of Clarity, What Can We Do?", "Anyone who presents tabular data can provide great service to public discourse by clarifying the horizontal or vertical view (and whenever possible, both). Make it explicit which direction adds to 100%!
