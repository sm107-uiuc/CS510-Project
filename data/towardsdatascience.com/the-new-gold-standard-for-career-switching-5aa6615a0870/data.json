Initially dead set on a career in investment banking, I slowly recognized that this was not the right path for me. I, like many reading this, recently came to terms with the daunting sentiment: \u201cI need to switch career paths.\u201d", "As many early-to-mid career professionals in the same position often find, the next steps can be incredibly unclear. We must ask ourselves:", "The first question is very personal, and outside of the scope of this article. The next two, however, are what we will focus on answering. Today, I\u2019m going to present a brand new approach to effectively identify and gather the skills you need to enter a new career path. To do so, this article will cover:", "We live in a golden age of data science. With many industries experiencing rapid data-driven innovation, one remains suspiciously stagnant \u2014 the job market.", "Career switching is no stranger to the average person.", "Those of us without network connections in our target industries have limited options. Naturally, we turn to the internet, but the vast amount of information out there is a double-edged sword. If you search for guides on how to enter a new industry, you\u2019ll quickly get overwhelmed; the internet offers less help than you\u2019d think.", "Why? Most of the information found online comes in the form of conflicting guides, each based on one person\u2019s limited perspective. Anecdotal advice isn\u2019t reliable, and even useful advice depreciates in value over time as industries evolve. A second option is going back to school (or a bootcamp), which can be time and cost prohibitive for most people. The last problem with both of these solutions is they assume one-size-fits-all. People don\u2019t start from the same starting point \u2014 and that influences their optimal learning path.", "In summary, today\u2019s online resources are too subjective and de-personalized to be effective.", "Because of these issues, many people get discouraged before starting, delay, or give up after sinking time and money trying.", "So, how do we decrease this paralyzing uncertainty and increase our chances of success?", "As a data scientist & software developer, I get many questions on how to break into the industry. People ask me what they should learn, how to learn it, and what the fastest/cheapest path is. I didn\u2019t know the answers, so I built something that does.", "Let\u2019s take a second to think about what a proper solution would look like. We\u2019ll need a solution that is:", "Today, there is no solution that addresses all of these issues, but there\u2019s hope.", "From a lost business school student, I was able to successfully transition to a full time Software Engineer at Amazon. Now, not only have I experienced the issues with career switching, but I have the skills to help others make that transition. Let\u2019s walk through what this solution looks like:", "Step 1: Thinking like a data scientist, we know the best way to understand an industry is to look at the data. With enough data, trends will become apparent. Which skills are popular? Which are gaining popularity? How proficient do you need to be? With the right data, we could answer all of these questions.", "Step 2: Now that we have an idea of the industry, let\u2019s understand our job-seekers. Depending on their prior experience, their skillsets will vary widely. Some people might have half the skills required, others may have close to none. To capture this, we need to directly ask a job-seeker about their current skillset. The goal here is to collect information objectively to accurately gauge which relevant skills our job-seeker already possesses.", "Step 3: Third, we figure out the skill gap. At this point, we know a person\u2019s current skills and what\u2019s required from their goal industry. Processing skills data into vectors and calculating these gaps would yield precise, meaningful numbers.", "Step 4: Finally, we must close the skill gaps. The most reliable and widely available way to learn new skills is online courses. If we have access to courses from multiple big-name providers, we can provide an un-biased assortment of options for our job-seekers to get evaluated against. With a customized content-based recommender system, we can calculate an effective, personalized, actionable set of course recommendations for each candidate.", "So, does this exist? Is it available for use? Yes and no. As of writing, I\u2019m still building things out. While it\u2019ll take me a little longer to conjure up the UI, the data is there. This means people can start getting value from it ASAP!", "This leads to the next and final section.", "Now let\u2019s focus on you. If you\u2019re reading this, there\u2019s a high chance you\u2019ve considered becoming a data scientist at one point. No matter if you\u2019re still toying with the idea or halfway there, I\u2019m confident I can help.", "If you\u2019re interested seeing your optimal learning path to becoming a data scientist, shoot me an email at shayaan.mlds@gmail.com.", "We\u2019ll set up a 15 minute meeting to get information about your current skillset and goals, and come up with a personalized learning plan \u2014 free of charge. The pandemic brought this problem to the forefront of many people\u2019s lives, and the only way out is together. Giving back to the community is important to me, which is why I\u2019d like to help as many people as my schedule allows.", "Ask 100 people how to break into an industry and you\u2019ll get 100 different answers. It\u2019s important to ignore them all, the real answer is in the data.", "Career switching is a challenge many early-to-mid career professionals face today \u2014 figuring out what the right career is after spending time, money, and energy pursuing the wrong one can be emotionally hard and mentally daunting.", "With a little bit of guidance and a data-driven approach, you can reduce the uncertainty and increase your chances of success.", "If you or anyone you know is data-minded and interested in a career switch, show them this article and email me!
