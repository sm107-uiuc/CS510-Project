As the name suggests, it helps to identify congregations of closely related (by some measure of distance) data points in a blob of data, which, otherwise, would be difficult to make sense of.", "The k-means algorithm searches for a pre-determined number of clusters within an unlabeled multidimensional dataset. It accomplishes this using a simple conception of what the optimal clustering looks like:", "It accomplishes the clustering by starting with a random assignment of cluster centers and then iterating in phases, where, in each phase, it assigns certain points to each cluster center and then re-compute the cluster center position from the arithmetic mean of those points. Here is a nice video demonstrating the process.", "A critical advantage of the k-means algorithm is its simplicity which makes it popular choice for fast processing of large scale data. But this very simplicity also leads to some key practical challenges.", "In particular, the non-probabilistic nature of k-means and its adoption of a simple radial distance metric to assign cluster membership leads to poor performance for many real-world situations.", "For example, imagine the following data points. Here they are colored by their labels but in an unsupervised machine learning setting, we won\u2019t have the class labels.", "If we run a simple k-means, most likely we will get the following final clustering arrangement,", "The two middle clusters appear to have overlap i.e. we might not have complete confidence in the cluster assignment of points in that overlapped region. Unfortunately, the k-means model has no intrinsic measure of probability or uncertainty of cluster assignments.", "k-means is, by its design, non-probabilistic.", "Moreover, for the k-means, it works best when the shape of the data distribution is circular. This is because k-means has no built-in way of accounting for oblong or elliptical clusters. So, for example, if we take the same data and transform it by stretching it in one direction, the cluster assignments become sub-optimal.", "k-means is not flexible enough to account for this kind of \u2018elongated data\u2019 and tries to fit the data forcefully into four circular clusters, which do not represent the true shape of the data points.", "k-means performs poorly on \u2018non-circular\u2019 data i.e. oblong or elliptical clusters", "Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs), can be viewed as an extension of the ideas behind k-means. GMM attempts to model the given data as a mixture of multiple multi-dimensional Gaussian probability distributions.", "It works on the basis of the Expectation-Maximization (E-M) algorithm and handles the probabilistic nature of the generated data intrinsically.", "In the simplest case, GMMs can be used for finding clusters in the same manner as the k-means. However, it performs flawlessly for non-circular data blobs because it can tailor the individual Gaussian distributions with parameters (std. dev and mean) suitable to fit the particular shape of the data.", "A comprehensive summary of such models can be found in this article,", "The most popular categorization of GMM is as a clustering algorithm. However, fundamentally, it is an algorithm for density estimation and falls into the family of generative models.", "This means that, when a GMM is fit to some data, the resulting model is not just a description of a set of fixed clusters, but it is a generative probabilistic model describing the true distribution of the data.", "GMM is a generative modeling technique and can generate synthetic data, close to the distribution of the fitted data.", "Here is a nice little introduction of what it means to be a generative model,", "Let\u2019s say we have a crescent moon-shaped clustering arrangement of some data points. This is a popular toy example, which is often used to show the limitation of k-mean. A special type of clustering method called spectral clustering works best for this type of data.", "How many natural clusters are there?", "Two, obviously. If we run a GMM with a choice of two clusters, we will get something like this.", "Not very impressive, is it? It demonstrates the same kind of limitation as that of k-means for this particular shape of data.", "But let\u2019s say we are not interested in clustering but generating more synthetic data based on the given data samples.", "We will need a lot of Gaussian clusters for that. See what happens when we run the same GMM algorithm with a choice of 4, 8, and 16 clusters as our guess.", "The clusters seem to be following the shape of the data closely. The great thing about GMM is that we have a samplemethod. That means it has \u2018learned\u2019 the distribution of the data, not just only clustered it and can generate an arbitrary number of samples out of that distribution.", "Standard algorithmic implementation of GMM has a sampling method to generate data. k-means does not have such method.", "Look what happens when I call the predict method on these models (4, 8, and 16 cluster models).", "It is able to generate new data, closely following the shape of the original data that it was clustering on!", "Obviously, the 4-cluster model is not so good at mimicking the original data, but the 16-cluster model gets it pretty close, doesn\u2019t it?", "Of course, this ability is not limited to any particular shape or two dimensions and extends generally to the multi-variate case. Following is an example with a 4-cluster data set.", "Just like any generative technique, this is susceptible to overfitting and poor generalization. You can increase the number of Gaussian components without any limit, but that will start to fit to the noise and will not represent the true distribution.", "In general, careful experiments must be done with the choice of Gaussian components, initializations, tolerance, and the number of iterations.", "Increase the number of Gaussian components until you start to get a close enough representation of the original dataset but increase no more. Observe the principle of Occam\u2019s razor and try to stop at the minimum complexity which is sufficient for your application.", "A potential application of this technique is immediate for business analytics and marketing segmentation cases. Often, marketing survey yields a limited number of data points. What if your in-house clustering algorithm or some other data processing technique demands a lot more data points? This a potential way to closely mimic the distribution of the true dataset and generate similar clusters for further processing.", "Business analytics can use this synthetic data generation technique for creating artificial clusters out of limited true data samples.", "A practice Jupyter notebook for this can be found here.", "If you have any questions or ideas to share, please contact the author at tirthajyoti[AT]gmail.com.
