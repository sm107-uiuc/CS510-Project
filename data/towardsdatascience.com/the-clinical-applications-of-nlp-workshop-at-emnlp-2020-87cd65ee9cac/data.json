In this post, I\u2019ll be briefly discussing 3 papers that stood out to me.", "This paper focuses on text summarization in the context of medical dialogue. The idea is that when a patient has a conversation with a doctor, you want to be able to automatically summarize what transpired in the conversation. So for example, if the conversation went something like this:", "Doctor: \u201cWhat have you been experiencing today?\u201d", "Patient: \u201cI\u2019m having pain in my stomach.\u201d", "Doctor: \u201cHow severe is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10\u201d", "Then you want to be able to produce a transcript-like record of what happened during the visit.", "In this paper, the authors propose a model that can summarize these dialogues by filling in words using local structures. For example, the model would be able to fill in the patient\u2019s response to \u201chow severe is the pain on a scale from 1 to 10\u201d (which was originally \u201c8\u201d) into something like \u201cThe severity of pain is 8 on a scale from 1 to 10\u201d. Doing this multiple times, the model could arrive at something like", "\u201cThe patient has pain in their stomach that is at a severity of 8 on a scale from 1 to 10\u201d.", "The model is 80% accurate at summarization when compared with a baseline model, so this is a promising direction for text summarization in medical dialogues.", "In this paper, the authors try to generate a diagnosis for a patient based on their medical records. Essentially, their model is inputted some information about a patient along with a central complaint, and it outputs an assessment of the patient.", "The main contribution of the paper is that the authors use a transformer-based model which outperforms a baseline LSTM model. This is quite interesting because it helps demonstrate that transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) can achieve high performance on domain-specific datasets and not just the general datasets that they are usually used for.", "Another interesting part of the paper is that the model is able to incorporate background medical contexts to increase performance. For example, it can actually help visualize why certain drugs have been recommended for a certain patient. Here\u2019s an example:", "In an example that the authors presented during the talk, the graph that the model builds is able to make it clear why the drug \u201cSaxenda\u201d was recommended instead of \u201clantus insulin.\u201d The graph shows that the model has found patient specific information (that the patient is looking for a cure for type 2 diabetes and is allergic to lantus insulin) and combined it with general medical knowledge (that Saxenda and lantus insulin are both cures for type 2 diabetes) in order to show that the doctor has suggested Saxenda instead of lanxus insulin because the patient was allergic to lantus insulin.", "This paper, which was nominated for the best paper award at the workshop, attempted to address the question: is there a certain amount of data needed for clinical reports for the model to converge?", "To answer this question, they took a dataset and obtained subsets of the dataset by taking a random percentage of the training data (the testing set is fixed). They then trained multiple models using the subsets in order to analyze the models\u2019 performances at varying percentages of data that was used. The paper had 2 main findings:", "Conclusion. NLP is a fascinating field, and this workshop just goes to show that NLP models can be applied anywhere, even in clinical settings. Though these papers all had great findings, clinical NLP still has a long way to go. I hope that as the fields of AI and NLP grows, more people will explore how we can tackle clinical problems with the models that we develop, as medicine is always has crucial issues that need to be addressed. Perhaps NLP is a field that can help out.", "Your home for data science. A Medium publication sharing concepts, ideas and codes.", "Large language models, AI for health.
