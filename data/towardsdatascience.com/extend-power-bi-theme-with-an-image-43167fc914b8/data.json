And, when it comes to working with images, Power BI offers you a whole range of capabilities \u2014 some of them I\u2019ve examined in this article.", "Adding an image as a background for your report page is fairly simple. I\u2019ve downloaded this photo from Unsplash and, in literally a few clicks, I would set this photo as my report page background:", "Once I\u2019ve set this image as a background, and set Transparency to 50%, my report page looks like this:", "If you wondered what happens with this image in your Power BI report, if you delete the image from your local storage, or change the file name\u2026You don\u2019t need to worry \u2014 once you\u2019ve uploaded the image to your report, it permanently stays there as part of your .pbix file!", "But, imagine that your report has 20 pages, and you need to apply previous steps of uploading and transparency setting in each of those 20 pages! Or, even worse, if you have 50 reports that need to be changed to include this image as a background\u2026", "Luckily enough, there is a quite handy solution to this challenge. I suppose that you are aware of the theme gallery within Power BI Desktop. You can choose between a whole bunch of built-in themes, but you can also import your own themes!", "Moreover, you can customize the existing theme, adjusting different parameters according to your needs. One of the things you can customize is also a Page background:", "Oh, wait\u2026I can\u2019t set an image as a background, and include it as a part of the theme:(", "But, what if I tell you that you can do that, with a little tweaking? Let me show you how you can achieve that.", "Essentially, a report theme is nothing but a JSON file. And, this means that (almost) all properties can be customized! So, I will go and save my current theme as a JSON file:", "Let\u2019s now open the file using Notepad++ and check what\u2019s in there:", "Nothing special \u2014 typical JSON file with key-value pairs. Only \u201cname\u201d property is mandatory, all the others are optional. Let\u2019s set now property for the report page background.", "As you may notice, we\u2019ve added a new code snippet that will handle the visual styles of our report theme. \u201cPage\u201d means that we want to apply this style to a page element, \u201c*\u201d instructs that this style will be applied to all report pages, and finally, we set \u201cbackground\u201d as a property to which the defined style will be applied.", "The trickiest thing is the \u201curl\u201d property. How do we set this property in the JSON file?", "Well, we\u2019ll need to quickly go out of our comfort zone and perform some workaround. This workaround requires converting an image into a Base64 scheme. This scheme will \u201cconvert\u201d a binary image data into an encoded string \u2014 and we can then use this string as our URL!", "There are a lot of free online converters and I will use this one. Once I get the encoded text, I will paste it in \u201cURL\u201d and finally set transparency to 50, like in our previous example with the manual upload.", "Let\u2019s import our customized theme into Power BI Desktop:", "And once I did that, let\u2019s check what happens once I want to create a new report page:", "As you can see, this works perfectly! No need to manually set a background image for every single page \u2014 by defining all the properties within the theme itself, we are now able to automatically apply our image on each page.", "Additionally, if we need to change existing reports\u2019 backgrounds, we would just import the customized theme and we are good to go!", "Here is my JSON code snippet, just as a helper. Of course, you should adjust it according to your needs:", "Become a member and read every story on Medium!", "Your home for data science.
