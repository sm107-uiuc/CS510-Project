Finally, I\u2019m using \u201cPython for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp\u201d by Jose Portilla on Udemy to learn NumPy, Pandas, matplotlib, and other Python libraries for data science.", "In the past few weeks, I\u2019ve tended to focus on only one of those until I got stuck, and then jump ship to work on one of the others. For some that workflow could be productive, but I could feel myself using it to avoid the feelings of self-doubt that bubbled up when working on the hard things, and I ended up reminding myself of this quote:", "So last week, I set up specific learning goals for each of my courses for each week. I think it\u2019ll be easier to avoid the two suboptimal learning behaviors I\u2019d observed in myself: avoiding hard things altogether in favor of easier ones, or \u2014 at the other small end of the usefulness bell curve \u2014 spending too much time on hard things, making zero progress on anything else. In machine learning terms, I need to literally tune my own learning rate higher to avoid getting stuck in a local minimum!", "Each week, I plan to do:One lesson from fast.aiOne unit of stats0.5\u20131 sections of the Python course (some sections are brief, and others are full projects)Read one deep or machine learning paper", "When I really don\u2019t want to work on something, I use the Pomodoro technique: I only require myself to work on it for 25 minutes, then I can stop or take a break. The first 25 minutes nearly always gets me over the emotional resistance hump, and I have an easier time keeping going after that. This technique helped me get through homework during grad school, too!", "So last week, I did Lesson 4 of \u201cPractical Deep Learning for Coders\u201d by fast.ai, and you can read about my experience with that in detail here. I also worked through the \u201cExploring Bivariate Data\u201d and \u201cStudy Design\u201d units on the Khan Academy stats course, learning how to calculate and interpret least-squares regression lines, and about experimental vs. observational studies.", "In the \u201cPython for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp\u201d course on Udemy, I completed Sections 5\u20137, reviewing the NumPy syntax I learned in the deeplearning.ai \u201cDeep Learning\u201d course on Coursera, and practicing querying data with Pandas. I\u2019ve previously learned some SQL and hadn\u2019t realized how much Pandas and SQL had in common. Then I started wondering when one is better to use than the other, and found this post very helpful:", "Which tool to use depends on where your data is, what you want to do with it, and what your own strengths are. If your data is already in a file format, there is no real need to use SQL for anything. If your data is coming from a database, then you should go through the following questions to understand how much you should use SQL.", "The paper I chose to read \u2014 \u201cLearning Gentle Object Manipulation with Curiosity-Driven Deep Reinforcement Learning\u201d \u2014 came from DeepMind, and was written by Sandy H. Huang, Martina Zambelli, Jackie Kay, Murilo F. Martins, Yuval Tassa, Patrick M. Pilarski, and Raia Hadsell. You can check out the notes I made and the questions I had while reading it here. The work revolved around teaching a robot to handle objects gently, using deep reinforcement learning.", "This was my first time reading a deep or machine learning paper, and it turned out to have been a fantastic choice. The overall idea is intuitive even for a layman, and even better, the simulations and video of the actual experiments make the methods and results simple to understand. But I still had many questions as I read, and learned a lot.", "I hadn\u2019t read much about reinforcement learning until this paper, and I didn\u2019t understand how it would help. Rewards? Penalties? Why? Why both? I didn\u2019t understand why a robot would need to be \u201crewarded\u201d for executing a particular task, much less given a \u201cpain penalty.\u201d It seems obvious now that I get it, but this is really the \u201clearning\u201d aspect of the project: if we know ahead of time exactly the amount of force the robot should use to handle an object, we\u2019re done here. But if we\u2019d like to be able to have the robot handle an object it hasn\u2019t encountered before, without our having to specify an amount of force for every action it takes, we have to have a means of letting it know when it\u2019s gotten it right.", "When an instance of the learner (the \u201cagent\u201d) was trained with only a reward for making contact with an object, it would frequently do so with excessive force. Training with only a penalty for excessive force, however, resulted in agents that would avoid contact with the object altogether. Taking a cue from child development research, the authors instituted a reward for an agent when it predicted the amount of force it should use incorrectly, and in true Goldilocks fashion, the combination of the three reward types was the winner. The agent was \u201ccurious\u201d about the pain penalty, and motivated to explore varying amounts of force to find the one that was \u201cjust right\u201d.", "It\u2019s difficult to convey how fun this paper was to read, and how fascinating it was to get a glimpse of how human psychology is being used to advance AI. We call it artificial \u201cintelligence\u201d because we explicitly understand this kind of thoughtfulness as a human endeavor, but it\u2019s incredible to see how that\u2019s actually implemented.", "I\u2019m a mathematics lecturer at CSU East Bay, and an aspiring data scientist.
