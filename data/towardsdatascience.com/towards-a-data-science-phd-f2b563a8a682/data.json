My choice of university was the Australian National University (ANU). At the time of my writing, it is ranked (overall) 50th in the 2020 Times University Ranking. Beyond the mere rank of the university, there were many other considerations during the university selection. Moreover, there are few more things that one might think before, during and after application for a studentship to pursue higher studies. So I decided to share my experiences, as one might someday find this useful. So here\u2019s some heads up. It\u2019s not hard if you give it an honest try!", "This is a critical decision for anyone who would want to study after graduation. Few of my key considerations in selecting the country were;", "Data science is a vast field and one of the most trending fields at present. Knowledge from fields such as computer science and statistics are made use of in data science to analyse data and learn interesting things about the data. Therefore, mathematics, statistics and computer science will be core knowledge areas to be discovered in a potential PhD career.", "Doing a PhD in data science could mean that you\u2019ll be conducting research in areas such as biology, medicine, economics, finance, agriculture and engineering but not limited to these. With the development of methods to generate and store data, all of these fields produce loads and loads of data creating a large number of research opportunities. Despite the specific field, a PhD in data science would involve conducting methodology development based on collected data. However, the final objective of any PhD is to contribute to the knowledge of humanity through innovation methodologies, etc. In gist, it can be concluded that at a higher level of abstraction, any speciality will have a point that involves data-driven innovation.", "It is always the first step to find a prolific staff member to supervise you. When I was looking for supervisors I looked for Monash University, ANU and the University of Melbourne. It is always easy to find a supervisor if you know, what might be your area of interest (as this is something very hard to define at once). First things first! Visit the university website or rather google \u201csupervisors at Monash/ANU/Unimelb/UNSW/QUT\u201d or any university you might like. You might find the following links useful.", "This is one of the most difficult and confusing things that you might have to do before you start studies. To make things easier, let\u2019s narrow down this step as follows.", "The initial point of contact is most of the times (if not always) through an email. Make sure your email makes a good impression! Here\u2019s a sample!", "I am YOUR NAME, from YOUR INSTITUTION. I completed my bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science and Engineering last December and I am looking forward for suitable opportunities to follow a PhD. I am interested in doing my higher studies in RESEARCH AREA and I came across your profile as a prolific researcher in the field of RESEARCH AREA.", "I have read about your research work in the field of RESEARCH AREA. EXTEND THIS EXPRESSING YOUR AREA OF INTEREST BY MENTIONING SOME OF YOUR POTENTIAL SUPERVISORS INTERESTING WORK. I would like to inquire whether you would like to supervise a project on RESEARCH AREA or a related field or have ideas for a project that you would like to have a Ph.D. student working on.", "ADD A SMALL SENTENCE MENTIONING YOUR FINAL YEAR HONOURS PROJECT, ONE OR TWO KEY PUBLICATIONS, AND YOUR CURRENT STATUS", "MENTION YOUR ACADEMIC STANDING (GPA/RANK) SO THAT YOU SEEM TO BE COMPETENT AND SOME OF YOUR MAJOR ACHIEVEMENTS", "My resume and academic transcript are attached for further reference.", "I appreciate your valuable time. Looking forward to a favorable reply.", "I have left my links to resume and transcript to make it easy for the reader. However, you might note that my transcript is not complete (not official). Because it doesn\u2019t have to be. As long as you can expose an original copy in a later date you are okay to show your current status as it is. The resume should be in academic style and make sure it is plain and easy to read for a busy person. Make everything SHORT but SWEET!", "I thought of sharing this information as it is confusing at the beginning. If you aren\u2019t into Aussie studies, skip this. All the best!
