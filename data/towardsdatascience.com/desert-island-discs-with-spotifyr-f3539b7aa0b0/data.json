I may be slightly over-hyping this notion but when considering his somewhat limited cognitive faculties, I thought what he proposed was quite neat. Having both been great fans of the BBC Desert Island Discs series, he pointed out that he reckoned he would get more out of knowing the favourite music of his loved ones than celebrities. To me, this made perfect sense. We have an actual affinity for our friends and family, an adoration and understanding that we could never associate with someone that we have seen on the television but never actually met. The hypothesis was that by knowing the favourite music of our loved ones we may understand what makes them tick.", "Firstly, Sam got all of our friends and family to send him their respective desert island discs, which he curated into individual Spotify playlists. After listening to each playlist, Sam came to me and asked if I could assist him in pulling together a piece \u2014 written or otherwise \u2014 that could display all the information about the desert island discs he received; to both compare against one another whilst also determining whether commonalities between compilations existed. I agreed to help and with some great assistance from the Spotify API and their developer documentation was able to pull together some really interesting information about the playlists of our friends and families.", "This article will display the steps taken to derive the information presented in our findings whilst also discussing the actual results we synthesised. Although you may not actually know the people we used for this piece, it shows you some of the Spotify API functionality and how this can be used to compare the music taste of the ones you love.", "Just a quick FYI: Part of this post concerns technical setup and the code used to compute the findings for this research. For anyone that is less bothered about such technical aspects and is interested in seeing the results from the analysis (although this is a data science blog first and foremost), you can skip to the \u201cfindings\u201d section.", "Nearly all of the heavy lifting needed to conduct this sort of analysis is done by the Spotify API, which I found surprisingly malleable. Not only can you manipulate and organise the data in lots of cool and interesting ways, but Spotify are pretty liberal with the metadata they allow you to access and there are a variety of performance metrics attached to each track (see \u201cmetrics\u201d below).", "This section is going to breakdown the steps that were taken to create a data-frame with all of our friend\u2019s compilations in order to conduct exploratory analysis, which can be easily replicated and developed.", "Firstly, you\u2019re going to need to install all of the packages that will be used for pulling from the Spotify API and formatting, arranging and plotting your data.", "To access the Spotify Web API you will first need to set up a Dev account. This will give you your Client ID and Client Secret. Once you have those, you can pull your access token into R with get_spotify_access_token(). The simplest way to authenticate is to set your credentials to the inputs in Sys.setenv: SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET. The default arguments to get_spotify_access_token() (and all other functions in this package) will relate to these. Fill in the hashed out values with your unique client ID and secret Spotify generates:", "As mention previously, the Spotify API provides multiple useful functions, which I urge you to check out. But this piece is about desert island discs so will concern the organisation and binding of multiple playlists. As previously mentioned, we got our friends and family to send their songs over, which we assembled into individual playlists in Spotify. We then used the get_playlist_audio_features() function, using the playlist_uri (which can be found on any public playlist). It\u2019s best practice to assign each API call to a new vector and create a new column called \u2018$curator\u2019, which will allow you to segment findings by each individual playlist and their creator. You can then rbind() all of the playlists to create a new data frame (DID_project) that you can use later to explore the data:", "Now, this is where it gets cool. Spotify attaches a load of metadata to each track, including: track duration, track popularity, release date of both track and album, tempo and the key the song was composed in. As well as that, Spotify provides a number of metrics associated with each song, which were used for subsequent analysis. You can view how Spotify calculate all of their metrics in their developer docs.", "Here is what our new data frame looks like with all the related audio features and metrics:", "Now we can arrange the data with respect to these metrics and start looking at how each track and playlist performed. It\u2019s imperative you pull through the track name, the metric and then the curator (this is so we can assess the \u201cperformance\u201d of each desert island disc in relation to other playlists). You can swap out the arrange() parameter to any metric of interest and select accordingly. Because we received 129 tracks in total, I narrowed it down to the top 25 performing tracks for each audio feature:", "Below is the syntax for a number of useful plots that were used in the findings that are discussed below.", "Plotting all curators against track popularity (using density ridges) and pirateplot(), respectively:", "Plotting all curators against track duration:", "Plotting metrics and the top 25 tracks in relation to these audio features:", "Plotting a correlalogram to assess the statistical relationship between metrics/audio features, using ggstatsplot():", "This is how Spotify classify track popularity in their docs:", "The popularity of a track is a value between 0 and 100, with 100 being the most popular. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are.Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. Duplicate tracks (e.g. the same track from a single and an album) are rated independently. Artist and album popularity is derived mathematically from track popularity. Note that the popularity value may lag actual popularity by a few days: the value is not updated in real time", "As play-count seems to be the primary measure for assessing track popularity it could be said that the higher each person scores for this metric, the more widely popular their taste is in respect to the rest of Spotify. Based on that theory, the lower the score, the more niche their taste is. (And I can assure you as a close friend of most of the curator\u2019s in this analysis, Spotify have done a good job of assessing track popularity). Overall the most popular songs selected came from Rachel and Helen, with songs from Toploader, Pulp and Foo Fighters. Unsurprisingly, Tristan had the least popular music taste (or most niche, depending on how you see it). If you knew Tristan, this will make sense. His lowest scoring songs included: Somewhere in My Heart by Aztec Camera, Advice For The Young At Heart by Tears for Fears and Bizarre Love Triangle by New Order. It seems that despite these late-80s New-Wave pop songs having a special place in Tristan\u2019s heart, they remain a song for a rainy day (or a house party in Shoreditch) in the eyes of Spotify.", "Interestingly, Joe had the most varied music taste in terms of its general popularity, with songs ranging from 11\u201372; which may suggest that Joe is open to listening to music at both ends of the popular-niche spectrum. Which is funny as there\u2019s an on-going joke in our family that \u201cJoe only listens to Motown\u201d. (Though it should be mentioned that the variance observed for this metric is a measure of the track's popularity in the Spotify-universe and not the diversity of the song selection, so this hypothesis is still yet to be rejected).", "This can be visualised in a few nifty ways (code referenced in methods):", "Now, this is a funny one. Everybody\u2019s desert island discs seem to fall somewhere between the 3\u20136 minute region on average, which is to be expected. This data would be considered somewhat normally distributed if it wasn\u2019t for Simon, who included two songs in his playlist that caused the data to skew. Simon included the two longest songs out of all of the desert island discs we received: The Gates of Delirium by Yes (~ 22 minutes) and Shhh / Peaceful \u2014 LP Mix by Miles Davis (~ 18 minutes). Both songs add to a hefty 40 minutes and one might argue this is enough for its own playlist (if you fancy 40 minutes of prog-rock and jazz that is!).", "It seems Will has the greatest range of tempos \u2014 as measured by beats per minute \u2014 in his playlist. This may well be a reflection of his ability to lift weights to his favourite Northern rock bands in the morning, whilst being able wind down to some trip-hop after a tough day as a quantity surveyor. (Or more likely, it\u2019s a statistical coincidence due to the nominal sample size used in this analysis).", "It seems Cahal favours the faster songs. Perhaps this is what he\u2019s listening to whilst he stomps around his house with little consideration for the impact his heavy gait has on his surroundings?", "Helen\u2019s playlist forms an almost perfect distribution around the 120 bpm mark. Given that this is the typical tempo of a \u201cpop song\u201d, these findings are supported by the track popularity figure as seen above, where Helen\u2019s songs were some of the most widely popular on Spotify.", "Emily\u2019s data also forms a nice bell-curve shape but around the 110 bpm mark. Perhaps her preference for the slower songs is what dictates her ever calming presence and relaxed demeanour whilst she designs quintessentially British table-cloths for M and S.", "This is how Spotify determines energetic music:", "Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy. The distribution of values for this feature look like this:", "Below displays the 25 most loud songs selected by the curators in this desert island disc analysis:", "This is how Spotify determines energetic music:", "The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db. The distribution of values for this feature look like this:", "Below displays the 25 most loud songs selected by the curators in this desert island disc analysis. Here is how Spotify determine this metric:", "Despite the nominal sample size used in this project, I couldn\u2019t resist playing around with some statistical analysis. This section will briefly discuss two pieces of analysis I conducted on all the playlist data we collected.", "I found a pretty cool piece of functionality in the pirateplot() function in the yarrr() package, where you can create a custom variable which encompasses the combined effect of multiple other metrics. Considering desert island discs is meant to be the actual music you would listen to when stranded on a desert island, I created a variable called \u201cDID Score\u201d, which I feel best reflects the sort of music you may elect to listen to if you really were alone for a prolonged period of time. This output is the combined score of the following variables that were pulled from the Spotify API:", "Valence: A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry). The distribution of values for this feature look like this:", "Danceability: describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A value of 0.0 is least danceable and 1.0 is most danceable. The distribution of values for this feature look like this:", "Below reflects how all curators performed for their DID Score (sorry Tristan!):", "I had a little play around to see if there was any sort of correlative associations between any of the audio features/metrics that were pulled from the Spotify API. Interestingly, no independent variable was correlated to track popularity. Loudness and energy were significantly correlated (0.74). As were energy and danceability (0.36). Unsurprisingly, a negative correlation exists between both energy and acousticness (-0.71) and loudness and acousticness (-0.54). This more than anything is a fairly good indicator that Spotify\u2019s classification on these audio features is pretty tight. It is, however, worth mentioning that this analysis was only performed on the 129 data points used from the playlists we were sent for desert island discs. It could well be that by increasing sample size Spotify\u2019s audio features \u2014 either independently or as part of a multiple linear model \u2014 are able to predict track popularity. This however, remains to be elucidated.", "Music is an extremely important aspect of our lives. We may not share identical taste to the man next to us on the tram, the woman on the tube and certainly not with the old lady who takes ages to checkout at the CO-OP, but what we do share is a mutual understanding that music is able to take us places. Some music motivates us for playing football on a Saturday, some music makes us reflect on a time we wish we could take back, some music takes us back to our favourite beach and in the case of any Coldplay record, some music makes us sincerely depressed or want to go to sleep.", "In an attempt to learn about the music loved by our friends and families, Sam and I were not only able to actually listen to the playlists we received and to decipher their pertinence to their curator but to visualise their importance to both the wider music community and in relation to other people\u2019s playlists. With the help from Spotify and their public API and how well integrated this is with R, I was able to conduct some really interesting exploratory analysis on the data attached to the playlists we received, and if you love either music or data even half as much as I do I sincerely recommend this exercise.", "Your home for data science.
