When I ask if it\u2019s sure it\u2019s not a woman, Siri says, \u201cSorry, I don\u2019t really know.\u201d", "Though Siri won\u2019t tell you (or isn\u2019t sure) what its gender is, its default voice is a woman, just like Amazon\u2019s Alexa, Microsoft\u2019s Cortana, and Google\u2019s Assistant. Siri, like its digital counterparts, is designed to be summoned at a beck and call and perform tasks like giving you directions to the nearest supermarket, pulling up movie times or telling you tell you how much Miley Cyrus is worth. You can joke with it, and give it compliments. But you can also yell and insult it (\u201cThat doesn\u2019t sound good,\u201d Siri says, when you say \u201cI hate you.\u201d) without it lashing back.", "The use of digital assistants is growing rapidly. According to an NPR and Edison Research report, the prevalence of voice speakers like Amazon\u2019s Echo grew 78 percent in American households in 2018. By 2023, more than 8 billion people are estimated to be using the technology. In the United States, almost all mainstream digital assistants are voiced by women.", "That\u2019s not a coincidence. Research shows that consumers respond more positively to a women\u2019s voice in the kinds of service roles performed by digital assistants like Siri. And as the prevalence of digital assistants grows, some people fear that the overwhelming use of a women\u2019s voice in a subservient role reinforces the stereotype that women are best suited for service jobs that require unflinching obedience and patience.", "\u201cWe haven\u2019t fixed sexism or racism or any other -ism in humanity,\u201d said Julia Rhodes Davis, director of partnerships at the Partnership on AI, an AI ethics research and advocacy group. \u201cSo it\u2019s going to be hard to fix it in computer systems without fixing it entirely in humanity as well.\u201d", "Tech companies are grappling with questions over the ethics of data privacy, election manipulation and mental health, and researchers say AI developers will also need to also be cognizant of the impact AI can have on society\u2019s views on gender. AI is becoming an increasingly powerful tool, not only to help us with everyday tasks like cooking but also to pick job candidates and set salaries, police cities and analyze our health.", "What happens when AI picks up our social biases about gender?", "Humans love to assign gender to robots. Some of the most famous fictional robots, like C-3PO and R2-D2, from \u201cStar Wars,\u201d HAL-9000, from \u201c2001: A Space Odyssey,\u201d and Terminator, from the film of the same name, are assigned a male gender through their voices or physical construction.", "The robots we\u2019re more likely to encounter today probably perform some sort of service task. Pepper, a four-foot tall, humanoid-looking robot with arms and hands, is popping up in malls, airports and hotels to help with hospitality duties like answering questions and giving directions. Roomba is a disk-shaped vacuum that scurries along floors, sucking up our messes. And then there\u2019s K5, the human-sized, egg-shaped security robot made famous for throwing itself into a Washington, D.C. fountain.", "Many robots don\u2019t come pre-programmed with a developer-acknowledged gender. Like Siri, if you ask Pepper if it\u2019s a boy or a girl, it\u2019ll dodge the question and say something about how it\u2019s just a robot. It\u2019s high-pitched voice sounds like it could belong to an 8-year-old of either gender. The 11th page of Pepper\u2019s user guide, in large text, is devoted entirely to explaining that the robot doesn\u2019t have a gender. Still, that doesn\u2019t stop people from questioning the robot\u2019s identity, including CNN\u2019s Samuel Burke, whose second question on a \u201cdate\u201d with Pepper was whether it was a boy or a girl.", "Researchers at Stanford University\u2019s Gendered Innovations in Science, Health & Medicine, Engineering, and Environment, looked into the intersection of gender and robotics, including why roboticists gender certain machines and why humans try to assign gender to robots. Its research found that people assign gender to robots because it makes humans more willing to comply with robot tasks, and because gender is a primary social category among humans.", "But that also means humans can apply our social biases to how we develop and interact robots, the study found.", "Roomba, unlike Pepper, has no human-like traits: There\u2019s no voice, no body, no apparent way to tell if one Roomba is more masculine or feminine than another. But when Heidi Waterhouse, a technical writer who hosted a panel on gender and robots at a convention in 2009, asked people what gender they thought their Roomba was, many said it was female because it did domestic work, according to Gizmodo. Others said it didn\u2019t have a gender until they got mad at it \u2014 then it was female.", "We\u2019re not competing for sidewalk space and airplane seats with humanoid robots like Pepper just yet (probably because Pepper costs $25,000). But digital assistants like Siri are among the most widely-used artificially intelligent service devices. Siri alone is used by more than 500 million people worldwide, Apple says.", "Digital assistants don\u2019t have any physical attributes, like Pepper, so users have to apply identifying characteristics through the assistants\u2019 voices. Siri comes pre-loaded with a \u201cfemale\u201d voice, which the user can manually switch to a \u201cmale\u201d voice in the phone\u2019s settings (the male version of Siri wasn\u2019t released until two years after the female version).", "Though Siri and Microsoft\u2019s Cortana won\u2019t acknowledge it, they were voiced by women and developed with feminine traits. The word \u201cSiri,\u201d for example, is a Scandinavian name that means \u201cbeautiful victory,\u201d and is traditionally given to women. Cortana was named after a highly-sexualized female character in the popular Halo video games (the game\u2019s director had to settle the debate over whether the Cortana character was naked by insisting Cortana couldn\u2019t be nude because she\u2019s a robot).", "\u201cPeople have a tendency psychologically to project personas onto home assistants with voices, whether they\u2019re doing that consciously or not,\u201d Carpenter said. \u201cWhen you name something, you\u2019re giving people cues about how to interact with it and what communication model they should be using.\u201d", "The tasks digital assistants perform \u2014 scheduling appointments, answering questions or setting reminders, for example \u2014 are historically women\u2019s roles in United States society. In the last U.S. Census, in 2010, 96 percent of people who listed their job as \u201csecretaries and administrative assistants\u201d were women, according to the Huffington Post.", "A 2017 study conducted by researchers in Peru and Japan found that people preferred a female voice for guidance over a male voice. And the tech companies that developed Alexa and Cortana have acknowledged that their own internal research shows that people are just happier using the technology when it has a women\u2019s voice.", "Anna Kristina Hultgren, a senior lecturer on the English language and applied linguistics at The Open University in the United Kingdom, said that\u2019s no surprise. People cognitively associate certain genders with specific tasks, and react negatively when a voice doesn\u2019t match their pre-conceived notion of a gender role.", "\u201cWe would probably expect somebody working in a call center or as a nurse, or in some sort of caring, nurturing profession, to be a women,\u201d Hultgren said. \u201cWe see a women\u2019s voice as more appropriate and suitable for that kind of job.\u201d", "Traditional gender roles are changing, at least in terms of voice, said Adrienne Hancock, an assistant professor at The George Washington University who studies gender and voice. It\u2019s becoming more acceptable for cisgender men to have a higher-pitched voice and not be considered gay, she said. And women are speaking at a lower pitch than they did 30 years ago.", "\u201cI think as more variability is accepted in cisgender women and maybe more variability is accepted in cisgender men, that the gap between the two is going to get smaller and smaller to the point that an ambiguous voice or a voice in between the two is not going to be so far from what people are used to hearing and accepting,\u201d Hancock said.", "Cue \u201cQ,\u201d a genderless voice assistant released in March in part to prove that digital assistants could transcend the entrenched binary-gendered world of existing AI technology.", "The Denmark-based team of sound engineers, researchers and academics developed Q so that it doesn\u2019t sound quite like a woman, or a man. Nis N\u00f8rgaard, a sound designer on the project, told WIRED that the team tweaked a person\u2019s voice so that it fell between 145 and 175 hertz, which human ears generally perceive as gender neutral. The result is a voice that is neither male nor female.", "I\u2019m a cisgender man, and to me, listening to Q is a little uncomfortable. The first time I heard it, I ignored what the voice was saying while trying to determine whether it sounded like it was closer to a female or male voice. When I showed the voice to a handful of other cisgender men and women, they also described it as \u201cuncomfortable.\u201d", "\u201cWe as human beings are incredibly hooked up on putting people into boxes,\u201d Hultgren said, adding that humans are engrained to think in binary terms when trying to identify a person\u2019s gender based on their voice or appearance.", "But Carpenter, who worked on the Q project, said people are beginning to accept that gender may not be split between man and woman.", "\u201cWhat we\u2019ve continued to discover is that people identify their gender in different ways because gender, unlike sexual biological characteristics, is socially constructed,\u201d Carpenter said. The point of Q\u2019s development was not necessarily so that it would be adopted commercially on a widespread scale. The developers just wanted to prove that it could be done, she said.", "\u201cWe wanted to contribute to global conversations about gender and ethics and inclusivity in AI and technology,\u201d Carpenter said.", "AI development itself at large tech companies, though, is not representative of the society that uses the technology.", "According to a 2018 WIRED/Element AI study, only 12 percent of machine learning developers were women. That\u2019s a problem, because social biases toward certain identities, including gender and race, tend to be replicated in AI and machine learning.", "Facial recognition technology, which is used to unlock newer smartphone models, for example, is accurate with white men 99 percent of time, according to The New York Times. That number drops to 65 percent accuracy when the technology is working to identify a darker-skinned woman.", "Google\u2019s facial recognition software, which helped people organize photos, faced scrutiny in 2015 after it repeatedly labelled black people \u201cgorillas.\u201d And Amazon\u2019s automated job recruiting tool had to be shut down after it began recommending men for jobs at much higher rates than women, according to Reuters.", "\u201cWe all have biases and these biases then end up in systems,\u201d said Matthias Spielkamp, executive director of AlgorithmWatch, a research organization that analyzes the impacts of algorithmic decision making on society. \u201cIt could be because the developer of the system is biased, and they don\u2019t really recognize that there\u2019s a problem with the model they created.\u201d", "Rhode Davis, who works at the Partnership on AI, has a recommendation: Diversify AI development teams, and include community input early in AI technology\u2019s development process. Decision-making done by a homogenous group is likely to replicate its own bias, Rhodes Davis said. Diverse development teams that include people impacted by technology can help prevent AI issues before they happen, because people could raise concerns about the technology before it\u2019s released, Rhodes Davis added.", "In an industry that prioritizes getting products to market quickly, before competitors, there may not be much room for deep research, Carpenter said. When it comes to AI, research that is rigorous takes time. That goes against a development model at large companies that prioritizes speed, she added.", "\u201cA lot of times I think their idea is get something out there, and then we\u2019ll fix things later,\u201d Carpenter said."], "all_outgoing_urls": [{"url":
