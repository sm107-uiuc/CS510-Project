If you\u2019re familiar with NLP and its tools, continue reading!", "POS or part-of-speech tagging is the technique of assigning special labels to each token in text, to indicate its part of speech, and usually even other grammatical connotations, which can later be used in text analysis algorithms. For example, for the sentence -", "\u2018She\u2019 would the POS tag of pronoun, \u2018is\u2019 would get an article tag, \u2018reading\u2019 a verb tag, \u2018a\u2019 would get an article tag and \u2018book\u2019 would get a noun tag. We can then do a search for all verbs which would pull up the word reading, and also use these tags in other algorithms.", "Some of the important uses of POS tags are -", "An entity, or a part of text that is of interest would be of great use if it could be recognized, named and called to identify similar entities. A CRF is a sequence modeling algorithm which is used to identify entities or patterns in text, such as POS tags. This model not only assumes that features are dependent on each other, but also considers future observations while learning a pattern. In terms of performance, it is considered to be the best method for entity recognition.", "Since these models take into account previous data, we use features which are modelled from the data to feed into the CRF. These feature functions express certain characteristic of the sequence that the data point represents, such as the tag sequence noun -> verb -> adjective. When y is the hidden state and x is the observed variable, the CRF formula is given by -", "Normalization is performed since the output is a probability. The weight estimation is performed by maximum likelihood estimation(MLE) using the feature functions we define.", "In this article, we will be training a CRF using feature functions to predict POS tags and testing the model to obtain its accuracy and other metrics. To train a CRF, we will be using the sklearn-crfsuite wrapper.", "First, we import the required toolkits and libraries.", "Now we can read and store the data. We will be using the universal dependency Hindi train and test set in conllu format. We read the data as a comma-separated or CSV file. The train dataset can be found here, and the test dataset here.", "We can see a preview of the data and observe the different rows of data and their associated tags to get an idea of the preprocessing to be done and the features that can be extracted.", "Now that we have an idea of what the data looks like, let us extract some features from the dataset. The features we will be considering in this article are -", "Features are qualitative functions and can differ from person to person. Feel free to experiment with the features to see which combination gives the most accuracy. Let us extract the features from the dataset now.", "Now that we have a feature extraction function, let us get our data ready to be passed to the function. Since it is in CSV format, we convert it into sentences.", "We can now use the above 2 functions to extract features from all the sentences formed from the input CSV file.", "Let us train the CRF on the processed train set. c1 and c2 are the parameters for L1 and L2 regularization respectively, and they usually range from 0.2 to 0.3. They can be tweaked to give better results in model performance.", "We can now obtain the accuracy and other metrics of the model on the train and test datasets.", "We can see that the model has an accuracy of around 99% on the train set and 87% on the test set. Playing around with the L1 and L2 regularization parameters might help give us a better performance on the test set and prevent overfitting.", "We can also predict the top 10 most likely as well as least likely transitions in the model using the Counter module.", "I hope this article was a good introduction to CRFs, and how to build them with the sklearn crfsuite wrapper without much mathematical knowledge of their working. Apart from POS tags, CRFs can also be trained to predict other entities or patterns. The entire code used in this article, as well the datasets, can be found here.", "Your home for data science.
