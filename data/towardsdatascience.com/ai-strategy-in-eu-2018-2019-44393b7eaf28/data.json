It is now the end of December 2019 and I thought it would be great to make a recap of certain strategic initiatives within the European Union in relation to the field of artificial intelligence. In doing so I have looked at five different documents issued by the EU. This is of course not a comprehensive review, rather it is an attempt to take certain of the varieties of documents issued by the EU over the last few years and give brief introductions to what they contain. I do this firstly to learn; secondly, so citizens in member countries of the EU can pursue the strategy more coordinated; and thirdly so that those outside the EU interested in policy may get a foundation in where the EU is currently headed in terms of their investment in ethical artificial intelligence.", "The five documents are as follows:", "I will go through each document underneath starting with the declaration.", "25 European countries signed a Declaration of cooperation on Artificial Intelligence on the 10th of April in 2018. Norway was part of this, although they are not an EU member (rather part of the EEA \u2014 European Economic Area). This was said to build on the pre-existing investment and community in Europe.", "It set out boosting technology and industrial capacity through access to public sector data. Addressing socio-economic changes, especially in the labour market. Ensuring an adequate legal and ethical framework building on fundamental rights and values, as well as transparency and accountability.", "The commitment that \u201cMember States agree to\u201d (I have simplified at times):", "This communication has a more positive slant in terms of what AI can solve and gives an introduction to what AI is. The message is that AI is transforming society like the steam engine or electricity. It says a solid European framework is required.", "This report says that EU should have a \u2018coordinated approach\u2019 towards AI for good and for all. It suggests to do so through:", "It mentions the commitment in the declaration. In almost the same breath it puts particular emphasis on competition, leaving no one behind and EU\u2019s sustainable approach to technologies. An approach that benefits people and society as a whole.", "It goes back to the review of the Digital Single Market strategy in 2017 where the invitation to explore the EU approach to AI partly originated (with civil law rules to robotics for example). The three points there were on (1) boosting tech capacity, (2) preparing for socio-economic changes and (3) ensuring ethical and legal framework.", "A different part of the communication on EU\u2019s position in the competitive international landscape outlines the increased investment in unclassified AI research by US and China, thus making it clear that EU is \u2018behind in private investments\u2019. There was an expressed wish to create an environment that stimulates investments. EU apparently produces one-fourth of the professional service robots. \u201cEurope cannot miss the train\u201d and the benefits of adopting AI are widely recognised \u2014 a few projects funded by EU are mentioned (agri, healthcare, infrastructure and manufacturing).", "In outlining the way forward they say that a joint effort by private and public is needed by 2020 and beyond. It outlines an increased investment from around EUR 4\u20135 billion towards EUR 20 billion over the following decade.", "This way stepping up investments is stated. They outline a growth towards this number by the end of 2020. This report also mentions supporting excellence centres (and digital innovation hubs). A mention of the \u2018AI-on-demand platform\u2019 is made here that can help facilitate collaboration between the more than 400 digital innovation hubs. It mentions that hubs focused on AI will be created.", "Toward 2020 they will invest 1.5 billion in research and innovation; strengthening excellence centres; and a toolbox for potential users.

In the last paragraph, there is additionally a question of intellectual property rights. Draft ethics guidelines were to be developed towards the end of the year. Safety and liability was mentioned leading into the empowerment of individuals through guidance document on the product liability directive in light of technological development by mid-2019.

Ending with the wish to place the power of AI at the service of human progress.", "The documents that I examine related to ethics and specific policy, as well as investments, were put together by the Independent High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence (AI HLEG). Therefore, I thought it may be good to explain first what AI HLEG is, their role and their members. There is a page for AI HLEG on the EU website.", "\u201cFollowing an open selection process, the Commission has appointed 52 experts to a High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence, comprising representatives from academia, civil society, as well as industry.\u201d", "They have a general objective to support the implementation of the European Strategy on Artificial Intelligence. Thus it is related to policy development, ethical, legal and societal issues related to AI including the socio-economic challenges.

As such you could say in some sense it is what is it built on in terms of values, how do we build it and how do we know what we have built is good or not. They outline that trustworthy AI should be (1) lawfully compliant; (2) ethical adhering to values; (3) robust from a technical and social perspective. If tensions arise between these components: \u201c\u2026society should endeavour to align them.\u201d", "One should develop, deploy and use AI systems in a way that adheres to the ethical principles of respect for human autonomy, prevention of harm, fairness, and explicability.", "Tensions between these should be resolved too when they appear. Situations involving vulnerable groups should be prioritised, within this consideration we find for example children, disabled, and asymmetries of power (employee/employer and business/consumer). While bringing benefit AI systems pose certain risks, certain things might be hard to measure such as impact on democracy, rule of law and the human mind. There has to be measures taken to mitigate risk.", "There are seven requirements that AI systems should meet through both technical and non-technical methods.", "Technical and non-technical methods have top be considered to ensure implementation of those requirements. Fostering innovation, communication in a clear manner to stakeholders, facilitating traceability and auditability of AI systems. Adopting trustworthy AI assessment list can be useful and adapting it to specific cases keeping in mind that such lists are not exhaustive.", "Mainly in short points we could say that according to the report there are three components of trustworthy AI:", "Each of the three are necessary, but not sufficient.", "Ideally, all three work in harmony and overlap in their operation. In practice, however, there may be tension s between these elements (e.g. at times the scope and content of existing law might be out of step with ethical norms ). It is our individual and collective responsibility as a society to work towards ensuring that all three components help to secure Trustworthy AI .", "They talk of this in the report as \u2018responsible competitiveness\u2019 in a global framework. Stakeholders can voluntarily use these guidelines as a method to operationalise their commitment. They argue that different situations raise different challenges (music recommendation system vs. critical medical treatments). Thus the guidelines have to be adapted to different situations. As mentioned people are invited to pilot the Trustworthy AI assessment list that operationalise this framework.", "These Guidelines articulate a framework for achieving Trustworthy AI based on fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter ), and in relevant international human rights law .", "Below, I sum up Trustworthy AI\u2019s three components.", "(I) Lawful: AI does not operate in a lawless world. It is important to consider EU primary law: the Treaties of the European and its Charter of Fundamental Rights. Additionally EU secondary law such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR); the Product Liability Directive; the Regulation on the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data; anti-discrimination Directives; consumer law and safety and health at work Directives; the UN Human Rights treaties and the Council of Europe conventions (such as the convention on Human Rights), and numerous EU Member State laws. Then various domain laws apply. The guidelines does not mainly deal with these and none of the text should be regarded as legal advice.", "(II) Ethical AI: laws are not always up to speed with technical developments, and can be out of step with ethical norms or not suited to addressing certain issues.", "(III) Robust AI: individuals and society must be confident AI systems will not cause any intentional harm. Systems should perform in a safe, secure and reliable manner, and safeguards should be foreseen to prevent any unintended adverse impacts. This is needed both from a technical and social perspective.", "The following model is used to display the approach in the guideline document:", "The report frames AI ethics as a subfield of applied ethics relating it to the EU Agenda 2030. It speaks as well of building an ethical culture and mind-set through public debate, education and practical learning.", "The fundamental rights mentioned are the (1) respect for human dignity; (2) freedom of the individual; (3) respect for democracy, justice and the rule of law; (4) equality, non-discrimination and solidarity; (5) citizens\u2019 rights.", "It further outlines the four principles mentioned earlier.", "Human autonomy: following human-centric design principles and leave options for meaningful human choice and human oversight over work processes in AI systems. It should aim for the creation of meaningful work.", "Prevention of harm: it should not exacerbate harm to human beings so attention must be paid to systems where power asymmetries of information can arise. Preventing harm also entails the consideration of the natural environment and all living beings.", "Fairness: development and deployment must be fair. This has to be a substantive and procedural dimension. It should increase societal fairness and equal opportunity to balance competing interests and objectives. In order to seek redress against decisions the entity accountable for the decision must be identifiable and the process of making a decision should be explicable.", "Explicability: processes need to be transparent, capabilities communicated, explainable to those directly and indirectly affected. Explanation is not always possible according to the report (these so called \u2018black box\u2019 examples) in this way other measures may be required (traceability, auditability and transparent communcation on system capabilities). This is dependent on the context and severity of the consequences.", "Different stakeholder should have different roles to play.", "a. Developers should implement and apply the requirements to design and development processes;", "b. Deployers should ensure that the systems they use and the products and services they offer meet the requirements;", "c. End \u2014 users and the broader society should be informed about these requirements and able to request that the", "Systemic and individual aspects in requirements matters.", "These different aspects are described in detail within the report. Within each requirements there is a breakdown of sub-requirements, or perhaps keywords to consider.", "Human agency and oversight. Systems should support human autonomy and act as enabler to a democratic as well as equitable society by supporting user\u2019s agency. Fundamental rights can help in letting people track their personal data or increasing accessibility to education. Given the reach and capacity of AI systems, they can negatively affect fundamental rights, therefore in cases where such risks exist a fundamental rights impact assessment should be undertaken. This should be done prior to the system\u2019s development and include an evaluation of whether those risks can be reduced or justified in order to respect the freedoms of others. Moreover, mechanisms should be put into place to receive external feedback regarding AI systems that potentially infringe on fundamental rights. Users should be able to self-assess or challenge the system where reasonable. Human autonomy should be kept so that humans are not subject to a decision solely based on automated processing when this produces legal effects on users or similarly significantly affects them.", "Additionally governance mechanism such as human-in-the-loop (HITL), human-on-the-loop (HOTL), or human-in-command (HIC) approach.", "Human-in-the-loop (HITL): refers to the capability for human intervention in every decision cycle of the system, which in many cases is neither possible nor desirable.", "Human-on-the-loop (HOTL): refers to the capability for human intervention during the design cycle of the system and monitoring the system\u2019s operation.", "Human-in-command (HIC): refers to the capability to oversee the overall activity of the AI system (including its broader economic, societal, legal and ethical impact) and the ability to decide when and how to use the system in any particular situation.", "This can include the decision not to use an AI system in a particular situation. Oversight mechanisms can be required in varying degrees to support safety and control depending on the application area and potential risk.", "\u201cAll other things being equal, the less oversight a human can exercise over an AI system, the more extensive testing and stricter governance is required.\u201d", "Technical robustness and safety. According to the report this is closely linked to the principle of prevention of harm. AI systems must reliably behave as intended while minimising unintentional and unexpected harm \u2014 this should also apply to changes in operating environment or presence of other agents (one could perhaps relate this to AI Safety in an operational sense). The physical and mental integrity of humans should be ensured. Resilience to attack and security is an aspect of this, and as such AI systems needs to be protected from hacking. This includes targeting of the data (data poisoning), the model (model leakage) or the underlying infrastructure, both software and hardware. If an AI system is attacked it can lead to different decisions, or causing it to shut down. Unintended applications and potential abuse by malicious actors should be taken into account, and steps should be taken to mitigate these. Fallback plan and general safety in case of problems can be devised. This could mean switching from a statistical to a rule-based procedure, or ask a human before continuing an action. Process to clarify and assess potential risks of AI across various application areas should be established. Safety measures must be treated proactively. Accuracy or correct judgements, for example in classifying information into the proper categories. A high level of accuracy is especially crucial in situations where the AI system directly affect human lives. Reliability and reproducibility is critical to be able to scrutinise an AI system and to prevent unintended harms. Reproducibility describes whether an AI experiment exhibits the same behaviour when repeated under the same conditions. This enables scientists and policy makers to accurately describe what AI systems do. Replications files can facilitate the process of testing and reproducing behaviours.", "Privacy and data governance. According to the report, privacy is a fundamental right affected by AI systems. This means we need the right data governance, data integrity, access to protocols and data processing capability that protects privacy. Data protection is important in this regard throughout a system\u2019s lifecycle. By this, there needs to be consideration for information initially provided and generated in interactions. Digital records of human behaviour may allow AI systems to infer not only individual preferences, but also their sexual orientation, age, gender, religious or political views. Quality and integrity of data are paramount to performance of AI systems and this has to be addressed prior to training with any given data set. Integrity of the data must be ensured so that malicious data is not used in an AI system that may change its behaviour, especially with self-learning systems. Thus data sets must be tested and documented each step of the way. This should also apply to AI systems that were not developed in-house, but acquired elsewhere. In any given organisation handling data is important and data protocols governing data should be put in place. Access to data needs to be clear in conjunction with qualified personnel with the competence and need to access individual\u2019s data (not all should be allowed).", "Transparency of elements relevant to an AI system: the data, the system and the business models. Process that yields decision(s) in AI systems should be documented to the best possible standard to allow for traceability. This helps us know why an AI-decision was erroneous and in turn help prevent future mistakes enabling an easier facilitation of auditability and explainability. Explaining both technical processes and human decisions. The technical requires that decisions can be traced and understood by human beings. The report mentions a trade-offs between explainability that may reduce accuracy \u2014 however the explanation has to be adapted to the stakeholder involved (layperson, regulator, researcher). In communication AI systems should not represent themselves as humans to users, humans have the right to be informed that they are interacting with an AI system. AI must be identifiable as such and options to decide against this interaction in favour of human interaction should be provided to ensure compliance with fundamental rights. Limitations should be communicated and encompass the system\u2019s level of accuracy.", "Diversity, non-discrimination and fairness. Involvement of all affected stakeholders giving equal access through the design processes as well as equal treatment linked to the principle of fairness. Avoidance of unfair bias must be strived for, this can be against groups of people due to inadvertent historic bias, incompleteness and bad governance models. Harm can result from intentional exploitation of (consumer) biases or unfair competition and could be counteracted by putting in place oversight processes to analyse and address the system\u2019s purpose, constraints, requirements and decisions in a clear and transparent manner. Moreover hiring from diversity of backgrounds, cultures and disciplines can ensure diversity of opinions and should be encouraged. Accessibility and universal design should be made to enable use of AI products regardless of age, gender, abilities or characteristics. Access for people with disabilities is of particular importance. Therefore AI systems should not have a one-size-fits-all approach that will enable equitable access and active participation. Stakeholder participation is advisable and beneficial, this could be done throughout the system life cycle.", "Societal and environmental well-being. AI systems should be used to benefit all human beings, including future generations. Sustainability and ecological sustainability of AI systems should be encouraged and research fostered into AI solutions addressing areas of global concern, such as for instance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The system\u2019s development, deployment and use process, as well as its entire supply chain, should be assessed in this regard. The effects of these systems in regards to social impact in all areas of our lives must be monitored and considered as well. For society and democracy the effect on institutions and society must be given careful consideration, including both political decision-making and electoral contexts.", "Accountability. This last requirement complements the previous ones as it necessitates that mechanisms be put in place to ensure responsibility and accountability for AI systems and their outcomes, both before and after their development, deployment and use. Auditability entails the enablement of the assessment of algorithms, data and design processes. Evaluation must be by internal and external auditors, and the availability of such report can contribute to the trustworthiness of the technology. In applications affecting fundamental rights, including safety-critical applications, AI systems should be able to be independently audited. Ability to report on actions and respond to consequences must be ensured \u2014 minimising and reporting of negative impacts. The use of impact assessments for example through red teaming or forms of Algorithmic Impact Assessment both prior to and during the development can be helpful to minimise negative impact proportionate to risk that AI systems pose. Trade-offs when implementing these requirements may arise. Each trade-off should be reasoned and properly documented. Redress needs to happen when unjust adverse impact occurs especially with vulnerable persons or groups.", "These are the seven requirements: (1) human agency and oversight; (2) technical robustness and safety; (3) privacy and data governance; (4) transparency; (5) diversity, non-discrimination and fairness; (6) societal and environmental well-being; (7) accountability.", "In addition, there is an importance to have evaluation and justification throughout the use.

One first suggestion which I think is good is digital literacy through courses (Massive Open Online Courses \u2014 MOOCs) across Europe to provide elementary AI training. Another is to integrate AI training more closely across education levels as well as informing about educational resources online and facilitate discussions.

It was mentioned that it might be good to tailor it to different sectors. There is a question of whether the guidelines can be operationalised: AI is more than just technology. Within this discussion it was an important aspect to give incentives to requiring some form of self-assessment or externally certified practice. It was mentioned as the difference between it feeling as a test or external audit or a self-assessment. In addition a discussion of bridging ethics with current laws. Ethical approaches for large technology companies with consultancies like KPMG, Deloitte and so on is setting up teams to be able to do this in Europe according to Richard Benjamins from Telefonica.", "The EU investment in ethical AI is coordinated in guidelines and recommendations, neither are legally binding for member countries.
