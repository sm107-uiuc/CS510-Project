It provides an ease of use for beginners and researchers alike and can be used to work on different applications like, but not limited to, computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning.", "In the computer vision world, most of us are familiar with the core TensorFlow along with TensorFlow Lite and JS. They are used to run models on mobile and edge devices for the former and the web for the latter. However, TensorFlow also offers many more arcane libraries, which we will be unraveling in this article.", "Real-time models are essential for many commercial operations. The inference speed of MobileNet had shone it into the limelight even if it meant sacrificing a little on accuracy. The first thing that comes to mind for optimizing TensorFlow models is to convert it to TensorFlow lite serving. However, that does not work very well on desktops as it is optimized for ARM neon, explained in this issue, or we need to optimize the model even further. The model optimization toolkit comes to our rescue for these tasks. According to its homepage, it can be used to:", "Reduce latency and inference cost for cloud and edge devices (e.g. mobile, IoT).", "Deploy models to edge devices with restrictions on processing, memory, power consumption, network usage, and model storage space.", "Enable execution on and optimize for existing hardware or new special-purpose accelerators.", "It can be applied to already trained models as well as during training time to further optimize the solution. It offers three techniques at the time of writing with several others as work in progress to hone the models.", "The first method is weight pruning. It works by removing some connections between layers hence reducing the number of parameters and operations involved and consequently optimizing the model. It eliminates unnecessary values in the weight tensors and is performed during the training process. This is useful in reducing the size of models, which can be further decreased by post-training quantization.", "I will not go into the details and code of each function as that will make the article too long. You can refer here for further understanding and here for its code.", "Unlike pruning, which is done only during training, quantization can be done at both training and testing. Tensorflow Lite models are also quantized to use 8-bit integers instead of the 32-bit floating points used generally. This improves performance and efficiency as integer operations are much faster than floating-point operations.", "However, this comes at a price. Quantization is a lossy technique. This means that the information previously represented from -3e38 to 3e38 has to be represented from -127 to 127. During addition and multiplication operations, the 8-bit integers scale up to 32-bit integers which need to be again downscaled introducing more error. To counter this, quantization can be applied during training.", "By applying quantization during training, we are forcing the model to learn the differences that it would cause and act accordingly. The quantization error is introduced as noise and the optimizer tries to minimize it. The models trained this way have comparable accuracy to the floating-point models. It will be interesting to see the comparison of Tensorflow Lite models created this way against the normal ones.", "To read more about it refer here, and for its code, you have a look here.", "Although it is preferred to apply quantization during training, sometimes it is not feasible to do so and we may have pre-trained weights ready to use. Also, it is much easier to implement.", "More information can be found here, along with the code.", "It combines similar weights and replaces them by a single value. It can be imagined like JPEG compression. Moreover, it is lossy as well due to similar weights being interpolated to the same number. The weight matrix stores float values. Those values are converted to integers with a lookup table containing the clustered numbers are stored. This reduces the space required as integers require less space to store, and a limited amount of floats are left.", "As seen in the example below, sixteen float-32 values are assigned to four float-32 centroids, and the layer weights are converted to integer values. The larger the weight matrices the greater is the savings.", "Clustering is applied to fully trained models to find the centroids. Then any compression tool can be used to reduce the size of models. To read about it detail refer here, along with its implementation.", "Different techniques can be combined to further reduce latency and many more approaches are planned as discussed in their roadmap.", "TensorFlow graphics aims to combine computer vision and computer graphics for solving complex 3D tasks. A computer graphics workflow requires 3D objects and their absolute positioning in the scene, a description of the material they are made of lights, and a camera to generate a synthetic rendering. On the other end, a computer vision workflow would start from an image and try to deduce its parameters.", "This can be thought of as an autoencoder where the vision system (encoder) would try to find parameters, while the graphics system (decoder) would then generate an image based on them and that can be compared with the original image. Moreover, this system does not require labeled data and trains in a self-supervised manner. Some uses of TensorFlow are:", "Further reading \u2014 here (It also contains links for Colab notebooks)", "This library can be used for other areas outside of computer vision as well. With the number of mobile devices and edge devices out there, there is a lot of data generated. Federated learning aims to perform machine learning on decentralized data, i.e. on the devices itself! This means that there is no need to upload huge amounts of (sensitive) data to servers. It is already being used with Google Keyboards.", "The video attached below explains everything about federated learning, from decentralized data to working with TensorFlow Federated.", "Refer to the article linked below for a guide on using TensorFlow Federated for image classification.", "Sensitive information can be extracted from trained ML models through privacy attacks. Truex et al. presented a paper concerning the factors that drive it. The models can even reconstruct the information it was trained on as shown in this paper.", "Again, like TensorFlow Federated, this is not exclusive to computer vision. The most common technique used is differential privacy. From Wikipedia:", "Differential privacy is a system for publicly sharing information about a dataset by describing the patterns of groups within the dataset while withholding information about individuals in the dataset.", "It is assumed that sensitive information is not repeated thoroughly across the dataset, and by using a differential privacy model it is ensured that the model does not learn such information. For example, suppose there is a dataset of chats between people. Now, the sensitive information passed on chat can be passwords, bank account details, etc. So, if a model is created on this dataset, differential privacy will ensure that the model cannot learn these details as they will be present in a scant quantity. Read this stellar article on differential privacy, and it also contains the code on performing it.", "Most of you must be knowing about this library, so I will keep its introduction very brief. TensorFlow Hub is a platform to publish, discover, and reuse parts of machine learning modules in TensorFlow. It won\u2019t be wrong to call it the GitHub of TensorFlow models. Developers can share their pre-trained models that can then be reused by others. By reusing, a developer can train a model using a smaller dataset, improve generalization, or simply speed up training. Let\u2019s have a swift look at some of the different computer vision models available.", "I have just described the tip of an iceberg. There are a lot more models available for topics like pose estimation, feature matching, super-resolution, etc. and I have not even discussed videos. Hop onto their page to find out more. You can also find tutorials on it here.", "TensorFlow offers many more libraries like TensorFlow Extended, a library used for deploying ML pipelines, Magenta, a library to generate music, etc. Check out the full list here.", "Your home for data science.
