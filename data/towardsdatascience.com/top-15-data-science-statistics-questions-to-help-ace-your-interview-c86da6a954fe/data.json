Millions of people including freshers and experienced professionals are trying to acquire the skills required in the data science industry. I have compiled a list of questions from data science and statistics that might help during an interview. Caveat \u2014 Neither it\u2019s an exhaustive list of questions nor does it apply for everyone but it will be relevant to 83% of the applicants.", "Generally all the data science projects have the same the workflowLoading \u2014 the given dataset is loaded on R, Python, SAS(or any other language) using the appropriate commands. Checking for raw data \u2014 The loaded dataset is checked for accuracy/consistency by using hashtotal calculation/mean/mode to make sure that the data has been loaded correctly. Cleaning \u2014 the dataset by imputation of missing values, outlier detection, etc. Preprocessing methods \u2014 such as checking correlation among the independent variables, handling categorical variables, creation of new synthetic variables, incorporating external data(if present). Premodeling steps- including dividing the data in train/test/validation split, creation of an accuracy metric, variable reduction techniques(principal component, stepwise regression, etc). Model Creation \u2014 Creating different statistical and data science models such as linear, logistic, randomforest, gbm, neural networks, etc and testing them across the accuracy. Deploying the models on the server.All along make sure to have a healthy discussion with the client/business teams so that all their expectations are met with the above models.", "Supervised models are those which are trained on labelled data i.e. we have one or more independent variables (x) and a dependent variable (y). The trained model so created will help in predicting dependent variable (y) based on unseen or future values of independent variables (x).Unsupervised models are those which are not trained on labelled data i.e. we just have one or more independent variables (x) but no dependent variable (y). In such methods, you allow the algorithms itself to discover hidden patterns in the data.", "It is a technique for determining the statistical relationship between two or more variables where a change in a dependent variable is associated with, and depends on, a change in one or more independent variables.Eg: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression", "Clustering is the task by which the computer algorithm segments the observations into different number of groups such that the observations in one group are more similar to each other than observations in other groupsEg: K-means, DBSCAN, LOCi", "Computer algorithms cannot compute and throw an error if there is missing values in the data. Some of the ways of imputations are: Continuous data\u200a\u2014\u200aReplace the missing values with mean Categorical data- Replace the missing values with mode Several other ways of imputation are\u200a\u2014\u200aforward imputation, linear regression, missforest technique from randomforest, MICE, etc.", "Outliers can come up because of several reasons \u2014 bad data, one-off cases, experimental errors, etc. Generally they are not important and can potentially decrease the accuracy of the model or give in-accurate results or both.But sometimes they can be extremely important and can be used to find anomalies. Especially helpful in fraud detection in credit card, insurance claim, etc.", "Correlation is a statistical measure which determines co-relationship or association of two variables.Correlation coefficient indicates the extent to which two variables move together.Regression describes how an independent variable is numerically related to the dependent variable. Regression indicates the impact of a unit change in the known independent variable (x) on the dependent variable (y)", "Categorical variables are those which can only take limited number of values. eg: variable like country will have a definite set of values such as India, United States, South Korea, Thailand, etc. Categorical variables can be of two typesOrdinal\u200a\u2014\u200aThe variables have values which are ordered in some form. Eg: Exam Grades which can have limited set of values like A, B, C, D, etc and can be ordered ie A>B>C>D.Nominal\u200a\u2014\u200aThe variables have values which are not ordered. Eg: Country example mentioned above.", "Categorical variable which are ordinal can generally be directly used in the modeling process but this isn\u2019t true for nominal variables. There are multiple ways of handling it but the easiest and the most common method is to create dummies or zero hot-encod the variable and use them as modeling variables", "Train-test helps the model not to generalise or overfit on the given data and help perform well in the real world scenario. Therefore the model is trained on train dataset and is used to score and check the accuracy on unseen test dataset.", "R-Square determines how much of the total variation in dependent variable (y) is explained by the variation in independent variable (x). (How well have you fitted the line or curve).Adjusted R-square is a modified version of R-squared that has been adjusted for the number of predictors in the model. If we add insignificant variables to the model, adjusted r-square will decrease. If we add significant variables, adjusted r-squares will increase", "Bias is the difference between the average prediction of the model and the correct value that we are trying to predict. Model with high bias pays very little attention to the training data and oversimplifies the model. It leads to high error on training and test data (Underfitting)Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalise on the data which it hasn\u2019t seen before. Such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data (Overfitting)", "A decision tree is a graph that uses a branching method to illustrate every possible outcome of a decision. The decision rules are generally in form of if-then-else statements. The deeper the tree, the more complex the rules and fitter the model", "Lasso & Ridge regression are different kind of regularization techniques which help in reducing overfitting. This is done by adding another element to minimize in the loss function which is called penalty function. In ridge regression(L2), the penalty is the sum of the squares of the coefficients. Therefore it helps in driving down the coefficient value for an unimportant variable. Whereas in Lasso(L1) regression, the penalty is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients. Therefore not only does it help in driving down the coefficient value but also in variable reduction.", "Both bagging and boosting are ensembling techniques built on decision trees but:Bagging: Model is trained on multiple subsets of data randomly selected from the training data. Finally average prediction(regression)/highest frequency(classification) of the different trees is taken. Might lead to high bias and low variance.Boosting: Model is trained step-by-step or sequentially. Early models are relatively simple whereas the followings models analyse the error from the previous model and try to fit the residuals. Might lead to low bias and high variance", "For classification models:Accuracy = TP+TN/TP+FP+FN+TNPrecision = TP/TP+FPRecall/Sensitivity = TP/TP+FNSpecificity = TN/TN+FPF1 Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)Gini = 2*AUC -1ROC Curve", "Your home for data science.
