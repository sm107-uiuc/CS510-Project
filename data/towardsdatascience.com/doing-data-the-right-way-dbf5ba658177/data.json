Newly-equipped with the ability to easily capture and store any information merely printed online, I was having fun scraping different websites just for the sake of it. Then, upon trying to scrape Reddit, I got this message:", "Web scraping albeit tedious is a powerful tool. Bigger websites like Reddit have measures like the above to stop us from getting too much information at once. And looking at the message above, we can still get this information, just not all at once. Web scraping is one of the first things we learn as Data Scientists, and within a month of my foray into the field of Data Science, I had the power to store pretty much any information written on any webpage online. And with great power comes great responsibility. Surely people out there could misuse their web scraping powers for evil.", "We live in the Age of Information where so much data exists and is continually being generated. Information is now an integral part of life and society, and with that comes the need to know how to manage it. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) actually published the Software Engineering Code of Ethics in 1999, outlining 8 principles software engineers should adhere to \u201cin accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public.\u201d The Code of Ethics offers a guide to the behavior and decision-making of software engineers, and it is (simply put) very utilitarian. For example, the very first principle states that \u201csoftware engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.\u201d The following principles also go along the lines of doing good and maximizing the amount of good that comes out of software.", "Data Science is a field even newer than Software Engineering. In 2018 we saw events such as the Cambridge Analytica/Facebook debacle and the EU implementing the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), both relating to Big Data and how to deal with the information we have online. Big Data is inevitably going to have a great impact on the world and our society, so it is important that we (we being Data Scientists) have some awareness regarding the ethical implications of whatever it is we\u2019re doing.", "A piece published on SiliconRepublic questions why Data Scientists don\u2019t get ethics training. The article starts off by asking a bunch of ethics-related questions such as: What can we sell? Are we allowed to get this information? \u201cAsk 20 data scientists these questions and you\u2019ll get 20 different answers.\u201d", "There has yet to be a societal consensus on what is right due to the infancy of the industry. Furthermore, in the Data Science process there are many phases where different questions of ethics will be addressed. I explore the ethics of Data Science in two broad areas: Data Collection and Validity. This isn\u2019t an answer key for what to do in any situation, but rather, an exploration into how ethics is applied to Data Science, and how we can practice Data Science the right way.", "Before getting into it, I\u2019d like to state that a lot of what\u2019s in this piece is based off online research. One of my main resources is the Data Science Ethics course on Coursera by Professor Jagadish at the University of Michigan.", "Given a Data Science task, the first general phase of the process is the collection and cleaning of data. Many points of ethical contention arise, like my encounter with web scraping. Here\u2019s a question to kickstart the ethics of data collection: If I take a photograph of you, does the photograph belong to me because I took it? Or since it has you as the subject, does the photograph belong to you?", "This basic example already brings up two major concepts that have been gaining traction in the field of Data Science Ethics: informed consent and data ownership.", "The notion of informed consent comes from the field of medical research, where patients have to know the full risks of a treatment before undergoing it. More relevantly, informed consent happens where subjects of a study have to know that they are being researched. This seems obvious, doesn\u2019t it? If you\u2019re taking part in some clinical trial, you\u2019d know that you\u2019re part of this trial and it would be completely unethical for researchers to drug random people to test the effectiveness of some treatment. Now apply this concept to Data Science. Many businesses make decisions based on A/B tests. A/B testing might not have the same impact on subjects as say, testing a cancer drug, but it\u2019s also a kind of experiment.", "Here are a couple real-life examples to consider. In 2014, it was revealed that Facebook was manipulating the newsfeeds of users in a study in conjunction with Cornell University and the University of California-San Fransisco on emotional contagion. They wanted to find out if users that saw more positive posts on their feeds would post more positively, and if users that saw more negative posts would post more negatively. They concluded that emotional contagion was evident, but most of the uproar came when the public found out that Facebook was not only manipulating the content they saw, but also using the information on their newsfeed and posts for the study. A quick Google search finds multiple articles bashing Facebook for abusing user data, especially because this experiment was manipulating users\u2019 emotions. However, Facebook claims that the use of data in their experiment is compliant with their Data Use Policy, which users had agreed and accepted prior to creating their Facebook accounts.", "In the same year, OkCupid came out to say that they too manipulated information presented to users in an experiment to see whether being told they were compatible would affect true compatibility. OkCupid basically told incompatible couples that they were compatible and vice versa, to see whether a reported compatibility score matters. I quote a New York Times article by Molly Wood regarding the experiment:", "OKCupid\u2019s user agreement says that when a person signs up for the site, personal data may be used in research and analysis.", "\u201cWe told users something that wasn\u2019t true. I\u2019m definitely not hiding from that fact,\u201d said Mr. Rudder, OKCupid\u2019s president. But he said the tests were done to determine how people can get the most from the site. \u201cPeople come to us because they want the website to work, and we want the website to work.\u201d", "Similar to the Facebook debacle, they claim informed consent because of the agreement users make when signing up for the service. How many of these agreements do we blindly agree to when signing up on different websites? Should this count as informed consent?", "Data ownership is somewhat related. In Data Science, the data belongs to whoever records it. Therefore, in the photograph example, convention would dictate that the photograph belongs to me. As Data Scientists, we usually obtain and manipulate existing data \u2014 we aren\u2019t the ones out there conducting surveys and putting out forms. The ownership of data now gets a little more complex. In intellectual property terms, we\u2019re dealing with derivatives of recorded data because have data from one place, curate and collect it, then clean and validate it for our studies. Because so much effort goes into this whole cleaning process, and technically because we are the recorders of this new data, does this cleaned dataset belong to us?", "The general consensus is that we have to get permission from whoever put the data out there before we can use it. But what if we\u2019re pulling information on say, product reviews? We would have to get the permission of every person who left a review. This is why online sites like Amazon or eBay have some sort of clause in their user agreements that say that whatever users post on their sites can be used by the company. So if we were Data Scientists for Amazon, we could ethically use their product review data. This is the area of Data Science ethics related to the GDPR \u2014 a measure to protect internet users\u2019 data from being processed by companies. To a lot of companies, data is an asset. Especially in the tech realm, data drives the decisions they make and generally, more data is better.", "The GDPR is one of the first major moves by a governing power to regulate the ownership and usage of user data, and it has impacted every company that has any online aspect in some way. It has also brought to light the many grey areas involved in the complex area of data ownership.", "Validity can be assessed at different points of the data science process. I grossly simplify the process and address three main points of contention: the validity of data, validity of processing, and validity of models. Ethically assessing the validity of processes in Data Science is where it gets subjective. Who\u2019s to say what\u2019s right and what\u2019s wrong? Sure there are ways that are better than others, but there\u2019s yet to be an industry standard on the right way to process data. There\u2019s no guide on how to make sure that data collected is sound to some standard.", "First, in my opinion, we as Data Scientists are responsible for verifying to the greatest of our abilities that the data we are working with is valid; or at the very least, we should contextualize the data and outline its limitations to the decision makers. Decision makers should be, to the greatest extent, aware of the circumstances surrounding the conclusions drawn from data and the models we create. Here are a couple questions I\u2019d consider when assessing the validity of data (definitely not an exhaustive list):", "There are so many ways we can process data. When we\u2019re dealing with NaN values in tables and dataframes there are so many different approaches we can take, that can yield different results. Whether to delete rows, replace null values with a mean or median or interpolate from neighboring data points, there are general best practices but no hard standard rule. What\u2019s best to do would also depend on the context of study. Since this is so subjective and requires so much context, the best I can do here is to recommend the utilitarian approach \u2014 choose whatever method you think makes the most sense; whatever method you think maximizes utility.", "Model validity is pretty similar to what we\u2019ve discussed. We just want to make sure we\u2019re doing the best we can to produce the best results for whatever situation we\u2019re in. On the technical level, we want to validate our model so that it best fits whatever scenario we have. That\u2019s why we have different evaluation systems and test scores \u2014 to see how well our model performs. It\u2019d be pretty unethical to propose an inaccurate model to make predictions or decisions, especially if it can be improved. The responsible thing to do as a data scientist, I believe, is to keep testing your model. Is it overfitting or underfitting data? Do the features engineered make sense? Is the model prone to changes?", "The Software Engineering Code of Ethics has three clauses I find relevant to this aspect of Data Science:", "Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.", "Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.", "Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.", "(from the IEEE\u2019s Software Engineering Code of Ethics)", "To end off, let\u2019s get deep. Imagine we\u2019re trying to train an AI to behave like a human. In supervised learning algorithms, the goal is to optimize some objective function. Now how would we define the objective function for a human? What kinds of morals would this AI have? Whoever is in charge of defining this objective function basically has the power to define, at least to this AI, the \u2018ideal human being\u2019.", "The Trolley Problem, with its variants, is one of the classic ethical thought experiments. With the advent of self-driving cars, this thought experiment now becomes a reality. If an autonomous vehicle is about to crash into some pedestrians, should the car swerve, potentially killing the driver? Or should the car spare the driver and kill the pedestrians?", "NPR\u2019s Laurel Wamsley wrote Should Self-Driving Cars Have Ethics? in October 2018. The piece looks at the results of Trolly Problem variants posed to people online. (You can see the problems posed here! \u2014 under the \u2018Judge\u2019 tab) The study found that people\u2019s answers would vary based on where they are from. So there is no consensus on what the right thing to do in each situation is. The authors of this Trolley Problem study write:", "\u201cBefore we allow our cars to make ethical decisions, we need to have a global conversation to express our preferences to the companies that will design moral algorithms, and to the policymakers that will regulate them.\u201d", "As Artificial Intelligence becomes a more and more significant part of society, rules will begin to form. We are so lucky to be able to witness the growth of the industry, and to potentially contribute to it as Data Scientists. I hope that as Data Scientists, we make sure that we are using our powers for good.", "tl;dr: Do the right thing, to the best of your ability.", "Thoughts?
