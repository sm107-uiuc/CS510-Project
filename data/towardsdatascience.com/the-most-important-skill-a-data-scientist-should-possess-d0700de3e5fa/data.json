Extracting, wrangling, cleansing, transforming, querying, analysing, modelling, visualising, deploying \u2014 all in a day\u2019s work. A \u201cFull Stack\u201d data scientist needs to be competent across myriad packages, frameworks and technologies, or at least have the ability to quickly up-skill where necessary. The diverse technical challenges are part of why we love the field so much.", "But despite our predispositions, there is one skill that we should all be working to perfect.", "The power of projecting one\u2019s personality into (and so fully comprehending) the object of contemplation.", "As a Data Scientist, your objects of contemplation could refer to your stakeholders, audience, end-users, or the people whose behaviour you are using data to understand or influence.", "Data Science is an exercise in translation. In goes a messy, ill-defined real-world, human problem. Out comes a solution to a hard-edged, clearly defined digital approximation of that problem. It\u2019s your job to make sure that that approximation maps well to the human problem, capturing its nuances and satisfying the requirements of stakeholders and users alike. For this you need to put yourself into many people\u2019s shoes, ask many questions and earnestly pursue an understanding of what makes people tick.", "Working in retail analytics, the question I disliked the most was \u201cCan you just give me some insights?\u201d. Completely open ended and vague, it invites you to jump down rabbit hole after rabbit hole in the search for something \u201cinteresting\u201d. As the deadline approaches, you hastily throw together a Powerpoint of a few loosely connected charts and \u201clearnings\u201d, before the grand reveal to a room of glazed eyes and not-so-subtly checked phones. The coup-de-grace being the dreaded question, \u201cThat\u2019s great, but so what?\u201d.", "For your work to be valued and to resonate with your audience, you have to understand their motivations and agendas. This means asking lots of stupid questions in building a genuine understanding of what they care about and what will give them the most value.", "Having learned my lesson many times over, I now appreciate that the most important part of a data science project is long before you begin tapping on the keyboard. Don\u2019t start with the data, start with the person. If you begin by focusing on the data, you risk only thinking about what you can do with it, rather than what will provide the most value. If you first concentrate on the person who asked for your help, you can more easily identify the questions and functionality that would be of most benefit, and can worry about finding the data you need later.", "Sometimes this forces you to sell a bit of your soul. In the murky politics of corporations, occasionally you\u2019ll have to work with people who aren\u2019t necessarily dedicated to the noble pursuit of knowledge. It\u2019s less a search for the truth, more a search for a truth we can work with. In this case, your client has a particular agenda, and needs data to help make a case for it. It\u2019s your job to understand the motivations of the client, plus their audience, and find an angle to put a positive spin on the data without compromising your integrity.", "Analysing data regarding people\u2019s behaviour requires empathy too. Raw numbers can give you the who, what, when, where, how about a person, but not the \u201cWhy?\u201d. To get to \u201cwhy\u201d they did what they did, you need to use your imagination to turn a row in a table into a living breathing human being.", "Pick a person in your dataset and then ask \u201cWho is this person, and why have they behaved in such a way?\u201d. Think carefully about what their lifestyle might be, what\u2019s on their mind and what decisions they are making to leave their \u201cfootprint\u201d in the data.", "For a supermarket example, you might ask:", "Combining this with qualitative research \u2014 surveys, focus groups, usage and attitude studies \u2014 helps flesh out the real people your data represents.", "At a shallow level, this thinking gives you names for your clusters and a few anecdotes to help liven up a presentation. At a deeper level, these questions lead to more thoughtful analysis, more accurate models and a more intuitive perspective on how the data reflects reality.", "In your career as a Data Scientist, you\u2019ll invest huge amounts of time and energy into learning technologies, that only a few years later will be obsolete. But long after PyTorch has been snuffed out and Pandas has gone extinct, the need to understand the wants and needs of other humans will continue. Until the robot apocalypse of course.", "The technologies we use are just tools, and the real challenge is always in applying those tools to achieve things other people care about. Those starting out in the workplace today will likely be working until half a century from now. They\u2019ll have to navigate countless changes in the way we work, which are unfathomable today. Just think how much has changed in the 50 years since 1970. But the need to empathise with your fellow humans holds strong as ever, and will continue to do so.", "Empathy is of course, also highly transferable, both to other careers and your personal life. Changing occupations runs smoother and with a higher chance of success if you work hard to decipher the inner thoughts of your new / prospective colleagues. And taking the time to think of the feelings of others makes you a better partner, friend, parent or workmate.", "Our industry is built on silicon chips, mathematics, and computer code. We revel in the pace of progress and the trials and opportunities that data science brings. But the true value of our work is the value that other people find in it. The technical challenges we overcome are worth nothing unless we help someone solve a problem, and make their day easier. By taking the time to understand other people, be they stakeholders, audience members or names in a database, your work will have the quality and impact your effort deserves.", "Your home for data science.
