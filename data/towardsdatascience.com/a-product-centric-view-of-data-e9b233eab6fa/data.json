However, this agility is born out of these company\u2019s missions to build products that customers find valuable. How the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and Expedia have continued to grow is a result of the use of data for internal optimisation, but future proofing themselves by building new data-intelligent products for the consumer.", "In the last two years, it has certainly been intriguing to leave my comfort zone of technology companies completely and work in a business where the vast majority of the products built that drive value for our customers usually take months, or in the case of launching new aircraft, years. However, just because a business that isn\u2019t digitally native is no reason not to instrument change by creating new data-driven products to pull a company (sometimes kicking and screaming) into the future. It may just be a little more work to implement, or just a little bit more politically difficult to navigate.", "So, you may first ask. My data is just fine, why would I want to change the way I use my data, or I\u2019m not sure what you\u2019re asking me to change today. What is a Product mindset and how does that differ from how we may work today? The way most portfolio management teams run data builds today is with a Project mindset. The Product mindset is usually seen as part of the domain of the Digital team. Yes, the \u201cDigital\u201d team\u2026 yes\u2026 the outcasts that are tucked away in an obscure corner of the business with those weird whiteboards, post-it notes (wars) and tattooed hipsters\u2026 or even worse yet, given a WeWork office space far away from the beating heart of the business because they can\u2019t integrate (I mean\u2026 have greater efficiency being located in an innovation hub in central London). I jest (but I\u2019m allowed). What I espouse here is not to debate the merits of either and which you should choose, but focusing on the merits of one, as a way to gain more value out of your data, and to possibly even create a data flywheel \u2014 a topic I will write about later.", "Not wanting to reinvent the wheel, I\u2019ve found this definition one of the most helpful to explain the differences.", "A product is anything that can be offered to a market to solve a problem, or to satisfy a want or need.", "Products have a life cycle that consists of multiple stages. First the product is conceived, then developed, then introduced and managed in the market, and finally the product is retired when the need for it diminishes.", "A project is a temporary endeavor that is undertaken to create a unique product or service. With a project, there is a clear definition of what needs to be delivered by a specified date in time.", "It\u2019s important to note that a product can only be developed within the context of a project, and multiple projects can occur within a product\u2019s life cycle.", "Unlike with a project, with a product there is no clear definition of what has to be delivered. Customer needs naturally evolve over time, and products must evolve to serve these customer needs.", "\u2014 Koombea \u201cThe Difference Between Product and Project Management\u201d", "Product: Value orientation Project: Task orientation", "Many data teams operate first and foremost with a project mindset. This stretches from how they may manage and govern data, report, and even conduct data science. A defined endpoint, a set delivery, numerical figures in tables as a report, and even an insight that may impact the business strategically once a quarter. I\u2019ve been in this world too many years of my career to know. Again, intrinsically there is nothing wrong with this way of thinking, and it suits many different types of data pursuits \u2014 system migrations, change requests to existing ERP systems or legacy 1970s data like TPFs (shudder).", "When approaching data with a product-centric view, the first major change to how you go about your day is \u2014 \u201cWhat will my customer benefit from today?\u201d rather than \u201cWhat are the CRs, tickets etc that need to be closed today?\u201d An admitted exaggeration, but I think you get the point.", "Admittedly, most data teams are abstracted from the true customer (and in our current case, passenger) this is much more difficult. Try telling someone that your data team needs D3/Node/React javascript developers to build interfaces into live systems today and watch the eyebrows raise (not only because most people won\u2019t even know what these things are let alone let a data (i.e. analytical team) loose on an operational system). Most traditionalists see data people as back-end folks and unsurprisingly so. Most of us tend to see our day jobs as guardians of the data.", "Instead start with the problem, and the value of solving the problem users have. \u201cI need to make it a whole lot simpler to do A, after I analyse B data and know that C is the action I need to take.\u201d Measuring the outcome of A is essentially the value that you are providing to the end user/customer.", "Most data teams I know stop there and go\u2026 \u201cWell, that\u2019s not my problem. I\u2019ll get you X data, and the BI team get produce Y report, and the Data Science team can get you Z insight.\u201d However, this mindset really only achieves, part B or at a pinch, B and C above, and doesn\u2019t end up truly solving the user problem which is A. Engineering a system integration to allow users to do this strictly isn\u2019t a data problem. That is a statement which may be true with a project/task orientation of data, less so with a value-orientation. If you truly want to prove the value of the analysis on a continous basis, conduct test-and-learn exercises to prove the value of your data, then yes, this is fundamentally a data problem.", "Data EngineeringAs you\u2019re now thinking about interfaces with other systems, interactions with users, and intelligent recommendations built by the data science team in POCs, you will start needing engineers with different skills. Good data engineers have different skills to those who can architect and build good APIs and those skillsets also differ to those who can construct good UI. As the user needs require, you should look at employing non-traditional skills into your data engineering function. In one of my previous jobs, we hired someone much more javascript/UI focused with a bit of data to complement our data engineering team. It resulted in such an amazing internal reporting portal, it then adopted it as the external facing one too.", "Ideally, your engineering function should also possess the right soft skills to join the Data Product team in holding ideation sessions with your business and analytical stakeholders. In addition to that, it also means your adopting a Continuous Integration pipeline that encourages quick iterations and automates and doesn\u2019t hold teams strictly to releases within a certain timeframe (say, a sprint).", "Data ProductIf you don\u2019t have a Data Product team, and it\u2019s mostly BI analysts interfacing with technology BI counterparts who build the data, you\u2019re missing out on a trick. The data product team\u2019s remit is not just to do what a business analyst would have done previously \u2014 i.e. take requirements, send back to delivery \u2014 they\u2019re job is to conjure solutions with the rest of the data and analytics function, but also with the business/consumers to understand what problems they have and how to solve it with a data-based/driven product.", "They are the glue to the entire data team and with your stakeholders by participating in the design phase of the solution that the end user/consumer needs. They evaluate and iterate based not only on the prioritisation of the rest of the data team, but the customer value of which each use case generates (hopefully garnered by soliciting feedback from their customers). Working to gel data science teams with consumer needs, bringing in other departments that either have existing interfaces with the consumer or building their own where those teams do not have the bandwidth or skillsets to do so, your data product folks are your collaborative strategists, those who should care the most deeply about deriving value from the data no matter how it makes its way to the consumer.", "Most data teams today lack a function like this. If they do, it\u2019s most often used as a means to provide data management, not product. Allow them to focus primarily on the solution that provides the best value (and work alongside engineering to build them), not just on what data is needed to provide analysis.", "Caution: If you do have a data product team, they\u2019re not just your note takers, and not just your lift-and-shifters, they should be technologists as well. Just because your Data Science team builds something in R/Shiny, doesn\u2019t mean the solution should just be to keep that up and running. It may be the easiest path to MVP, but not always the most impactful.", "Reporting/BI and AnalyticsLots of reporting and BI folks tend to be seen as system jocks, click here, code some SQL there, and voila, a table with what you need. I\u2019ve often seen reports that are so extensive and convoluted that end users cling onto just one number and monitor that number like a hawk, completely missing the bigger picture. I\u2019m very fortunate to have had very commercially analytically minded BI analysts, ones who don\u2019t just want to stop at a grid-based report, or just a pretty report.", "A value-oriented analyst always goes one step further \u2014 What would the user benefit from this? A couple questions they tend to ask a lot is \u2014 \u201cHow do I show what the drivers are of this metric changing?\u201d \u201cHow do I create the right suite of reports that link with each other to be used seamlessly?\u201d Oftentimes, existing reporting tools like Tableau/Qlik/PowerBI don\u2019t allow for such analytically insightful reporting. Being able to integrate analytical tools like R into these environments for visualisation might be the key to solving this problem, but it then means a change of the skillset of your traditional BI analysts or developers. One I\u2019m still trying to crack \u2014 but at least have a number of good analysts to try to do so.", "Data ScienceLastly, but surely not the least, the hottest job of the\u2026 I\u2019ll stop there. Apart from true AI/ML use cases, where you are building intelligent cars and robots, most end consumer products have their insightful POCs born out of data science teams and productionised in conjunction with the engineering function. Data science teams focused on tasks tend first to focus on model accuracy and spending every last waking moment tweaking the model to get the best explanatory value. Again, that\u2019s great, if they\u2019re one-off strategically aligned projects that need the most accurate answer, never to be used again. Value-oriented data science functions tend to focus on the impact or change to the customer and what\u2019s needed to hand-hold the customer through the change to improve likelihood of adoption, with initial sacrifice to the accuracy/complexity of the model, knowing they will be iterating it over time.", "Emily Glassberg Sands gives a great overview of how data science teams assist in building great data products. Her HBR article goes into the process of how to build them. However, she takes a view from a digitally native business, one that already has an overarching product function. For companies that do not have an overarching product function, the data science team is best suited to work in conjunction with data product teams and the business to bring the entire solution to bear.", "The CustomerLast but most certainly not least, the most integral part of the data team that builds great products is the customer. Now the customer here can come in internal and external forms, with the internal customer generally more forgiving of bugs/incorrect data. They determine the features and help us understand the value of our product. Without them, great products will not exist, data-powered or not. The data team needs to develop and build solutions that make life easier for them, which in turn increases the adoption and ability to generate monetary value from them.", "A product-centric mindset is a paradigm shift for most data teams today. It changes people from being task oriented and perhaps even simple outcome oriented to being value driven. It is just the beginning of the realisation that data is only the new oil if it is used to propel the right outcomes. Oil in its rawest form existed for millennia and did not have any intrinsic value until we found the right uses (products) that benefitted mankind. Data as a corollary is exactly the same. The only way we truly monetise or create value from our data is if our customers/end users benefit from the products we create with data. Only then does the data revolution truly take hold. Thus, taking a product-centric view of data is the next step in creating a sustainable data revolution one that benefits both end users and companies alike.", "Associate Director, BCG Platinion;
