Actually that\u2019s an understatement. It really amazed me that the AI algo found the solution I am going to describe before I thought of it (I am a senior machine learning engineer at Lore AI as well as a string theorist with expertise in quantum information and black holes so I don\u2019t know if the above is a praise for the AI or that I am just getting rusty. The reader can judge for herself.)", "OpenAI Gym provides several environments for people to train their reinforcement learning algorithms on and the cartpole is a very popular choice due to its simplicity.", "PROBLEM STATEMENT: As shown above there is a block on a frictionless surface with a rod attached to it which rotates on a frictionless hinge. The \u201cenvironment\u201d is thus characterized by 4 numbers: the horizontal position and velocity of the centre of mass and the angular position and velocity of the bar. The \u201caction\u201d taken by the agent can only be a left or a right push. The goal of the learning task is to keep the system running for 200 steps (there is a reward of +1 for each time step the system keeps running). Running itself is defined as the center of mass remaining within (-2.4,2.4) and the angle being between (-12,12) degrees.", "As one can see this is a very simple classical mechanics problem but ofcourse the model does not know anything about classical mechanics and has to learn to do the task. Several people have written about reinforcement learning in general and this problem in particular so I will not go into it more than saying I will use policy gradients.", "What I want to talk about is the physics of the problem and how the machine learns an interesting class of solutions.", "Think about what a solution should be. If you are not into physics a lot, you will think that the centre of mass should be stationary and the pole vertical. This is indeed a solution found by the AI algorithm and we can see a video of the solution", "as well as plots of the impulses, position and angular positions", "Now those of you who know physics a little bit will see that this is part of a family of solution where the centre of mass has uniform velocity \u2014 in this case zero velocity. The other solution are simply related to this one by a change of reference frame to another inertial frame. Just think of the same solution as above viewed from a car moving with constant velocity.", "For those of you who do not remember what an inertial frame is, it is defined in Newton\u2019s first law as a frame in which absence an external force, a body moves at a constant velocity.", "Such solutions can also be found by the AI algo but but that is not the point of this article.", "In this section I describe the interesting solution the AI found that surprised me but before I get there I need to give a physics primer for the reader to appreciate the solution the AI system found.", "Newton\u2019s first law defines inertial frames as frames where things maintain their velocity in the absence of forces. The other two laws tell us the laws of dynamics in such frames. But what about frame that do not obey the first law i.e. non-inertial frames? An accelerating car is an example of such frames where you \u201cfeel\u201d you are being accelerated despite no force acting on you. Physicists have found a way to simplify computations in non-inertial frames and to use the other two laws even in non-inertial frames by inventing the concept of pseudo-forces.", "Simply stated the idea is to pretend the non-inertial frame is inertial and that all objects in that frame are acted upon by a (pseudo-) force equal to mass times the negative of the acceleration (recall that acceleration is a vector so negative means the vector in the opposite direction).", "Pseudo force can be used to explain why a pendulum swings backwards when the car from whose ceiling it hangs accelerates forwards. There is a pseudo force acting on the pendulum backwards. Then the total \u201cforce\u201d acting on the pendulum is the sum of gravity downwards and pseudoforce backwards acting at an angle theta = arctan(a/g).", "One can even say that there is an \u201ceffective gravity\u201d acting in the above direction and with magnitude Sqrt(a\u00b2 +g\u00b2).", "In fact, Einstein\u2019s general relativity is based on precisely the idea that there is no local way to distinguish between real gravity and pseudoforce, something that goes by the name of equivalence principle.", "So what has all this got to do with reinforcement learning and our cartpole problem. Well what I saw was that the AI learned the solution in the non-inertial frame! That is it learned a solution where the pole remains tilted at an angle and the agent keeps pushing the system towards that direction to maintain a constant acceleration so that the rod doesn\u2019t fall further.", "The system learns to let the rod tilt to an angle and then accelerate it constantly (which is not as simple as just giving impulses in one direction which results in the rod falling over rather quickly).", "The acceleration may be a little hard to see in the above video but we can see that the centre of mass position follows a constant acceleration trajectory very closely (1/2 at\u00b2 where a is fit on the trajectory using MSE).", "The above is not straightforward to obtain using standard gym environment for the Cartpole problem. When I first saw the above solution I was amazed that the AI system learnt this but it was not this clean because the standard problem requires the pole to remain within 12 degrees tilt and withing 2.4 units of the center which is not compatible with constant acceleration for 200 steps. So I wrapped the standard environment with my own code and I also had to modify the render function so that the cart remains in the visible area for the duration of 200 steps. The code for all this is available in my github repo.", "Your home for data science.
