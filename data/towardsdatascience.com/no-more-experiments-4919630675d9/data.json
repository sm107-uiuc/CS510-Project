It\u2019s a remarkable book, one that exudes the intellect of its author, one that seems as an exemplar guide to deep and critical thinking, and one that \u2014 in the light of the world Hayek helped to build \u2014 is undoubtedly informative of the present.", "However, the world which Hayek built is changing, and with it cracks in the pillars of Hayekian liberty are beginning to show. Liberty, of course, is a funny and endlessly difficult thing. For example, (market) libertarians are amongst the first to protest any notion of reductions in their freedoms, but freedom seems to only exist within a nexus of capitalist realism. The American appropriation of the term liberal doesn\u2019t help this confusion, with terms like socially liberal and fiscally conservative saying more about our subservience to capitalism than they do about our views on liberty.", "Then there is the philosophical liberal debate, between those who believe we are born free and society emerges from the imposition of restraint (positive liberty) and those who believe we are born restrained, and it should be our endeavour to abolish all coercive focuses which remain unjustified (negative liberty). One might be inclined to ask themselves what type of liberal they are, but I think this question misses the point. Liberty, like many things, is not a series of absolutes, but a spectrum. At the very least, liberty is far too complicated to be understood using a political quadrant\u2026", "In the Constitution of Liberty, Hayek\u2019s explanation for what he thinks liberty is and when it can be constrained is very short, following quite closely to John Stuart Mill\u2019s thoughts in On Liberty and Mill\u2019s Harm Principle. This is not surprising given Hayek spent a period of his time curating Mill\u2019s writing.", "More interesting, then, is the discussion Hayek has throughout the rest of the book \u2014 a discussion surely informed by the geopolitical situation at the time \u2014 of why liberty (though not strictly liberal democracy) with the individual at the centre is superior to alternative, collectivised, systems. One of these arguments is what I would characterise as the, \u2018many experiments,\u2019 argument.", "A big part of liberal thought is the ability to make mistakes and to learn from them. This is why the Harm Principle only justifies coercion when protecting someone else\u2019s liberty; we have every right to make our own mistakes, and in doing so, we learn from them and develop. Mill thought this, and Hayek certainly agreed with it. Society progresses, Hayek argued, by people trying and occasionally succeeding (but frequently failing). Thus, allowing people the freedom to go their own way and experiment will produce more successes (and more failure) faster than under collectivisation, where a single actor \u2014 say the state \u2014 tries only one plan at a time.", "This is a very politically loaded idea, but within capitalism it is remarkably important. The best way is your own way.", "Can the, \u2018many experiments,\u2019 argument survive data, algorithms and the 21st century? Let\u2019s assume the argument is correct; then, do we need human liberty if we can simulate every outcome a trillion times? Wouldn\u2019t this be more ethical, because now people don\u2019t have to fail just so some can succeed? And isn\u2019t it more efficient, maximising the number of experiments we can perform in an ever-shorter period?", "Clearly, this is a contentious argument. Firstly, how accurately can be simulate the world? Financiers and academics with the aid of billions of dollars have tried for decades to model the stock market, and yet many of the animal spirits which pervade trading floors remain untamed.", "Secondly, accepting we could simulate the world, who \u2014 or from whose perspective \u2014 should we choose to build the simulation? Research into algorithmic bias already suggests negative racial bias in criminal justice algorithms, as well as facial recognition software. The causes of these biases appear to be different, but the effects are the same \u2014 a homogenisation of reality.", "Thirdly, what does society and progression even mean under the cosh of The Algorithm? This is what I would dub, \u2018the Matrix problem,\u2019 and is covered extensively in the literature on bullshit jobs. What if the algorithm\u2019s purpose is to serve human progress, but human progress exists within a society of service and hierarchy, can any outcomes be described as progress? Or, instead, must we label this world stationary? Oppressive? Hyperreal?", "The proliferation of big data makes the first argument a bold and likely incorrect one. The value of data is increasingly being realised, with the implications of data and algorithms on society \u2014 from YouTube radicalisation to Facebook election nudging \u2014 growing significantly. Yes, we may not have tamed the animal spirits yet, but as our data infrastructures expand the power and the intimacy of data, we may very well get there \u2014 such a concept I have called the datascape.", "The remaining arguments continue to present challenges to data\u2019s dominance, but only insofar as we continue to care about them. The tendency for criminal justice algorithms to discriminate against black men is because of long held law enforcement biases, while the efficiency of facial recognition software to identify white men is because predominantly white men write the programs. These are societal problems and serve as examples of how allowing a few perspectives (if not a few individuals) to create our data-driven future will render the project a deeply illiberal one.", "Though, there are some proposals for preventing this. Data economist Ernst Hafen has suggested all humans be given a, \u2018right to a copy:\u2019 the right to ask anyone who collects data on us to provide us with a copy. He suggests we could then collectivise these copies \u2014 a concept I have referred to as collective transparency \u2014 creating a central hub of data: a data common. This would provide algorithms with data relatively free of bias and reflective of society but would also democratise and demonetise data collection.", "Imagine if the value of Facebook was in providing a quality service, rather than because you and all your friends have already given them too much data for you to easily switch to a different company? Imagine if we decided that some data, for moral reasons, should not be used in algorithms, just as we morally object to a market for human organs?", "Perversely, such collectivisation of data may be the future of the liberal project; one that tackles data monopolies, expands data freedoms, and democratises data usage. All of this, while continuing to benefit from big data and algorithms. A world where, instead of no more experiments, we are empowered to experiment like never before.", "Your home for data science.
